## Chapter 1429 — People Grow Shrewd with Age

At the time Yang Kai still didn't quite understand why; now, seeing Shen Shitao and Lü Ying standing at his side, it all became clear in his heart.

It should be because Miss Shen and Miss Lü Ying had spoken up on his behalf.

The two women truly repaid kindness, and that middle-aged man from Qiantian Sect was also decent; otherwise, on that day at Dragon Lair Mountain he would not have secretly helped him. Even though it was only once, Yang Kai still remembered it.

After all, back then no one had faith in Dragon Lair Mountain; that he acted righteously to help counts him as someone who distinguishes gratitude from grievance.

"Miss Shen and Miss Lü Ying, come along as well," Yang Kai called over.

The two women's faces lit up and they nodded repeatedly, then followed closely behind Mo Yu as they swept over this way.

The cabin door of the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle had not been closed; after a moment Daiyuan and the three from Qiantian Sect had entered. Once they saw the situation inside, Mo Yu's expression stiffened; he hurriedly saluted Ye Xijun, and, imitating Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, sat up straight and composed himself.

Outside the war shuttle came Yang Kai’s final ultimatum. Moments later, he flashed and entered the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle. As soon as he did, that strange flying Secret Treasure gave a faint tremor, then slipped into the fiery barrier and vanished from sight.

Outside the Flowing Flame Sandland countless experts' faces were iron-gray; they glared at the sandland with hatred but were utterly helpless.

Seeing Yang Kai's arrogant demeanor a moment ago, many couldn't help but want to strike, but with figures like Mo Xiaosheng and Cheng Pengxuan holding back, they too could only stand down, missing the chance. The other side had already fled into the Flowing Flame Sandland and could not be pursued.

"Elder Mo, that brat is far too arrogant; are we to let this pass?" A burly man stepped forward, looking resentful toward Mo Xiaosheng.

This man was not completely unknown; his realm was respectable. A few years earlier he had just advanced to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and was the Sect Master of a second-tier sect.

Although a Sect Master-level figure, when facing the Great Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance his status was still a notch lower; after all, the Battle Sky Alliance was not something his sect could compare with.

"Sect Master Lan, what do you intend?" Mo Xiaosheng glanced at him coolly, expression neither pleased nor angry.

"I, Lan, cannot swallow this humiliation," Sect Master Lan said resentfully.

"If Sect Master Lan truly cannot bear it, try attacking the Flowing Flame Sandland — maybe you can break the flame barrier. If that happens, I will marshal the full strength of the Battle Sky Alliance to help Sect Master Lan take that brat's head!"

Hearing Mo Xiaosheng speak thus, Sect Master Lan was not pleased; his face changed and he hurriedly waved his hand, "Elder Mo, you jest. The Flowing Flame Sandland has long been a forbidden area of Dark Star; until it opens no one can enter. How could I possibly break the flame barrier?"

"If that is the case, then don't spout meaningless talk!" Mo Xiaosheng snorted.

Sect Master Lan had been rebuffed and looked extremely awkward; he could only retreat to one side, mood sullen.

"Brother Mo, it seems we must all feign compliance for now," Cheng Pengxuan frowned and sighed.

“Indeed, I, Mo, think the same. For now, the priority is to find a way into the Flowing Flame Sandland—otherwise, once the Imperial Garden opens, we’ll surely miss our chance. As for that so-called Lingxiao Sect… hmph, there’s plenty of time ahead. Letting him off for now means nothing; we’ll settle the score double in the days to come.”

"Brother Mo speaks reasonably. In that case, let's not stay here and risk angering him. If that brat really brings out that Void King-Grade warship and flies to my Leitai Sect..." Cheng Pengxuan shivered at the thought and hastily shouted orders to his disciples, leading a retreat.

Mo Xiaosheng made the same move.

Seeing the two great powers swallow their pride and withdraw, no other force dared remain; they called to their companions and disciples and withdrew en masse beyond a hundred li. Only then did the countless martial artists halt.

Meanwhile inside the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, Yang Yan stared at a translucent disc before her and smiled, "Sure enough, they've all withdrawn — already far beyond a hundred li."

"A wise choice," Yang Kai sneered, as if he had long expected this scene.

It wasn't that Yang Kai could foretell everything, but what Lingxiao Pavilion had displayed left them no choice.

Not to mention that the Lingxiao Sect, situated within the Flowing Flame Sandland, could rest easy without any fear of being attacked—and beyond that, the Sect itself could rely on its Void King-Grade warship as a deterrent.

This single fact meant that none dared lightly provoke them.

After all, once provoked one couldn't directly attack another's headquarters, and would instead live in constant fear of being harassed by a Void King-Grade warship — who would take such a losing bet? To take hits and be unable to retaliate is surely a path to certain defeat.

Moreover, a Void King-Grade warship is capable of long voyages.

With it, Dark Star could fully restore contact with the outside; if a peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior boarded it and left Dark Star, freed from the local suppression of the laws of heaven and earth and traveled to another star, they would have the chance to break through to the Void King Realm.

Mo Xiaosheng, Cheng Pengxuan, Old Woman Feng — which of them doesn't desire it? Which doesn't want to be a passenger on that Void King-Grade warship?

These people had been trapped at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm for countless years; their life wish was to break into the Void King Realm. Now that such an opportunity lay before them, of course they intended to seize it with both hands.

One could say that if not for the Dragon Lair Mountain conflict, they would now be trying to ingratiate themselves with Lingxiao Sect and with Yang Kai.

Unfortunately the Dragon Lair Mountain incident tore them apart from Lingxiao Sect, and these major powers are all prominent figures; it would be embarrassing to lower themselves now. If they did so they'd be made fools of later. Mo Xiaosheng, Cheng Pengxuan and the others could only take a middle course: first stabilize Lingxiao Sect, avoid offending this newly founded sect and Yang Kai's interests and nerves, and then make gradual plans.

If later there is a chance to reconcile grievances, all the better.

If reconciliation proves impossible, they will not idly watch Lingxiao Sect grow strong; they will surely find ways to uproot it.

The older, shrewder ones could analyze the stakes in a very short time; otherwise Yang Kai's single warning could not have driven them a hundred li away.

All reasons stemmed from Lingxiao Pavilion's present position and the existence of that Void King-Grade warship.

Yang Kai understood this in his gut, which was why he appeared so confident and overwhelmingly forceful.

Although the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle flew swiftly, the Flowing Flame Sandland was vast; it was a full half day before the shuttle reached the mountain gate of Lingxiao Sect.

When Yang Yan opened the hatch of the war shuttle and stepped out first alongside Ye Xijun, Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, Mo Yu, and the others hurriedly followed, each of them gulping down great breaths of fresh air.

Inside that warship earlier, the atmosphere had indeed been oppressively tense.

They were the top figures in their respective sects and renowned on Dark Star, yet faced with Ye Xijun they involuntarily felt inferior, daring not to act presumptuously and even speaking carefully.

Once out of the shuttle they felt somewhat better, but soon all of them were dumbstruck, eyes wide with astonishment and shock.

The majesty of the ten-thousand-step white jade steps and the dense Spiritual Qi here made them almost believe they were no longer on Dark Star.

"This..." Qian Tong opened his mouth but could not find words; he only managed a single syllable before trailing off.

"Sirs, this is the headquarters of Lingxiao Sect. What do you think?" Yang Kai stood to one side and smiled as he introduced it.

Qian Tong and the others glanced at him, seemingly at a loss for words. After a long while Qian Tong said, "Young one, there’s no need to show off before us. A place with Spiritual Qi this dense—this old man has never seen its like before.”

"Indeed, this could be said to be the best place to cultivate on Dark Star." Mo Yu nodded slowly, envy evident on his face. His Qiantian Sect's headquarters also sat in mountain ranges rich in Spiritual Qi, but compared to here it was far inferior; this was only outside the gate and yet far exceeded Qiantian Sect's training halls — if one entered inside, who could imagine the heights?

"This should be the ruins of an ancient sect, right? You didn't have the time to build such a vast foundation yourselves," Fei Zhi Tu said thoughtfully to Yang Kai.

"Lord Fei has keen eyes. Indeed, this is the remains of an ancient sect; we're merely nesting in their dwelling. Pardon our presumption," Yang Kai chuckled.

"Don't call it nesting in another's dwelling — it's simply that your luck is heaven-defying. Others would not be able to find the way in." Qian Tong shook his head with a wry smile; to this day he did not know why they had been able to pass through the flame barrier so easily.

Isn’t this place supposed to be a forbidden land? Wouldn’t anyone at the Origin Returning Realm die upon entering?

“What’s there to talk about out here? Save it for inside,” Ye Xijun said calmly, then led the way up the white jade steps together with Yang Yan.

She had spoken; none dared disobey and they hurried after her.

Along the way Qian Tong and the others secretly probed their surroundings, astonished at the richness of the Spiritual Qi, occasionally exchanging comments; the atmosphere turned cordial.

Yang Kai walked at the rear, accompanying Wei Guchang and the younger generation, chatting and laughing all the while.

Before long they finally set foot at the front hall of Lingxiao Sect. The palaces and the vast plazas once again left them in awe, and the dense Spiritual Qi made everyone involuntarily breathe deeper.

Each face displayed longing and envy.

Looking up, although the Flowing Flame Sandland was still wrapped in the flame barrier, directly above this front hall was a circular hole roughly a dozen li across, letting sunlight pour through and brightening the place.

From there they could also see the Imperial Garden floating above.

"This way, please!" Yang Kai said, guiding them to the Reception Hall.

This palace was Lingxiao Sect's place for receiving honored guests, and Qian Tong and the others were the sect's first guests, so Yang Kai naturally would not neglect their reception.
