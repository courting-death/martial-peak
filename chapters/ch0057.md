## Chapter 57 — One Side Big, One Side Small

“What are you talking about?” Hu Jiao’er’s face suddenly changed, forcing a smile. “I don’t understand.”

Could he really see through that she was no longer the younger sister? Impossible. He was clearly only at the Body Tempering Realm, Ninth Stage. How could he possibly see through the tricks of a True Yuan Realm expert like herself? Moreover, she and her younger sister looked almost identical—voice and appearance alike. Even the elders in their sect often confused the two. How could he possess such ability?

Yang Kai looked at her calmly, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Miss, by saying that, are you unwilling to admit it?”

“Admit what? I truly don’t know what you’re talking about.” Hu Jiao’er made one last effort to deny.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead helplessly. “Then I’ll make it clearer. Miss, you are not Hu Mei’er. I believe... you must be her twin elder sister.”

Hu Jiao’er was momentarily stunned, then chuckled softly. “Why do you say that?”

This time she no longer denied it outright but watched Yang Kai with keen interest. She wanted to know exactly where she had slipped up. If Yang Kai could not point out any concrete evidence, then he was clearly bluffing.

Perhaps he was only suspicious and dared not be certain, so he wanted her to admit it herself. Hu Jiao’er guessed inwardly.

“You’re testing my eyesight, aren’t you?” Yang Kai was not offended and chuckled, turning to the table to pick up the teacup he had been drinking from. Taking a sip, he said, “Actually, I was never sure if you were Hu Mei’er, but now I am certain—you are not her.”

Hu Jiao’er’s expression flickered, then she ground her teeth in fury. So his words were just a test! How infuriating! A True Yuan Realm warrior like herself had actually been fooled by a mere Body Tempering Realm youth. This was truly a humiliating defeat.

There was no point in denying anymore. Hu Jiao’er laughed coquettishly, turning to sit on the fragrant bed. Her alluring figure was faintly visible, and her beautiful eyes appraised Yang Kai as she softly asked, “When did you begin to suspect?”

“When we were drinking tea.” Yang Kai tapped the teacup in his hand. “Though the tea was fragrant, it could not mask the feminine scent on the cup. There was even a faint lipstick mark on the rim. I believe this cup was used not long ago, and that person was Miss Hu Mei’er.”

“You think I’m not Mei’er just because of that?” Hu Jiao’er was taken aback.

“Of course, that’s not the only reason.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “The second thing that raised my suspicion was your temperament. I don’t believe a woman’s temperament can change so drastically in just over ten days. To flatter you, Mei’er’s charm was somewhat immature, but yours is natural and effortless.”

“I like hearing that.” Hu Jiao’er covered her mouth with a light laugh. “Go on, is there more?”

“Third, the scent you and Mei’er carry is very similar, but if you pay close attention, there is a difference. Hers is sweet, while yours is more subtle and elegant.”

“You little brat!” Hu Jiao’er’s cheeks flushed pink. Yang Kai’s blunt words made her a little flustered. Thinking of the sacrifice she had made to test him, she wished she could slap this talkative man into a meat paste.

“Fourth...” Yang Kai ignored her murderous glare and continued.

“Wait, there’s more?” Hu Jiao’er was surprised. She never expected this Body Tempering Realm brat to spot so many flaws. She had thought her disguise was flawless.

“Heh, the fourth is the injury on your foot. It looks like a sprain but is actually an internal injury caused by your own cultivation. This is the biggest flaw. Though Mei’er is young, she is a warrior—how could she so easily injure her own foot?”

“That was my oversight.” Hu Jiao’er nodded lightly. At the time, she was only focused on trapping Yang Kai and hadn’t thought so deeply.

Looking up, she saw Yang Kai still deep in thought and said, “Don’t tell me you found more flaws.”

Hu Jiao’er was indignant. How could something she thought perfect be full of flaws in his eyes? And his analysis was so thorough there was no way to refute it.

This brat was truly annoying!

If he dared to mention any more flaws, she would make him regret it. She was no one’s fool.

“Then never mind.” Yang Kai frowned.

Hearing that, Hu Jiao’er was displeased. Her beautiful eyes frosted over, a faint smile playing on her lips as she bit her silver teeth. “Speak!”

“I still won’t.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Hu Jiao’er snapped angrily, “I tell you to speak, so speak! Why do you have to tease me like this?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly. “I’m afraid you’ll get angry if I say it.”

Hu Jiao’er narrowed her phoenix eyes. “Angry? Then it must be something bad?”

“Yes.”

“Then I definitely want to hear it.”

“But you have to promise not to get angry.”

“How can I promise if you don’t even tell me what it is?”

“Then forget it.”

“You... don’t you know that in disputes with women, it’s wise to yield a little?” Hu Jiao’er cursed inwardly. This brat looked clever but was actually a blockhead, utterly lacking in tact.

“If I yield, I’ll get hurt. I think... I can’t beat you.” Yang Kai’s face was serious.

“Good, you still have some sense!” Hu Jiao’er smiled proudly, a breeze swirling around her as she rose from the fragrant bed and walked to the table. Her clothes fluttered gracefully as she sat down, gazing at Yang Kai with all the charm of a temptress. After a moment’s thought, she said, “Fine, I promise not to get angry with you.”

“And promise not to hit me.”

“Deal!” Hu Jiao’er bit her lip. “Now tell me, what is this final flaw?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. “Actually, it’s not really a flaw. It’s just that you and Mei’er don’t look exactly the same.”

“How so?” Hu Jiao’er asked curiously. She and her younger sister were carved from the same mold. How could there be any difference?

Yang Kai hesitated for a long moment, then finally muttered, “Your buttocks—one side is bigger than the other. Not as symmetrical as Mei’er’s.”

The moment the words left his mouth, Hu Jiao’er’s face flushed crimson. Her True Yuan erupted fiercely, and a wild wind howled through the room.

“Remember your promise!” Yang Kai reminded her calmly.

Hu Jiao’er’s overwhelming aura suddenly shrank back. Trembling with anger but unable to lash out, she nearly bit through her silver teeth. After a long moment, she slammed the table and snapped, “Nonsense!”

For a young lady to curse so crudely showed just how furious Hu Jiao’er was.

That damned brat had the audacity to say her buttocks were uneven! Was that something a man should say? She was perfectly symmetrical!

You little brat, you probably don’t even know how to write the word ‘death’!
