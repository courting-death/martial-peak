## Chapter 942 — Demon Lord Changyuan

Before seeing this scene, he had assumed Xueli and Meng Ge, unwilling to be humiliated, had called other demon generals to back them up; but upon witnessing what was before him, Yang Kai immediately realized that this unassuming middle-aged man was not a demon general at all.

A silent cry rose from the depths of his heart, yet his expression forced itself calm as he stared intently at the middle-aged man, his eyes full of guarded apprehension.

The man wore a garish cloak and had an ordinary face, but his eyes were extraordinarily spirited, radiating a brilliance that made one afraid to look directly at them; his aura was vast and remote, unfathomable.

He cocked his head, scanned the crowd, and in an instant fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, offering a smile as warm as a spring breeze: "Saint Lord Yang?"

He had never met Yang Kai before, yet he had singled him out from among these thousands with a single glance—his sight was piercingly sharp.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and let out a low, sharp word: "Demon Lord?"

The middle-aged man raised his brows and burst into laughter, praising, "Saint Lord Yang, sharp eyes indeed—so quick to pierce my guise. Impressive, truly impressive!"

He had not expected Yang Kai to have such keen sight, nor that anyone knowing his true identity would remain so composed; those who recognized him tended to panic like facing a mortal enemy, or else immediately attack.

Yang Kai was different: though there was caution in his eyes, he did not lose his bearings and remained composed.

He struck him as genuinely admirable.

Yang Kai snorted softly. His recognition of the man’s identity had been inferred from Xueli and Meng Ge’s conduct. These two were demon generals of top caliber; for them to willingly yield a step and wear looks of reverence left only the current Demon Lord as the one who could command such deference.

Yang Kai had imagined countless times what the present Demon Lord might be like.

Perhaps broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, as strong as a bear.

Perhaps with a dark, ferocious visage—insidious and sly.

Or perhaps a debauched, rakish figure—carefree and unruly.

He had never imagined the Demon Lord would take such a form: utterly plain and ordinary to the extreme; were it not for that flashy cloak, he would not even have drawn the crowd’s attention.

Those who glanced his way cared only for his clothing, not the man himself.

This was the Demon Lord who had sealed Meng Wuya's strength? Yang Kai felt an unreal sort of disbelief.

"Saint Lord Yang, you need not doubt—indeed I am the current Demon Lord, Changyuan! Xueli and Meng Ge can vouch for me," the Demon Lord said serenely, smiling warmly.

"I do not doubt you," Yang Kai drew a breath. "I only cannot understand why you would leave the Demon Domain and travel so far here. There does not seem to be anything here worth your personal attention, does there?"

Sensing Yang Kai’s hostility and resistance, Changyuan rubbed his nose and laughed: "I told you—I came here to speak with Saint Lord Yang about certain matters."

"What could we possibly have to discuss?" Yang Kai frowned.

"There are things to discuss," Changyuan insisted, glancing around as he said, "This is not a place for conversation. Saint Lord Yang, could you arrange somewhere quieter?"

He finished with a smiling look at Yang Kai.

"Master!" Li Rong, who had stood behind Yang Kai the whole time, warned in a low voice, her eyes wary of Changyuan: "Be careful—he may have schemes."

"Don't agree to anything!" Han Fei interjected.

Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. "I'll speak with him. From his manner he doesn't seem to be here to make trouble; it seems he truly has something to say to me."

If he had come to pick a fight or to avenge Meng Ge and Xueli, someone with Changyuan’s power would not waste words; he would simply strike.

He might not be able to subdue Yang Kai, but if a top expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm fought here, those thousands gathered in Lingxiao Pavilion could suffer grievously.

That would be the most effective way to strike back at Yang Kai.

"Please, inside!" Yang Kai called, gesturing for them to talk within Lingxiao Pavilion, and led the way.

"Excuse the intrusion," Changyuan inclined his head slightly, and Xueli and Meng Ge followed behind Yang Kai.

Once the six of them had disappeared, the thousands present finally exhaled; the oppressive weight that had pressed on them moments before had almost made it hard to breathe.

"Who was that? He seemed very powerful."

"Senior Brother Yang called him the Demon Lord... what exactly is a Demon Lord?"

"Elder Shi Kun, what do you know about this?" Ling Taixu and Fourth Master Yang approached Shi Kun together, for they had little knowledge of the Tongxuan Continent.

Shi Kun’s face had turned pale; whispers brushed his ear and he chuckled bitterly: "Ignorance breeds boldness."

The Demon Lord… even he had never seen one before, yet people here were debating what a Demon Lord actually was...

He believed that if that title were spoken anywhere on the Tongxuan Continent it would cause a tremendous stir; here, it merely aroused curiosity.

"The Demon Lord can be said to be among the most powerful of the Tongxuan Continent’s top experts. How strong is he? Well, to put it simply—do you think I am powerful?"

Those gathered around Shi Kun all nodded vigorously.

The Saint Realm—half a year ago they barely knew what entering the Saint Realm meant, yet the Blood Servants of the Yang Family had personally experienced the gulf between the Saint and the Transcendent.

The Saint Realm was fearsome to them; such earthshaking means, they could not resist.

Shi Kun laughed bitterly: "In your eyes I am indeed formidable, but even a hundred of me against that Demon Lord would be doomed—he could crunch me to dust with a single finger."

The crowd turned ashen and finally grasped the Demon Lord’s terrifying prowess.

"Isn't Kai in danger then?" Dong Suzhu cried out.

Shi Kun scratched his head. "Not necessarily. This time the Demon Lord doesn't seem to be here to fight. Besides, the lady beside the Saint Lord, Li Rong, is no weakling; with her guarding him, the Demon Lord may not be able to harm the Saint Lord."

"You mean that lady's strength rivals the Demon Lord's?" The crowd was stunned, as if only now discovering Li Rong’s depth.

"I don't know either," Shi Kun shrugged, unable to give a definite answer; he could not fathom why the Demon Lord would come here and bluntly ask to discuss serious matters with the Saint Lord.

They had never met before—what could there be to talk about?

Inside a grand hall of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai and the Demon Lord took their seats; Li Rong and Han Fei stood behind Yang Kai, while Xueli and Meng Ge stood behind the Demon Lord, each side arrayed against the other.

The hall’s atmosphere was strange and heavy.

Yang Kai, filled with questions, said nothing and stared at the Demon Lord, unwilling to miss a single movement.

The Demon Lord, however, looked around the simple hall as if nothing had happened, repeatedly praising, “A blessed land, truly a blessed land! That such a place could give birth to someone like Saint Lord Yang—truly remarkable. I almost wish I had been born a thousand years later, so I could have been fellow sect brothers with Saint Lord Yang, drinking wine together and roaming the world!”

Everyone’s expressions in the hall grew odd; no one knew what Changyuan’s purpose was.

Such immediate flattery made people suspect ulterior motives.

"Demon Lord, get to the point—you're not welcome here," Yang Kai said in a low, impatient tone.

Having such an expert seated before him pressed heavily on Yang Kai.

He wasn’t worried about his own safety. Even if a fight really broke out and his strength was no match for the Demon Lord, he could simply tear space and escape, or better yet, ride the Flying Shuttle. At the speed of the Flying Shuttle, even the current Demon Lord would be left choking on his dust, with no hope of ever catching up.

He worried about the safety of the thousands gathered here—his disciples, his clan, his parents and siblings...

He had too many people to consider.

"Impudent!" Meng Ge barked, "Boy, don't take your luck for granted—Demon Lord's presence here is your honor!"

"He came uninvited—I'm the host here; am I not allowed to send him away?" Yang Kai sneered.

"Silence, Meng Ge!" Changyuan's voice rang once, and Meng Ge immediately lowered his head.

Although Meng Ge and the others were also Third Stage Saints, the Demon Lord's power far exceeded that of any demon general, which explained how he could secure his current position.

Changyuan glanced at Yang Kai and smiled: "Saint Lord Yang seems very wary of me. Fine, I won't waste your time—I'll be direct."

Smiling, he continued: "In truth, Saint Lord Yang needn't be so suspicious. Let me put it this way: the power you wield now is in no way inferior to mine. The lady beside you may not be weaker than me by much. I have four great demon generals under me, each a Third Stage Saint, yet your people are no slouches either. If the two of us truly clash, no one benefits. Don't you agree?"

Yang Kai frowned, his face stern, and remained silent.

He could not understand why the Demon Lord had emphasized the comparison between their forces.

It easily gave the impression that the Demon Lord did not wish Yang Kai to unleash a full-scale conflict. Since their strengths were comparable, neither side had an overwhelming advantage, and matters could be kept in balance.

Changyuan pondered briefly, then added: "I recently heard that two of my reckless subordinates offended Saint Lord Yang. This is my fault for not disciplining them. Come—both of you, pay your respects and apologize to Saint Lord Yang. Let us turn major matters into minor ones, and minor ones into none; no one needs to hold grudges going forward."

At this, Meng Ge and Xueli stared blankly, incredulous as they looked at Changyuan.

They had never expected him to say such a thing.

Even Yang Kai’s expression grew strange.

Even if Changyuan wished to make amends, this was over the top; and with his status, why would he stoop to flattering gestures?

The more Yang Kai thought it through, the more convinced he became that Changyuan had ulterior motives; a man of his caliber would never allow useful subordinates to be publicly humiliated for no reason.

Once that thought crossed his mind, Yang Kai relaxed, wearing a composed, leisurely smile as he regarded Changyuan.

He wanted to see exactly what the present Demon Lord intended, and what he sought from him.

As long as Yang Kai could anticipate all of his designs, the initiative would remain in his hands. Yang Kai’s heart settled.
