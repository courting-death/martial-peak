## Chapter 415 — Enough Talk or Get Lost

Before the Yang Family disciples returned to Zhongdu, there were three young figures who dominated the city's spotlight.

First was Liu Qingyao, second Qiu Yimeng, and third, Huo Xingchen.

However, the first two were renowned for their good reputation in Zhongdu, while the last was infamous. Everyone in Zhongdu knew that this sole heir of the Huo Family was a privileged playboy, bold and unrestrained. Whenever beautiful young maidens caught sight of him, they would quickly hide to avoid being abducted by him.

In every household with a young daughter in Zhongdu, there was a portrait of Huo Xingchen pinned up—a reminder to remember his face.

In a sense, Huo Xingchen's notoriety was even greater than that of Liu Qingyao and Qiu Yimeng. He was nicknamed the Zhongdu Wolf!

Wherever the Zhongdu Wolf, Huo Xingchen, went, the winds and clouds would change color and the earth would tremble. Children in Zhongdu would stop crying upon hearing the infamous name of the Zhongdu Wolf at night!

At this moment, the Zhongdu Wolf, young Master Huo, sat casually atop a Treading Cloud Steed, arms crossed over his chest. Upon seeing so many elders gathered, he showed no intention of dismounting to pay respects, causing the heads of other families to shake their heads in silent disapproval.

"Where were you last night?" Huo Zheng glared fiercely and demanded.

"Secluded in cultivation," Huo Xingchen said offhandedly.

Old Huo Zheng was instantly enraged, steam seemingly pouring from his ears. Stomping his foot, he shouted, "You bastard! Then what about the lipstick marks on your face?"

Suddenly, laughter erupted just outside the South Gate.

Huo Xingchen showed no embarrassment. Instead, he chuckled coldly and glanced around, causing the laughter to abruptly cease.

Though his debauched reputation was notorious, he was still a scion of the Eight Great Families! Such people were not to be laughed at lightly.

Moreover, as the sole heir of the Huo Family, he was even less to be trifled with. If the mocking continued, he might just remember their faces—and no one would know how they died afterward.

Huo Zheng shook his head in exasperation, his face filled with the look of a father disappointed in his son. He quietly rumbled, "You’re not messing around in the Spring Breeze Pleasure Pavilion, so what are you doing out here?"

Huo Xingchen laughed and replied, "Father, didn’t you say the Yang Family’s succession war was an unmissable opportunity? I thought long and hard, and concluded that for such a big matter, our Huo Family must join in. Otherwise, we’d be looked down upon as weak or absent."

Upon hearing this, Huo Zheng’s face lit up with joy, the previous displeasure and irritation tossed aside. He quickly asked, "You mean… you want to participate in the succession war?"

"I indeed do, so as not to disappoint your expectations, father," Huo Xingchen answered seriously.

Overjoyed, Huo Zheng slapped his thigh loudly. "Good, good! Finally, you’ve seen reason. It’s not too late. Get down, come on!"

As he spoke, Huo Zheng rushed forward like a servant, eagerly helping his son dismount from the Treading Cloud Steed.

Such doting behavior, he found no fault in at all. Instead, his face beamed with smiles.

For a long time, irrespective of how much Huo Zheng persuaded his son before, Huo Xingchen had been disinterested in involving himself in the succession war, preferring to drink and revel instead, which had left Huo Zheng dispirited and gloomy.

He never expected that on the day the succession war officially began, his son would come voluntarily and actively request participation. Naturally, he was ecstatic.

"Look!" Huo Zheng smiled, waving his hand and pointing to a group not far away. "These are the eight young masters of the old Yang Family! Son, choose one well. Once chosen, I will entrust the Xingmen to your management!"

"Really?" Huo Xingchen raised a brow, a sly grin crossing his face.

"Of course! I wouldn’t joke in front of your other elders," Huo Zheng said seriously.

"Then fine, I like it!" Huo Xingchen chuckled with a lecherous grin.

The dialogue between father and son was overheard by many Yang Family disciples, whose breaths subtly quickened.

Xingmen! The Huo Family’s unique force.

Composed entirely of women, each member was not only stunningly beautiful but also formidable in strength. More importantly, since they practiced light and swift cultivation methods and martial skills, they specialized in assassination and covert operations.

Controlling such a force would be a tremendous boon; if fallen to enemies, it would spell trouble.

Thus, the mention of Xingmen drew keen interest from both Huo Xingchen and the Yang disciples.

Huo Xingchen’s gaze casually swept across the Yang Family members. Except for Yang Wei’s cold expression, the rest smiled and cupped their fists, clearly trying to curry favor and eager to have him join their side.

Huo Zheng bore a smile as he awaited his son’s decision, curious to see whom he would select.

After a long moment, Huo Xingchen’s eyes settled on Yang Kai with a playful yet cold smile creeping to his lips. He nodded and said, "You it is!"

Yang Kai frowned and glanced at Huo Xingchen with a strange expression.

He did not expect Huo Xingchen to choose him. It was utterly illogical. They had history, and any reasonable person would choose someone else to suppress him as revenge. But this choice perplexed Yang Kai greatly.

"Who?" Huo Zheng also blinked in surprise.

"Young Master Kai!" Huo Xingchen answered with a smile.

The heads of the Seven Great Families furrowed their brows slightly, and Qiu Shoucheng looked particularly puzzled.

"Father, hand over Xingmen to me now," Huo Xingchen said excitedly. "Xingmen suits my name perfectly. It should be me managing it. You’re growing old; it’s time to let go, lest those beauties there guard an empty chamber all alone!"

Huo Zheng’s old face flushed red with anger. He opened his mouth several times as if to curse, but given the public setting, he could not bring himself to. After a while, he snarled, "Bastard! I don’t agree!"

Huo Xingchen looked surprised. He had not expected such broken promises from his father. He retorted, "Father, your words are like farting—first you want to give me Xingmen, now you go back on your word. Don’t you have any shame?"

Though the family heads had immense composure, even they struggled to hold back laughter at this scene, feigning deafness and muteness as they suppressed their amusement.

Huo Zheng flared with rage. "I said I’d give you Xingmen once you chose your ally properly. And whom do you pick of all people…" 

Yang Kai’s face darkened, and he sneered coldly.

Huo Zheng cleared his throat, unwilling to say more. He shook his head. "No means no. Choose again!"

"A man sticks to his word. This isn’t selecting a bride but an ally. How can you keep changing your mind?" Huo Xingchen gave a serious wave. "Don’t say a word, Father. I’ve made up my mind!"

"You... you’re going to be the death of me!" Huo Zheng staggered, his face reddish and his True Essence surging.

"Hey, Father, you’re letting your anger out—want to strike me?" Huo Xingchen teased cheekily, seemingly trying to drive his old man mad as he continued to provoke him.

Other family heads, having enjoyed the show enough, stepped forward to mediate.

Gaomo advised, “Old Huo, let it be. Kids have their own ideas. No need to interfere.”

Meng Xiping added, “Yeah, just a game. Nothing serious.”

Huo Zheng snorted. “Nothing serious? That’s our Huo Family’s power! Why don’t I see you treating your own family forces so lightly?”

The family heads chuckled lightly and fell silent.

"Master Huo Zheng!" Suddenly, Yang Yinghao appeared at the South Gate, having witnessed the entire farce. He said loudly, "The succession war is the Yang Family’s grand event to select the new leader and the stage of the younger generation. Your son’s choice is his own. You needn’t meddle."

Huo Zheng frowned at Yang Yinghao’s words.

Huo Xingchen laughed and bowed to the Yang Family head, "The Yang Family head is truly wise, unlike my father here—he’s already senile!"

"If you dare speak so recklessly again, I will beat you to death today!" Huo Zheng bellowed with fury.

"Enough, enough. An old man making a fool of himself, better go home and enjoy your retirement. The Huo Family still has me," Huo Xingchen said impatiently, waving his hand dismissively.

"You’ve got guts!" Huo Zheng gritted his teeth. "You can choose whomever you want—that’s your freedom, and I won’t stop you. But if you think you can take Xingmen away from me, you’re dreaming!"

With that, he stormed off in a huff.

Huo Xingchen was unbothered. He smiled slyly at Yang Kai and said, "Young Master Kai, looks like we’re going to share weal and woe from now on."

Yang Kai was speechless.

Outside the South Gate, the matter finally settled.

The eight young masters mounted their Treading Cloud Steeds and set off towards the war city in formation.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian glanced awkwardly at Yang Kai, nodded slightly, and followed behind Yang Kang, gradually fading into the distance.

Yang Kai observed everything and smiled broadly. He said to Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, "Let’s go."

"Yes!" they answered firmly.

Huo Xingchen galloped after them, looking Yang Kai up and down before glancing at Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu. He laughed heartily. "Interesting! One ally without any force to wield, two Blood Servants heavily wounded—there’s nothing optimistic about this situation."

"Enough talk or get lost!" Yang Kai shot him a cold glare.

Huo Xingchen was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected Yang Kai’s attitude to be so hostile. Rarely angered, he felt instead amused and said, "Your other brothers treat their allies with friendliness, but you dare treat me like this? Truly fascinating. I want to see how you survive tonight!"

"You’re hoping I lose, huh?" Yang Kai smiled thinly at him.

Huo Xingchen’s choice of him as an ally was a major surprise to Yang Kai. Until he understood his true intentions, Yang Kai would not consider him a support.

He would just treat him as a meddler.

"You think why I chose you?" Huo Xingchen chuckled. "I just want to see how you, a tiger without claws, will meet utter defeat in this succession war."

"Then I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed," Yang Kai smirked confidently.

Huo Xingchen sneered, "I won’t deny you’re powerful, but what good are you without allies?"

He pointed at Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu. "With just those two, what great feat could you accomplish? Are you as naive as my old man?"

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu exchanged expressionless looks and said solemnly, "Even if we die, we will not let anyone approach young master!"
