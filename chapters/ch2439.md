## Chapter 2439 — Also a Star Lord?

"Who stole from you? Clearly, you were the one overcome by lust, trying to tempt me with this Origin Power. When I refused, you flew into a rage and tried to force yourself on me. Luckily, I was prepared, or you would have succeeded." Yu Ying cried out in grievance, clutching her clothes as if she had been assaulted by Guan Qi.

Guan Qi glared at Yu Ying in disbelief. “Do you have no shame, woman?”

Yu Ying’s pretty face darkened, turning sinister as she snapped, “How dare you say I have no shame?”

Guan Qi retorted angrily, “I clearly found this Origin Power first! If you want to snatch it, fine, but why turn the tables and accuse me?”

The two suddenly erupted into a heated argument, each claiming to have discovered the Origin Power first and accusing the other of trying to steal it. With no evidence, neither could prove their story.

Yang Kai stood by with an indifferent expression, sneering inwardly.

If his guess was right, Guan Qi had indeed found the Origin Power first, and Yu Ying was here to snatch it.

The reason was simple. Guan Qi’s presence in the Shattered Star Sea meant his aptitude in Wenqing Sect was excellent—an elite disciple. As an elite, he must have cultivated the Supreme Sentiment Art.

Wenqing Sect’s technique cultivates through emotion. Though it makes elite disciples promiscuous, with countless wives and concubines, the Supreme Sentiment Art’s nature prevents them from forcing themselves on a woman. If they desire someone, they must stir both their own feelings and the other’s.

Yu Ying’s claim that Guan Qi was driven by lust was pure nonsense.

Yang Kai wouldn’t have known this if he hadn’t tangled with Wenqing Sect in the Northern Territory.

Still, neither of these two were any good—just a pair of dogs fighting, nothing more.

After another round of bickering, Yu Ying suddenly clung to Yang Kai’s arm, whining, “Senior Brother Feng, he bullied me! You have to stand up for me!”

Judging by her look, she truly wanted to use Yang Kai’s strength to intimidate others.

Yang Kai couldn’t keep watching the show and coldly snorted, staring at Guan Qi. “Boy, you’ve offended Junior Sister. This can’t be let go so easily.”

Guan Qi glared at Yang Kai, gritting his teeth. “What do you want? I’ve never wronged you, so don’t go too far.”

His unyielding attitude surprised Yang Kai. After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai sneered, “Good thing Junior Sister wasn’t hurt. Otherwise, I’d have taken your life!”

Guan Qi relaxed a little at those words. It seemed Yang Kai didn’t intend to make things too difficult, which puzzled him—he couldn’t figure out Yang Kai’s game.

In this cursed place, if a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm really wanted to kill him, he’d have no chance to resist. Dying here would be for nothing.

“Who says I’m not hurt? My heart aches terribly! If you don’t believe me, Senior Brother, feel for yourself.” Yu Ying cooed, pushing her chest toward Yang Kai, inviting him to touch her.

Yang Kai’s face darkened with embarrassment. “There are others here, you know…”

Yu Ying giggled. “Senior Brother Feng, you’re so funny.”

She thought Yang Kai was just shy about getting too close in front of others.

Yang Kai quickly changed the subject, glaring at Guan Qi. “Here’s the deal. Leave something behind, and I’ll let you go!”

“What!” Guan Qi’s face changed in shock. If Yang Kai’s demand wasn’t too much, he might agree, but if it was excessive, he’d rather fight to the death than give in.

“Leave your ring. Consider it compensation for Junior Sister.” Yang Kai said coldly.

Yu Ying had been unhappy about Yang Kai letting Guan Qi off, but hearing this, her mood instantly brightened, and she looked at Yang Kai with gratitude.

Guan Qi hesitated, realizing he was the fish on the chopping block and couldn’t resist. Reluctantly, he took off his Spatial Ring and tossed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, swept his Divine Sense inside, and, finding nothing of interest, handed it to Yu Ying.

“Can I leave now?” Guan Qi asked uneasily.

“Scram!” Yang Kai barked.

Guan Qi glared hatefully at Yang Kai and Yu Ying, as if etching their faces into his memory, then suddenly activated a secret technique and fled at top speed.

“Senior Brother Feng, now’s your chance! You can catch him off guard!” Yu Ying whispered in Yang Kai’s ear, quietly gathering her Origin Qi, ready to strike.

This woman is truly vicious! Yang Kai was secretly alarmed. Even now, she refused to let Guan Qi go, determined to take his life. If she were confident enough, she’d have already attacked.

To kill Guan Qi, she needed Yang Kai’s help.

But to her disappointment, Yang Kai never made a move, even after Guan Qi disappeared. She was a bit dissatisfied, her brows furrowing, thinking this Senior Brother Feng De was too soft-hearted.

Guan Qi bore a Star Seal on his hand. If she could kill him and take it, her own Star Seal would upgrade. Missing such a golden opportunity, the joy of getting his Spatial Ring faded quickly for Yu Ying.

“Wenqing Sect disciples aren’t easy to deal with. He might have a hidden trump card. If we push him too hard, we might not escape unscathed.” Yang Kai explained calmly.

In truth, he just didn’t want to be used by Yu Ying. If he’d met Guan Qi alone, things might have ended differently.

“True!” Yu Ying nodded in agreement, smiling. “Senior Brother Feng, you’re so thoughtful.”

After a pause, she added, “Senior Brother Feng, about this ring…”

Although Yang Kai had said the ring was compensation for her, since he’d taken it, she felt she should ask his opinion.

“Just keep it, Junior Sister. Consider it my gift to you.” Yang Kai smiled.

Yu Ying was overjoyed, quickly stowing the ring away. “Senior Brother Feng, you’re so kind.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “It’s just a small gesture, Junior Sister. No need to mention it.” Then, changing the subject, he added, “By the way, it’s been years since I last saw Senior Brother Yin. Why don’t we go look for him now?”

Deep down, he was eager to find Yin Lesheng and ask about Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts. If not for that, he wouldn’t bother pleasing Yu Ying or tolerating her temper.

“Finding Senior Brother Yin isn’t so easy. Our Netherworld Sect disciples practiced a secret art before coming in, so we can sense each other from afar. But in this vast Shattered Star Sea, we might not meet until it closes. Still, don’t worry, Senior Brother Feng. Even if you don’t find Senior Brother Yin here, just mention Junior Sister’s name when you visit Netherworld Sect, and I’ll personally welcome you.”

Yang Kai’s heart sank. If he couldn’t find Yin Lesheng, what was the point of staying with Yu Ying?

Yu Ying continued, “But it’s not impossible. We’re still on the outskirts of the Shattered Star Sea. Senior Brother Yin and the others will head deeper, so if we go further in, we might sense their location.”

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Yang Kai urged.

Yu Ying shot him a look. “Senior Brother Feng, you’re so impatient! Finding Senior Brother Yin is important, but we can’t miss out on the Origin Power here.”

Yang Kai slapped his forehead. “Right, I almost forgot. Thanks for reminding me, Junior Sister.”

Yu Ying giggled, “Senior Brother Feng, you’re adorable…”

Yang Kai said, “Let’s each find a spot and refine the Origin Power. Once we’re done, we’ll look for Senior Brother Yin.”

“Alright!”

The two immediately split up, each finding a safe place to sit and refine.

The Origin Power here was decent. For two ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators, it would take at least a month to absorb it all. If only one person, it’d take two months.

That’s also why each opening of the Shattered Star Sea lasts for such a long time—refining Origin Power is an extremely time-consuming process. If the event ended too quickly, most cultivators wouldn’t have enough time to gain any real benefits.

Yang Kai was anxious to find Yin Lesheng, so he activated the Star Refining Technique. Instantly, the Origin Power on the meteorite surged toward him, turning into starlight that merged into his body.

In just two days, the Origin Power on the meteorite was completely refined.

And that was with Yang Kai holding back. If he went all out, he could have absorbed it in less than half a day.

Yang Kai refined ninety-nine percent of the Origin Power, leaving Yu Ying with only a pitiful amount.

Two days later, the pair regrouped. Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai strangely. “Senior Brother Feng, why did the Origin Power here disappear so quickly?”

“I have no idea!” Yang Kai feigned ignorance. She hadn’t seen him use the Star Refining Technique, after all.

Yu Ying said, “Earlier, I could feel the Origin Power gathering toward you. You refined it much faster than me…” Suddenly, her face changed as she exclaimed, “Senior Brother Feng, could you be a Star Lord too?”

Yang Kai was taken aback, but nodded. “Yes, I’m also a Star Lord in the Great Wilderness Star Domain.”

Hearing this, Yu Ying covered her lips in excitement, gazing at Yang Kai as if he were a priceless treasure. She cried out, “Senior Brother Feng is actually a Star Lord too?”
