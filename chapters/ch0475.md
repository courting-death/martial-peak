## Chapter 475 — The Grand Gift

Leng Shan was after all a rising star of Ghost King Valley. Although her memory was not perfect, she was quite clear about who she had seen before.

Especially since this extraordinary Senior Di was so powerful—if she had met him before, how could she have forgotten?

Yet Leng Shan simply couldn’t recall.

Moreover, this familiarity was not from sight alone; it was a feeling.

If she probed deeper… the impression this Senior Di gave her was somewhat like that despicable Zi Mo from the Tianlang Kingdom!

She and Zi Mo shared a strange sense of kinship because Yang Kai had imprinted them in the soul, creating an inexplicable bond. Why then did this Senior Di give the same feeling?

He was so powerful; surely he hadn’t also been marked by Yang Kai’s imprint in the soul? Leng Shan silently shook her head, thinking her guess was baseless.

Senior Di chuckled: “I have seen you before, but you have never seen me.”

Leng Shan grew even more confused, but it was not suitable to ask further.

“Enough talk, we’ll talk while walking. The distance to War City is only eight hundred li; we should arrive before nightfall!” Senior Di waved his hand and led the way.

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect exchanged hesitant glances.

Wu Yan hesitated for a long moment before biting the bullet and saying, “Let’s follow.”

This man was too powerful. Regardless of why he had assisted out of nowhere, if he harbored ill intent, he could have exterminated them all instantly with the abilities he just displayed.

This was either a blessing or a curse, but luck could not be evaded. At this moment, it was better to yield to his will. The truth would reveal itself once they reached War City.

Over thirty people followed behind, each filled with apprehension.

After some distance, the middle-aged man suddenly turned back. He beckoned to Leng Shan, “Little girl, come here!”

Leng Shan responded and stepped forward. Shen Yi hastily warned in a low voice, “Junior Sister, be careful!”

“Mm.” Leng Shan showed no worry, calmly walking up to walk side by side with the man, respectfully asking, “What orders do you have, Senior?”

The middle-aged man glanced at her and said, “Relax.”

Leng Shan did not know what he intended, but suddenly he stretched out a large hand to grab at her. Instinctively, she tried to resist, but before she could condense any True Yuan, the man withdrew his hand.

A wailing, ghostly scream resounded. Leng Shan’s expression changed sharply as she looked on.

She saw that her Ghost King Seal had been extracted from her body. The illusory Yin soul was writhing and screaming in the man’s hand but could not escape.

The Ghost King Seal was a martial skill practiced by every disciple of Ghost King Valley, born from the Spirit bodies created in the Ghost Formation Grounds. The disciples subdued and refined these spirits into their bodies by a secret method. They fed on their essence, Qi, and spirit, growing in tandem with their masters.

In battle, the Ghost King Seal allowed disciples to launch unexpected two-against-one attacks.

Those cultivating to great depths could unleash the full power of the Ghost King Seal spirit.

However, Leng Shan and her young peers had yet to develop their Ghost King Seal to that degree, so it could not display its full might.

No one had ever forcibly extracted the Ghost King Seal spirit from a Ghost King Valley disciple’s body, but this Senior Di had done so.

Leng Shan hadn’t sensed a thing.

Just as she prepared to question him, the middle-aged man spat a plume of black mist, striking the Ghost King Seal spirit.

The thrashing spirit seemed to gain great nourishment, instantly calming down. It no longer struggled anxiously but instead accepted it willingly, showing a rare and profound joy on its twisted face.

Leng Shan stood stunned, biting back the words at her lips.

“I return it to you!” The middle-aged man smiled faintly and replaced the Ghost King Seal spirit back into Leng Shan’s body.

“Junior Sister!” Shen Yi, who had witnessed the entire event, immediately charged forward in indignation, glaring fiercely at the man to protect Leng Shan.

“Quite bold!” The man sneered coldly.

Leng Shan hurriedly explained, “I’m fine, Senior Brother, you’ve misunderstood. This senior helped me greatly just now!”

Her tone was excited, almost joyful.

“What do you mean?” Shen Yi was suspicious.

“My Ghost King Seal had fallen into a dormant state,” Leng Shan clarified.

“What?” Shen Yi’s eyes bulged.

The Ghost King Seal spirit evolved alongside its master. Like a snake shedding skin, each dormancy led to a great leap in power upon awakening.

Strictly speaking, Leng Shan’s Ghost King Seal spirit had evolved three times already, with the next evolution scheduled when she advanced to the Divine Roaming Realm. Then, the spirit’s strength would equal that of an ordinary expert at the Divine Roaming Realm.

But now, this evolution, normally years away, had been forcibly advanced.

Leng Shan felt this would be a transformative change—no ordinary dormancy evolution.

And all because Senior Di spat that black mist.

“Thank you, Senior.” Leng Shan was overwhelmed with gratitude.

“No need. Consider it a reward for your aid to Yang Kai. Cherish your spirit. When it awakens, it will develop sentience and become your most loyal companion,” Senior Di imparted seriously.

“Sentience…” Seven or eight Ghost King Valley disciples looked on with mouths agape, disbelief plain on their faces.

It was not empty talk; Ghost King Valley records told of this happening centuries ago to a predecessor who reached beyond Divine Roaming Realm.

Even the current Valley Lord Gui Li hadn’t seen his spirit develop sentience.

Everyone now realized what an extraordinary gift this was!

Leng Shan blushed deeply in excitement. Biting her lip, she asked softly, “Senior Di, what is your relationship with Yang Kai?”

The man cleared his throat awkwardly, almost slipping: “He is my young master!”

“So you’re from the Yang Family?” Leng Shan’s eyes brightened.

“Hmm, that’s uncertain,” he replied evasively.

“Senior, Senior...” Shen Yi approached obsequiously, scratching his head, “We’re here to help Yang Kai as well, just like Junior Sister. So…”

The man shot him a glance and coldly scoffed, “You think helping your spirit evolve is as simple as blowing out a breath? That costs me my cultivation.

Shen Yi’s face darkened, embarrassed but unwilling to give up.

Cultivating alone, his spirit would never evolve sentience, a legendary existence. Such a great opportunity deserved full embrace.

Yet the man’s words were a rebuff.

Suddenly, the man’s tone softened: “But today I’m in a good mood. Very well, I’ll help you youngsters.”

The turn of events triggered Shen Yi’s boundless excitement, expressing profuse thanks and waving others over.

Several Ghost King Valley disciples trotted delightedly forward, showering the man with flattering titles.

The man did not hesitate, extracting the Ghost King Seal spirits from each and breathing into them before returning them.

Before long, the process was complete.

The seven or eight disciples exchanged looks, detecting excitement and expectation in each other’s eyes. Earlier, the man had said nothing seemed to have changed, but now all felt certain that this evolution would bring a qualitative leap. Their futures filled with hope.

This was truly a great gain. They had not even reached War City or met Yang Kai, yet on the road they had encountered a powerful friend connected to Yang Kai who had bestowed such a grand gift. Once in War City, if they spent time with this senior, they could expect to be mentored and supported.

The opportunity and fortune of Ghost King Valley disciples stirred jealousy within Baoqi Sect members.

Tao Yang eagerly approached with a smile, “Senior, Senior, we’re here to help Yang Kai too. Might you…”

“What do you want?” The man smiled.

Tao Yang became serious: “Do you have a method to increase the purity of my True Yuan? Ideally raise it by one or two ranks!”

Refiners and alchemists both demanded high purity and cohesion of True Yuan. Tao Yang was a refiner, not from Ghost King Valley, so he sought improvement here.

The man sneered: “I can’t help with that. You must rely on your own efforts.”

“Ah…” Tao Yang was somewhat disappointed.

“However… I heard you’re from Baoqi Sect?”

“Yes.”

“In terms of refining, I can offer some guidance. Whether you can grasp it remains to be seen.”

Wu Yan snorted coldly, scornful.

Though the man was powerful and eccentric, no one surpassed Baoqi Sect in refining, not even Divine Roaming Realm elites.

Wu Yan thought he was merely showing off.

“Senior, you understand refining?” Tao Yang’s eyes brightened.

Senior Di nodded lightly, “A little, though not an expert. But enough to guide you.”

Tao Yang’s expression soon turned odd, unsure how to respond.

To think someone would dare show off refining before Baoqi Sect—how absurd!

The man was ruthless. If embarrassed, he might lash out violently. Tao Yang had no choice but to humbly accept, letting the man save face.
