## Chapter 1557 — Stellar Origin

Only after questioning Xia Ningshang carefully did Yang Kai learn that her obtaining that wisp of gray qi had been nothing more than a fortunate coincidence.

When Yang Kai had left the Tongxuan Continent back then, Xia Ningshang had been utterly lonely; to pass the time she could do nothing but remain at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, refining pills for others day after day.

She had been born with the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, and pill-refining itself was her cultivation.

As vast quantities of pills were produced, Xia Ningshang’s cultivation rose at a terrifying speed, as if no bottleneck existed at all.

In just a few years she entered the Saint Realm, catching up to the level Yang Kai had been at when he left.

Later, one day out of sheer boredom she secretly went traveling alone, and in an isolated underground cavern she found that wisp of gray qi.

From that moment on her cultivation became unstoppable: in ten years she swept through the Saint Realm Stage and advanced to the Saint King Realm, and after another over ten years she reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Yang Kai listened with his eyes wide.

Such terrifying speed of advancement— even disciples of the great Sects on the Dark Star would not necessarily achieve it.

Yet on this barren Tongxuan Continent, Little Senior Sister had accomplished just that.

Xia Ningshang’s achievements to date were indeed inseparable from that wisp of gray qi.

"After you obtained it, did you feel any discomfort?" Yang Kai asked seriously.

"Not much discomfort," Xia Ningshang thought carefully. "Sometimes I would suddenly feel a wave of fatigue, and at other times I’d become lazy, not even wanting to think, hehe—like I was getting old."

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"Junior Brother, could there be something wrong with it?" Xia Ningshang asked.

"I can’t be certain whether it’s a blessing or a curse," Yang Kai said, slowly shaking his head, worry evident.

"Then what exactly is it?"

"Not clear. But I have a guess. If that guess is true… then this is your opportunity, Little Senior Sister!" Yang Kai’s eyes burned as he looked at her, his expression a little excited.

That vague conjecture made his blood boil.

"By the way—do you remember where you obtained it?"

"Yes." Xia Ningshang nodded.

"Take me to see!" Yang Kai said, slipping an arm around Xia Ningshang’s slim waist, summoning the Star Shuttle, and transforming into a long rainbow that vanished from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Following Little Senior Sister’s directions, Yang Kai and she sped through the air. Their pace was tremendous.

In no more than a single day they reached the air above a mountain range stretching ten million li.

Xia Ningshang’s memory was excellent; even after more than twenty years she could still clearly recall the place where she had found that wisp of gray qi.

Soon the two arrived at a valley, and Yang Kai descended the Star Shuttle. The pair walked toward a particular spot.

Before long a deep, dark cave mouth came into view. Xia Ningshang pointed at it and said, "Junior Brother, I entered from here and went down to the lowest level, where I obtained that thing."

"Let’s go in and take a look." Yang Kai grinned; skilled people are bold. He showed no fear, took Xia Ningshang’s hand, and dove into the cave.

The cave was utterly dark. The air was clear—surprisingly not damp but extremely dry.

As soon as he entered the cave, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

He sensed a rich presence of Spiritual Qi within the cavern!

Of course, this richness was only relative to other places on the Tongxuan Continent; it could not compare to the Dark Star or the famed cultivation stars of the Star Domain.

Even so, it was extraordinary.

Moreover, the deeper they descended, the more abundant the Spiritual Qi became.

Yang Kai’s expression brightened; he suddenly realized his guess was likely correct—this abnormal Spiritual Qi was a telling sign.

This truly was Little Senior Sister’s opportunity! If that wisp of gray qi were handled properly it could bring unimaginable benefits, allowing her to transform, to emerge like a butterfly from its cocoon.

Hand in hand, the two pressed ever deeper.

Suddenly Yang Kai seemed to sense something and immediately halted.

At the same moment Little Senior Sister cried out in delight, "It’s here—I feel it! It’s coming!"

A strange energy was rapidly approaching from ahead. Yang Kai probed with his Divine Sense and discovered the fluctuations of that energy were exactly the same as those he had extracted from Little Senior Sister’s body a few days before.

The gray qi that had fled underground had indeed returned to its original place, and now that it felt Xia Ningshang’s presence it eagerly revealed itself.

In a moment it had arrived nearby.

It did not dare to pounce directly on Xia Ningshang, but stopped ten zhang in front of Yang Kai.

It felt threatened by Yang Kai!

Xia Ningshang looked to him, seeking his guidance.

"Take it in," Yang Kai said. "At the time I had no intention of frightening it off—I only wanted to see what it was." He stepped aside to give it room.

Xia Ningshang immediately summoned it with her mind. The gray qi, sensing her call, quivered, flashed past Yang Kai, and dove into Xia Ningshang’s body, disappearing.

Xia Ningshang’s delicate form trembled and she gave a soft cry.

Golden light suddenly bloomed from Yang Kai’s left eye; a narrow, majestic golden pupil appeared and fixed upon Xia Ningshang.

World-Ending Demon Eye!

Under his scrutiny, after Xia Ningshang received the gray qi a grayish aura invisible to the naked eye indeed spread about her body.

Such an aura is typically only found around the elderly who have not long to live; once it appears it signifies a short remaining lifespan.

For Little Senior Sister—still in the prime of her youth—to be shrouded by such an aura could only mean that wisp of gray qi was at work.

Yang Kai was not surprised; he had suspected as much and was not in a hurry. He beckoned to her, "Follow me!"

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly and trailed behind Yang Kai step by step.

They continued deeper. Time and distance blurred; Yang Kai only felt the surrounding Spiritual Qi grow ever more abundant, yet this richness brought him no comfort—rather, it carried the mournful chill of a last, dying glow.

When the Spiritual Qi was nearly comparable to that of the Dark Star, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang found themselves in a vast underground cavern.

From the deeper recesses ahead a faint light flickered, as though conveying some message, striking their Sea of Consciousness and calling them forward.

Hearing that summons, Xia Ningshang’s lovely eyes went blank and her body moved forward uncontrollably like a moth to a flame, resolute and unhesitating.

Yang Kai’s face darkened and he issued a low shout as his Divine Sense flooded into Xia Ningshang’s Sea of Consciousness like a rising tide.

Xia Ningshang’s body trembled and her complexion paled. When she came to, the blankness in her eyes vanished, replaced by boundless horror.

"Junior Brother, I…" Xia Ningshang was at a loss. Just now she had been controlled by some force and could not think for herself.

"Yes. Look over there!" Yang Kai said, pointing in a direction.

Xia Ningshang looked and her eyes trembled.

There, densely seated, were countless corpses. Each body was shriveled; some had long since crumbled to dust. From traces on some of the bones it was clear they had been instantaneously drained of their life essence and perished there.

Xia Ningshang edged closer to Yang Kai, seeking a measure of safety.

"If I'm not mistaken, these people are the same kind of existence as you."

"The same as me?" Xia Ningshang furrowed her brow. A moment’s thought and she understood: "You mean they also obtained that wisp of gray qi?"

"Probably so," Yang Kai chuckled softly.

"Then how did they…" Xia Ningshang felt a chill run through her. The terrifying scene replayed in her mind; if Yang Kai had not awakened her in time, her fate might have matched theirs.

"Because the gray qi’s true body, needing an energy replenishment, chose you to nurture it—so it could become stronger. The stronger you become, the more it benefits."

"Why would it do that?" Xia Ningshang asked, bewildered.

"Because it’s dying!" Yang Kai answered, then shrugged. "These are only my guesses—whether that is the case, we’ll know when we see for ourselves."

Saying that, Yang Kai took Xia Ningshang’s hand and stepped forward.

Bones crunched under their feet with each step, the sound chilling to the bone.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and looked toward the faint light ahead.

Not long after they arrived at the source of the light.

They stood at the edge of an underground abyss. The depths below were unknowable, but peering down they could see a mass of grayish light burning like a vast lamp.

The light was extremely dim and its color exactly matched the gray qi Xia Ningshang had obtained.

"So it is!" Yang Kai drew a deep breath. Seeing that huge, lamp-like gray glow, he immediately confirmed his earlier conjectures.

"Junior Brother, what exactly is this?" Xia Ningshang asked doubtfully, looking at the gray flame and vaguely feeling that the gray qi inside her was closely connected to it, seemingly separated from that flame—they were one and the same.

"Stellar Origin!" Yang Kai said in a low voice, his expression instantly fired with excitement.

"Stellar Origin?" Xia Ningshang was utterly baffled.

"The source power every cultivation star possesses. It is a star’s life manifested—it is the key to a star’s survival, like our heart!" Yang Kai patted his chest and explained. "Because of the Stellar Origin a star has vitality; without it the star becomes a Dead Star. There are countless such stars in the Star Domain—perhaps they once nurtured life, but as time passed and the Stellar Origin perished, that vitality ceased. When a person dies the lamp goes out; stars are the same. If this origin-lamp before us is extinguished, the Tongxuan Continent will be gone—turned into a Dead Star."
