## Chapter 205 — This Kid's Surname is Yang

Within the Lingxiao Pavilion, three major forces currently held sway: the Dong Family, the Bai Family, and the Ziwei Valley. Each of these factions was formidable and not to be trifled with, ranking just below the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, with deep foundations and countless experts. While these forces might intimidate others, they could not intimidate Yang Kai.

In recent days, Yang Kai had gathered a considerable amount of information from Xia Ningshang, and naturally, he had his own plans in mind.

As he walked through the Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai first stopped by the Contribution Hall to greet Meng Wuya.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Meng Wuya's old face immediately fell, as if Yang Kai owed him a fortune of silver.

Finally, the old man realized why his precious disciple had shaken off the gloom and melancholy of the past few days, now appearing joyful and elusive.

It turned out… this kid had returned. There was no need to say more; his precious disciple must have met with him beforehand, or else how could there be such a drastic change?

Sigh, it’s either a blessing or a curse, and one cannot avoid their fate. He just hoped his precious disciple could safely navigate through this tribulation.

“Shopkeeper Meng, I’m back!” Yang Kai greeted with a smile.

Meng Wuya chuckled dryly, “Ah, it’s good that you’re back, good that you’re back.”

His expression was perfunctory and casual, showing no signs of joy whatsoever.

As they spoke, Meng Wuya’s expression suddenly changed, his Divine Sense sweeping over Yang Kai, shock evident on his face. “You… you’ve advanced to the Separation and Union Realm?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Meng Wuya nearly bit his own tongue. How long had it been? It had only been half a year since Yang Kai left the Lingxiao Pavilion, and just six months ago, he had only been at the Qi Movement Realm. Now, he had reached the Separation and Union Realm. This speed of advancement was simply astonishing, beyond imagination.

“How did you manage that?” Meng Wuya stared at Yang Kai with wide eyes, as if he had discovered a treasure.

“I just practiced and it happened,” Yang Kai grinned.

Meng Wuya was speechless for a long time, thinking that if this kid continued to advance at such a speed, he might really be able to leave this small world and truly be worthy of being his precious disciple.

Furrowing his brow, Meng Wuya continued, “You’ve returned at a rather inopportune time. Many people are looking for you.”

“Looking for me for what?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

“To inquire about that martial technique,” Meng Wuya replied solemnly. “The one you used to severely injure that Sixth-Order Monster Beast in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. Many are quite interested in it.”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “If they want it, they should offer me a price that piques my interest. Selling it to them wouldn’t be a problem.”

The Star Mark technique was immensely powerful, but it was a one-time use. Gathering Yuan Qi was quite taxing, and if one’s physical strength wasn’t sufficient after using it, they would only suffer losses. If those people truly offered a price that intrigued Yang Kai, then they could sit down and negotiate.

“Just be careful, kid. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. The Bai Family and the Ziwei Valley don’t seem too concerned about you; most of their attention is on Su Yan. But that kid from the Dong Family seems quite interested, coming to me several times to inquire about you.”

“I’m quite interested in him as well,” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Where is he now?”

“He’s staying in the place you used to live. This kid is quite peculiar; the Bai Family and the Ziwei Valley people have been arranged to stay in comfortable accommodations, yet he insists on your little shabby house, as if he’s determined to have it. You should avoid the limelight for now,” Meng Wuya suggested, his eyes glinting. “Why not go hide for another year or so?”

By the time you return after a year or so, my precious disciple might have forgotten about you, Meng Wuya thought.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. If they weren’t coming to find him, he would go find them. Why hide from them?

After bidding farewell to Meng Wuya, Yang Kai headed towards his old shabby house.

“Yang Kai! It’s Yang Kai! He actually returned at this time!” Someone exclaimed upon seeing Yang Kai.

“The people from the three major forces are looking for him; isn’t he just walking into a trap?”

“Do you think he’ll be recruited by those three families?”

“Of course! Hasn’t there been a steady stream of recruits lately? Yang Kai has suffered quite a bit in the sect over the years and is just a Trial Disciple. Now that there’s a good opportunity, why would he stay in the sect? The conditions offered by those three families are quite tempting.”

“Another ungrateful white-eyed wolf,” a voice of disdain echoed, mixed with endless contempt, along with a hint of envy and jealousy.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, ignoring them.

Although he held the title of a Trial Disciple in the Lingxiao Pavilion, all of his abilities and strength were earned through his own efforts, without any support from the sect. He was free to leave, and even if he departed from the sect, he would have no psychological burden; why would he care about their opinions?

Before long, he arrived at the front of the small wooden house.

Outside the wooden house stood two elderly men, one standing with his hands hanging down, while the other was hunched over, clasping his hands within his sleeves. As Yang Kai approached, the two old men didn’t even glance at him, merely squinting their eyes, lazily basking in the sun.

When Yang Kai was about thirty zhang away from the wooden house, two Divine Senses suddenly surged towards him, devoid of killing intent, merely a warning.

Yang Kai’s body trembled slightly as the two Divine Senses entered his body, sinking like stones into the sea, causing no ripples. With the assistance of the Warm Spirit Lotus, such trivial warnings posed no threat to Yang Kai.

Continuing forward, his steps were steady and resolute.

Only then did the two drowsy old men suddenly open their eyes, their gazes sharp as they looked at Yang Kai in astonishment. Clearly, they hadn’t expected this young man to be so extraordinary.

Just as they were about to take action, a voice suddenly called out from within the wooden house, “Stop!”

Upon hearing this voice, the two elderly men’s imposing aura diminished, becoming harmless once more, but their vigilant eyes remained fixed on Yang Kai.

From within the wooden house stepped out a young man dressed in a blue long robe, around twenty years old, with sword-like brows and starry eyes, handsome and imposing, exuding an extraordinary aura, clearly a young master from a prominent family.

However, he was slightly plump, giving him a somewhat endearing appearance, with a fair complexion, even whiter than most women.

At this moment, the young man was looking at Yang Kai, their gazes meeting in mid-air. The former’s eyes held a trace of disdain, while the latter’s eyes reflected a hint of caution.

After a moment, the young man stepped forward, walking towards Yang Kai with increasing speed.

“Young Master!” One of the old men exclaimed upon witnessing this scene.

“Don’t interfere!” The young man snorted coldly.

“Yes!”

Yang Kai also moved towards him, and moments later, they collided, almost simultaneously launching their attacks. Their fists and palms clashed, and both figures swayed, retreating a few steps.

“Eh?” A flicker of surprise crossed the blue-robed young man’s eyes as he sneered. He attacked again.

Bang! Bang! Bang! It was as if both the young man and Yang Kai were filled with pent-up rage, desperately striking at each other without any defense, purely focused on offense.

Yang Kai kicked towards the young man’s groin, but the latter blocked it with his legs. The young man then extended two fingers, aiming for Yang Kai’s eyes, but Yang Kai tilted his head and narrowly avoided the attack.

The two’s moves were unpredictable, varied, and viciously ruthless, leaving the two elderly men watching with their eyelids twitching.

However, what struck both men as particularly strange was that neither the Lingxiao Pavilion disciple nor their own young master was using any Yuan Qi.

They were merely competing in their martial arts skills.

It appeared as though there was a deep-seated grudge between them, fighting fiercely, making the scene chaotic and intense.

What is the young master doing? This is not a sparring match; it’s clearly a street fight!

The two elderly men, who had lived for many years, felt their faces flush red. If this scene were to spread, how would their young master face the world again?

With a muffled sound, Yang Kai took a hit from the young man’s eye-poking strike, causing him to see stars and sway unsteadily.

With another crash, the Dong Family young master was punched in the face by Yang Kai, feeling as if his front teeth were about to be knocked out, a mouthful of blood filling his mouth.

“You little brat, you’re courting death!” The Dong Family young master roared.

Yang Kai sneered, “Let’s see who dies first.”

The two clashed again in a desperate struggle. In the chaos, the Dong Family young master managed to throw Yang Kai to the ground, pinning his legs down, with his knee pressed against Yang Kai’s abdomen and his hands gripping Yang Kai’s arms, coldly asking, “Stinky brat, do you submit?”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, using all his strength to roll over, capturing the young man instead, and viciously twisting one of his arms, grinning maliciously, “Do you submit?”

The Dong Family young master gasped in pain, one hand slapping the ground repeatedly, raising his head to the two elderly men, shouting, “What are you looking at? I’m being beaten!”

His face was covered in dirt, completely devoid of the previous elegance.

Only then did the two watching old men snap back to reality and hurriedly step forward.

Yang Kai smirked, his figure flashing as he retreated several zhang.

The two elderly men did not pursue. Although their young master had been beaten, they had observed for long enough to realize that this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple seemed to be an acquaintance of their young master, and naturally, he wouldn’t resort to killing blows.

However, how could their young master recognize someone from such a small place?

The Dong Family young master quickly got up, looking at Yang Kai with apprehension, one hand hanging limply at his side, gritting his teeth, “Stinky brat, you’ve grown stronger!”

Yang Kai was in a similar situation, his left arm dislocated and unable to exert any strength. Hearing this, he chuckled lightly, “Thirty years in the east river, thirty years in the west river. If you don’t call for help, I’ll make sure your mother won’t recognize you!”

The Dong Family young master took a deep breath, gritting his teeth, “I’ll settle the score with you later!”

He called to one of the old men, “Go help him reset his arm.”

“No need!” Yang Kai extended his right hand, lifting his left arm and pulling it, accompanied by a crack, his arm was restored to its original state.

The Dong Family young master stared in shock, gritting his teeth, he did the same, but it was so painful that cold sweat broke out on his forehead, yet he managed to reset his arm.

“The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians?” Yang Kai casually glanced at the two old men, asking nonchalantly.

The expressions of the two old men changed, shocked as they looked at Yang Kai, not expecting their identities to be revealed by this young man.

Who exactly is he?

The Dong Family young master sighed bitterly, “Don’t be shocked; this kid’s surname is Yang!”

Surname Yang! The expressions of the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians changed again, their hearts already guessing Yang Kai’s identity. They quickly clasped their fists from a distance, “We greet Young Master Yang!”
