## Chapter 1858 — Auction

Over the next few days everything remained calm.

Since that night when he had slipped into the Purple Star Palace and startled them, Yang Kai had not acted rashly again; he believed the Purple Star Palace must now be on exceptionally high alert, and even with Yang Kai's skills he could not be certain of entering unseen once more.

Hua Youmeng, using the connections at her disposal, quietly inquired about recent goings-on within Purple Star City and reported them back to Yang Kai.

Only then did Yang Kai learn that because Zi Long and Zi Donglai had been gone for so long, the Purple Star upper echelons had fractured into several factions, among which the group led by Second Young Master Zi Wuji and the faction under Great Elder Gongsun Liang were openly at odds, scheming against each other in secret.

Although these matters were suppressed by Purple Star's leadership, paper could not forever hide a fire — certain things inevitably leaked out, which was how Hua Youmeng had been able to learn them so easily.

Of course, the information she uncovered was all common knowledge; she was powerless when it came to the most secret intelligence.

That was enough — at the very least Yang Kai now knew that beneath Purple Star City's calm exterior something was hiding.

At present Yang Kai had only two concerns: to steal the Star Emperor Token, and to get Shen Tu and the others out and ready to leave; alas, there was no good opportunity, so he could do nothing but wait quietly.

Time passed, and the Tongtian Auction House's auction was held as scheduled.

With nothing better to do, Yang Kai accompanied Hua Youmeng to the auction — after all, the land deed the Commerce Guild was auctioning this time was of tremendous value, and without some experts on hand it was impossible to guarantee nobody would try anything underhanded.

Hua Youmeng was naturally delighted; she had been worrying how to persuade Yang Kai to come, and she had not expected him to volunteer to follow, which deepened her gratitude toward him.

On the day of the auction Hua Youmeng was dressed appropriately, wearing a form-fitting purple gown that lent her an air of nobility; she kept close behind Yang Kai, matching his steps and drawing many passersby’s gazes.

Presenting their invitations at the auction house, Tongtian Auction House staff escorted Yang Kai and Hua Youmeng into Room A-5, offering spirit-fruit tea before respectfully withdrawing.

Hua Youmeng stood shyly to one side; only after Yang Kai repeated himself several times did she reluctantly take a seat.

There was still some time before the auction began, and with nothing else to do Yang Kai looked around.

After a short while his brow tightened; a trace of suspicion showed on his face.

"My lord—what is it?" Hua Youmeng's attention had been fixed on Yang Kai; seeing his expression change she hurriedly asked.

"Is there anything unusually valuable at this auction?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"I do not know either…" Hua Youmeng answered with an awkward smile.

"Then it is nothing." Yang Kai gave a slight smile, withdrew his Divine Sense, and his brow creased.

He had just detected that there were quite a few Void King Realm experts within the auction hall!

This was peculiar — there were few things in the world that could attract Void King Realm experts, and even if such things existed they should not have appeared in the Tongtian Auction House.

Even a Void King Realm expert wouldn’t show up at an auction house like this for no reason. If not for accompanying Hua Youmeng, he would never have lowered himself to come here.

Yet now, besides himself, there were at least five other Void King Realm experts present.

Rooms A-1 through A-4 all had Void King Realm experts stationed in them; especially in A-1, where Yang Kai's Divine Sense had been slightly impeded when he swept it over — a clear sign of that person's great strength.

Moreover… that person's aura felt very familiar to Yang Kai.

The man in A-1 turned out to be Great Elder Gongsun Liang, the same Gongsun Liang who had fought him a few nights earlier!

That the auction could even draw Gongsun Liang proved that there must be truly valuable items on offer.

This realization piqued Yang Kai's interest in the auction.

Before long a striking figure appeared on the central platform of the auction — none other than Li Nuo.

She stepped out with a gentle, charming smile. Dressed in a sleeveless turquoise gown, her pale, slender arms were bare; the neckline dipped low, faintly revealing a trace of snowy white and the hint of a deep valley. Her legs were long and shapely, her feet clad in a pair of specially crafted jade shoes, her delicate toes exposed and stirring the imagination. The moment she appeared, she drew the crowd’s attention—countless greedy gazes from below fixed on her, brazenly sizing her up.

Li Nuo received them with grace and a smile. Parting her red lips she said, "Thank you all for attending today's auction; your presence flatters me and enhances Tongtian Auction House's prestige. I am Li Nuo, honored to preside over today's auction — I hope you will all favor us with your attention later."

As she spoke she offered a graceful bow.

"Enough idle talk — the auction will now officially begin. However… allow me to keep a little mystery: many extremely precious items will appear today; perhaps some of you will leave richly rewarded!" she said, glancing toward the A rooms; though she did not speak plainly, her meaning was obvious.

Yang Kai smiled to himself, thinking that Tongtian Auction House truly had the backing of the Hengluo Commerce Guild; otherwise it could not have mustered items capable of stirring Void King Realm experts.

"Now for the first lot!" Li Nuo called in a sweet command, gesturing to one side; a maidly girl stepped forward carrying a tray, smiling.

A red cloth covered the tray — the material of the cloth unknown, for it could block most martial Divine Sense probes, leaving everyone itching with curiosity as they craned to see.

Hua Youmeng's eyes shone with curiosity as she stared fixedly.

Though she had attended auctions before, this was the first time she had enjoyed the privilege of entering a private room; it was nothing like the crowded hall she had once squeezed through.

"It's only an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure and something you can’t make use of," Yang Kai said, seeing her interest and bluntly pointing it out.

Hua Youmeng was taken aback. "My lord, can you discern its true nature?"

Yang Kai chuckled. "That red cloth is woven from silk spun by the Tianxue Red Silkworm; it does little but block Divine Sense probes. It works against cultivators below Void King Realm, but it's no match for a Void King Realm."

Hua Youmeng lightly nodded, a look of longing on her face. She was now at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If given the chance she might try to break through to the Void King Realm, but the barrier was immense — despite years of effort she had yet to form a complete Shi field, let alone comprehend the mysteries of a Domain Field.

In this lifetime such a breakthrough seemed unlikely!

On stage Li Nuo smiled faintly, stepped forward, and pulled the red cloth off the tray, revealing the item beneath.

Indeed it was an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure: an exquisite dagger that radiated waves of cold.

Li Nuo picked up the dagger, formed a few hand seals, poured Saint Yuan into it, and the dagger hummed; its blade immediately surfaced with dense, grain-sized rune patterns.

The already strong chill grew even more intense.

Holding the dagger, Li Nuo made a casual motion and circulated her protective Saint Yuan; she smiled, "This Fen Yuan dagger is forged primarily from Deep-Sea Cold Iron, blended with Hanming Sand, Tiansha Earth, and teeth from a Ninth-Tier demonic beast called Heijing Mo, carefully refined by an Origin-Grade Upper-Level artificer. It is exceptionally cold and specializes in breaking through protective Saint Yuan — watch closely."

As she spoke she suddenly jabbed toward her arm.

The dagger's tip condensed a visible coldness and collided with Li Nuo's Saint Yuan; in an instant there was a tearing sound as her protective Saint Yuan was ripped apart.

Her control had been excellent — though the blade tore her protective Saint Yuan it did not harm her in the least.

She withdrew the dagger and smiled, "Although this Fen Yuan dagger is only an Origin-Grade Middle-Level item, with it in hand, even facing a Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator wouldn’t be a problem. Its value needs no further comment, and it is not difficult to refine; opening bid: one hundred fifty thousand Saint Crystals — place your bids!"

No sooner had she finished speaking than bidding voices rose in the hall; clearly many were interested in this Secret Treasure.

Hua Youmeng looked tempted; the dagger was compact and suited to a woman, but Yang Kai's words still rang in her ears, and she could not afford to offend him.

At that moment Yang Kai's voice floated over: "This dagger has a flaw; if I'm not mistaken it appears to be a failed piece."

"A failed piece?" Hua Youmeng was startled.

"Yes — you didn't notice. When Li Nuo tested the dagger's power she invoked a cold-attribute secret technique; to activate the dagger's power one must practice a cold-attribute cultivation method or secret art. I see no cold qi in your body, so even if you win this item it will be of little use to you."

"Is that so?" Hua Youmeng exclaimed, astonished. "If Li Nuo did that, isn't she deceiving others?"

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "Not quite — it's just that her words were not entirely accurate. Besides, if a cultivator who trains in cold-attribute methods obtains it, the dagger's power is indeed formidable."

"I understand," Hua Youmeng said, appearing enlightened.

Bidding continued unabated in the hall, and the opening price of one hundred fifty thousand was soon pushed up to two hundred eighty thousand.

The success of the first lot made Li Nuo beam with satisfaction.

An auction's prime goal was a strong opening; that spurred others to participate enthusiastically and drove prices skyward.

When the price rose to three hundred twenty thousand the bidders began to thin out; after all, the cost of an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure was roughly in that range, and any more would be excessive.

Not every cultivator had so many Saint Crystals; even those who occasionally earned a great deal still had to spend them on Spiritual Pills to train and increase strength — Secret Treasures were only auxiliary.

In the end the Fen Yuan dagger was bought by a male cultivator in the hall for three hundred fifty thousand.

The auction surged on with fiery momentum. With the first item serving as a strong opener, the crowd of cultivators was thoroughly roused. One treasure after another was brought forward, each price climbing steadily above its starting bid, and the hall buzzed with lively excitement.

Secret Treasures, Spiritual Pills, medicinal materials, ores, and even cultivation techniques and secret arts… the auction covered everything imaginable.
