## Chapter 1914 — Are You Sure You Want to See?

"More talk is useless! Light the furnace!" Zuo De ignored the entreaties of countless people and looked at Yang Kai with resolute eyes.

Ai Ou opened his mouth as if to say something, but when he met Zuo De's gaze he only sighed and fell silent.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and said calmly, "Very well, then, as Master wishes!"

As he spoke, he slapped the Purple Void Cauldron on the ground; in an instant the lid flew up, and at the same time a streak of light suddenly shot out, while an overwhelmingly rich medicinal scent instantly spread.

"What…" someone cried out, eyes fixed on the streak of light — who did not already know that Yang Kai's pill had long since been completed?

The reason there had been no scent from the start was entirely because the pill's properties were too restrained; only when the cauldron lid opened did the fragrance expected of a Spiritual Pill drift forth.

Lost!

Zuo De had lost!

Regardless of whether the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill Yang Kai had refined was of high or low quality, Zuo De had already lost, for he himself had said earlier that if Yang Kai could succeed in refining it, then he would concede defeat.

The ability to refine a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill proved that Yang Kai truly was a Void King-Grade alchemist!

Everyone involuntarily drew quick breaths, and their eyes toward Yang Kai shone with fanaticism and respect!

Such gazes should have been reserved for Zuo De alone — the kind of reverence any Void King‑Grade alchemist would command.

The moment the Spiritual Pill flew from the furnace, Zuo De staggered, staring at the streak of light in disbelief; his face suddenly looked many years older.

But he soon gritted his teeth and called in a low voice, "It's not over yet — whether this truly is a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill still needs verification!"

"Indeed, it's not over!" Yang Kai laughed heartily and flicked his fingers at his Purple Void Cauldron once more.

No one understood why he did this, but in the next moment an unbelievable thing occurred: immediately following the first streak of light, another streak shot out from the Purple Void Cauldron, and an even richer medicinal scent assailed everyone's nostrils.

"Two…"

"How is that possible?"

"Did he refine two Taichu Soul-Returning Pills at once?"

"Am I dreaming?"

"Did Chairman Ai Ou give him two sets of materials? No — even with two sets, it's impossible to successfully refine both at once; what on earth is happening?"

The alchemists felt as if the long-ingrained truths in their minds had been overturned; every pair of eyes stared at the two streaks of light, stupidly watching.

Yang Kai produced a jade vial he had prepared long ago; with a wave of his hand the two streaks seemed bound by some force and obediently dropped into the vial, from which a tinkling sound came.

"Did I see correctly — just now weren't there two Spiritual Pills that flew out of that furnace?"

"I thought I had misseen it as well — what on earth does this mean?"

For quite a while, even in the murmuring of the Ninth-level Medicine Master Hall, no one dared come forward to request to inspect the Spiritual Pill, for fear that what they saw would overturn their understanding.

"Master, would you like to verify the pill?" Yang Kai asked, holding the jade vial and looking at Zuo De.

Zuo De's face had withered; he said nothing, his gaze complex as he looked at Yang Kai.

The other alchemists said nothing either.

"I'll do it." Ai Ou said in a deep voice, stepped forward, and took the jade vial from Yang Kai's hand.

"Then thank you, Chairman Ai Ou." Yang Kai smiled indifferently.

Ai Ou nodded, opened the jade vial, and before the watching crowd poured out a single Spiritual Pill.

The Spiritual Pill was plump and round, its color clear and translucent; its scent calmed and purified the mind — if it wasn't a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, then what was?

However, this Taichu Soul-Returning Pill Yang Kai had refined differed slightly from Zuo De's and even from what the pill recipe recorded: the surface of the Spiritual Pill was surrounded by a faint golden haze, and beneath that glow the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill appeared resplendently noble, and everyone felt a surging vitality emanating from it.

Even those who did not understand alchemy would know at a glance this was certainly a Spiritual Pill that could heal and save lives!

The alchemists were stunned and could not fathom why, using the same materials, Yang Kai's pill differed from the pill recipe's record.

None of them noticed that during the refining process Yang Kai had dripped a single drop of his own pure Golden Blood into the cauldron!

Only when a pill has a spirit can it be called a Spiritual Pill — this was the last line recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Yang Kai realized from this that to refine a Spiritual Pill one must have a Pill Guide!

A Demonic Beast's Inner Core can serve as a Pill Guide, and one's own pure Golden Blood can also serve as a Pill Guide — in fact it was even better than a Demonic Beast's Inner Core, for his pure Golden Blood contained unimaginable qi and blood power and vitality.

Under normal circumstances, Yang Kai would not expend his Golden Blood to refine a Spiritual Pill; Golden Blood was immeasurably precious, worth more than a Spiritual Pill itself.

However, this time, since it was to save Xue Yue's foster mother, Yang Kai did not hold back.

Precisely because Golden Blood had acted as the Pill Guide, a faint golden mist arose around this Spiritual Pill.

"Everyone, feel free to inspect it — confirm whether this is truly a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!" Ai Ou said as he handed the Spiritual Pill to the crowd of alchemists.

The alchemists did not refuse; one took it and others gathered around. After observation and analysis they ultimately confirmed beyond doubt that it was indeed a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, and its efficacy seemed two degrees stronger than the record.

This made their gazes toward Yang Kai even more solemn and respectful.

They instinctively felt Yang Kai had altered the prescription of the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, hence achieving this result!

To refine a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill one must be a Void King-Grade alchemist, and to alter such a Spiritual Pill's prescription one must at least be a Void King-Grade Middle-Level, or even an Upper-Level, alchemist to have that qualification!

Every prescription was a heritage of tens of thousands of years, refined through countless eras and perfected by countless geniuses — how difficult it was to change one, and how much harder to improve it.

Yet today, they beheld it with their own eyes in Yang Kai.

They immediately understood Yang Kai must be a Void King-Grade Middle-Level or Upper-Level alchemist!

At that thought, every alchemist shuddered, for they had just realized this man not only possessed the formidable cultivation of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, but also alchemical attainments surpassing everyone else's.

Could he be some ancient monster who had lived for tens of thousands of years and disguised himself? Otherwise, given how he appeared, how could he achieve such a level?

"Master, do you wish to inspect?" Ai Ou looked toward the wan-faced Zuo De and asked.

Ai Ou had disliked Zuo De's earlier behavior and attitude, but seeing the famed Star Domain alchemy master in such a state made him feel some pity; after all the man was still a Void King-Grade alchemist, and if he truly collapsed now it would be a loss for the entire Star Domain.

Zuo De slowly shook his head.

"Very well. Then the result of this contest…" Ai Ou was about to announce the result when the alchemists suddenly became agitated.

Someone shouted, "Chairman, there's another Spiritual Pill — show it to us."

"Yes, what about that second Spiritual Pill? Let us see!"

Everyone had seen two Spiritual Pills fly from the furnace; no one understood the situation, and the alchemists' curiosity would not let Ai Ou dismiss it so casually.

Ai Ou could not help but sigh and cast a complicated look at Yang Kai.

When he opened the jade vial he had already sneakily looked at the second Spiritual Pill; when he saw it clearly he had nearly thrown the vial in fright, so now the many alchemists' requests put him in a difficult position.

"Are you… sure you all want to look?" Ai Ou asked, seeing Yang Kai show no objection.

"Of course we do; Chairman, stop hiding it."

"Fine! Suit yourselves." Saying so, Ai Ou tossed the jade vial forward.

A middle-aged alchemist acted quickly and caught the vial; when he peered inside he stiffened as if struck by thunder, trembling violently with his eyes glaring wide as if he had seen something unbelievable.

"Brother Zhao, Brother Zhao, what is it? Tell us!" someone urged when they saw his ghostly expression.

The middle-aged man gave no response.

"Damn it, I'll look myself!" another alchemist swore, snatched the vial, and the next moment his throat made hoarse, meaningless sounds; like the previous man, he froze, eyes bulging.

The jade vial passed from one alchemist to another, and every one who saw the pill inside was shocked to their core.

To those ignorant of the truth it might even appear the vial contained a Poison Pill — the potent toxicity seemed to have poisoned all the alchemists.

Zuo De's expression flickered as he took in the scene; he had a vague suspicion, but the thought that surfaced in his mind was something he simply could not bring himself to believe.

He staggered forward, no longer maintaining any masterly dignity, snatched the jade vial from a frozen alchemist's hand, and poured the Spiritual Pill into his palm.

A faint golden mist wrapped the Spiritual Pill; it remained plump and round with translucent color, but this pill showed a glaringly obvious difference from the first.

There were distinct, orderly patterns on the pill's surface, like the meridians in a warrior's body, distributed across the entire surface of the Spiritual Pill.

If those patterns were spread out, they would surely form a profound and intricate diagram suffused with the ultimate truths of heaven and earth.

"Pill Patterns!" Zuo De cried out in alarm, his aging frame trembling like a willow in the wind.

He had seen Spiritual Pills with Pill Patterns before — after all, he was a Void King-Grade alchemist who had refined pills for thousands of years and produced countless medicines; occasionally by luck a pill born with Pill Patterns would appear.

There had even been low-grade pills that birthed Pill Clouds.

Pills born with Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds were the pride of Zuo De's life and the honor of his career as an alchemist.

However… a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill bearing Pill Patterns — this was the first time he had seen such a thing.
