## Chapter 450 — Teaching the True Alchemy Formula

The flickering light cast dancing shadows as Xia Ningshang sat on Yang Kai’s lap, embraced in his arms. Her expression was timid, stealing glances at her junior brother before quickly looking away.

Her delicate earlobes flushed a deep red, exuding a tender charm.

Yang Kai smiled warmly at her, his gaze filled with affection so intense it seemed to melt her completely.

Silence spoke louder than words.

This simple contact had already released the pent-up yearning they harbored for each other all this time, leaving only sweetness and happiness behind.

For the first time, Xia Ningshang felt this sense of fulfillment. Though Yang Kai had always looked at her with tenderness, never had he been as direct and unguarded as he was now.

He still cares for me...

The young girl thought quietly, a smile blossoming on her delicate face as she nestled closer into Yang Kai’s embrace.

Suddenly, an invisible Divine Sense enveloped them, carrying a message straight to Yang Kai’s mind.

“You brat, I’m right next door. Don’t push me or I’ll come over and wipe you out this instant!”

Receiving this message, Yang Kai chuckled softly, condensing his Divine Sense into a thread and sending it back to the room next door. “Shopkeeper Meng, spying on your own apprentice is very inappropriate. Have some decency!”

As this message arrived, Yang Kai could distinctly feel Meng Wuya’s Divine Sense tremble abruptly, as if startled. After a moment’s pause, a strange cry came from the adjoining room.

“What happened to Master?” Xia Ningshang hurriedly looked up.

“Nothing, probably just a nightmare.”

She smiled faintly, clearly aware that Yang Kai was speaking nonsense.

With Yang Kai’s teasing, Meng Wuya had no choice but to stop hiding behind his cloak of secrecy. From next door, he muttered, “When you’re free, come find me. There’s something I want to ask you.”

“Sure, I also have something to consult with you,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Meng Wuya gradually withdrew his Divine Sense, no longer spying or monitoring.

Inside the room, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang exchanged smiles, feeling much more at ease. Though they knew Meng Wuya meant well, being watched by such a formidable master’s Divine Sense was always a bit constraining.

Holding his little senior sister tenderly, Yang Kai refrained from any rash moves, simply savoring the warmth of the moment.

Xia Ningshang’s body was soft, seemingly boneless, and carried a naturally alluring fragrance, fresh and pure.

“Little Senior Sister has quite the talent; already at the first stage of Divine Roaming,” Yang Kai praised involuntarily. When she left Hidden Cloud Peak last time, she was barely at the seventh stage of the True Essence Realm, but now she had advanced to Divine Roaming. This cultivation speed even outmatched his own.

“It’s all thanks to you, junior brother. What exactly did you leave me? Since taking a drop daily, my cultivation speed has improved greatly. Lately, I’ve been discussing alchemy with Master and also studying the spirit formation you had brought over. I haven’t spent much time actually cultivating."

Yang Kai revealed a trace of astonishment.

To have improved this far without much cultivation, what might she achieve with more effort?

This little senior sister truly possessed a rare and innate advantage.

“That is the Wan Yao Ling Ye, a medicinal elixir that cleanses one’s meridians,” Xia Ningshang nodded. “I still have some left. I take only one drop each day and gave some to Master, but it seems to have little effect on his injury.”

“Shopkeeper Meng is injured?” Yang Kai was startled. “How did that happen?”

Tilting her head slightly, Xia Ningshang’s brows furrowed gently. “I don’t know the details. Master never told me clearly. All I do know is he is wounded and needs me to cultivate diligently so I can aid his recovery.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew complex.

A formidable figure like Meng Wuya, whom he had seen personally as stronger than most Divine Roaming Realm elites, was injured? Possibly only someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm could inflict such harm.

Judging by his appearance, there were no visible signs of injury—perhaps an old wound?

Yet if it was an old wound, the Wan Yao Ling Milk should have some effect. Yang Kai made a mental note to inquire with Meng Wuya when he had the opportunity.

Though Shopkeeper Meng didn’t particularly approve of Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang being together, it was out of his deep concern as a mentor. At Lingxiao Pavilion, he had also taken good care of Yang Kai, a fact Yang Kai remembered well.

“Junior Brother, do you have any news of Su Yan?” Xia Ningshang asked suddenly.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened a little as he shook his head slowly. “I have sent people to inquire, but there’s been no word. I don’t know where she or those people from Lingxiao Pavilion have gone.”

“Don’t worry. She will be safe,” Xia Ningshang said softly, reaching out boldly to stroke Yang Kai’s hair in comfort. “If she knew you were here, she would definitely come looking for you.”

“Let’s hope so,” Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming his restless thoughts before changing the subject. “Senior Sister, what exactly was that technique you used during the day? It drove off so many Divine Roaming Realm experts in a single move.”

Xia Ningshang smiled coyly, flicking her fingers to evoke the star ring from earlier, which again shimmered with radiant light. “This is the Star-Hiding Ring, given to me by Master after I reached Divine Roaming. He said it’s a Middle-Level Mystery-Grade treasure. It stores three of Master’s own martial skills. I only need to channel a bit of True Essence and Divine Sense to activate them.”

Yang Kai was moved, a look of understanding dawning on his face.

He had always wondered how Xia Ningshang, despite her special constitution and Divine Roaming Realm cultivation, could unleash such tremendous power from a single secret technique, even one from a Mystery-Grade treasure.

Ultimately, the strength of a treasure depends on the martial artist's ability to activate it.

Now her explanation made perfect sense.

It was truly a technique thrown out by Meng Wuya at full force, which no ordinary Divine Roaming Realm expert at the seventh or eighth stage could withstand.

“Shopkeeper Meng is truly profound,” Yang Kai smirked, considering whether he should try obtaining some Mystery-Grade treasures from Meng Wuya.

But knowing Meng Wuya’s stingy nature, this would be difficult. His precious treasures were reserved only for Xia Ningshang; others, even Yang Kai himself, could hardly get a favor.

“Let’s put that aside,” Yang Kai regained focus, speaking seriously. “Senior Sister, since you have come, there will be much to do. You will be in charge of alchemy. I need to raise everyone’s strength as quickly as possible.”

“I like alchemy,” Xia Ningshang’s eyes curved like crescent moons, “To me, refining pills is cultivating, plus it lets me help you.”

“Helping me is one thing, don’t overwork yourself. Otherwise, Shopkeeper Meng won’t let it go easily,” Yang Kai smiled, then lowered his voice. “Senior Sister, open your Sea of Consciousness.”

“Hm?” Xia Ningshang looked puzzled, unsure why he said this.

“There’s something about alchemy I need to pass on to you.”

Her eyes brightened immediately. “Is it related to the two spirit formations?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Xia Ningshang instantly lowered her defenses within her Sea of Consciousness. The next moment, an immense and terrifying Divine Sense flooded in, invading her inner world.

This Divine Sense was vast and aggressive, like an invincible dagger with a cold, sinister aura. Fortunately, it did not attack her directly, but still startled Xia Ningshang.

Within her Sea of Consciousness, her Divine Sense formed a shadowy shape, testing, “Junior Brother?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai’s own shadow appeared, nodding.

“How…” she stared, incredulous at the figure that radiated far greater Divine Sense power than her own. She could not fathom how Yang Kai, barely at the eighth stage of True Essence Realm, could wield such overwhelming Divine Sense.

“I can’t fully explain it. But it’s not a bad thing,” Yang Kai grinned, looking around. Xia Ningshang’s Sea of Consciousness matched her personality perfectly—calm and clear.

Beneath them spread an endless sea formed by interwoven Divine Sense threads. Every Divine Roaming Realm martial artist cultivated such a vast Divine Sense Sea, expanding as their power grew.

He had seen Shan Qingluo’s Sea of Consciousness before, which was marked by a seductive and enchanting aura. Compared to that, Xia Ningshang’s Sea of Consciousness radiated serene purity.

It seemed her inner world could cleanse the heart of evil and agitation.

Above this sea, the two Divine Sense shadows faced each other.

“I’m not very adept at using Divine Sense yet. I’ll just impart what I know; you just have to remember it. Ask me if anything is unclear,” Yang Kai instructed.

Regarding Divine Sense usage, Yang Kai only possessed a single soul technique. Had he mastered it fully, he could have wrapped the knowledge in a sphere of Divine Sense to transmit it all at once to Xia Ningshang, avoiding such tedious teaching.

Xia Ningshang nodded gently.

What Yang Kai was about to reveal was the True Alchemy Formula.

He had only glimpsed a small portion of it, but that portion encompassed wondrous spirit formations and the hard-won experience of many alchemy masters.

To ordinary people, these insights were worthless. Even typical alchemists found these matters too profound and arcane. But to an alchemist of Xia Ningshang’s caliber, it was a priceless treasure.

With this knowledge, Yang Kai believed that his little senior sister’s alchemy would become far more efficient, perhaps even reaching miraculous levels.

Time passed, the sun concealed and the moon rose. Inside the Sea of Consciousness, the two shadows remained still, one speaking, the other listening, with utmost earnestness.

Xia Ningshang’s comprehension was extraordinary. Some parts Yang Kai barely understood himself grew clear after her interpretations; both of them benefited greatly.

Gradually, their exchange shifted from simple instruction to mutual discussion, each sharing their thoughts, slowly mastering the True Alchemy Formula, bit by bit, thread by thread.
