## Chapter 1763 — Illusory Void Butterfly

Just as Yang Kai and Xue Yue were preparing to slip away quietly, Kong Fa, who flew over from that side, unexpectedly called out loudly, "Is that Senior Ni from the Hengluo Commerce Guild up ahead?"

He had obviously recognized Ni Guang, yet he showed no sign of avoidance; on the contrary, he advanced straight toward him and even greeted him proactively. The scene was unusual, for whether it was Kong Fa or Xu Wei, both bore extremely ignoble backgrounds and had stained hands with the blood of many Hengluo Commerce Guild cultivators. Normally, if they ran into Ni Guang they would flee for their lives—how could they willingly walk into his net?

Ni Guang was momentarily stunned, his brow tightening as he wondered whether the other party harbored some scheme; at the same time he subtly signaled Luo Lan to be careful, snorted coldly and said, "Indeed, it is I — Ni."

Kong Fa was overjoyed and immediately cried out, "Wonderful! Please, Senior Ni, save my life—this Kong will surely reward you richly in the future!"

"Save your life?" Ni Guang was taken aback; as if realizing something, his gaze instantly grew profoundly deep. He looked toward the area behind Kong Fa and Xu Wei. A moment later his expression changed drastically and he shouted, "Bad!"

He finally understood what Kong Fa and Xu Wei had run into, and why they would approach despite knowing he was here.

Those two were actually being chased by a pack of ancient ferocious beasts!

At that moment, Yang Kai and the others also noticed the clue.

From the time Kong Fa and Xu Wei had appeared until then, the area behind them had been calm, yet the two themselves looked thoroughly disheveled—clearly they had endured a fierce fight and carried more than slight wounds.

Yang Kai had been puzzled at first—what could make two Void King Realm experts suffer losses?—but the instant Kong Fa cried for help, a kaleidoscope of colors flashed into being less than three li behind him. The light dazzled the eyes; at first it was hard to make out what it was, but on a closer look Yang Kai discovered it was an inexhaustible swarm of strange insects that resembled butterflies.

They fluttered colorful wings and their forms shifted unpredictably. Every time their wings beat they could perform what amounted to instantaneous movements, closing the distance to Kong Fa and Xu Wei as if by teleportation.

From where the others stood, the creatures pursuing Kong Fa and Xu Wei numbered at least a thousand, gathering into a vast mass, a ferocious tide of insects clustered not far behind them.

Luo Lan's fair face drained of color. Though she did not recognize what kind of ferocious beasts these butterfly-like creatures were, seeing Kong Fa and Xu Wei in such a sorry state made it obvious they were not to be trifled with.

"Illusory Void Butterflies!" Ni Guang answered quickly. "Ancient exotic insects born with the ability to stir spatial power; their bodies are harder than steel and they are exceedingly ferocious. Once they move out they are like locusts sweeping across the land..."

Before his words finished, an even larger area of prismatic light burst forth behind Kong Fa and Xu Wei, revealing still more Illusory Void Butterflies.

Their numbers were not merely in the thousands—far from it; they numbered well into the tens of thousands...

At the very least tens of thousands of Illusory Void Butterflies filled the sky and swept toward them, a horrifying scene. Each time they beat their wings, faint ripples visible to the naked eye formed in the surrounding space, as if even the fabric of space itself were affected.

"Run!" Ni Guang barked, quickly mobilized his Saint Yuan, wrapped Xue Yue and turned to flee.

Unlike Luo Lan, Ni Guang had done a great deal of preparation before entering the Lost Realm and knew of the existence of Illusory Void Butterflies; he also fully understood how difficult and ferocious they were. The moment he realized the creatures chasing Kong Fa and Xu Wei were of this kind, he no longer hesitated—he only thought to escape as fast as possible.

Seeing his actions, Yang Kai and Luo Lan understood how serious the matter was; they both employed secret arts and fled at speed.

Luo Lan was a Void King Realm expert—her escape speed was naturally not slow—while Yang Kai, though lower in cultivation, possessed advantages many warriors lacked: his physical constitution and the might of his Saint Yuan far exceeded that of an ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so in speed he was not at all behind, trailing closely after Luo Lan.

"Senior Ni!" Kong Fa shouted from the rear, "I beg Senior Ni to lend a hand so this Kong and Brother Xu can get free!"

Ni Guang, furious, sped on without looking back and shouted, "Get lost! If you dare follow this old man again, I'll take your life!"

He was full of rage—having stumbled into such a thing for no reason, with these people shamelessly tailing him and trying to duck responsibility, all the while blabbering for help. If Ni Guang did not so fear those Illusory Void Butterflies, he would have turned and killed Kong Fa on the spot.

This was undoubtedly an excellent opportunity to kill Kong Fa.

"Is Senior Ni truly so heartless?" Kong Fa's voice suddenly took on a chill.

"I have no kindness to spare for you two!" Ni Guang snorted coldly.

Kong Fa sneered, "If Senior Ni shows no mercy, then do not blame Kong and Brother Xu for acting without honor."

As he spoke, he and Xu Wei exchanged a glance; in the midst of their escape they each unleashed a secret art, launching attacks remotely at Ni Guang.

Power fluctuations rose and brilliant lights streaked like meteors across the sky, striking the path ahead of Ni Guang. His body stuttered and he roared back, "You two bastards—I'll remember you!"

"Despicable, shameless!" Luo Lan cried angrily.

These two Void King Realm experts, tumors in the Star Domain, were clearly trying to drag Ni Guang and Luo Lan down so they could relieve their own pressure and escape amidst the chaos of these tens of thousands of Illusory Void Butterflies.

A brief pause allowed Kong Fa and Xu Wei to rapidly close the distance, and the Illusory Void Butterflies behind them drew ever nearer.

After the outburst, Ni Guang could not afford to linger and had no time to counterattack; he continued forward with Xue Yue and fled.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he realized the situation might be dire. Judging by the current state of affairs, Ni Guang and Luo Lan being pulled into it was only a matter of time. If the two were entangled by the Illusory Void Butterflies, given the power those demonic beasts displayed, he and Xue Yue would stand little chance.

Moreover, with the two treacherous schemers Kong Fa and Xu Wei stirring up trouble, the situation grew all the more unpredictable.

"Senior Ni, matters have come to this—why not unite for the moment and drive off these demonic beasts first, then deal with everything else?" Kong Fa, seeing his plot had succeeded, abandoned his earlier pleading tone and began to propose cooperating with Ni Guang.

Ni Guang's face darkened and he remained silent, though he cast a worried glance at Xue Yue. With his formidable cultivation at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, he was not overly afraid of these Illusory Void Butterflies; even if surrounded he was about eighty percent confident he could cut his way out. But bringing Xue Yue along changed the situation.

With that thought he sent a Divine Sense to Xue Yue: "If we separate, be sure to protect yourself!"

Xue Yue barely nodded.

At that moment Kong Fa and Xu Wei once again unleashed secret arts to impede Ni Guang and Luo Lan's speed, and in order to drag these two Void King Realm experts down they gave everything, each striking with their strongest attacks.

By the time Ni Guang and Luo Lan dispelled those attacks, Kong Fa and Xu Wei had already closed to within less than thirty zhang of everyone, and the countless Illusory Void Butterflies pursuing them were also within arm's reach.

"I swear, one day I will pulverize you both to bones and ash!" Ni Guang cried, seeing no way to escape; he shoved Xue Yue out and whirled to roar.

"Senior Ni, there is no need for such anger—let us get past this first," Kong Fa said miserably, but his words were cut off as his face changed—the opposing Ni Guang had charged straight at him.

Kong Fa let out a startled yell, pointed forward and manifested a blood-red shield for protection.

Boom—an explosive sound rang out as the violent attack struck the shield. The shield flared with a crimson light; although it withstood Ni Guang's hasty blow, the aftershock still sent Kong Fa hurtling backward.

In Kong Fa's terrified gaze, he fell straight into the encircling ring of countless Illusory Void Butterflies.

Within that area, multicolored butterfly shadows fluttered wildly as Kong Fa’s figure quickly vanished from sight. From within the encirclement came a chorus of startled cries and strange shouts, along with violent surges of energy.

A moment later a figure shot up into the sky—the battered Kong Fa who had fought his way out.

But in that short span he had been grievously wounded; his body was drenched in blood, half his nose seemed missing, and his face was pitted and corroded as if eaten away—truly a ghastly sight, revealing the terror of these Illusory Void Butterflies.

Countless Illusory Void Butterflies converged into a single force, following like a rising multicolored column, relentless in their pursuit, intent on extermination.

Kong Fa had reaped what he sown—his situation was grim—and the Ni Guang and Luo Lan he had dragged down wore anxious expressions. Each called forth protective secret treasures and unleashed secret arts, fiercely striking at the surrounding Illusory Void Butterflies.

Clang, clang—the attacks of Void King Realm experts against those Illusory Void Butterflies sounded like metal meeting metal. Vast swathes of the butterflies fell from the sky dead, yet still more pressed forward in waves; the ground where the two stood was sealed in an impenetrable encirclement.

The long-silent Xu Wei was the same.

The four Void King Realm experts could only fight for themselves, striving to survive.

The Xue Yue who had been shoved out earlier had already reunited with Yang Kai; she well knew that only by joining forces with Yang Kai could a sliver of hope be secured.

She manifested a bracelet-like secret treasure that radiated a powerful energy surge; once activated it multiplied—one became ten, ten became a hundred—and in a very short time the sky itself seemed filled with the bracelet's phantoms.

This was clearly a Void King-Grade secret treasure!

Given Xue Yue's status and standing, it was only natural she possessed a Void King-Grade secret treasure; had she not, that would have been the oddity.

However, her cultivation was insufficient, so even though she owned a Void King-Grade secret treasure, it was only Lower-Level.

Under her Saint Yuan's activation, the countless bracelet phantoms hummed and, like loosed arrows, began to sweep the area. The attacking Illusory Void Butterflies' assaults were halted, and from time to time dead butterflies drifted down from the sky.

But Xue Yue was not pleased; she whispered, "These things have such strong defenses!"
