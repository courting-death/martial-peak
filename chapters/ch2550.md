## Chapter 2550 — Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl

"Miss Lin'er, please lend us your aid!" Hua Feichen, seeing that the Heaven Net Sealing Array was about to be broken, could no longer hold back. He turned and shouted at the red-clothed young woman.

Lin'er pouted, "What a useless formation. More than twenty people working together can't even trap a single person, and you still have the nerve to boast about how powerful it is! When I offered to help earlier, didn't you all say you didn't need me? Now you know to beg for my help."

Hua Feichen was so frustrated he could cough up blood. He thought to himself that it wasn't the formation's fault at all—the enemy was simply too strong, and those setting up the formation weren't powerful enough.

The Heaven Net Sealing Array's power depends on the strength of those who set it up and the grade of the Netherworld Infernal Banners. The higher both are, the greater its might. Otherwise, it wouldn't be the Netherworld Sect's protective grand array.

He and Yin Lesheng had thought this operation would be foolproof. After all, Yang Kai had only just advanced to the Emperor Realm; how strong could he be? As long as they sealed the space, it should've been easy to toy with him.

But reality was completely different from their expectations. Yang Kai's strength simply couldn't be measured by common sense.

"Miss Lin'er, please don't be so sarcastic," Hua Feichen said, sweat beading on his forehead in anxiety. "If Yang Kai escapes, your own plans might fall through as well."

Lin'er was startled awake. "That's true! I'll help you this once."

As she spoke, a crystal-clear jade bowl suddenly appeared in her hand. The bowl wasn't large, resting in her slender palm, emitting a pure white glow. Inside the bowl was a carved image of an ancient cinnamon tree, so lifelike it seemed to sway gently, as if it were alive.

Lin'er gave a delicate shout, raised her hand, and threw the jade bowl, calling out softly, "Go!"

The jade bowl instantly turned into a streak of white light, shooting above the black sphere. It expanded with the wind, and in the blink of an eye, formed a semi-circular white screen that descended, covering the black sphere.

Not only that, but the ancient cinnamon tree's shadow inside the bowl also became real, rooting itself in the earth and transforming into a towering ancient tree. Its wondrous fragrance spread everywhere.

Boom...

At the same time, Yang Kai's attack struck again.

The black sphere suddenly swelled, but with the white screen formed by the jade bowl blocking it, the sphere was suppressed before it could expand much.

The more than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples, who had all been pale and thought the grand array would be broken and they'd suffer backlash, were overjoyed to see the screen holding firm. They redoubled their efforts, channeling their Origin Qi to boost the array's power.

Hua Feichen's eyes burned with desire as he swallowed hard. "Is this the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl?"

This Imperial Treasure was renowned—few experts in the Eastern Territory hadn't heard of it, though even fewer had seen it in person. This was Hua Feichen's first time seeing it, and with his experience, he knew well how terrifying its power was.

"What, you want it?" Lin'er turned to glare at him.

Hua Feichen looked terrified and quickly replied, "I wouldn't dare. It's just that today, Miss Lin'er has truly opened my eyes. This trip was worth it."

"Enough with the nonsense, hurry up! I can't control this thing for long," Lin'er said, her face flushing. Her Origin Qi poured out like a flood, clearly showing that using this Imperial Treasure consumed a tremendous amount of energy—she really couldn't maintain it for long.

Hua Feichen seemed to suddenly come to his senses, straightening up and saying respectfully, "Miss Lin'er, I'll need your cooperation once more."

As he spoke, he exchanged a glance with Yin Lesheng. The two moved in unison, darting toward the black sphere.

Lin'er formed a hand seal, and when the two approached, she suddenly opened a gap in the white screen, letting them pass through.

The more than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples did the same, allowing Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng to enter the Heaven Net Sealing Array.

Inside the array, Yang Kai let out a soft exclamation, his expression extremely odd.

He had nearly broken this damned array, but for some reason, a new, incredibly tenacious force had suddenly stabilized the chaotic formation.

Not only that, but the surrounding space was sealed even tighter, and he felt even more suppressed.

Trapped in this ghostly array, Yang Kai felt as if he were in a strange mist. His Divine Sense couldn't extend far, so he had no idea Lin'er was interfering outside, using a powerful Imperial Treasure.

He thought he'd underestimated the array's power.

Sss sss sss sss...

All around, the sound of tearing air echoed as hideous Yin-Soul ghosts circled him, attacking whenever they saw an opening.

The Heaven Net Sealing Array was set up using the Netherworld Infernal Banners as its foundation. The black mist that sealed the world was released from the banners, and with the array's boost, its power was greatly enhanced.

Yang Kai, trapped inside, had to face more than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples wielding Netherworld Infernal Banners. This was far from a simple one-on-one fight.

The Yin-Soul ghosts seemed to have grown much stronger. Though Yang Kai did his best to drive them away, he hadn't killed many. Earlier, he'd focused on breaking the array, which left him surrounded now.

Only now did he realize the array's sinister nature.

Covered by the array, Yang Kai found his vitality slowly draining away. The black mist around him contained a troublesome corrosive force, eating away at his flesh and Emperor Yuan.

Woooo...

His ears were filled with chilling ghostly wails. Shadows hid in the mist, launching attacks from all directions.

Yang Kai flicked his fingers, sending Moon Blades slashing in every direction.

Though this world was sealed off and he couldn't teleport out, inside the black sphere he could still freely use his space powers.

The Moon Blades were terrifying, tearing through space and turning the ghosts to ashes.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly sensed danger and instinctively struck behind him with his palm.

But his attack hit nothing, and instead his right shoulder was fiercely struck, making his Qi and blood churn as he staggered back.

Luckily, his body was tough—otherwise, that blow would have broken his arm.

"Yang Kai, inside the Heaven Net Sealing Array, I am the master! If I want you to live, you live; if I want you to die, you die! You have no chance of survival!" Yin Lesheng's voice suddenly echoed from all directions, impossible to pinpoint.

Yang Kai frowned deeply, sensing real trouble.

Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen, both from the Netherworld Sect, were like fish in the water inside the array, while he was bound and unable to use much of his strength.

With the array draining his vitality and countless Yin-Souls attacking, if he didn't think of something, he might really not make it out this time.

Yang Kai's mind raced. Before he could steady himself, he felt a chill rush toward his neck.

Startled, he summoned the Myriad Sword, slashing at the cold sensation.

A crisp clang rang out, sparks flying.

A voice of surprise sounded—it seemed to be Hua Feichen.

He clearly hadn't expected Yang Kai, trapped in such a desperate situation, to sense his sneak attack, making his strike completely ineffective.

Spinning the Myriad Sword in his hand, Yang Kai looked around. Though he still couldn't see clearly, he smiled and said, "Yin Lesheng, I let you go once in the Shattered Star Sea, but I didn't expect you'd come to the Ancient Land to ambush me. Since you're so eager to die, I might as well oblige you."

Yin Lesheng was furious. "Still so stubborn at death's door! I'll see what tricks you have left."

Yang Kai chuckled, "Just wait and see. Don't cry later!"

Yin Lesheng burned with anger, wanting to retort, but Hua Feichen interrupted, "Junior Nephew, be careful—he's probing your location!"

Yin Lesheng realized Hua Feichen was right. Yang Kai was clearly out of options and kept provoking him to make him speak, so he could locate him.

He immediately fell silent.

Yang Kai sneered, "You think with this damned array helping you, I can't do anything? Within one incense stick, I'll have you begging for mercy."

"Arrogant!" Yin Lesheng was so enraged he couldn't help but shout.

Hua Feichen was also trembling with anger. After all his years of cultivation, he'd never seen someone so reckless. Facing death, Yang Kai still shouted nonstop. He couldn't understand where his confidence came from, and secretly decided to torture him well once he was captured.

After a few exchanges, the black sphere fell silent, with only the sound of weapons clashing.

Outside, the red-clothed girl and Elder Fu stood watching. Though they didn't know what was happening inside, they understood Yang Kai must be struggling.

Every so often, Yang Kai would grunt in pain, clearly struck by Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng.

Lin'er did her best to wield the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl. Though it consumed her greatly, her face was full of excitement, just like Hua Feichen—both secretly looked forward to tormenting Yang Kai.

As long as they could capture Yang Kai and vent their anger, any price would be worth it.

Bang bang bang...

Inside the black sphere, the sounds of battle rang out every so often. It was clear Yang Kai had completely fallen behind, only able to defend. If not for his keen mastery of space power, sensing attacks before they landed, he'd have died countless times already.

Even so, he was now battered and bruised, covered in wounds. Though none were fatal, the accumulation was shocking.

"Still not dead!" Yin Lesheng was both shocked and furious. He and Yang Kai had both just advanced to the Emperor Realm, yet Yang Kai was displaying far greater strength—he couldn't accept it.

But it shouldn't be long now. Inside the array, with his vitality draining and cold invading his body, and already wounded, Yang Kai would soon be spent and become meat on the chopping block.
