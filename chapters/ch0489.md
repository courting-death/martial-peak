## Chapter 489 — Total Defeat

Tonight, Yang Kai launched a sudden large-scale attack on Yang Kang. Eldest Brother Yang Wei led troops to restrain Yang Zhao, and the two battlefields were shrouded in smoke and fire, the situation instantly becoming tense.

Upon receiving the news, Yang Shen immediately saw an opportunity to exploit. He promptly sent word to Yang Ying, and the two led a large force to strike at Yang Kai’s rear, hoping to seize the command flag and eliminate him from the competition.

At this moment, Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, Yang Kai, and Yang Kang were all stretched thin, their martial artists scattered. Even if they mobilized, they had to worry about their own rear security.

To ensure victory, both Yang Shen and Yang Ying brought along their sole remaining Blood Servants, and approximately seventy percent of their household’s martial artists were mobilized.

They aimed for a swift and decisive battle to quickly break through Yang Kai’s defenses.

Yang Shen’s ambition was understandable—anyone in his position would have made the same decision.

In fact, it was an extremely sound decision.

However, Yang Shen had gravely misjudged the situation.

He believed Yang Kai and Yang Kang would be locked in a protracted battle. He assumed that he and Yang Ying could easily snatch the command flag from the central hall of Yang Kai’s mansion.

In his fantasy, by the time he and Yang Ying returned triumphantly with the flag, the fight between Yang Kai and Yang Kang would still be unresolved—a time gap to be exploited.

Both forces hastened to converge at Yang Kai’s residence.

With a fierce assault, Yang Kai’s martial artists proved unable to withstand and kept retreating.

Only a few forces remained in the mansion: Wan Hua Palace, Fei Yu Pavilion, the Xiang Family, Yingyue Sect, Blood Battle Gang, and Ghost King Valley. How could they resist the attack from the numerous martial artists Yang Shen and Yang Ying brought?

Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen were both absent, leaving everyone like headless flies. Han Xiao Qi, Wan Hua Palace’s Senior Sister, remained composed and calm, issuing commands.

Under her coordination, the troops gradually steadied.

Yet the disparity in strength left them feeling helpless, forced to evade and withdraw repeatedly.

Seeing this, Yang Shen and Yang Ying rejoiced and ordered soldiers to storm the central hall to seize the command flag.

Qu Gaoyi single-handedly held off the attackers, empowered by the Blood Fury Technique, displaying a spirit that could hold off thousands—a force that no one could breach.

Despite prolonged efforts, Yang Shen and Yang Ying grew anxious.

At that moment, a subordinate rushed in with news.

Yang Kang was defeated!

A complete and utter defeat, utterly disastrous! Yang Kai had led his martial artists to retreat from Yang Kang’s residence.

Yang Shen and Yang Ying were shocked and dared not hesitate further. They personally led their Blood Servants into the fray, hoping to finish the battle before Yang Kai returned.

Qu Gaoyi was formidable, but he was only one man. Any one Blood Servant beside Yang Shen and Yang Ying could delay him.

With two Yang Family scions and two Blood Servants attacking, Qu Gaoyi was indeed outnumbered, unable to guard the central hall.

Just as the command flag was within reach, an elderly man with white hair suddenly appeared. His expression was unreadable, as if forced to act against his will. Calmly, he blocked the martial artists trying to seize the flag.

Yang Shen and Yang Ying’s eyes reddened in fury. Victory was so close, yet this old man was unexpectedly powerful.

They refused to give up, ordering countless martial artists to press the attack again and again.

But the old man’s strength was overwhelming. Combining forces with Qu Gaoyi and the Divine Roaming Realm martial artists from Yang Kai’s residence, they formed an impenetrable defense in front of the hall—no mosquito could get through.

After a long standoff, Yang Shen and Yang Ying grew desperate.

What puzzled them even more was that Yang Kai had yet to send reinforcements.

Just as they were bewildered, a martial artist rushed over in a panic with a report: “Sixth Young Master, bad news! Ninth Young Master seems to have led troops into the mansion and has not returned here!”

Hearing this, Yang Shen felt as if a bucket of cold water had doused him from head to toe; his whole body chilled.

He had tried to exploit Yang Kai’s weak rear defense to seize the command flag. Unbeknownst to him, after defeating Yang Kang, Yang Kai had been thinking the very same thing.

“Brother Six...” Yang Ying looked at Yang Shen mournfully.

“Retreat!” Yang Shen waved his hand decisively—no more hesitation. The attack here was failing, and his own rear was aflame. There was no time to linger.

Yang Ying gritted his teeth, casting a hateful glance at the old man, then followed Yang Shen as they withdrew.

Halfway back, Yang Shen saw many martial artists from his own mansion fleeing toward them, his face turning ashen.

“Sixth Young Master!” One of the fleeing martial artists spotted them and hurried over, sniffling tearfully as he recounted the sorrow, “Ninth Young Master is a bastard! He stormed into the mansion, burning, killing, and looting; we couldn’t hold him back. The command flag has been lost!”

Yang Shen staggered slightly; sorrow and despair flickered across his face.

He truly lost in the most humiliating way.

Yang Kang was eliminated, but at least because Yang Kai directly assaulted him and overpowered him. What about himself? He had fallen purely due to greed and carelessness!

He had never expected the fight between Yang Kai and Yang Kang to end so quickly. Nor did he anticipate the fortress-like defense of Yang Kai’s mansion.

One wrong move, total defeat!

“Brother Six...” Yang Ying pursed his lips, unsure how to console him, only softly calling out.

Yang Shen’s expression suddenly steadied, his voice low and firm: “Seventh Brother, take some supplies from the Xiang Family clan that Brother Six exchanged for. Also, all the martial artists in my mansion, I entrust them to you.”

“Sixth Brother!” Yang Ying looked moved, opening his mouth but unsure what to say. As brothers in the succession war, they naturally helped each other. Now that Yang Shen was out due to losing the flag, all he could do was bolster Yang Ying’s strength.

“What are you waiting for? Ninth Brother has a big appetite. After he’s done with my mansion, he’ll come for yours. Hurry back!” Yang Shen barked.

Yang Ying snapped out of his daze, realizing the gravity, and hurriedly led his men back without further words.

“Since you’re out, Sixth Young Master, I will take my leave,” said Luo Hai, one of Yang Shen’s Blood Servants.

Yang Shen glanced at him, smiling bitterly. “You’re going to join Ninth Brother?”

Luo Hai nodded slightly, not denying it.

“You’ve been waiting for this day a long time, haven’t you?” Yang Shen sneered in disdain, tinged with despair.

The expression on Luo Hai’s face remained unchanged; he said nothing.

“Why do you Blood Servants always want to join Ninth Brother? Does he have such great power to make you willingly submit?”

“Blood Servants are loyal and grateful. You understand why we serve Ninth Young Master,” Luo Hai replied.

“Just because he employed Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu? You really owe him that much?”

“Yes!” Luo Hai nodded deeply.

Yang Shen inhaled deeply, feeling his heart sink. He waved his hand: “Go then. You’ve worked hard while you were with me.”

Luo Hai cupped his fists and turned to leave.

Watching Luo Hai’s back, Yang Shen bitterly smiled. He, too, once had the chance to employ Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu—not only him, but every Yang Family scion with enough merit had that chance. Yet no one seized it except Ninth Brother, who alone had the boldness.

If he had been the one to employ Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu back then, would these Blood Servants have sworn loyalty to him? Surely, if he had managed to hold on.

At that time, Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu were seriously wounded and could only perform at thirty percent of their peak. No one dared have them as followers.

Yang Shen still couldn’t understand what extraordinary means Ninth Brother used to heal their injuries and build such an overwhelming strength to rise above all others.

***

At Yang Shen’s mansion, the troops happily counted the spoils, hauling out large boxes, their gains substantial.

Yang Shen had taken out seventy percent of his martial artists. When Yang Kai arrived, he met no meaningful resistance and easily captured the estate.

It was effortless.

The martial artists fled in all directions. Yang Kai did not order a pursuit but instead commanded the retrieval of supplies.

“Yan Lingxing reports to Young Master!” A scar-faced burly man approached Yang Kai with respect.

Yang Kai glanced at him and gave a slight nod.

This man had been Yang Shen’s Blood Servant at Po Jing Lake, like Tu Feng. Both were afflicted with the Sealing Yuan Curse, which shackled their True Yuan, rendering them powerless.

At present, apart from being physically strong, he was no different from an ordinary person.

All the martial artists in Yang Shen’s mansion had fled; only he remained.

“I wish to follow Young Master and serve faithfully. I sincerely ask for your approval!” Yan Lingxing said solemnly.

“Just as I was thinking.”

Yan Lingxing rejoiced, repeatedly expressing thanks.

Qiu Yimeng watched nearby, shaking her head with a bitter smile.

She had studied many records of the Yang Family succession wars and knew that whenever a Yang Family scion was defeated and eliminated, their Blood Servants became highly sought-after by the remaining heirs, often triggering battles to win their allegiance.

But this time, astonishingly, all the defeated scions’ Blood Servants had without exception chosen to follow Yang Kai.

She couldn’t understand what charm this bastard possessed, that even the Blood Servants Hall’s masters bowed and swore loyalty so willingly.

If Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, and the others witnessed such a scene, they would probably be green with envy.

“Yang Kai, where do we go now?” Qiu Yimeng asked, her head aching and unwilling to ponder.

“Home. Where else would we go?” Yang Kai glanced at her.

Qiu Yimeng pursed her lips. “I thought you’d go to Yang Ying’s mansion.”

Yang Kai shook his head. “Not for now. Seventh Brother’s mansion is likely filled with two factions. A strong assault now would cause heavy losses. We’ll wait a while. Tonight... we’ve gained enough.”

“You’re too modest,” Qiu Yimeng teased.

The gains were more than enough, overflowing indeed!

Yang Kang was defeated; they took his command flag, seized his supplies, and gained the allegiance of Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Yang Shen was defeated; likewise, they claimed his command flag, took his provisions, and received the loyalty of Yan Lingxing and Luo Hai.

In just one night, Yang Kai’s mansion grew stronger, well-stocked, and its future bright.
