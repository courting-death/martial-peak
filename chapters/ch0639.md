## Chapter 639 — Dancing with Demons

In boundless darkness, Yang Kai slowly awakened.

The scene he had just experienced flashed through his mind; Yang Kai's expression changed as he quietly released his Divine Sense to probe his surroundings, wanting to understand where he was.

However, his Divine Sense extended only a dozen or so zhang before being blocked by an invisible force.

Where he was now seemed to be encased by a layer of binding barrier that restrained him.

Helplessly drawing back his Divine Sense, he slowly opened his eyes; an orange light met his gaze. He found himself seemingly detained in a stone chamber, surrounded by cold rock walls. In the ceiling there was an egg-sized stone that emitted a soft glow to provide illumination, so his sight was not entirely confined.

Sitting cross-legged and circulating his cultivation to regulate his breath, Yang Kai was astonished to find he was unharmed; not only were there no injuries, but his True Yuan showed no signs of being sealed. His heart relaxed.

He knew he had been captured by the Coffin-Bearer, but that legendary Saint-Grade expert—rumored to be half simpleton, half madman—had not harmed him, which left Yang Kai puzzled.

There were so many people; why had the Coffin-Bearer focused solely on capturing him? From start to finish, Yang Kai had only once cautiously used his Divine Sense in full view of everyone.

Furrowing his brow in thought, Yang Kai formed a conjecture, though he did not know if it was correct.

He sat upright on the ground, regulating his breath and waiting in silence.

He understood that since the Coffin-Bearer had neither sealed nor tormented him, merely bringing him here, there must be a purpose; the Coffin-Bearer would surely reappear. Not knowing the situation, Yang Kai refrained from rash action and chose to wait.

Time passed slowly, and after a long while a rustling sound came from afar and approached.

Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes; his pupils shone brightly.

"It seems Senior Coffin-Servant has delivered another one; they say the fellow's young—don't know if he has any skill."

"Who cares, I don't hold much hope. If he's useless, when the ten-year term ends he'll die here; none of our business."

"Mm, but Lady Li seems very eager to fulfill her ancestors' long-cherished wish; by comparison, Lord Chu is more open-minded. Actually, staying here isn't so bad."

"Shh, don't say more; walls have ears—if someone hears, you'll be in trouble."

The two men's voices entered Yang Kai's ears clearly, causing his expression to become somewhat odd.

He had thought the newcomer would surely be the Coffin-Bearer, but now it seemed that was not the case.

Not long after, a creak sounded in the sealed chamber as a stone door at the side was opened; two men, one tall and one short, stood at the doorway, their faces grim and cold as they stared at Yang Kai.

Detecting their aura, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

He found their auras differed from any he had previously encountered—there was an icy, sinister ferocity about them.

Specifically, their aura resembled that of the Di Mo and shared a common origin with the aura he had when he Entered the Demonic State; however, their presence was quite tenuous compared to either the Di Mo or himself.

Demonic energy? Yang Kai was startled.

Looking at their appearances, they also seemed different from ordinary people: hooked noses, narrow eyes—one could tell at a glance they were treacherous and sly—and on their faces were a few colorful streaks of patterns.

Seeing these markings, Yang Kai's expression grew stranger still.

Because when he had Entered the Demonic State, his entire body—save for his face—had been covered with similar patterns. Yang Kai knew clearly that such markings concealed immense power.

Thoughtful but impassive, Yang Kai simply watched the two men quietly.

"Awake?" the taller man chuckled. "If you're awake, stand up and come with us — the Lady wishes to see you!"

Yang Kai narrowed his brow but said nothing more.

The two men, one tall and one short, cultivated to roughly the fourth or fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; given Yang Kai's present state, killing them would take no effort and he could end their lives casually, but without understanding the situation he did not intend to act.

Their roles were clear: one in front, one behind, sandwiching Yang Kai and glancing at him from time to time with vigilance.

As they walked out, Yang Kai discreetly observed the surroundings.

Upon exiting the stone chamber they entered a long corridor that led upward, with many steps; it seemed he had previously been imprisoned underground.

After walking for a long time they finally finished the steps and set foot on solid ground.

Light assaulted him; Yang Kai squinted and looked up, startled, for the scene that met his eyes carried a strange sense of familiarity.

Day and night undistinguished, sun and moon darkened, heaven and earth in chaos...

Yang Kai could not help but stop in his tracks.

In his life he had been to such places twice before.

Once it had been in the Inheritance Celestial Cave near Lingxiao Pavilion, the second time when he followed Ling Taixu into an otherworldly place in Ghostly Underworld Mountain to undergo trials.

On both occasions, the spaces he entered were very similar to the one before him now.

In that instant Yang Kai thought he had returned to the Inheritance Celestial Cave or the otherworldly place in the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, and he was momentarily dazed.

"What are you stopping for? Move!" the man behind barked angrily, growing impatient.

Yang Kai frowned, recovered himself, and glanced around; he suddenly noticed many men and women on the nearby ground curiously inspecting him, pointing and whispering.

On these people, regardless of who they were, exposed skin bore, to varying degrees, patches of differently colored markings.

Who exactly were these people? Yang Kai wondered.

Not showing anger, he complied with the man's shout and resumed walking, though he regarded the crowd with greater curiosity.

Soon, following the tall and short men into a spacious hall, Yang Kai keenly noticed that the architecture outside the hall differed somewhat from what he had seen before—seemingly more brazen.

Inside the hall stood great columns, each carved with many grim, menacing patterns.

In the central seat sat a beautiful woman in courtly robes, graceful and composed; her long-lasting aura and delicate form contained a power that made Yang Kai's heart uneasy. Below her, many more people stood in two lines, quietly awaiting something.

When Yang Kai entered, everyone's eyes brightened; the beautiful woman's gaze shone with anticipation.

Yang Kai secretly shook his head in puzzlement; he had not found the Coffin-Bearer here, which differed greatly from his expectations.

He had assumed the 'Daren' the two who had escorted him mentioned would be the Coffin-Bearer, but to his surprise it was this mature, dignified beauty.

Moreover, Yang Kai did not observe traces of those markings on the people inside the hall.

Beside the beautiful woman stood a pretty young girl in a goose-yellow gown, delicate and attractive; when Yang Kai arrived her deep, sapphire-like eyes fixed on him, and she said to the woman at her side, "Lady, this is the person Senior Coffin-Servant brought in this time."

The woman lightly inclined her head and parted her crimson lips to say, "Thank him for his trouble. Senior Coffin-Servant was not injured this time, was he?"

Her voice was supremely gentle and indescribably sweet; matched by her dignified attire, she seemed to possess a tranquil temperament.

The girl shook her head. "Only some superficial wounds. Those humans are truly hateful; because Senior Coffin-Servant could not act openly they attacked relentlessly. Otherwise, given his strength, Senior Coffin-Servant could have slaughtered them all with ease!"

"Alas, we burdened Senior Coffin-Servant," the woman sighed faintly.

Those beneath her also shook their heads continually, their expressions pained.

The woman tempered her expression, fixed her gaze on Yang Kai, and asked, "Human, what is your name?"

Yang Kai frowned. Though he did not fully understand what had happened to him, from his observations and the snippets of conversation he quickly realized the nature of those before him. Narrowing his eyes, he hesitantly asked, "The Demon race?"

Only members of the Demon or Yao races would address humans like that! Moreover, these people's bodies all contained demonic energy, a force distinct from True Yuan.

A flicker of surprise crossed the woman's pretty face; she had not expected this deliveree to see through their identity at a glance, nor to show any panic.

In the past Senior Coffin-Servant had delivered others, but most knelt begging for mercy, wailing without end; some resisted. Never had one been as composed as the youth before them.

"You truly are of the Demon race!" Yang Kai read them and grew more certain. "Is this the Demon Domain? Why did you seize me—what are you after?"

"Impudent!" the pretty girl could not help but cry out chastely, glaring at Yang Kai. "Answer my Lady properly; no needless questions. Speak another word and I'll pull out your tongue!"

Yang Kai chuckled.

"What are you laughing at!" The girl grew angrier, gritting her teeth at Yang Kai. "Do you think I'm bluffing?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"You..."

"Enough." The woman halted the girl's mischief, looked at Yang Kai with mild interest and smiled. "You're not afraid at all?"

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.

"Why do you think Guan'er is trying to frighten you?"

"It's obvious," Yang Kai sneered. "Because when you brought me here you neither harmed me nor sealed my True Yuan or Divine Sense, and many of you showed looks of expectation when I arrived. I don't know what you're hoping for, but you certainly want something from me; if you need me, you wouldn't hurt me."

Quiet snickers erupted among many inside the hall.

The pretty girl, Guan'er, also involuntarily opened her mouth, staring at Yang Kai foolishly.

The woman rose gracefully and offered a faint smile. "They say humans are cunning and sly—truly well-earned praise."

Yang Kai could not tell whether it was mockery or sarcasm; the words left him inwardly ill at ease.
