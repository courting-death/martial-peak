## Chapter 98 — Slaying Two More

Among these three, Nu Lang was a warrior at the first stage of the Qi Movement Realm; dealing with him might prove troublesome.

Therefore, Yang Kai had to first eliminate the other two Fengyu Tower disciples at the Open Origin Realm before he could properly contend with Nu Lang.

He was eager to see if his own strength at the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm could match that of a Qi Movement Realm opponent. Battle intent surged in his chest, and his blood boiled fiercely.

Yang Kai’s prediction was accurate. The two approaching from the left were indeed disciples of Fengyu Tower, their strength comparable to the two he had just faced. Even if they were stronger, it would not be by much.

Drawn by the cries of their junior brother, the two had not yet reached the scene of the incident when suddenly another figure came rushing toward them.

“Who goes there?” The two disciples halted, eyes wary as they faced the newcomer.

Yang Kai gave no answer. His speed suddenly increased severalfold as he lunged fiercely at them. Sensing Yang Kai’s murderous intent and hostility, the two could only cry out in alarm, “It’s Yang Kai!”

Their weapons were already in hand, attacking fiercely from left and right.

Yang Kai’s battle intent blazed. Facing their assault, he did not yield an inch. His body moved like lightning, and from his fingertips, a blood-red blade formed and shot out toward one of them.

That disciple raised his weapon to block, but a blade forged from a single drop of Yang Liquid was no ordinary Common-Grade weapon. The moment it made contact, the disciple’s weapon was severed outright. Fortunately, his reflexes were quick, and in a panic, he twisted his body just in time to avoid a fatal strike, the blade grazing his ribs as it flew past.

A sizzling sound rang out.

The disciple screamed in agony, feeling as if his ribs had been branded by a hot iron. The air quickly filled with the acrid scent of burning flesh.

“Senior Brother!” The other’s expression changed drastically, and his attack abruptly faltered.

In a life-or-death duel, this retreat exposed him fully to Yang Kai’s counterattack.

Yang Kai showed no mercy. With a casual motion, he deflected the sharp weapon and struck the man’s chest with a palm infused with mighty and scorching True Yang Primordial Qi. The disciple’s eyes bulged as he was sent flying, convulsing on the ground before falling still.

He had been slain in a single encounter, even faster than the previous Senior Brother Xiong.

Before Yang Kai could withdraw his hand, the surviving Fengyu Tower disciple lunged at him with a sword.

Unable to dodge, Yang Kai instinctively tensed every muscle.

The sword’s gleam flashed, and a bloody gash appeared across his abdomen. Pain radiated from the wound, blood seeping out, yet Yang Kai remained unmoved, a wild, bloodthirsty grin spreading across his face as he turned to look at his attacker.

The man had just witnessed his junior brother’s death before his eyes. Consumed by rage, he no longer cared for anything else. His mind was filled with the single thought of avenging his brother by killing Yang Kai. After landing one strike, he thrust again, aiming for Yang Kai’s throat.

Yang Kai raised his arm to block; the sword tip pierced about an inch into his forearm before hitting bone, unable to penetrate further.

“Heh heh!” Blood dripping down, Yang Kai sneered fiercely.

In the darkness, two rows of white fangs gleamed like a beast ready to devour its prey.

At this moment, Yang Kai was suffused with a wild, frenzied, bloodthirsty aura! His smile was chilling to behold.

“You…” The surviving Fengyu Tower disciple had never seen such a man before. Despite being stabbed twice, he could still smile. Was this man mad?

His heart filled with terror, and he tried to leap backward. In a life-or-death battle, to be cowed by the enemy’s presence meant no chance of survival.

Yang Kai’s foot shot up, striking his groin.

A sound of something breaking echoed. The man immediately doubled over and collapsed to his knees, his face pale and ashen.

Yang Kai pulled out the sword stuck in his arm and threw it down, pinning the man to the ground.

Two more slain!

“Swish!” Only then did the figure rushing from the right appear—none other than Nu Lang! The five Fengyu Tower disciples had split into three groups, searching the vicinity for Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang, but had been picked off one by one.

Nu Lang’s eyes immediately fell on the two fallen disciples, and his fury exploded. With a fierce glare, he demanded, “Did you kill them?”

Yang Kai turned to him, his expression wild yet tinged with calm resolve.

“Looks like everyone underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to have such skill.” Nu Lang’s face darkened, forcing down his rage as he took a deep breath. “I have a question for you.”

“No need to ask. You guessed right—Nu Lang and Cheng Shaofeng were killed by me.”

“So it was you!” Nu Lang’s body trembled violently. He had hoped his brother was merely out playing, however slim that hope was. But now Yang Kai had shattered that hope, openly admitting to his brother’s disappearance and death.

“They sought to kill me; naturally, I could kill them!” Yang Kai grew impatient. “Enough talk. Come and fight!”

“Very well.” Nu Lang’s killing intent surged as he glared venomously at Yang Kai. “Since you dare take responsibility, I shall not hold back. Today, I will take your life to honor my brother’s spirit!”

With that, Nu Lang launched forward with a burst of speed. His figure blurred, and in the blink of an eye, he was before Yang Kai, his hand like an eagle’s claw sweeping horizontally toward Yang Kai’s throat.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. A Qi Movement Realm warrior’s strength was indeed different from that of an Open Origin Realm cultivator. The power behind this strike was incomparable.

He hurriedly leaned back, palm raised to guard his throat.

Nu Lang sneered, but midway, his five fingers suddenly changed direction, clawing downward.

A ripping sound followed.

Yang Kai staggered back several steps and looked down to see his chest torn open. His clothes were shredded, leaving five blood-red claw marks, and a strange energy had invaded his body.

He immediately activated the True Yang Technique, dispelling the energy in the blink of an eye.

“Such arrogance from a mere fourth-stage Open Origin Realm cultivator! I will not kill you quickly—I will make you suffer a fate worse than death!” Nu Lang’s face twisted with rage as he pressed his advantage.

“Flailing like a woman, scratching in a fight—aren’t you ashamed?” Yang Kai tore open his tattered shirt, revealing his lean yet muscular frame, and sneered coldly.

Nu Lang’s face flushed red, but he had no retort. After all, his cultivation was based on claw techniques, hardly refined or elegant.

“Sharp tongue—don’t expect mercy later!” Nu Lang snarled, his hands like eagle claws striking again.

“Come and taste my fists!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, meeting the mad claws with his fists.

“Overestimating yourself!” Nu Lang sneered. At his first-stage Qi Movement Realm cultivation, even a rock would be torn apart by his claws, let alone the punches of a mere fourth-stage Open Origin Realm warrior.
