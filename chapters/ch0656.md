## Chapter 656 — Very Hurt

Seeing Yang Kai truly about to leave, Han Fei grabbed at his clothes, lightly bit her thin lip, and looked at him with a sorrowful gaze, wearing an expression of having suffered a great injustice—pitiful to the extreme.

A woman as coldly beautiful as Han Fei would not normally display such an expression, not unless she was utterly helpless.

And now, that was precisely the case.

If Yang Kai left, she would have to follow him; to watch such a massive vein of ore right before her eyes and be unable to mine it herself—one could imagine the agony in Han Fei’s heart.

Her people were in dire need of these Crystal Stones.

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai cocked his head, looking at her at leisure.

“As you said—whoever mines it, it’s theirs.” Han Fei clenched her teeth, full of hatred.

“Then get to work.” Yang Kai chuckled, squeezed his fist, and a small popping sound like cracking beans rang out.

Han Fei said nothing; she turned and began battering the rock face laced with Crystal Stones. Debris flew, and before long she found some stones among the rubble, stuffing them into her Void Ring with a pleased look.

Seeing her as if eager to claim this stretch of Crystal Stone vein, Yang Kai smiled to himself and strolled over, joining in the pounding.

Crystal Stones are generally embedded within other minerals; an entire Crystal Stone vein that can yield one tenth in extraction is already considered rich.

But the Crystal Stone vein beneath this volcano was richer than rich—about thirty percent of the ore was Crystal Stone.

Prompted by Yang Kai’s earlier words that whoever mines it keeps it, Han Fei worked with full vigor, regardless of her injuries, violently striking the rock. Whenever she found Crystal Stones she didn’t even glance at them before tossing them into her ring, as if afraid Yang Kai would snatch them away.

Yang Kai’s movements, by contrast, were deliberate and unhurried; he advanced shoulder to shoulder with Han Fei. Most of the stones ended up in her possession, and Yang Kai only obtained a small portion.

During the mining, Han Fei stole a glance at him and couldn’t help feeling proud; she thought this damned human actually wanted to race her in mining speed, as if he didn’t see the vast gap in their cultivation.

She kept that thought hidden from her face, so as not to anger him into abandoning her.

Time passed slowly. Han Fei’s collected yield was several times greater than Yang Kai’s, and by this point she no longer worried the stones would be taken from her; with his means it seemed unrealistic for him to steal them away.

The passage they were carving grew deeper and deeper, and the farther in they went the more Crystal Stones appeared, each chunk larger than the last.

Yang Kai even unearthed a Crystal Stone the size of a human head, which greatly astonished Han Fei.

Even she had never heard of a Crystal Stone so large.

Each of them was so captivated by the wealth before them that they completely forgot they were supposed to be fleeing to safety.

What puzzled Han Fei was that, despite harvesting far less than she, the human remained calm and unhurried, showing not the slightest sign of anxiety.

Did he know he couldn’t beat her in a scramble, and so was content even with a small take?

Han Fei speculated to herself.

It was also possible that the vein was simply too abundant: Han Fei was collecting for an entire clan, while Yang Kai was collecting for himself. Even a small amount would suffice for one person.

She didn’t know how much time had passed, but even a powerhouse like Han Fei began to feel fatigued.

Driven by a subconscious urge to compare with Yang Kai, Han Fei was exerting several times the spirit and strength that he was.

Suddenly, Han Fei’s movements stopped; her expression turned bitter. She held a freshly mined Crystal Stone and stood dazedly in place.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked with a cheerful tone.

“Tired. I’ll rest a bit.” Han Fei said, deliberately stepping back a little and sitting cross-legged within the protective radius of Yang Kai’s True Yuan, quietly dumping some unneeded items out of her Void Ring.

After a while, she began mining again.

But in less than an hour she stopped once more, her beautiful face full of helplessness as she shook her head.

“Your Void Ring is full, isn’t it?” Yang Kai immediately saw the crux of the matter.

Han Fei glanced at him and said faintly, “Do you have any Spatial Pouches? Lend me a few.”

Yang Kai shrugged, indicating he couldn’t help.

Han Fei sized him up with her bright eyes; she saw no signs of a Spatial Pouch or Void Ring on him. The Crystal Stones he took vanished after a flicker—she had no idea where he was hiding them.

“It’s a secret. No comment,” he replied.

“Making a mystery out of it.” Han Fei snorted. A Void Ring is a high-grade storage Secret Treasure; hers could hold an amount the size of a room.

She did not believe that someone like Yang Kai could possess a storage Secret Treasure superior to a Void Ring.

Thinking of this, Han Fei bit her lip and murmured to Yang Kai, “I don’t know why, but I’m a bit cold.”

“Could your wounds be getting worse?” Yang Kai was taken aback. He did not want Han Fei to die here—she was, after all, one of the four commanders. If she died, he would have trouble explaining himself to Li Rong and might even bring the enmity of the entire Ancient Demon Clan upon himself.

Until he had a real way to leave this Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai had no intention of making enemies of the Ancient Demon Clan.

“I don’t know.” Han Fei said as she actually began to shiver.

Yang Kai frowned, stopped mining, took off his clothes, and tossed them to Han Fei.

Han Fei’s expression was complicated; she accepted them and whispered, “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, but the next moment his smile froze.

The woman who had been shivering a moment ago now appeared perfectly composed; she tied the sleeves of the garment into a knot to make a simple sack, then picked up many Crystal Stones and put them inside.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he finally understood her intention.

“You’re insatiably greedy, aren’t you?” Yang Kai said in disgust.

“What do you know? My clan has longed for Crystal Stones for many years. Of course I must collect more. Every single stone has great use for my people.” Han Fei felt no guilt and continued stuffing stones into the bundle.

“Shall I take off my pants too? They could be turned into a pouch,” Yang Kai sneered.

“Fine.” Han Fei nodded indifferently.

Yang Kai shook with anger and pointed at her. “I’ll remember you, you lying woman. I will never trust you again. Do you have no shame at all?”

At that moment, he suddenly felt deeply hurt.

“What is shame?” Han Fei looked at him in puzzlement.

She only knew the concept of chastity...

Yang Kai drew a deep breath and, saying nothing further, bent his head and continued mining Crystal Stones.

Han Fei was powerless; her Void Ring was full, and even the clothes Yang Kai had given her for warmth could not be squeezed in. She could only stand by and watch Yang Kai harvest by the handful, her jealousy reaching its limit.

One day passed, two days passed, three days...

Han Fei was amazed to find that the human still showed no sign of stopping; the Crystal Stones he mined continued to vanish as if he had some unknown hiding place.

After these days, Han Fei roughly estimated that the amount he had mined already exceeded hers by more than twofold.

No wonder he had acted so calmly at first and had no intention of scrambling with her—he had already calculated that her storage capacity would be the limiting factor.

But what about him? What kind of storage Secret Treasure did he use to possess so much space? Han Fei had been spying on Yang Kai these days, trying to uncover the mystery, but had never succeeded.

What shocked her even more was that in the following days his massive yield continued without pause; he seemed to have a bottomless receptacle—no matter how many Crystal Stones he put in, they all fit.

“I’ll help you mine. When you get out, split half with me, okay?” Han Fei could not sit still and quietly proposed.

Yang Kai cast her a cold glance, snorted, and said nothing.

“Then give me forty percent!” Han Fei gritted her teeth and backpedaled, “Thirty percent? With my help your progress would be faster—no loss to you!”

“How about twenty percent? Ten percent is fine... at least ten percent!”

“Don’t talk to me. I don’t want to deal with you.” Yang Kai exhaled two hot breaths through his nostrils.

“Such a stingy man—can you even use that many Crystal Stones yourself? The amount you’ve mined would be enough for you for decades.” Han Fei glared.

“If I can’t use them all, I can trade them.” Yang Kai counted on his fingers: “Trade for medicinal herbs, for Secret Treasures, for Martial Skill manuals, even for women!”

Han Fei gnashed her teeth and glared at him. “Shameless!”

“Mind your place.” Yang Kai sneered. “You’re under my protection right now—so don’t boss me around, or I’ll really leave you behind.”

Han Fei was resentful but did not dare speak further.

In truth, with her Saint Realm cultivation she could easily suppress Yang Kai and make him obey, but he had saved her earlier, and now she relied on him; she could not repay kindness with ingratitude. In that regard she had some sense of right and wrong, which made Yang Kai not hate her completely.

“Huh?” Yang Kai suddenly exclaimed in surprise, picking up an unusual Crystal Stone from the pile before him. The stone was not large—only about the size of a longan compared to the ones he had found before—but its energy was a thousand times denser than that of a basin-sized Crystal Stone.

The moment he took it in hand, Yang Kai’s expression changed.

“A Saint Crystal?” Han Fei also cried out, covering her mouth as she stared at the stone in Yang Kai’s hand.

“A Saint Crystal?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “Is this the legendary grade one level above Crystal Stone?”
