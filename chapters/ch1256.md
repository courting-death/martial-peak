## Chapter 1256 — The Changes of Dragon Lair Mountain

A bit of probing left Yang Kai with an unexpectedly pleasant surprise.

That single Blood Fusion Pill proved exactly as he had suspected: though it harbored immensely potent Qi and blood, it also contained a huge share of violent aura and murderous energy; ordinary martial artists would discard such a thing as if it were worthless, never daring to take it. Only those born into the Demon Blood Sect — who would harness the pill’s malignant aura to bolster their cultivation — would make use of it.

Yang Kai did not place much value on that murderous aura; after all, he himself had once possessed similarly potent force.

Examining the ingredients used to refine the Blood Fusion Pill more closely, Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart. He couldn’t identify every component, only most of them, but the materials required to make this pill were all exceedingly rare spiritual herbs — no wonder Senior Brother Deng Ning and the two others, already Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivators, had fought so fiercely over a single Blood Fusion Pill.

Such strange pills were likely scarce even within the Demon Blood Sect; only when one had achieved great meritorious service in the sect might a handful be bestowed as reward. Deng Ning must have gained considerable benefits from the Flowing Flame Sandland and presented the gains to the Demon Blood Sect’s higher-ups, thus receiving this Blood Fusion Pill.

It was only unclear why the news had leaked and why Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong had their eyes fixed on it.

Yang Kai shook his head and did not ponder their internal grievances. His expression turned strange as he fell into thought for a while, then he opened his mouth and tossed the Blood Fusion Pill into his throat, swallowing it.

The demonic flame inside his body immediately blazed to an extremely hot, blazing yang presence. As the pill’s efficacy dissolved in his belly, a stream of chilling, yin-cold energy surged toward every limb and sinew of Yang Kai’s body; yet under the refining of the blazing, yang demonic flame, those yin-cold energies were expelled outward. Filaments of black breath seeped from Yang Kai’s pores and dissipated into the air.

All that remained was the pill’s vast store of Qi and blood coursing through Yang Kai, merging into his flesh and blood.

Not caring further for the pill’s medicinal effect, Yang Kai turned to probe the Demon Blood Threads technique Deng Ning had given him.

He did not inspect it out of any desire to adopt the Demon Blood Sect’s secret art, but to prepare for the future—one could never say when he might meet the sect’s high-ranking members; if they unleashed such techniques in battle, he wished to know them as well as they did.

Yet the moment he looked, Yang Kai made a soft exclamation. His spirit immersed itself in the secret art and for a long time would not withdraw. As he probed, his expression shifted: at times delighted, at times frowning, at times contemplative.

……

A month later, over Tianyun City a streak of azure rainbow light flashed and shot straight toward Dragon Lair Mountain fifty li away. Moments later it halted at the mountain’s foot, and Yang Kai’s figure emerged from within the light.

Looking up toward Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai was startled; disbelief and puzzlement flashed across his face, and for a time he forgot to continue onward.

From the day he had left for the Flowing Flame Sandland until now, barely more than a year had passed, yet in that scant year the entire Dragon Lair Mountain had been transformed as if the heavens had turned upside down.

From the foot of the mountain the few peaks that had once been visible were nowhere to be seen; in their place was a beautiful vista of swirling mists. Within those mists surged an uncommon fluctuation of Spiritual Qi, and through the fog one could faintly make out the cave where he had once sat in meditation and a scattering of pavilion-like structures; though few in number, they were now connected into a cluster.

A few figures bustled about within, moving to and fro.

Is this still Dragon Lair Mountain? Yang Kai even suspected he had gone to the gates of some sect’s mountain by mistake, yet fifty li away it was undoubtedly Tianyun City. Just earlier, when he had passed by, he had been considering whether to drop in on Qian Tong and give him a report of his safety.

Although the sight before him still fell short of the grandeur of a great sect’s mountain gate, the fact that so vast a change could occur in the span of a single year left Yang Kai incredulous.

Such a transformation could only be the work of Yang Yan! The spirit-gathering formation she had set up earlier in this place must have taken effect. Under Yang Kai’s Divine Sense probe, the whole Dragon Lair Mountain was surrounded by a strange, immense array; Divine Sense wandering within it felt obstructed and stifled, and there were several secret spots his Divine Sense could not penetrate at all — those secret places included the very cave he had formerly used for meditation.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense cultivation was no less than a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if even his Divine Sense could not probe in there, then even the top experts of Dark Star would have to work hard to get a glimpse.

Yang Yan had truly done it! Yang Kai could not help being slightly stunned. Before he left for the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Yan had said she would arrange the entire Dragon Lair Mountain into a terrifying grand formation; he had not expected the work to reach such a scale in so short a time.

Yang Kai did not know whether her project had been completed; if it was still unfinished, then it was truly a masterpiece in the making.

However… those hundred million Saint Crystals must be nearly spent by now, right? Setting up such an enormous formation would surely consume extraordinary materials. At that thought, Yang Kai’s face couldn’t help but twitch slightly.

As Yang Kai probed the interior, a few weak strands of Divine Sense also surged out and retreated rapidly upon contacting him.

Immediately a beam of rainbow light shot out from within Dragon Lair Mountain and struck the void before Yang Kai. Strangely enough, an invisible gate seemed to open; the pervasive Spiritual Qi parted to the sides and an unseen, straight passage formed — a passage leading directly into the mountain’s interior.

Yang Kai grinned, knowing they had surely noticed his presence. He did not hesitate and strode into the passage.

Walking, he continued to probe the surrounding changes.

After a while Yang Kai breathed out in contentment; the alterations to Dragon Lair Mountain were simply too great — so great he scarcely recognized the place.

Before long several figures came racing toward him. Leading them was Yang Yan, her whole body wrapped in a black robe; she had run so swiftly that the swell of her chest rose and fell conspicuously. Her hood had been thrown back, her small face lit with a look of relief.

Close behind Yang Yan came Wu Yi and Yu Feng and the others.

Chang Qi and Hao An were among them as well.

Yang Kai even spotted within the ranks Luo Qing from Yingyue Hall, an Origin Returning Realm First Stage expert.

Each of them wore broad smiles, visibly joyful, as if a great stone had been lifted from their hearts and they felt a rare ease.

It seemed that with the Flowing Flame Sandland closed for half a year and Yang Kai gone without returning, they had indeed worried.

Yang Yan’s concern for Yang Kai was personal. Without Yang Kai, she might still be in Tianyun City’s Treasure Refining Pavilion claiming to be an Origin-Grade artificer and grinding out small items to get by, never given the chance to manifest her staggering talent. Yang Kai had provided her the stage and the unimaginable funds to display her gifts. Wu Yi, Yu Feng and the others were similar. As for Luo Qing, he had likely been left behind by Qian Tong to keep watch and gather news of Yang Kai.

“You’re back!” Yang Yan took hurried steps to reach Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes sizing him up to make sure he hadn’t lost any limbs; only then did she give a relieved clap and cry out.

Wu Yi, Yu Feng and the rest hurried up in turn, all greeting Yang Kai with bright expressions.

Warmth swelled in Yang Kai’s chest; for the first time since entering the Star Domain he felt relied upon and trusted. In this vast Star Domain there had been no one to care for his safety; if he had died somewhere none would have known or mourned. It was utterly different from the Tongxuan Continent.

But at this moment he once again experienced that feeling, as if returned to the Tongxuan Continent facing Little Senior Sister, Meng Wuya, Ling Taixu, Chu Lingxiao and the others.

“I’m back!” Yang Kai said mildly, but the emptiness that had lived in his heart felt much more filled.

“It’s good you returned, it’s good you returned — we worried so much.” Wu Yi stepped forward with a gentle smile, casting a glance at Luo Qing and then speaking lightly: “You wouldn’t know — after the Flowing Flame Sandland closed, Elder Qian even ordered men to stand guard outside for half a year. Unfortunately, you never showed up, and they only returned to Yingyue Hall not long ago.”

Half a year! The thought struck Yang Kai — that meant Yingyue Hall’s people must have just left when he came out.

Qian Tong had been thoughtful. Yang Kai quickly clasped his fist to Luo Qing in greeting: “Greetings Brother Luo. Please tell Elder Qian not to worry; I encountered some matters in the Flowing Flame Sandland and came out separately, then had to immediately find a place for seclusion, which is why I delayed so long and had no chance to send word back to ease Elder Qian’s concern.”

Luo Qing laughed heartily. “Brother Yang, there’s no need to be so polite. If Elder Qian learns you’ve returned safely, he’ll surely be overjoyed. So long as you’re unharmed, all is well… Huh? Brother Yang, you’ve already reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm? Truly, congratulations—what wonderful news!”

While exchanging pleasantries with Yang Kai, Luo Qing could not hide a trace of envy as he congratulated Yang Kai for his advancement.

As a cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm, Luo Qing could not enter the Flowing Flame Sandland and felt regretful. He had long heard that those who entered the sandland and returned came away greatly enriched; some even broke through their bottlenecks. Now it appeared those tales were true.

At Luo Qing’s words everyone’s faces showed great exhilaration.

Strictly speaking, it was because of Yang Kai that these people had gathered here, and so Yang Kai was their true leader; now that his cultivation had risen they naturally rejoiced along with him.

After a few more casual words, Luo Qing took his leave.
