## Chapter 2230 — Battle of the Emperors

“Honored guest?” Zhou Dian raised his brows at the words, looking at Yi Quan with a mocking gaze. “Are you joking?”

He thought Yi Quan was speaking offhand. After all, even from fifty li away, he could clearly see Yang Kai’s figure and discern his cultivation. How could such a human brat possibly be worthy of being Yi Quan’s honored guest?

“This Lord is not in the mood to joke with you.” Yi Quan snorted coldly. “Get out of my Heavenly Yao Valley at once, or don’t blame this Lord for being rude.”

“So it seems… you have no intention of handing him over!” Zhou Dian’s gaze darkened as he stared coldly at Yi Quan.

Yi Quan snorted again, saying no more, his power slowly surging forth.

At this point, both experts knew that words were useless; only strength would decide the outcome.

In that instant, everything between heaven and earth seemed to freeze. The gazes of the two Third Stage Emperor Realm experts clashed, sending invisible sparks flying into the void.

Sensing danger, the many yao experts quickly used their movement arts to scatter in all directions, not looking back.

Lian Yan did the same, his whole body turning into a streak of red light, retreating dozens of li away in a flash.

Supreme battle intent filled the air, awe-inspiring Imperial Might descended, space began to tremble, and the stones on the ground slowly floated upward…

Even from fifty li away, Yang Kai still felt a chill all over his body. If not for lacking a body of flesh and blood, he might not even be able to breathe at this moment.

In a flash, Yuan Fei and Bai Lu, the two yao experts, appeared on either side of Yang Kai, nodding slightly to him.

The hostility and rejection they’d shown before were gone. Their purpose in coming here was now to protect Yang Kai.

“Where’s Purple Civet?” Yang Kai asked.

“The Young Master has already been settled somewhere safe,” Bai Lu answered softly. “Young Lord Yang need not worry.”

Even the way she addressed Yang Kai had changed, clearly due to Yi Quan’s earlier words about him being an honored guest.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, focusing his strength in his eyes as he gazed into the distance.

This was a battle between Third Stage Emperor Realm experts. If he could observe even a little, it would benefit him immensely, so he didn't want to miss the spectacle.

Just then, Zhou Dian moved.

He leapt from his mount, soaring into the sky. A brilliant light burst from his body, and when it faded, a Fangtian halberd appeared in his hands. The halberd was over three zhang long, as thick as a man’s arm, exuding a heavy might and sweeping up Spiritual Qi from all directions, as if it could stir the world itself.

With the Fangtian halberd in hand, Zhou Dian’s aura soared higher and higher. The energy on his body seethed like boiling water.

This was not a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, but a weapon condensed from Zhou Dian’s own soul power. Yet, this Fangtian halberd had followed Zhou Dian for many years, refined by secret arts. Though not a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, it had many wondrous uses and in many ways rivaled one.

Gripping the halberd, Zhou Dian laughed maniacally. His whole body turned into a stream of light, diving at Yi Quan, his furious roar echoing through the heavens.

“Yi Quan, let this General see if you’ve improved at all over the years!”

This strike was like a shooting star, like a falling meteor, as if it would tear the world apart. Every onlooker, regardless of cultivation, felt a stabbing pain in their eyes, as if they were about to be blinded. At the same time, a chill spread over their bodies.

Yang Kai was shocked to his core.

Though he had seen several Third Stage of the Emperor Realm experts in action recently, he had never witnessed such a powerhouse going all out. Only now did he understand just how strong the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm truly was.

They were existences nearly invincible in this world.

Yet, facing this earth-shattering blow, Yi Quan simply stood in place, unmoving, his eyes filled with disdain, as if he didn’t see Zhou Dian as a threat at all.

Sss sss…

A thick pillar of energy, visible to the naked eye, shot from the Fangtian halberd, transforming into a dragon that roared, baring its fangs and claws as it pounced at Yi Quan.

“It seems… you’ve forgotten the pain after your wounds healed. Have you forgotten the battle two thousand years ago?” Yi Quan said calmly.

With that, Yi Quan flicked his finger.

A thread-thin arc of force burst forth at his command, calm and precise, rising to meet the dragon-shaped torrent head-on.

The difference between the two seemed immeasurable, like an ant trying to shake a tree.

Yet…

When the thread-thin arc met the dragon, it exploded in dazzling light, so bright it covered everything, swallowing the giant dragon.

The dragon roared in agony, Zhou Dian’s face twisting wildly.

Yi Quan stepped in place and vanished.

Ding…

A light sound rang out. When everyone came to their senses, they were shocked to find Yi Quan had appeared right in front of Zhou Dian, stabbing a long sword at the shaft of Zhou Dian’s halberd, sending up a shower of sparks.

Zhou Dian stared at the long sword, his face blank with confusion.

When he fought Yi Quan two thousand years ago, the other hadn’t used such a weapon. Besides, this sword didn’t look like it was formed from soul power. He had no idea what kind of treasure it was.

But his doubt lasted only a moment. At this level, any hesitation could mean death, so Zhou Dian quickly refocused, shaking the halberd to force Yi Quan back.

At the same time, a surge of pure soul power burst forth, blasting at Yi Quan. Who knew what exquisite soul secret art he was using.

Yi Quan’s expression grew serious, his own soul power surging within, using a soul secret art to counter.

Both were Third Stage of the Emperor Realm experts. Even if there was some difference in strength, it wasn’t much. So while outsiders couldn’t see clearly, the fight was extremely dangerous.

Man and yao, a two-thousand-year-old grudge, finally clashed today, bursting with dazzling sparks.

As their souls collided, the light around them flashed wildly, their hands never stopping, sword and halberd clashing in a flurry of ringing sounds.

The sword stabbed, flicked, cut, twined, intercepted—light and agile. The halberd slashed, hooked, chopped, hacked, cleaved—fierce and domineering. Two divine weapons, two great experts, as if they would stir the world itself.

In an instant, they were locked in battle.

Their figures intertwined, darting back and forth, the clash of metal ringing out again and again.

The sword's movements were complex and fluid, its light like stars shooting in all directions, dazzling the eyes.

The halberd was mighty and overbearing, like waves crashing on the shore, unleashing supreme might.

Secret arts, energy, and exquisite movements wove a mesmerizing, dazzling scene.

Every onlooker watched, utterly transfixed.

In that battlefield, even time seemed to blur. Sometimes man and yao moved as slow as turtles, sometimes as fast as lightning. The visual contrast struck every watcher’s heart.

“Ugh…”

At last, a yao expert could bear it no longer. His face darkened, he staggered back a few steps, clutching his chest as if wounded, slowly closing his eyes, not daring to watch any longer.

As time passed, more and more people found themselves in the same state.

At first, only First Stage Dao Origin cultivators were affected, then those of the Second and Third Stages…

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, even Yuan Fei and Bai Lu, both at the Emperor Realm, had to circulate their power to dispel the discomfort in their bodies, forcing themselves to keep watching.

They didn’t want to miss this spectacular, world-shaking battle.

In a daze, Yuan Fei seemed to catch something out of the corner of his eye. He quickly turned to look at Yang Kai.

The next moment, Yuan Fei’s mouth dropped open in shock.

He saw that Yang Kai’s eyes were wide open, staring unblinkingly at the battlefield. The images of the two great experts fighting dozens of li away were reflected in his clear eyes, as if he were completely unaffected.

Not only that, but he occasionally showed a thoughtful expression.

This scene stunned Yuan Fei, who couldn’t help but nudge Bai Lu quietly.

“What are you doing!” Bai Lu snapped, annoyed at being disturbed while watching the fight.

Yuan Fei jerked his chin to the side.

Bai Lu looked over suspiciously, and the next moment, she too showed a look of shock.

“This kid… is really strange,” Yuan Fei whispered to Bai Lu.

As strong as they were, even they felt discomfort and could only keep watching for a little longer. Yet Yang Kai, who was much weaker, seemed completely fine. How could they not be curious?

“Anyone the Lord values is certainly extraordinary,” Bai Lu nodded lightly.

As the two whispered, a surge of pure soul energy suddenly spread from Yang Kai’s body, enveloping him. From that energy, an indescribable aura emerged.

Yang Kai himself seemed to be undergoing some mysterious transformation in silence.

“Emperor Intent!” Yuan Fei cried out in shock. “He’s actually touched Emperor Intent?!”

In that instant, Yuan Fei clearly sensed something and shouted in surprise.

Bai Lu’s beautiful eyes shone as she looked at Yang Kai for a long while before nodding slightly. “It’s true! Though it’s still shallow, it’s definitely Emperor Intent. Could he be about to advance to the Emperor Realm here?”

The thought startled Bai Lu.

Advancing within the Divine Roaming world was no simple matter. Every advancement was a life-and-death transformation. A single misstep meant soul annihilation, for the beings here had no flesh and blood to shield them from the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy. All they could rely on was their own soul, making it far harder than for cultivators outside.

Yi Quan was still fighting. If something happened to Yang Kai during his advancement, they wouldn’t be able to answer to Yi Quan.

For a moment, Bai Lu couldn’t help but grow anxious.

But she was clearly overthinking it.

Yang Kai was not a native of the Divine Roaming world. Though he had entered with his Spirit Body, he still had a body. Even if the battle inspired his Divine Sense to touch Emperor Intent, without sufficient physical strength he could not truly advance.
