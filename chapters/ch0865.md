## Chapter 865 — Legendary Lineage

In the endless snow mountains, two powerful and strikingly beautiful women stood nose to nose, tensions rising as if they were about to come to blows.

Both of them were women of mature, elegant beauty.

Everyone watched with bated breath, eager to see what would happen if these two actually fought.

Strangely, the slightly weaker woman carried herself with calm indifference, while the demon general Xueli wore a grave expression, looking oddly hesitant.

This left many people puzzled and suspicious.

Li Rong glanced at the clansmen who were breaking through to advancement and, seeing they were at the final moment, stopped holding back and said coldly, “You were the one who struck Senior Coffin-Servant down, weren’t you?”

“You mean that Coffin-Bearer?” Xueli’s face darkened, “So what if I did? As a member of our demon clan, he dared attack me—death was well deserved!”

“Good! So long as you admit it!” Li Rong drew in a deep breath, her full chest heaving dramatically. A trace of sorrow welled up on her face as she murmured, “Senior Coffin-Servant gave countless years for my clan, yet at the final moment, I wasn’t even able to see him once… Demon General Xueli, you will pay the price for this!”

As she spoke, Demon Yuan within her surged, coalescing into a black mist that shot straight toward Xueli.

“Brave words.” Xueli sneered. Seeing Li Rong actually take the initiative, she didn’t hesitate; her graceful body flicked and she met Li Rong head-on.

The two beautiful, full figures collided in an instant. Savage power exploded outward—an earthshaking duel between Saint Realm experts had begun.

Every eye was drawn upward to the sky.

“Saint Lord, these demons you gathered are abnormal,” Wu Jie muttered beside Yang Kai, his face twitching.

It would be one thing if ordinary clansmen had clustered together to break through, but for that leader — the beautiful woman — to take the initiative and challenge Xueli was plainly like bringing an egg to smash against a rock.

Though the Second Stage and Third Stage of the Saint Realm differ by only a Stage, their real combat power is worlds apart.

Wu Jie expected Li Rong to fall quickly.

He kept his senses alert, ready to slip away the moment Xueli was distracted.

“They’ve been sealed up too long,” Yang Kai chuckled. “That probably explains it.”

Even so, Yang Kai could sympathize with Li Rong’s feelings.

The Coffin-Servant had been torn apart by Xueli, his blood and flesh scattered across the land—how could Li Rong not be enraged?

At first she hadn’t rushed to take revenge, likely to protect her clansmen. Now that their ascensions were nearly complete, she could no longer wait.

In the sky, the two women fought like enemies bound by blood—rings of black Demon Yuan spread outward. Each collision sent exquisite energy ripples through the air, causing all present to narrow their eyes and shiver.

Battles between Saint Realm Second and Third Stage experts were rare indeed.

Yang Kai, who had been watching closely, could not tell which of the two held the advantage.

Judging by the intensity of the fluctuations, it seemed Li Rong was being suppressed.

Black Demon Yuan slithered like venomous snakes, instantaneously coalescing into a towering python that opened its fanged maw and lunged to sink its teeth into one of the figures.

At the same time, Xueli’s soul aura intensified and surged toward a point in the void.

Li Rong, who happened to be there, faltered as Xueli’s Divine Sense struck her. Before she could react, the jet-black python swallowed her whole.

Gasps rose up. Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and others watched aghast, horrified by Xueli’s technique.

The Second Stage expert endured for less than half an incense stick of time before falling under Xueli’s hand; Zhang Ao thought if it were him facing Xueli, he’d have lasted even less.

The mysteriously appearing beauty had already shown herself to be formidable.

Hisssss…

While everyone cried out, a faint sound came from within the python. In the next moment light burst forth, the python shattered, and Li Rong broke free—there was a trace of blood at the corner of her delicate mouth, evidence she had taken some damage.

Xueli looked on leisurely and sneered, “With such meager skill you dare act so audaciously before me? Submit obediently and I may spare you!”

Li Rong wiped the corner of her mouth and met Xueli’s gaze calmly, saying nothing.

After a moment she closed her eyes, and her aura underwent an earthshaking transformation.

Black Demon Yuan visibly welled up from her body like living serpents, crawling over Li Rong and vanishing beneath her clothing.

Strange black markings appeared across her lovely face.

They exuded a wild, fierce beauty.

Demon God Transformation!

Li Rong cultivated the authentic Demon God Transformation; while not comparable to Yang Kai’s, it greatly enhanced her combat power and Qi-and-blood strength.

Though she had been Second Stage of the Saint Realm, once the Demon Mark spread her wild, feral aura rivaled Xueli’s.

Drawn by Li Rong’s Demon God Transformation, the ancient demons undergoing their final ascensions all let out low roars, howling like trapped beasts.

Demon Yuan spilled outward; each person’s face and exposed flesh became covered with Demon Marks to varying degrees.

A final round of heaven-and-earth might struck from the sky; those ancient demons screamed toward the heavens, having mustered no defense and taking the destruction directly with their bodies.

Bones and flesh cracked. An invisible tidal force spread from their feet, and in that instant hundreds rose a Stage together.

Xueli’s eyes trembled violently; Yu Mo’s expression stiffened and his hands and feet trembled.

At the sight of those Demon Marks, the two of them recalled an ancient legend.

“You are…” Xueli shrieked like a madwoman, as if she had recognized Li Rong and the others but dared not utter the forbidden name. “You belong to that clan?”

It was said that during the height of the Great Demon God’s power, there existed a small branch of the Demon Race that served the Great Demon God directly.

They were personally nurtured by the Great Demon God and possessed the noblest bloodline in the Demon Race, second only to him.

The title of Demon General was insignificant before members of that lineage.

When any demon met them, they treated them with reverence. They were the Great Demon God’s servants and the glory of the Demon Race.

In those days, every demon dreamed of entering that branch, but it never accepted outsiders—self-reproducing and few in number, yet possessing unfathomable power.

Almost every scion of that line could fight beyond their level; the elite could leap several Stages without falling behind.

In times past that branch followed the Great Demon God to war, winning glory and representing him in ruling the land.

They were the Great Demon God’s confidants and a symbol of invincibility.

Legend held that in full battle their bodies would be covered by Demon Marks bearing the Great Demon God’s power, and with those marks they had few equals in the world.

But after the Great Demon God’s fall, that branch disappeared.

That branch was called the Ancient Demon Clan.

Over the years, no one knew whether the legend was true; many assumed it was a fabrication to magnify the Great Demon God’s renown.

Yet now that scene from legend had appeared before Xueli’s eyes.

The Demon Marks covering them testified to it.

From those marks Xueli felt an unimaginable power.

“You recognize us?” Li Rong mocked, nodding faintly. “So you have some discernment after all.”

“Impossible!” Xueli howled, her general’s composure gone. “You should have been annihilated long ago! The records say it was that great one who buried you—because you dared touch forbidden power!”

As a demon general, Xueli knew secrets others did not.

She had heard accounts of the Ancient Demon Clan.

It was said that for special reasons the Great Demon God had exterminated the Ancient Demon Clan before his fall.

Thus Xueli believed that branch had long since ceased to exist.

“If you don’t believe me, test it—with your own body!” Li Rong snorted and struck again.

Caught off balance, Xueli found Li Rong already before her. Li Rong pointed a slender finger and a sliver of light flashed—a light that seemed to possess soul-stealing power, leaving Xueli momentarily dazed.

“My Lady!” Yu Mo cried out, about to leap in, when Yinya and Xueji, the Ancient Demon Clan’s new leaders who had been holding back, moved to strike.

They attacked with grim, leering smiles, pinning Yu Mo in a pincer that left him scrambling.

A scream rang out as Xueli was flung back like a paper kite; a deep, bone-puncturing wound opened on her delicate shoulder, blood suffused with a faint golden light pouring out.

“You think you deserve the Great Demon God’s golden blood?” At the sight of that golden gleam, Li Rong’s expression turned ice-cold and murderous; she pressed her advantage without mercy.

Xueli was in dire straits, scrambling to steady herself. She’d been careless earlier to allow Li Rong to land a blow, and now faced a true Ancient Demon Clan expert; she could not afford any laxity.

This was truly a legendary lineage.

Only now did she realize they really had the right and strength to fight her, despite being a Stage beneath her.

“What are you waiting for?” Yu Mo roared as he was pincer-attacked by Yinya and Xueji. “If you want to live, get up and help—otherwise you’ll all die!”

His words were aimed at the stunned Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others.

Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others exchanged looks, their expressions tangled. With a bite of their teeth they drew out secret treasures and charged forward to relieve Yu Mo’s encirclement.
