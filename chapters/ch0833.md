## Chapter 833 — Strange Changes

That day, having finished refining a Sacred Pill, Yang Kai suddenly frowned.

He discovered that, without his noticing, the yang liquid stored in his dantian was nearly depleted. The last time he had replenished a large amount of yang liquid he had assumed he would have no worries about it for at least a decade, but now he realized he had been mistaken.

Every time he tore open space it consumed several precious drops of yang liquid; when he had been studying and experimenting with that method in recent days, the expenditure had been astonishing.

It was time to top up.

Yang Kai breathed a little easier — in his Black Book Space there remained sixty or seventy Divine Tree fruits, each containing an extraordinary reserve of yang-attributed energy; if he ate them all, his dantian could be replenished once more.

The Divine Tree now resided in his Black Book Space. Although its fruits were slow to mature and rare, such heaven-and-earth treasures were meant to be consumed, and Yang Kai was in no mood to be stingy.

He took out a fruit and devoured it in big bites.

The sound roused Sun Yu from his meditation; he opened his eyes and brightened at the sight.

He had reached the Divine Roaming Realm and could naturally perceive the fruit’s uncommon nature, especially the yang energy flowing within it, which made him crave it all the more.

Yet before Yang Kai he dared not show too much desire.

Just as he was about to close his eyes and continue meditating, Yang Kai smiled and cut off a piece of the fruit for him: "I’m not being stingy — it’s just that you can’t eat much of this."

Sun Yu took the small piece with an embarrassed air and tossed it into his mouth.

Moments later his True Yuan suddenly erupted into violent chaos; his face flushed deep red, his pores opened, and energy spurted from him, as if his body might burst apart at any second.

Yang Kai paid him no mind, letting him deal with the upheaval within his body.

Sun Yu didn’t dare slacken. Hastily he turned his cultivation formations to dissolve and absorb the energy surging into him.

After a long while the violent aura finally calmed. Sun Yu emerged looking lively; his Qi-and-blood power strengthened considerably, his cheeks ruddy and full of vigor.

"Want more?" Yang Kai asked.

Sun Yu hurriedly shook his head.

That single small piece had nearly caused him a catastrophe. Seeing Yang Kai eat fruit after fruit heedlessly and yet remain as calm as ever, he thought no wonder the elder was an elder — his own capacity was nothing in comparison.

Although the fruit obviously was a treasure, Sun Yu knew his limits and would not take another.

Yang Kai swallowed all sixty or seventy fruits in one go, and the yang liquid in his dantian instantly swelled to several hundred drops.

Just as he wore a satisfied expression, Yang Kai’s face shifted and his mind slipped into the Black Book Space.

"What’s the matter?" The spirit body manifested before the towering Divine Tree as Yang Kai inquired.

"There’s something strange over there." The Divine Tree transmitted its thought.

It had been a long time since he acquired the Divine Tree, and the tree’s intelligence had grown rapidly. Now it communicated with Yang Kai without obstruction, able to express itself clearly.

"Where?" Yang Kai asked, suspicious.

"Follow me." A streak of golden light suddenly shot from the Divine Tree, guiding him.

Following it, Yang Kai quickly arrived at one corner of the Black Book Space. Scanning the area, he raised an eyebrow in surprise.

"Right here!" the Divine Tree sent, the golden glow drifting about nearby.

Even without being told, Yang Kai sensed something amiss.

Scattered rubble lay here, and several precious ores were missing.

Especially the strange stones he had brought back from the starry sky — many of them were gone.

Yang Kai remembered clearly that after the starry-sky storm he had collected many curious stones and placed them here, along with minerals swept up from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

But now it seemed something had absorbed the essence from certain ores, leaving only worthless dregs.

Yang Kai glanced at the Divine Tree with suspicion.

The last time he’d noticed something similar he had thought the Divine Tree had done it, so he hadn’t paid it much mind.

Now it was clear the tree was not responsible — it wouldn’t lie to him.

"You’ve been here — have you noticed anything?" Yang Kai asked as his divine sense swept through the pile of ores, finding nothing.

"I didn’t find anything," the Divine Tree replied after a moment’s thought, "just a sense that this place is very strange."

"Keep watch over this spot; if you discover anything, tell me immediately," Yang Kai instructed.

Strange happenings within his Black Book Space left Yang Kai baffled.

The energies in those stones shouldn’t vanish without cause — they must have been consumed. If not the Divine Tree, then who?

The question sat like a bone in his throat.

After receiving the Divine Tree’s response, Yang Kai left the Black Book Space and continued to focus on improving his alchemy.

Many peaceful days passed until one day Yang Kai once again sensed the Divine Tree’s call.

Without hesitation he dove into the Black Book Space and asked urgently, "Any discoveries?"

"Yes." The tree shot another golden beam to the pile of ores and drifted around two stones: "It’s them. I sense it — they’re absorbing the stones’ essences, there’s no mistake."

Following its indication, Yang Kai looked closely and let out a soft "huh."

Though many of the ores were mixed and disorderly, he recognized these two stones and recalled where he had obtained them.

They were unusual, unlike the others.

Jet-Black Spheres.

The first had been found in the caverns where he obtained the Soul Devouring Worm; at that time he had not yet joined the Tianxiao Sect and had gone with Cang Yan and Fei Yu into that cave to investigate. Cang Yan and Fei Yu brought back several items from the depths, among them this jet-black sphere, which Yang Kai pocketed.

The second came from Fuyun City. When they had been pulled along by Du Wan and Mi Na to attend the alchemy contest during the Thousand-Year Demon Flower’s bloom, and he took first place, he discovered it inside a Saint-grade alchemist’s spatial pouch.

The two jet-black spheres looked almost identical, so Yang Kai had been curious and examined them carefully, yet found nothing.

He had never expected the culprits behind the strange events in his Black Book Space to be those very stones.

What sort of strange stone would absorb the essences of other ores? Yang Kai thought long and hard and could not come up with an answer.

He released his divine sense and probed the jet-black spheres carefully; after a moment Yang Kai’s expression turned odd.

He discovered that within the two jet-black spheres there had grown delicate patterns resembling the meridian channels of a human body — yet they were not coherent. They interrupted here and there, as if a martial artist’s meridians had been shattered.

The discovery startled him.

When he had first acquired the jet-black spheres he had examined them closely; at that time there had been nothing inside.

The discontinuous exquisite patterns inside clearly had something to do with the stones’ absorption of nearby ores’ essences.

At this moment an unusual energy flowed through those patterns, like a warrior’s True Yuan.

These two strange stones were indeed intriguing.

After some thought, Yang Kai left them be. Having determined what had happened inside his Black Book Space, he felt reassured. He merely instructed the Divine Tree to keep watching the two stones, then withdrew his mind from the Black Book Space.

He had a vague sense that the two stones were not simple. If they were allowed to continue absorbing, unexpected changes might occur.

By drawing in other ores’ essences they would become harder and more refined; if later used in forging, they could be made into an immensely powerful Secret Treasure.

When he opened his eyes and looked around, the golden dragon still devoured nearby energy and showed no sign of stopping; Sun Yu was likewise immersed in hard cultivation and refused to relax.

Yang Kai could only keep working on his alchemy.

He was also refining a drop of Demon God’s Blood taken from the Sacred Tomb and cultivating the Great Demon God’s Incarnation Technique; progress was good. That wisp of his Soul Incarnation was being nourished by the Six-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus and was steadily growing stronger and more resilient.

By now Yang Kai could clearly feel the benefits the Incarnation Technique brought.

When the technique was perfected, it was as if one possessed two divine souls; when cultivating a divine soul’s power, one’s progress could be twice as fast.

No other cultivation method in the world had such an effect.

Although Yang Kai had not perfected it, he could already noticeably sense that, because of the Soul Incarnation’s existence, his Divine Sense power increased and recovered far more significantly than before.

He therefore spared no effort in developing his Soul Incarnation, hoping one day it would fulfill its purpose.

If the Soul Incarnation were perfected and a suitable host body found, it could enter that body and become his avatar, traveling where he himself could not.

He was also refining the Upper-Level Saint-Grade Secret Treasure that had belonged to the old Saint Lord. The silvery leaf saturated with profound power was difficult to refine, but Yang Kai had ample time and was not rushed.

……

Since the day he discovered the changes inside the Black Book Space, Yang Kai checked the two jet-black spheres every few days to see how they were changing.

As time passed their exquisite patterns gradually became more coherent, but the cost was that the ores Yang Kai had collected dwindled greatly; many of the strange stones from the starry sky and from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land were now only half what they had been.

At this rate, within a year or so the ores in the Black Book Space would be completely consumed.

Wrapped in that golden sea of energy, neither Yang Kai nor Sun Yu noticed the passage of time; each was wholly occupied with his own tasks, occasionally pausing for conversation before returning to their work, neither disturbing the other.

Days passed full and meaningful; both Yang Kai and Sun Yu gained tremendous growth and benefits from this upheaval.
