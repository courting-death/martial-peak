## Chapter 612 — Seeking-Trace Worm

Zi Mo hurriedly led Yang Kai and Shui Ling out of that thicket, running hard toward the direction of Wasteland, as if afraid her master might change his mind again.

Half a day later, her pace finally eased; she panted lightly, a look of helplessness on her face as she regarded Yang Kai and Shui Ling and said, "You two… ah…"

"Your master is an interesting sort," Yang Kai chuckled.

"Master is not someone who cannot distinguish right from wrong. He is grateful you stepped in to slay those men, which is why he let you go."

"Grateful?" Yang Kai shook his head. "I did not see it that way. His letting us go was calculated."

"What calculation?" Zi Mo asked in surprise.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, drew his hand across the back of his hand, and a wound sprang open. Blood welled up, and with deft fingers he pinched something small out of the gash.

"A Seeking-Trace Worm?" Zi Mo's face changed; she stared at Yang Kai, then suddenly reacted, "Did master plant it on you?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai countered, a teasing expression on his face.

Zi Mo was instantly embarrassed. Only her master could have stealthily implanted a Seeking-Trace Worm on Yang Kai, and the quality of the worm was not low — it was plainly cultivated by her master.

"Don't concern yourself. Your master did this partly because he did not intend to kill us — after all, we acted on behalf of your Insect Controlling Branch and he also owes you a life — and partly to leave some trace to appease the anger of the Senluo Palace's palace lord," Yang Kai analyzed, seeming to see through her master's thoughts, and returned the Seeking-Trace Worm into his body.

"You…" Zi Mo was dumbfounded. "Why did you put it back?"

"If I killed it, how would your master explain to the Senluo Palace's palace lord?" Yang Kai smiled. "If I'm not mistaken, this worm can locate my position, yes?"

"Yes. The Seeking-Trace Worm is born in male and female pairs. The one planted on you is the female; with the male, it can find you," Zi Mo nodded gently.

"Then the male should now be in the hands of the Senluo Palace's palace lord."

In a few words Yang Kai had already parsed the situation; Zi Mo looked at him with evident admiration.

"Aren't you afraid?" Zi Mo stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head. "If he dares to come, he will have come only to die."

"Truly arrogant," she muttered.

"Putting that aside, what exactly is going on with your Senluo Palace?" Yang Kai could no longer contain his curiosity.

He had feigned ignorance earlier to avoid entanglement; now that he was involved he naturally wanted to understand the matter.

Zi Mo inhaled lightly and said, "Senluo Palace is the only great power in Tianlang, but within the palace there are five branches. Our Insect Controlling Branch is one of those branches and is the weakest. Every ten years the five branches each put forth one person to contend for the next palace lord's position. The current palace lord is the father of that Xing Bao — Xing Zong. He's a man of some standing, but hungry for power. As his term neared its end he used various means to win over and dominate the other four branches. My master would not compromise and insisted on following the ancestral rules, but he was suppressed and excluded. Since a year ago our Insect Controlling Branch was driven out of Senluo Palace and has been living in that forest."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, gaining some understanding of Senluo Palace's internal situation.

Insect Controlling Branch numbered only around a hundred people. Though they had a Transcendent Realm expert present, against the palace lord's repression and exclusion they could not live in peace and were forced to leave the Sect.

"Even though we left Senluo Palace and distanced ourselves from the whirlpool of disputes, we have not found peace. That Xing Bao comes every now and then with men to cause trouble, pressuring us to submit to his father, but my master has never relented."

"No wonder you said what you did when I first arrived," Yang Kai said, understanding at last.

Zi Mo smiled faintly, "I had no idea it was you who had come. I thought after all these years you might have died somewhere."

She paused, then sighed, "That's the situation."

Yang Kai fell silent, offering little comment. If Zi Mo had been a Han warrior he might have been able to invite her to Zhongdu, but as she belonged to Tianlang he could not speak of such a thing; even if Zi Mo wished to go to Zhongdu, her master would not.

From her master's unwillingness to compromise, it was clear the old man was stubborn; people like that generally would not leave the land that raised them.

Yang Kai did not wish to meddle in another Sect's affairs. But if they brought trouble upon him, he would not be merciful.

Meanwhile, in the thicket thirty li from Senluo Palace.

A burly man of imposing mien, appearing in his forties or fifties, suddenly flew into the air above that place.

His gaze trembled as he looked down at the torn flesh and blood below. His breath became disordered, violent True Yuan burst forth, and he roared, "Liu Yun, come out!"

"Palace Lord, Liu Yun has waited long," Zi Mo's master appeared oddly, greeting him lightly.

"Who killed Xing Bao?" Xing Zong roared. His breath rose and fell erratically; he stood at the edge of explosion, glaring at Liu Yun as if he would kill him if unsatisfied.

"Two Han warriors."

"Han warriors?" Xing Zong flew into fury. "How could Han fighters appear here? Did you collude with someone to harm my son?"

"Palace Lord, you jest. Had I wished to act, Xing Bao would have died countless times over. Out of respect for you I have tolerated his recklessness," Liu Yun snorted coldly, showing not a shred of fear.

Xing Zong's anger abated somewhat, but he would not let the matter drop. "What exactly happened?"

Liu Yun simply related the events, then said, "I did not expect those two to kill on the spot; by the time I tried to stop them it was too late."

"Where are they now?" Xing Zong pressed. "Did you capture them to hand over to me?"

Liu Yun slowly shook his head, "They escaped."

Xing Zong's eyelids narrowed, his aura again turning dangerous. "With you there and they could escape — did you purposely let them go?"

"You could say that. I have no grudge with them; I had no reason to act," Liu Yun replied calmly.

Xing Zong's wrath finally burst forth. His oppressive momentum pressed down as he said icily, "If you do not give me an explanation for today's matter, I will wipe out your Insect Controlling Branch."

Liu Yun laughed coldly. "I only thought that such a grievous vengeance for a son's death should be settled by the Palace Lord personally, which is why I did not usurp the matter."

As he spoke he produced a small insect and said, "Palace Lord should recognize what this insect is, yes?"

"A Seeking-Trace Worm?" Xing Zong's eyes brightened.

"Correct." Liu Yun nodded gently. "The one here in my hand is the male; the female has been implanted in the body of the one who killed Xing Bao. With this male, Palace Lord should be able to easily track their trail."

"Give it to me quickly," Xing Zong reached out without hesitation.

Liu Yun slowly shook his head. "It's not that I refuse to hand over the male, but I have conditions."

"You dare bargain with me?" Xing Zong's anger flared into laughter. "Do you think without the worm I cannot find them? Laughable. As long as they're still in Tianlang, I will find them in a day!"

"If Palace Lord knew where they went, you would not be so confident," Liu Yun retorted with a cold smile.

Xing Zong frowned and asked gravely, "Where did they go?"

"Wasteland!"

Xing Zong's expression changed; he took a deep breath and said, "State your conditions."

Wasteland — even Xing Zong could not promise he would be able to find one or two people within it. The energies there were too chaotic and dangerous; without a clear direction one could easily lose oneself and never emerge.

"Insect Controlling Branch shall return to Senluo Palace, and the ten-year rotation for the palace lord shall be conducted according to ancestral custom! If you do not agree, I will destroy this male right now!"

"You dare!" Xing Zong leapt in fury, shouting.

Liu Yun laughed coldly. His True Yuan ebbed and flowed as he remained unhurried and composed, as if he had Xing Zong well in hand.

After a long moment, Xing Zong finally nodded heavily, "I agree. So long as I can avenge my son, all else will be as you wish."

"I hope Palace Lord will not break his word!" Liu Yun frowned. Though distrustful, he had no other choice and casually tossed the male over.

Xing Zong caught it, snorted coldly, and sped off toward Wasteland.

…………

Two days later, at the outskirts of Wasteland, Yang Kai and his party halted.

Before them lay a lifeless, desolate expanse where even the earth seemed unable to survive. Yang Kai and Shui Ling could not help but click their tongues in wonder.

The aura exuded by this land was exceedingly strange; no wonder it had become a forbidden ground of Tianlang.

"This is the place," Zi Mo said, a hint of fear on her face, unwilling to penetrate further.

"Thank you." Yang Kai nodded lightly. Over the past two days Zi Mo had told him much about Wasteland, giving him some preparation.

"You really intend to go in?" Zi Mo hesitated, looking at Yang Kai uncertain of his purpose in Wasteland.

"Of course."

"Then I'll wait for you to come out." Zi Mo sighed and no longer tried to dissuade them.

"No need." Yang Kai shook his head. "Once we enter, we likely will not meet again; we will not come back. You should return to Senluo Palace."

Zi Mo froze, astonished.

"Go back and tell your master: if he dares scheme against me again, even as your master, I will kill him!" Yang Kai grinned wickedly, laughter full of malice, then led Shui Ling as they stepped into Wasteland.

Zi Mo stood dazed for a long moment before calling out, "Yang Kai, be careful — don't die."

Yang Kai did not look back, only raised his hand in a small wave.

Soon their figures vanished from Zi Mo's sight.

Without reason, Zi Mo felt a sudden pang of regret.

In truth their acquaintance had not been deep. Having spent some time together in that other place, Yang Kai's conduct had altered her view of him; this meeting left her even more impressed.

Unwittingly, she found that the bastard possessed cultivation at the Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage. Perhaps having never seen a man quite so exceptional, Zi Mo felt some lament as Yang Kai left.
