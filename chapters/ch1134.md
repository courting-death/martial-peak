## Chapter 1134 — Too Simple!

As soon as the Yang Yan's formation opened, Yang Kai knew the Xu Family was finished.

The swirling mist enveloped an area a thousand zhang in radius; though his sight was somewhat obscured and even his Divine Sense probing into it felt as if wading through a marsh, he could at least still make out the figures of the Xu Family.

Yet the dozen or so Saint King Third Stage cultivators of the Xu Family all wore looks of panic and confusion. Though Yang Kai stood clearly not far from them, they seemed not to see him at all, glancing around warily in fear. A few even stumbled about like headless flies—and soon, they had unknowingly wandered right up beside Yang Kai.

“Yang Kai, the formation in its current state doesn’t have the power to kill. If you want to slay them, you’ll have to do it yourself,” Yang Yan’s voice suddenly sounded in his ear. Yang Kai grinned: “Understood.”

No sooner had the words fallen than a pitch-black cloud of fire howled out, roaring like a furious flame-dragon and sweeping toward the nearest Xu Family elder.

That Xu Family elder was still in a dazed state—though highly alert, he didn’t realize what was happening until the fire-cloud reached his face. He then erupted with power and struck fiercely at the cloud.

But when his Saint Yuan poured into the fire-cloud it did not dampen the blaze one bit; on the contrary, it seemed to pour oil on the flames, and the already violent fire grew even more ferocious, devouring him like an ancient leviathan.

“Black fire…” the Xu Family elder screamed in terror as he died.

From the mouths of the few fighters who had escaped back to the Xu Family, he learned that Xu Zhishen had been burned to death by that jet-black flame, and that even the Hundred Mountains Painting could not withstand its power.

His own strength did not match Xu Zhishen’s, nor did he possess a mighty Secret Treasure like the Hundred Mountains Painting—how could he possibly stop it?

In the next moment the Xu Family elder became nothing but a charred husk; the Saint King-Grade Middle-Level armor he wore provided him no protection at all.

“Fifth Elder, what happened?” A middle-aged man three zhang away from that elder roared. He had clearly heard the Fifth Elder cry out, but when he called back there was no response.

A suffocating unease rose in his chest. Turning, he suddenly saw a youth standing behind him, sneering. The smile was full of scorn and contempt.

“It’s you!” He recognized Yang Kai at a glance without thinking. He immediately invoked his long-whip Secret Treasure, unleashing countless whip-phantoms that swept toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai strolled back a leisurely step. To the other man’s horror, in that tiny motion Yang Kai vanished from sight; the myriad whip-phantoms whipped through empty air as if the other had never been there.

With a full-force strike that hit nothing, the middle-aged man felt his chest’s Qi and blood surge and a bitter, metallic taste flood his mouth—he knew something was wrong. His own attack had backfired. Before he could steady his mind he felt a large hand clamp his throat, hot power surging from it. A single thought of horror rose in his heart and his body burst into flame; he managed one pitiful shriek before perishing.

Yang Kai abandoned the corpse and turned to stare at another Xu Family expert not far away, then walked over with the air of a man taking a leisurely stroll.

A few breaths later a scream rang out once more.

Simple. Far too simple!

Although Yang Kai knew that with his current strength he could defeat a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm in a straight fight, it shouldn’t be this easy. Those trapped within the formation seemed unable to see him; he only needed to walk among them and harvest their lives.

This is the power of a formation? The formations of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land back then were rubbish compared to this.

What on earth is Yang Yan’s background? She is so young—how can she be both an Origin-Grade artificer and a formation master?

Others always marvel at Yang Kai’s deeds, but this time it was Yang Kai who was stunned by Yang Yan. According to her, this was only a defensive formation and not even fully deployed—if it were completed, then he wouldn’t need to lift a finger; every Xu Family member caught within it would surely die.

This little lass is extraordinary; aside from being a bit timid and inexperienced in battle, her abilities are utterly outrageous.

Yang Yan must have a story, but Yang Kai wouldn’t pry. When she felt like telling it she would.

Within the formation that spanned a thousand zhang, the anguished screams of the Xu Family experts rang out one after another—each cry marking another death. Yang Kai walked slowly through the mist-shrouded array; wherever he passed, the fog that obscured sight and blocked Divine Sense would part on its own, guiding him toward his next target.

Yang Kai knew that Yang Yan was aiding him.

Xu Family head Xu Zhikun no longer wore his previous arrogance and contempt. His face was deathly pale as he brandished a long staff and struck around like a madman. Five Xu Family experts clustered tightly around him, never leaving his side.

But no matter how they struck, the mist clung and would not disperse, continuously enveloping them.

Though the mist did no direct harm, the Xu Family members felt like frightened rabbits; every nearby scream set their nerves on edge and filled them with dread.

At first they could still hear the calls and shouts of many of their own experts attacking here and there.

But as time passed those sounds dwindled and then ceased altogether.

An elder following Xu Zhikun kept calling one Xu Family name after another, yet there was no reply.

“They’re all dead… they’re all dead…” the man murmured, his face ghastly white.

The six who remained could no longer contain their terror; coldness spread through their bodies.

Death is not the worst—what terrifies them is the feeling of waiting to die! Ten-odd Third Stage Saint King Realm experts—these were the Xu Family’s backbone, their strongest—but now more than half of them lay dead.

The few still alive didn’t even know the enemy’s methods.

“I’m not staying here, I’m leaving!” One of the Xu Family experts, unable to bear the torment any longer, swung his cleaver and slashed out razor-sharp blade-qi, then broke into a run toward the exit.

“Guest Elder Liu, you cannot leave!” Xu Zhikun roared, reaching to grab at Liu’s back, but his hand grasped nothing—Liu’s figure vanished from before his eyes in an instant.

Xu Zhikun’s face turned as dark as water; he knew Liu was likely doomed.

Before the thought finished, Liu’s scream came from not far away—brief and frantic, clearly killed with a single blow.

A rage and helplessness welled up in Xu Zhikun’s eyes. Inside this formation his strength could not be fully exerted. If someone like his Third Brother fell in combat, he could accept it—no one can blame being outmatched—but such a humiliating, cowardly death was not what he wanted to see.

Another Xu Family expert tried to rush out with Liu, but though only half a tea cup’s time had passed since they entered, it felt like an eternity; he had endured this eerie place long enough.

Yet when he heard Liu’s scream he rejoiced inwardly that he had hesitated earlier—otherwise he would have shared Liu’s fate.

“Do not leave my side!” Xu Zhikun, as head of the family, was shrewder. After the initial panic he realized something: “This formation probably only traps us; it doesn’t kill. So we must not be separated. If anyone falls behind they will meet death. Follow me and we’ll force our way out together—I refuse to believe this formation can hold me forever!”

The men brightened at once and nodded together, sticking close behind Xu Zhikun and refusing to leave him.

The five remaining Xu Family members fought left and right within the formation. The dozen or so Haike Family spectators watched, drenched in sweat, faces ashen.

Just earlier they had still been scheming to take advantage if Yang Kai proved unable to resist, to ride in and reap rewards—who would have thought that in less than half a tea cup’s time the situation would reverse so drastically?

Although they couldn’t see into the mist, the screams allowed them to infer what was happening.

The Xu Family is finished!

Ten-odd Third Stage Saint King Realm experts—the family’s pillars—now perhaps only four or five remained alive, and even those few might not escape with their lives.

The Haike Family’s strength is similar to the Xu Family’s. If this strange formation can deal with the Xu Family, then should any of the Haike Family fall into it they would face the same hopeless fate.

Ba Qingyan pulled a handkerchief from who knows where and kept wiping the sweat from his forehead. The cloth was already soaked through, yet he didn’t even realize it—each time he wiped, fresh beads of sweat rolled down to replace the old.

Warren, Huang Juan, and the other Guest Elders looked no better; each one trembled uncontrollably.

They could scarcely believe that the Dragon Lair Mountain of their own family—this mere thousand-zhang area—had become a grave for the Xu Family’s experts. Xu Zhishen was first slain here, and now a dozen Xu Family Third Stage Saint King Realm warriors were falling one after another. The Xu Family is truly finished.

Ian’s face also went deathly pale; he inwardly thanked his prudence for not immediately agreeing to ally with the Xu Family when they first proposed it. Had he led the Haike Family’s experts in to outnumber them, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

How laughable that he had been scheming to extract every advantage from the conflict—turns out the Xu Family needed no help to be annihilated. Does the Haike Family stand to gain from that?

Yet that formation made Ian envious!

Whoever set up that formation—if they could arrange one for the Haike Family, wouldn’t the family’s defenses be impregnable?

“Family Head…” Warren’s voice trembled, “what should we do now?”

“Wait and see, wait and see…” Ian stammered. After all, the Haike Family had not personally provoked them, and with Wu Yi and Yu Feng and dozens of their disciples over there, he did not think the other party would come seek trouble. So staying and watching was fine; he wanted to see whether anyone from the Xu Family would escape or if it truly would be total annihilation.
