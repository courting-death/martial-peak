## Chapter 1069 — Can You Keep It Down?

In the Alchemy Room, Yang Kai's hands moved without pause, tracing one spirit formation after another and sending them continuously into the pill furnace.

While inscribing the spirit formations, his Divine Sense strength waxed and waned, controlling the heat without the slightest error.

Watching from the side, Zong Ao was dazzled and enthralled, shouting and exclaiming, no longer able to maintain a calm expression; he even threw caution to the wind and darted to Yang Kai's side, eyes wide as he watched him inscribe the spirit formations.

Zong Ao recognized all of these spirit formations; a few of the diagrams were even his own original creations. Clearly this brat Yang Kai had stolen his alchemy techniques and was now putting them to use.

Yet these ordinary, commonplace spirit formations underwent some gratifying changes after being driven into the furnace, causing the medicinal liquid inside to churn and condense as pill fragrance gradually diffused.

Zong Ao wore a pensive look, faintly feeling as though a barrier before him had split open a crack. He wanted to see more clearly, yet no matter what he did he could not tear that crack any wider, and for a time he was so anxious he stamped his feet.

He was an Alchemy Master; in alchemical skill and method, Yang Kai was far from his match.

But watching Yang Kai refine like this still made his eyes light up. Sometimes, an unintentional motion by another can bring someone unexpected gains, plunging that person into a state of Enlightenment.

Thus, as the times advance, alchemy advances. As the long river of years flows on, countless alchemists have thrown themselves forward, opening many schools along the alchemical path and creating many spirit formations used for alchemy.

As strong as Zong Ao was, he did not dare claim he had mastered all alchemical techniques; he only groped bitterly along his own road, seeking to pursue his own goal.

He had refined pills in solitude for a hundred years, and his thinking had ossified; Yang Kai's movements set his mind flowing again. In an instant he thought of many, many things even Yang Kai could not touch upon.

"Keep refining—why did you stop?" Just as his emotions surged and he felt some insights, Zong Ao discovered that Yang Kai had actually stopped his hands, and he asked in puzzlement.

"Senior Zong, can you keep it down? Carrying on like that... I can't refine." Yang Kai frowned at him.

Zong Ao's old face flushed, yet he had no way to refute it and, sullen, he fell silent.

Only then did he notice that from the furnace before Yang Kai, a burnt smell was now issuing forth. The medicinal liquid that had been rolling within had all turned into useless muck—clearly the refinement had failed and fine ingredients had been wasted.

"The first time—it's only natural to be a bit rusty." To cover the embarrassment of having disturbed Yang Kai's refining, Zong Ao actually took the initiative to offer comfort, waving his hand: "Enough. This old man will go sit over there and guarantees he won't shout again. You continue refining!"

With that, he walked back, sat straight in his own chair, and withdrew all aura.

If one didn't look for him, Yang Kai couldn't even sense his existence; Zong Ao's realm and cultivation were far from something Yang Kai could compare to.

Yang Kai shook his head. Through these days of contact, he also knew that although Zong Ao's temper was a bit eccentric, he was utterly obsessed with the Dao of Alchemy. Anything to do with alchemy could stir tremendous interest in him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have refined pills here in dull solitude for a hundred years and still found joy in it.

So long as he refined one or two pills bearing Pill Patterns, he would become incomparably excited.

Such people seemed unfeeling and extremely cold, but in truth they were not hard to deal with; as long as you catered to their preferences, they were easier to get close to than anyone.

Yang Kai had encountered many such people, so dealing with them came with practiced ease.

He wasn't afraid that Zong Ao would steal his alchemy techniques, because before Zong Ao, there was no guarding against it anyway.

He simply refined openly and magnanimously, ignoring the other's observation; how much he could see would be up to him.

What Yang Kai cared about even more, however, was the Profound Yin Moon Water in his hand!

After cleaning out the dregs in the furnace, Yang Kai once again began refining the Leaving Flame Pill.

The earlier failure wasn't because of Zong Ao's disturbance; even if he shouted louder, he couldn't affect Yang Kai. Back in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, every time Yang Kai refined pills there were several people at his side observing and commenting, their chatter unending; they would even raise questions, making him resolve their doubts while refining. He had long since gotten used to it.

This was, after all, his first time refining the Leaving Flame Pill, and his control over heat and timing wasn't yet so practiced; failure was only natural.

On the second refinement, Yang Kai was much more familiar; although he still failed in the end, it did nothing to dampen his enthusiasm.

The third time, he fell short right at the last moment, yet Yang Kai's expression grew ever more confident; he felt he had already grasped the Leaving Flame Pill's changes in heat and control of timing.

The fourth time, pill fragrance wafted from within the furnace, and a Leaving Flame Pill was successfully produced.

He put it into the prepared jade bottle, but before he could examine it, Zong Ao snatched it away. After only a glance, Zong Ao tossed the jade bottle back and snorted, "Mediocre. Refining a pill in four tries—you're already doing quite well, brat. But you can't even refine Pill Patterns, so how can you talk about the higher Pill Cloud?"

"What are you so anxious for? This is only the beginning." Yang Kai smiled and ignored him, not pausing as he continued refining.

The disdain on Zong Ao's face gradually withdrew and turned solemn, a wry groan rising in his heart.

So it really is the Divine Sense Fire—when refining pills, the speed is simply terrifying.

Even if he himself took action, refining one Leaving Flame Pill would take the time of one stick of incense, yet this brat's first successful refinement had only taken one shichen.

This span seemed long and simply couldn't compare to himself, yet Zong Ao knew better than anyone that this was the brat's first successful Leaving Flame Pill. Once he mastered all the techniques and grew more and more practiced, the time needed to form a pill would grow shorter and shorter, until it might end up on par with his own.

In realm and cultivation, in alchemist rank, and in the length of time steeped in the alchemical path, he surpassed this brat in every way, yet in the end the time needed to refine an identical pill would be almost the same.

What did that imply?

Zong Ao felt both envy and jealousy toward that Divine Sense Fire, and he wished he could seize it for his own, but once he recalled the bitterness he had tasted back then, he could only endure and give up.

The days slipped by one after another.

Every day, Yang Kai refined ten Leaving Flame Pills—no more, no less. After finishing the ten, he immediately sat cross-legged, recovering the Divine Sense he had consumed while also reflecting upon himself, enhancing his understanding of alchemy by reviewing the day's refining process.

At such times, Zong Ao also refrained from disturbing him, his gaze deep and distant as he revealed a look of contemplation.

During this period he hadn't lifted a hand to refine at all; each day he watched Yang Kai repeat the process of refining the same pill, again and again, in endless cycles, as if there were no end.

He not only didn't find it dull; he watched with relish.

The frequent switching of spirit formations made him seem to glimpse another avenue of alchemy. He had never before considered changing out more than a dozen sets of composite spirit formations while refining a single pill.

Yang Kai's fanciful ideas and unrestrained movements gave him the thrill of the clouds parting to reveal the bright moon, and his ossified thinking gradually came alive.

He was, after all, a generation's Alchemy Master. When he sank into contemplation, what he pondered was far more and far deeper than Yang Kai's; he faintly felt that the barrier that had bound him for many years showed signs of being broken.

This discovery set all the blood in Zong Ao's body to boiling.

A month passed, and Yang Kai refined as many as three hundred Leaving Flame Pills. Each time a pill formed, Zong Ao would snatch it to take a look. What puzzled him was that all three hundred Leaving Flame Pills Yang Kai refined were ordinary pills.

Given how grand Yang Kai's tone had been earlier, he had thought the brat possessed some extraordinary ability; at the very least he ought to occasionally refine a few Leaving Flame Pills bearing Pill Patterns.

Yet among these three hundred pills, not a single one with Pill Patterns existed.

He couldn't help but feel a little disappointed and doubtful; at last he couldn't restrain himself and asked, "Brat, you can't even refine Pill Patterns? If you intend to rely on luck to birth a Pill Cloud, this old man advises you to give up that idea. This old man has refined pills his whole life—if the pills I personally produced aren't a million, they number in the hundreds of thousands—yet only a scant few ever birthed a Pill Cloud, and their grade wasn't high. You think you can get a Pill Cloud with just two thousand portions of materials? You're daydreaming!"

"I'm not planning to rely on luck." Yang Kai smiled. "These three hundred pills were merely my familiarization process."

"Familiarization process?" Zong Ao looked at him suspiciously.

"At the very least, I now know how to use the fastest speed and the best spirit formations to refine the Leaving Flame Pill. What's next is the main act."

Zong Ao frowned, not knowing what trick he was playing.

Over this month, his speed in refining the Leaving Flame Pill had indeed grown faster and faster; at the beginning a single pill took one shichen, and now it didn't even take half a shichen—the speed had doubled. Zong Ao believed that if he continued refining, this time would still shorten until it reached a level that would astonish people.

What shocked Zong Ao most was not his speed, but his pill-forming success rate.

After the first three pills were refined into failure, it was as if he suddenly opened up; from then on, none of the pills he refined failed. Every batch formed pills, and not a single portion of materials was wasted.

Zong Ao practically judged Yang Kai to be a man of the heavens!

Even he himself could not avoid some sudden mishaps when refining, leading to failure and burnt medicinal liquid—this was something no alchemist could avoid.

Yet such common occurrences had never happened with Yang Kai. Portion after portion of ingredients all turned into pills. Although, due to heat and timing, the quality of those pills differed slightly, as time passed the quality of the Leaving Flame Pills he refined grew better and better, almost bringing out every bit of the medicines' efficacy without the slightest loss.

Is this the truly terrifying aspect of the Divine Sense Fire? Zong Ao felt somewhat dazed.
