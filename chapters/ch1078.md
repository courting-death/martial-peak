## Chapter 1078 — I Am a Man of Principle

Just as a few guards, their faces full of genial smiles, were blocking Yang Kai and asking him to show some understanding for the brothers’ duties, Xue Yue’s clear voice came from inside.

"Let him in!"

The guards sighed in relief as if pardoned from a dream, stepping aside one after another; before leaving they even spared him encouraging looks.

Yang Kai could not be bothered to pay them any mind; wearing a cold face, he pushed open the door and strode inside.

The room had not changed; it was the same as before. Xue Yue, however, looked considerably more troubled, and in her beautiful eyes there was even a hint of resentment. She did not flinch from Yang Kai’s furious gaze; she simply looked at him with a smile and said, "Sit and talk."

Seeing her like that, Yang Kai had a bellyful of anger with nowhere to vent.

Women are so infuriating!

She was clearly far stronger than him—far enough that in a fight he would be no match; she could pinch, knead, and toy with him as she pleased, and yet at this moment she could create an air of vulnerability with nothing more than a single expression.

As if she had suffered an immense grievance...

Yang Kai picked up the teapot on the table and poured himself a cup, taking a light sip. Before he could open his mouth to speak, one of Xue Yue’s slender jade fingers was pressed against his lips.

Her fingers were cool, and a faint, delicate fragrance emanated from their tips.

"Don’t speak yet, I’ll show you something," Xue Yue said, her red lips parting, her tone softer than it had ever been.

"What?" Yang Kai was on guard, scanning her up and down. "If it’s your body, forget it. I’ve memorized every part of you—it’s all imprinted in my mind; I could recall it with my eyes closed."

"You can’t expect ivory from a dog’s mouth!" Xue Yue, both ashamed and angry, snapped. "Do you think I’m the kind of woman who’d sell her body just to keep you here?"

"Then what do you want me to see?" Yang Kai relaxed considerably when he heard that.

Xue Yue gave him a sidelong look and handed over a document-like thing.

Yang Kai took it with a suspicious look, sipping his tea as he read it carefully.

A moment later, his expression turned strange, and he let out a dry chuckle. “Xue Yue, the terms you’re offering are a bit too generous, aren’t they? Acting as your guard for a yearly payment of a hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals—and a five-hundred-li territory on top of that?”

"Yes, my guards enjoy such benefits; only the specifics differ for each person," Xue Yue said calmly, lifting the teacup before her and taking a gentle sip, appearing composed. But the faint tremble of her little finger betrayed her inner anxiety.

If before she had felt affection for Yang Kai—perhaps even tolerating his closeness because of the Soul Chain—now she could be certain that that fondness would have taken root deep within her spirit even without the Soul Chain.

When habit becomes nature, it is hard to change.

What’s more, her Sea of Consciousness had already been invaded by him—all her secrets laid bare. It was even more humiliating than standing naked before him, exposed to his gaze.

Xue Yue sincerely hoped Yang Kai would stay, even though she knew he was itching to leave her immediately.

Pretending to sip her tea, she furtively watched Yang Kai’s reactions, wanting to see which clause of the contract might catch his eye.

When disappointed, Yang Kai showed no trace of being moved; he merely clicked his tongue and commented on the various terms on the document.

"I’m to have twenty beautiful maidservants?" Yang Kai glanced up at Xue Yue. "I’m a guard, am I not? Guards can have maidservants?"

"What’s so strange? Ordinary people’s guards are naturally servants; they’re not entitled to these things. Is my Xue Yue’s guard not entitled?" Xue Yue smiled lightly, seeing a spark of longing in Yang Kai’s eyes, she hurriedly embellished her words. "I can personally select the finest girls for you. You might not know it, but the Hengluo Commerce Guild also trades in slaves. Many fallen or annihilated noble families’ daughters become commodities kept in the Guild; they are well educated and possess good aptitude and strength. As far as I know, the strongest among them has already reached the Saint King Realm. If you want a refined lady, you’ll get a refined lady; if you want a delicate maiden, you’ll get that too!"

As she sweetened her words, describing all sorts of enticing benefits, she was secretly cursing him as a shameless pervert. She had offered such generous terms, yet he’d shown no interest—only fixating on that one condition. Xue Yue was so furious she wished she could strangle him with her bare hands.

But men are like that...

Xue Yue sighed inwardly with helplessness.

"This is good, this is good!" Yang Kai nodded vigorously; he had long desired those maidservants. Back on the Tongxuan Continent there were too many acquaintances to act recklessly; now, in the vast Star Domain, he could do as he pleased.

Since he had gotten intimate with his Little Senior Sister, Yang Kai had become somewhat indulgent in matters of men and women; he no longer rejected flirtations with unfamiliar women.

The last time in Shen Tu’s palace he had indulged himself and still savored the memory.

"You think it’s good too?" Xue Yue continued to smile, biting the inside of her lip. She spoke softly, "If you think it’s good, press the hand seal. Press it and you’ll be mine—under my protection from then on. If anyone bullies you, just speak my name and you’ll be able to stride across the Star Domain however you want—even sideways."

"I’m not a crab to walk sideways," Yang Kai chuckled as he put the document back on the table.

Xue Yue stared at him, her beautiful eyes unwavering.

Yang Kai sighed, reluctant to meet her gaze, and said, "Why bother? You know what I really want; what does it mean to hand me a contract?"

"Who said it’s a contract of servitude?" Xue Yue’s brows rose. "Doesn’t it say five years per term? After five years, if you’re not satisfied we can negotiate again. I only want to give you more time to think."

"If I sign, I’ll be stuck for life. Xue Yue, let us break the Soul Chain. From now on you go your way and I’ll go mine—mind your own business and don’t trespass in mine," Yang Kai said earnestly.

Hearing that ruthless resolve, Xue Yue’s eyes brimmed with tears; she clenched her jaw and forced them back, lifting her head slightly.

Remarkably, those tears soon vanished entirely, as if they had withdrawn back into her tear ducts.

Gritting her teeth, she snapped, "I don’t care. You’ve touched me, you’ve seen me, you’ve probed deep into my Sea of Consciousness and uncovered all my secrets—you must sign, or I come off badly!"

"There are only two secrets of yours; don’t worry, I’ll keep them. I’m not going to gamble my life, and I know how powerful you are," Yang Kai said with a sincere face.

Xue Yue grew even more aggrieved. "So you really know that secret as well."

Yang Kai scratched his cheek and said innocently, "I didn’t mean to know it—who would have thought that besides being a woman you hide such a massive secret! No wonder Chairman Ai Ou kept raising you as a man; he did it for your good. Don’t blame him."

"For my good?" A cold light flashed in Xue Yue’s eyes and she said in a frigid tone, "I haven’t seen my mother in decades. They say that to keep this secret, my father killed everyone who knew, including my mother. Is that also for my good?"

Yang Kai did not know what to say.

What Xue Yue said he had indeed glimpsed in her Sea of Consciousness—this was family business, and it was not convenient to comment; whether her mother was truly dead no one could say, and Xue Yue could only repeat hearsay.

"So what if I have the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body? Does everyone in the world have the right to see through my constitution and snatch me away?" Xue Yue cried out in anger, her ample chest heaving in a soul-stirring curve.

"Keep your voice down!" Yang Kai snapped in alarm. "Do you want to live? Must you shout about such things?"

Seeing Yang Kai’s nervousness, Xue Yue felt a little pleased; the previous anger evaporated and she smiled. "You know the secret now—why aren’t you tempted? You should understand what benefits a Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body can bring."

"Of course I know," Yang Kai said, glancing at her. "According to that old man who examined your constitution, any man who takes your yuan yin will gain unimaginable benefits. Your Commerce Guild’s moon slave trade was inspired by your constitution, wasn’t it?"

Xue Yue nodded softly. "Yes! You could say I’m the most outstanding Moon Slave in the Guild; it’s simply unknown to others. When I was unconscious, you had ample opportunity—I can’t believe you weren’t tempted. You aren’t that saintly."

Her face wore an expression that said, I’ve seen right through your heart.

"Yes, I’m tempted—deadly tempted!" Yang Kai nodded vigorously. "When I learned your secret, I wanted nothing more than to tear off your clothes and possess you then and there."

"Then why didn’t you?" Xue Yue’s interest was piqued. "You know, even if you had, I wouldn’t have blamed you—at most I’d have given you a beating."

She spoke as if mentioning a stranger’s virtue rather than her own chastity.

Yang Kai felt a headache coming on and thought for a moment before saying, "I’m a man of principle!"

Xue Yue pursed her lips in obvious disbelief, thinking Yang Kai was full of empty talk.

"According to that old fellow who detected your constitution, the higher your strength, the greater the benefit one can gain from possessing you. You’re at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm now; if I really took advantage, I might leap directly to the First Stage of the Saint King Realm!" Yang Kai said lightly, "But so what? I can reach that threshold without using your body; believe me, I can do it within three years."

Xue Yue stared at Yang Kai in a daze, listening to his bold words; her eyes clouded over and she kept nodding. She casually asked, "What if I weren’t at the Saint King Realm but at the Void King Realm?"

Yang Kai sized her up without a second thought. "Then you’d already be mine."

The dreamy look in Xue Yue’s eyes vanished in an instant, replaced by endless contempt. She sneered, her tone dripping with sarcasm, "In the end it’s still about insufficient benefit! You think the gain is too small."

"Yes!" Yang Kai admitted frankly.

“And what happened to those lofty principles you were preaching just now?” Xue Yue sneered, the contempt in her eyes growing deeper.

“How much are those worth? Can you sell them by the pound?” Yang Kai scoffed.
