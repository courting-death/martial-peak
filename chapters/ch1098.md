## Chapter 1098 — Dark Star

Seeing Wu Yi sitting there with a stern face, waiting for him to ask, Yang Kai sighed and, half unwillingly, said, "Who provoked you?"

"Those stinking men! How can they all be so dim-witted, and yet have the gall to take credit for themselves — Yang Kai, is it like this outside as well?"

Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, "I can't speak for others, but I know men grow very foolish in one particular situation."

"What circumstance?"

"When facing the woman they fancy, they often play the fool to attract her attention."

Wu Yi thought for a moment, then suddenly giggled and nodded. “You’re right. They’re not usually foolish—normally they’re sharper than most. But every time I show up, it’s like they’re trying to show just how dumb they can be.”

"If they didn't act like that, how would your cleverness be made apparent?"

"Are you saying I'm actually dumb, and only seem smart because of their help?" Wu Yi was instantly displeased.

"Not what I mean, you're overthinking it. If you weren't capable, no one would dare let you command this warship, and those men wouldn't entrust their lives to your hands."

"That's more like it." Wu Yi hummed, pleased with Yang Kai's answer, then suddenly said, "Do you know during that fight outside just now I thought we were done for? I've never run into such a huge pack of Black Rock Beasts. If they'd torn the warship apart, less than third of us would have survived. Then out of nowhere a golden spear appeared and solved the crisis. Yang Kai, what kind of person do you think could be the owner of that golden light? You were watching too — didn't you notice anyone suspicious?"

"No." Yang Kai shook his head.

Wu Yi stared at him intently, half casual, half not: "If that person is willing to reveal themselves, I'll thank them properly."

Yang Kai sat upright, as if in meditation like an old monk, expression indifferent.

After a while Wu Yi sighed, "In another month we'll return to Dark Star. Rest well — I see you still haven't fully recovered; did you injure your foundation? I'll have someone bring you some Pills and Saint Crystals later."

Yang Kai nodded and made no objection.

Not long after Wu Yi left, a martial artist brought ten Upper-Level Saint Crystals and several Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pills, saying Miss had sent them for Yang Kai so he could recuperate before returning to Dark Star.

Yang Kai thanked him and took them.

Looking at the ten Saint Crystals and the Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pills that had seemed inconsequential before, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel moved.

The last time Wu Yi had taken five hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals from him, but as Yang Kai knew, she hadn't hoarded them; she had taken them out and distributed all the Saint Crystals to her subordinates.

Although each person's share was small, everyone was delighted.

Yang Kai immediately understood that these people's lives were not actually prosperous.

That Wu Yi sent ten Saint Crystals now shows her kindness.

Living a plain life, Yang Kai stayed in his room to recover, storing his Saint Yuan and occasionally stepping out for a walk. The small warship showed its age and low status, yet Wu Yi's followers maintained it well; the floors were spotless and the windows wiped daily. Their care for the ship exceeded even their concern for their own lives.

Yang Kai was not one of Wu Yi's people, so he could not go to confidential places like the engine room, but aside from those areas he could move freely. The warriors gradually grew accustomed to this outsider; the curious asked about the outside world, and everyone mingled happily.

As time passed, the warship drew ever closer to Dark Star, and the moods of the dozens aboard rose inexplicably high.

They had risked life and limb to mine on the ore star and endured countless hardships; now that they were about to return laden, of course they were overjoyed.

Even Wu Yi was caught up in the celebratory mood and had not come by Yang Kai's place in recent days.

At last the vast Dark Star revealed itself to all, and shouts rang out through the warship.

Yang Kai, startled from his meditation, went outside and peered through the corridor window.

Before his eyes rose an unimaginably colossal star; Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly: "So big?"

Dark Star's scale was almost beyond belief. Yang Kai had roamed the Star Domain for years and seen many cultivation stars, but none matched Dark Star's grandeur. It was more than ten times larger than the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Shuiyue Star — like a titanic beast stretched across the Starry Sky.

Far off stood an even larger sun that cast scorching light over Dark Star.

Around Dark Star seven or eight moon-stars revolved constantly; each moon-star was the size of a Rainfall Star.

"I've heard Dark Star is the largest cultivation star in the Star Domain — is that true?" Wu Yi, who had come to stand beside Yang Kai, asked delightedly at his astonished face.

No matter how much she yearned to leave Dark Star and broaden her horizons, this cultivation star was after all her homeland, and she felt proud of its immensity.

"I don't know if it's true, but it's probably hard to find another cultivation star to rival Dark Star," Yang Kai answered solemnly.

"Actually Dark Star's Spiritual Qi isn't poor — it's just so vast that compared with other cultivation stars it seems thin," Wu Yi said softly. "And I heard that long ago there used to be many cultivation stars in this region, back when contact with the outside hadn't been severed. But something happened in this stretch of the Starry Sky and the smaller cultivation stars vanished, leaving only the largest, Dark Star. The dangers along the star routes, the shortage of supplies, especially the lack of Saint Crystals, prevent us from regaining past glory; our communications with the outside were cut off — unless outsiders come here, those on Dark Star seldom go out."

She chattered on, and Yang Kai did not interrupt but listened quietly.

Wu Yi suddenly shifted tone, her face full of confident smile: "My wish is to reopen Dark Star's connection with the outside, so our people can go whenever they like and never worry about lacking Saint Crystals."

Yang Kai turned to look at her and gave a thumbs-up.

People with ideals deserve respect. Compared to Wu Yi, he felt he had no lofty plans and only wanted to grow stronger.

"My family isn't powerful; I can't get them to support this. Yang Kai, help me."

Yang Kai, still approving, paused and smiled wryly: "The last sentence is your real intention, isn't it?"

Wu Yi stuck out her rosy tongue, as if conceding the point.

Yang Kai couldn't help but laugh silently, thinking no wonder she seemed sentimental — she had designs on him. After a moment he shook his head, "I'm only a martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm — what can I do to help?"

"I don't know what you can do, but at least you're from outside. You know the outside world and which forces we might cooperate with — that's what I lack. I need someone like you; your slightly lower strength doesn't matter." She looked at him sincerely.

Yang Kai frowned. He had a good impression of this woman — outwardly gentle but inwardly strong, with convictions — yet he didn't want to meddle. To Dark Star he was only a passerby who might leave soon.

Rashly agreeing would be irresponsible, but seeing the clarity in her eyes he couldn't bear to dampen her hopes.

After some thought he said, "You mentioned before your family is attached to a force called Yingyue Hall on the periphery, right?"

"Yes. Yingyue Hall is one of the largest forces on Dark Star; our Haike Family is attached to Yingyue Hall. There are many families like ours on Dark Star — without attaching to a major force one cannot survive."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded lightly. Such arrangements were common on Tongxuan Continent; the Haike Family was probably an outer family of low standing and not very strong.

"Which member of your family is the strongest?" Yang Kai asked.

Though she didn't understand his motive, Wu Yi pointed to the side: "Elder Chang Qi counts as one of the strongest."

Yang Kai was stunned: "Not even someone at the Origin Returning Realm?"

Wu Yi gave him a look: "Do you think there are many at the Origin Returning Realm? Will you help me or not?"

Yang Kai smiled bitterly: "Your wish seems distant. To realize such an ideal you'd need experts; become your family's Family Head first, and then I'll consider it."

Wu Yi trembled with fury at his seeming perfunctory response — she had invited him sincerely and was outraged by his brush-off, so furious she bit her teeth as if wanting to tear a piece of flesh from him.

"Very well. When you truly preside over your family, if you still hold such ambitions, I'll help you!" Yang Kai said, eyes burning.

"It's a promise!" Wu Yi immediately smiled and extended a fair hand toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai could only shake his head helplessly before lightly clapping her hand three times — sealing their agreement.

"Just wait — in two or three years I'll become a leading figure in my clan," Wu Yi declared confidently.

Seeing her like this, Yang Kai couldn't bring himself to tell her that once she became a clan leader and viewed matters from that height, her thoughts would differ from now.

Now she pursued her dream fearlessly, but later she would have to consider the entire family's livelihood and the constraints would tighten her wings.

Time will blunt a person's sharpness and turn hot-blooded youth into worldly cunning.
