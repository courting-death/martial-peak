## Chapter 2523 — Irreconcilable Hatred

"Forty-sixty, absolutely no more," Ju Tianqing said coldly. "Although after this is done, I, Ju, have a great chance of advancing to the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, with so many Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines here, Brother Zu, your breakthrough is just around the corner as well. With this split, you’re definitely not losing out!"

Zu Hong pondered for a moment, a trace of resolve flashing in his eyes, then nodded: "Fine, as Brother Ju says."

Forty-sixty—if you really calculated it, Ju Tianqing was definitely getting the better end. But after all, he was an elder of the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. If he could advance to the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm this time, his strength would soar. Giving him some face now would make things easier in the future.

On the other side, Gao Xueting couldn’t help but tremble with anger as she listened to the two of them dividing the spoils right in front of her, even including her in their calculations. But she had no power to protect herself now, so even if she was furious, there was nothing she could do.

"Forty-sixty? That seems a bit off."

A sudden voice rang out. Both Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing shuddered violently, their eyes wide with shock as they looked toward the source. Zu Hong, who was still healing, even stood up at once. The Imperial Treasure, Myriad Beasts Seal, at his side flashed with a dangerous light.

This place was a small world, hidden in a crevice of the void. If not for the two halves of a beast hide opening the barrier, it would be impossible for anyone to enter. They had only managed to come in because they activated the restriction on those two pieces of beast hide.

But now, there was suddenly one more person here.

Even though Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing were Emperor Realm experts, at this moment, they couldn’t help but feel their scalps tingle.

Could it be a ghost? The thought flashed through both their minds.

Meanwhile, on the other side, the previously despairing Gao Xueting suddenly shuddered, a strange light blooming in her gray eyes as she strained to look to the side.

No one knew when it happened, but a young man had appeared as a ghost a dozen zhang away, a smiling expression on his face. If he hadn’t spoken up, none of the three would have noticed him at all.

"Who’s there!" Zu Hong shouted.

Ju Tianqing also frowned deeply, his Divine Sense sweeping over Yang Kai without restraint. When he saw that Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, he finally relaxed a little.

No matter how this person got in or what his purpose was, as long as his cultivation wasn’t higher than his own, Ju Tianqing wasn’t too worried.

"City Lord Zu, Elder Ju." Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists to the two of them, acting as if they were all old acquaintances. "Long time no see."

Zu Hong’s expression was uncertain as he scrutinized Yang Kai, only to find the face completely unfamiliar. He couldn’t help but ask in a deep voice, "Who are you?"

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "My humble name isn’t worth mentioning."

Zu Hong was so angry his head spun, but he knew the other party didn’t want to reveal his name, so pressing further would be pointless. His expression shifted as he barked, "How did you get in here?"

Earlier, when Ju Tianqing and Gao Xueting entered together, Ju Tianqing had secretly left a hidden door. It was thanks to that door that he himself had managed to enter. But how did Yang Kai get in? Did he also use that hidden door?

No, that can’t be. Only Ju Tianqing and him knew how to open that hidden door, no one else could possibly know. Besides, Ju Tianqing’s personal disciples were guarding outside.

For this man to appear here without a sound, those people outside were probably in trouble.

At this thought, Zu Hong’s heart skipped a beat. He glanced at Ju Tianqing, only to find his face completely indifferent, not the least bit concerned for his disciples’ safety.

"Friend, your abilities are impressive to have found this place. This Lord is impressed!" Ju Tianqing looked at Yang Kai blandly, his words polite but his face showing no admiration at all. He got straight to the point: "Just now, you said the forty-sixty split was inappropriate. What’s your brilliant suggestion?"

Yang Kai replied lazily, "I wouldn’t call it a brilliant suggestion, just a little proposal."

"Let’s hear it," Ju Tianqing said, face dark.

"I want everything here. The two of you can go back to where you came from. How about that?" Yang Kai looked at them with a smile in his eyes.

"Outrageous!" Zu Hong was furious. He’d thought this young man just wanted a share, which he could have tolerated for now and settled later, but he never expected this guy to want it all.

Why had he gone through all this trouble with Ju Tianqing, even risking offending an elder of the Qingyang Shrine? There was no way he could accept such a proposal. They were all at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, so who was afraid of whom? Besides, he and Ju Tianqing were on the same side, while Yang Kai was alone.

Ju Tianqing’s face also darkened as he snorted, "You’ve got quite the appetite for a youngster. Aren’t you worried you’re being too greedy?"

Yang Kai’s face turned cold, his eyes frosty. "Watch your mouth, old man. If you anger me, don’t blame me for not respecting elders."

"Fine, fine!" Ju Tianqing was so angry he laughed. "Then this Lord will see just how capable you are to boast so shamelessly."

"Stop putting on an act," Yang Kai laughed loudly, looking at him with disdain. "Elder Ju, don’t pretend you don’t know me. Your disciples recognized me the moment they saw me. Even if you act like it’s your first time meeting me, your intentions are too obvious."

"What? Brother Ju, you know this brat?" Zu Hong looked at Ju Tianqing in surprise.

Exposed by Yang Kai, Ju Tianqing’s face turned ugly. He said in a low voice, "I know him. His name is Yang Kai. In the Shattered Star Sea, he killed Chang Hao and Chang Xian. The enmity between him and my Brahma Heaven Sacred Land is irreconcilable!"

"What? Chang Hao and Chang Xian, the two Holy Sons, died at his hands?" Zu Hong was shocked.

The Shattered Star Sea had closed mysteriously, and he’d heard about it. He also knew that Brahma Heaven Sacred Land had suffered heavy losses, especially with the deaths of the two Holy Sons, which was a huge blow. Both were rare geniuses, seen as the future of the Sacred Land.

He hadn’t known what happened in the Shattered Star Sea, only that they hadn’t returned safely.

Only now did Zu Hong discover that both Holy Sons had died at the hands of this young man named Yang Kai.

But soon, Zu Hong realized something else. His expression turned odd as he said, "Since this brat entered the Shattered Star Sea before, doesn’t that mean he only just advanced to the Emperor Realm?"

"That’s right, it should be so," Ju Tianqing nodded slightly.

Zu Hong burst out laughing, looking at Yang Kai mockingly. "Kid, your courage is impressive. You just advanced to the Emperor Realm and you dare boast in front of me and Elder Ju. Too bad your brains are lacking."

Having just advanced, he should be in seclusion consolidating his realm. If his foundation was unstable, he could fall from the Emperor Realm. Yet this kid wasn’t in seclusion, but running around. Who knows how his elders taught him.

In an instant, in Zu Hong’s eyes, Yang Kai became an arrogant, ignorant junior who’d gotten lucky. All his previous wariness vanished, and he no longer took Yang Kai seriously.

Yang Kai ignored him and looked at Ju Tianqing. "Elder Ju, there’s something I need to clarify with you."

"What?" Ju Tianqing said coldly.

Yang Kai smiled. "You say Chang Hao died by my hand—I have no objection, I did kill him. But Chang Xian’s death had nothing to do with me. In fact, before he died, Chang Xian begged me to kill Chang Hao for him, to avenge him. Who knows what grudge those two Holy Sons had, but they wanted each other dead. I have a soft heart, so I granted Chang Xian’s dying wish and killed Chang Hao, so he could rest in peace."

"Nonsense!" Ju Tianqing roared. "Chang Hao and Chang Xian were as close as real brothers. How could Chang Xian ask you to kill Chang Hao?"

Yang Kai snorted. "Believe it or not."

Ju Tianqing took a deep breath to calm his anger, then said coldly, "Since you made it in here, what about my useless disciples outside..."

"No idea. They’re probably all dead," Yang Kai grinned.

As for Zhang Ruoxi, he was confident in her. Even if she couldn’t win, with the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress, she wouldn’t be hurt. But if her terrifying bloodline power was forced out, Ju Tianqing’s disciples would be in trouble.

In short, Ju Tianqing’s disciples were likely doomed.

"Fine! The two Holy Sons died by your hand, and now my disciples too. Since you’ve come here yourself today, don’t even think about leaving!"

Ju Tianqing erupted in fury, murderous intent surging from his entire body. As he spoke, he urged his Emperor Yuan, and a dense wave of Emperor Intent swept out, making the already fragile laws of this small world hum and tremble. The Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade in his hand quivered lightly, sending out a dazzling arc of blade light that was blinding to behold.

Zu Hong was even more direct. Seeing that Yang Kai and Ju Tianqing were about to fight, he knew this battle was inevitable. With Ju Tianqing on his side, he didn’t take Yang Kai seriously at all.

Besides, Yang Kai looked so young and had just advanced to the Emperor Realm. What was there to fear?

Recently, many new talents had gained opportunities in the Shattered Star Sea, breaking through to the Emperor Realm.

But how could these newly advanced Emperors compare to old experts like them? They’d need another thirty to fifty years of cultivation.

As Emperor Yuan surged, roars came from the Myriad Beasts Seal at Zu Hong’s side, filling the small world. Streams of light shot out, transforming into all kinds of strange Demonic Beasts in midair.

Each of those Demonic Beasts had a powerful aura, at least at the early Eleventh-Tier.

With Emperor Yuan pouring in, the Demonic Beasts shot out from the Myriad Beasts Seal one after another, rumbling as they charged toward Yang Kai.
