## Chapter 1751 — You Can't See Me…

“My relationship with him isn’t something I need to explain to you, is it? Elder Cui, aren’t you talking a bit too much?” Luo Lan looked at him with clear disgust.

The cultivator surnamed Cui let out a low, sneering chuckle. “Fine, if you won’t say, then forget it. No need to be so overbearing.”

As he spoke, he cast a sinister glance toward Yang Kai and, in a creepy tone, added, "Kid, the Lost Realm is extremely perilous—don't go dying in there, alright?"

Yang Kai shot him a sidelong look, expression cold, showing no intention of replying.

This enraged the warrior surnamed Cui. It was one thing for Luo Lan to publicly snub him—after all, she was also an elder of the Sword Alliance and not weaker than him—but for a mere Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm like Yang Kai to be so insolent naturally gave him an excuse to lash out.

However, before he could make things difficult for Yang Kai, a cold snort came from not far away. “What a joke! If your Sword Alliance has internal disputes, settle them early—what are you bringing them here for? Shall this old man act as your judge? The two of you can fight it out first—the winner stays, and the loser gets lost!”

The speaker wore a dark purple robe, his features stern, an air of authority that brooked no argument, and an oppressive aura radiated from his body.

At those words, both the warrior surnamed Cui and Luo Lan's faces shifted slightly.

Luo Lan gave an embarrassed laugh, "I’ve made Senior Ni laugh. This wasn't my intention."

The warrior surnamed Cui also forced a laugh, "Senior Ni, don't take it to heart—I was only joking with Elder Luo."

"Hmph!" Senior Ni snorted coldly, clearly not putting Luo Lan and this Cui in his sights at all, and said icily, "If that's the case, be quiet. Don't disturb me!"

Luo Lan and the warrior surnamed Cui both looked awkward and fell silent. The warrior surnamed Cui, however, still glared coldly at Yang Kai as if trying to etch his features into memory.

Having just arrived and already being stared at by a Void King Realm cultivator made Yang Kai's mood sour.

"That fellow is Cui Hong—an elder of my Sword Alliance and sworn comrade of Li Minghai. They're both from the Vice Alliance Master faction. Once you enter the Lost Realm, be careful and don't stray from my side. If he won't face me directly, he'll likely make a move on you," Luo Lan whispered into Yang Kai's ear, explaining.

Yang Kai subtly inclined his head and quietly asked, "Who exactly is Senior Ni? You all seem rather wary of him."

"His name is Ni Guang. He's from the Hengluo Commerce Guild," Luo Lan replied. "He has Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation—do you think Cui Hong and I aren't wary?"

"I see!" Yang Kai understood and looked up toward Ni Guang.

His gaze happened to meet that of someone standing beside Ni Guang.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

The owner of the gaze wore a smile at the corner of their mouth and their eyes shone with a peculiar light, staring at Yang Kai with bright interest.

Yang Kai’s expression twisted bitterly, and he nearly cursed aloud. He hurriedly averted his gaze and lowered his head, using the motion of raising a hand to his forehead to cover half his face. Inwardly, he chanted over and over: You can’t see me, you can’t see me, you can’t see me…

That was clearly just deceiving himself…

Since Luo Lan had come, Yang Kai hadn't paid close attention to the cultivators who had arrived earlier; only now did he realize that a familiar face stood beside Ni Guang.

The person was graceful and tall, skin fairer than a woman's, seemingly flawless, with a gentle smile capable of driving any woman mad and even causing men to stare longer.

He held a folding fan and exuded an air of rakish elegance—the kind of presence that made young heroes feel inferior; he seemed born to be aloof and lofty.

He was the very embodiment of perfection.

That fellow… if not the Third Young Master Xue Yue, who else could he be?

The last time Yang Kai had encountered Xue Yue was in the Imperial Garden during a fierce clash; with the Imperial Garden's closure he had escaped her pursuit, and he hadn't expected to run into her again here in the Lost Realm.

It wasn't surprising—opportunity and danger coexist in the Lost Realm. Although its existence was known only to a few powerful figures, the Hengluo Commerce Guild, one of the Star Domain's strongest powers, would naturally be aware of it.

This time, even a powerhouse like Ni Guang had personally taken action, bringing along Xue Yue for experience and tempering—there was nothing unreasonable about that.

In a flash, thoughts raced through Yang Kai's head and he grasped the situation before him.

He sighed, raised his head, and stared straight into Xue Yue's eyes. With an attitude as if nothing could faze him, he pulled a grin at her.

Xue Yue froze for a moment, apparently not expecting Yang Kai's boldness—daring to look her in the eye with Ni Guang at her side. She was annoyed and shot Yang Kai a venomous glance, full of coquettish fury.

With her current appearance as a handsome young man, making such an expression was truly improper—anyone unaware of the truth might well think something was wrong with Xue Yue’s mind. But Yang Kai knew her true nature all too well, and seeing her suffer a setback only made his smile widen with delight.

Yang Kai had long been unable to make sense of his relations with Xue Yue.

They were not outright enemies—nothing to the level of life-and-death—only that Yang Kai held Xue Yue's greatest secret, and Xue Yue wished to silence him.

Yet Xue Yue had never truly attempted to kill him. Even when she sent pursuers to Rainfall Star, she left room, only dispatching two weak cultivators who were ultimately killed by Yang Kai.

They couldn't be called friends either; there was no camaraderie or brotherly sacrifice between them.

The most likely reason was that Xue Yue felt Yang Kai had taken quite a bit of advantage of her, so her heart was vexed and she wanted to teach him a lesson to make him remember his place. Yet her life had been saved by Yang Kai, and caught between gratitude and resentment, Xue Yue found herself in a difficult and awkward dilemma.

Yang Kai didn't know how to handle their relationship, and Xue Yue was just as confused.

If she were any ordinary woman it might be simpler, but Xue Yue was the heir the Hengluo Commerce Guild's president Ai Ou had high hopes for. Perhaps she could one day steer the Guild—and a woman's status might not suit sitting at the very top.

Her hidden secret could not be exposed.

The exchange of glances between the two did not escape the Void King Realm experts present. Luo Lan looked at Yang Kai in astonishment and whispered, "You know that youth? Do you know who he is?"

"I know him. We've met," Yang Kai nodded.

"Your social circle is that broad?" Luo Lan exclaimed.

Luo Lan, unfamiliar with the famed Third Young Master Xue Yue, could only recognize him because Ni Guang treated Xue Yue with unusual humility.

Ni Guang had great power and influence in the Hengluo Commerce Guild, yet he was courteous to a mere Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—who else could make him behave thus besides Xue Yue?

Ordinary Origin Returning cultivators didn't even have the qualifications to meet him; they would be meek in his presence.

Moreover, Xue Yue's appearance matched the rumors—capable of enthralling countless onlookers, men and women alike. Even experts couldn't help but take another look upon seeing her.

"Are you friends?" Luo Lan asked again.

"Heh…" Yang Kai hesitated, unsure how to answer. "There's some entanglement between us."

The word 'entanglement' made Luo Lan's heart sink—she instinctively feared that Yang Kai and Xue Yue might bear some deep hatred, which would put her in a bad position.

While the two whispered, Ni Guang and Xue Yue seemed to be conversing as well, and with each exchange Ni Guang kept glancing toward Yang Kai, clearly interested.

Yang Kai felt a bitter pressure in his chest, not knowing what Xue Yue and Ni Guang were saying; if they spoke ill of him, Ni Guang might take action against him.

Thinking so, he quietly warned Luo Lan—if things went awry she should flee immediately and forget about the Lost Realm.

Luo Lan dared not refuse. She regretted bringing Yang Kai along; alone she might have faced increased danger but not been singled out even before entering. She wasn't afraid of Cui Hong alone, but Ni Guang was different—the Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation made her want to keep her distance.

Over there, Ni Guang and Xue Yue's talk seemed to end. The Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert looked steadily at Yang Kai, eyes emitting a gaze like tangible light, as if trying to peer into his very heart.

Yang Kai felt crushed under that weight and glared at Xue Yue without speaking.

Xue Yue smiled innocently, snapped her folding fan open with a soft sound, and fanned it twice in the elegant manner of a refined gentleman.

In their past encounters, Xue Yue had rarely seen Yang Kai embarrassed; now, backed by Ni Guang's prestige, Yang Kai was helpless, and Xue Yue delighted at his discomfort.

"Young man, why not come over to my side?" Ni Guang suddenly asked.

At his words, the Void King Realm experts around them were taken aback and all turned to appraise Yang Kai with strange expressions.

No one knew why Ni Guang would invite a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator—especially one who had been brought here with Luo Lan of the Sword Alliance.

It was plainly an inexplicable attempt to poach someone—and left everyone puzzled.

If Yang Kai's strength could rival Ni Guang's and Ni Guang wanted to recruit an ally for exploring the Lost Realm, that would be understandable.

But Yang Kai was only a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—what could he possess that would make Ni Guang take notice?

Yang Kai hadn't expected this turn of events; he thought Xue Yue might have spoken ill of him to Ni Guang so that Ni Guang would teach him a lesson. When Ni Guang extended the invitation, Yang Kai was stunned and glanced at Xue Yue to see what she was up to.

Xue Yue smiled smugly, fanning herself idly as if she were only here to enjoy the scenery, her expression inscrutable.

Damn woman! Yang Kai cursed inwardly.
