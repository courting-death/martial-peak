## Chapter 653 — Escape

Faced with such a strike, Han Fei's expression grew exceedingly grave; she drew up every ounce of strength and concentrated to search for any flaw in Chu Jian's attack.

Yang Kai, whom she sheltered at her side, could not help but feel a suffocating illusion; under this onslaught it seemed he could not even form the thought of resistance.

Chu Jian’s exact number of Stages into the Saint Realm was unknown, but the gap between his cultivation and Yang Kai's was as wide as heaven and earth; even if his assault was not aimed at Yang Kai, that momentum alone made every step for Yang Kai arduous.

Fists like mountains and peaks fell; Han Fei carried Yang Kai, dodging and weaving, each step carefully deliberate. Amid that explosive fist-force, the two were like a lone skiff on a raging sea, ever at risk of being overwhelmed.

“Han Fei, you are no match for me—surrender now and I will grant you a dignified death!” Chu Jian bellowed as he pressed the attack, trying to disturb Han Fei's mind.

Both were Saint Realm masters; even with some disparity in strength, Chu Jian would still need to expend effort to take Han Fei, and would have to carefully control his force to avoid harming Yang Kai, so he naturally felt somewhat restrained.

Han Fei remained silent, teeth clenched; her delicate form rose and fell as she threaded through the gale and storm.

After a fierce burst of assault and still not grazing even Han Fei’s clothing, Chu Jian was furious; his eyes went scarlet, and feeling that his face had been lost before so many, he snarled in anger, “You brought this on yourself—Demon God Transformation!”

With that roar, complex black Demon Marks quickly spread across his face; his Qi and blood surged, and his combat strength rose noticeably.

Han Fei dared not slack either and likewise unleashed Demon God Transformation; pink Demon Marks covered her lovely face, and in that instant a faint floral scent drifted through the air.

Petals of unknown flower-essence condensed from True Yuan drifted down like a plague of locusts toward Chu Jian.

Chu Jian made no evasive move and struck with a fist; the petals became powder in an instant.

“Two Stages into the Saint Realm?” Han Fei cried in astonishment. “So you were hiding your true cultivation all this time!”

Chu Jian laughed loudly, “Knowing the truth before you die is not too late!”

Laughing, a black demonic spear infused with malignant qi was hurled from his hand with unstoppable force, directly piercing Han Fei’s lower abdomen. She let out a muffled groan and a spray of blood mist; her momentum fell sharply, her face went deathly pale, and she began drifting down toward the volcanic crater.

Having used his full strength, Chu Jian had severely wounded Han Fei with a single blow.

The leaders’ relative strengths could be glimpsed from this; Chu Jian’s audacity to rebel was not without some backing.

“You flee—” As she fell, Han Fei used her last reserves to fling Yang Kai away, and whispered a brief admonition in his ear.

Under the crushing clash of two Saint Realm masters’ momentum, Yang Kai could not move an inch; though he heard Han Fei’s warning and knew he should escape, he was powerless.

Chu Jian would not kill him—like Li Rong, he had use for him—but Chu Jian was the sort to betray once his need was met, far less trustworthy than cooperating with Li Rong.

Yang Kai understood in his heart but could not muster any strength; he could only be hurled away under Han Fei’s despairing gaze.

“Seize him!” Chu Jian did not even glance at Han Fei as he barked at the nearby subordinates.

The warrior nearest Yang Kai, a Divine Roaming Realm peak master, shifted his body and intercepted him; with one hand he pinched Yang Kai’s throat, looking coldly at him and sneering, “Human, from now on you will serve Lord Chu Jian!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened; he panted heavily, his bones creaking.

Under that desperate pressure, his Indomitable Golden Body seemed to react in an unusual way.

The greater the pressure, the stronger the Indomitable Golden Body’s counterforce.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled that the reason he had been able to obtain the Indomitable Golden Body in the past was precisely because he refused to yield to despair.

From countless desperate battles he had also comprehended an insight into a secret of the Indomitable Golden Body.

A flash of light crossed his mind; the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched into an arc as he softly called out, “Unyielding Will!”

The shackles and the pressure imposed upon him shattered in an instant; at that moment Yang Kai reclaimed control of his body and regained his freedom.

Chu Jian’s oppressive might still hung over him like a mountain, but Yang Kai was no longer completely unable to act as before.

“I will not serve anyone!” Yang Kai grinned at the demon warrior; suddenly a drop of Yang Liquid appeared in his palm, and at his command the drop swiftly congealed into a razor-sharp blade.

Thrust—

The Yang Liquid blade pierced the demon warrior’s chest. He widened his eyes and stared blankly at Yang Kai, clearly not having yet understood what had happened.

Rending—

The pure True Yang Yuan Qi clashed with his corrupt demonic energy, purifying the demon qi within his body.

A scream tore from his throat; the pain of the wound and the suppressing True Yang Yuan Qi left him helpless, unable to muster his strength, and he tumbled headfirst toward the volcanic crater.

“How is this possible?” Chu Jian was momentarily stunned; he had not expected this human to still have the strength to fight under his pressure.

Seeing one of his subordinates inexplicably gravely wounded, he flew into a rage: "You deserve to die!"

With a roar, Chu Jian opened his enormous hand and lunged to seize Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s body hairs stood on end; while he could casually slay a Divine Roaming Realm peak from surprise when unguarded, he instinctively felt a tremendous crisis facing an attack from a Saint Realm master.

With a flick of his wrist, a dozen drops of Yang Liquid shot from his fingertips; in midair they transformed into indestructible spears, golden in hue, and they stabbed at Chu Jian’s outstretched hand.

Pock… pock… pock…

Chu Jian’s assault was halted for a moment; this pure True Yang Yuan Qi was not something even he could ignore. The demonic qi in his palm was rapidly purified, and the flesh of his palm blistered from the searing heat.

One drop of Yang Liquid was the crystallization of Yang Kai’s entire True Yuan; a dozen drops equaled Yang Kai instantly erupting his True Yuan a dozen times over. Such an attack was naturally overwhelmingly powerful.

After flinging the Yang Liquid, Yang Kai did not look back. Amid Chu Jian’s rage he turned and rushed downward.

Before Han Fei fell into the magma, he reached out and seized her, tucking her beneath his arm. He circulated True Yuan to envelop them both, and plunged into the lava.

With a splash—

The two figures vanished from sight.

“Chase them!” Chu Jian, stung by shame and rage, led the pursuit himself.

Chu Jian’s men glanced at one another and ground their teeth as they followed. They were indeed warlike, but to throw themselves headlong into an environment that suppressed them carried its own dread and hesitation.

Beneath the magma, Yang Kai moved with practiced ease; he and Han Fei dove swiftly downward.

Cradled beneath his arm, Han Fei’s expression was complicated; her beautiful eyes fixed unblinkingly on him, and a bitter sorrow filled her heart.

She had not expected to be saved by this human.

Had he not suddenly erupted at the last moment, this time she likely would not have returned. Chu Jian had truly intended to kill her—he needed to eliminate rivals to unify Mo Shen Fort and would show no mercy to his own.

How had this little fellow managed it?

Under such savage pressure he was still able to move—utterly incomprehensible. The moment she flung him away even she had been in despair.

From the side Han Fei observed the human’s countenance—cold and stern, but with not an ounce of fear; instead, in his eyes she keenly detected a concealed excitement.

He seemed to savor such perilous thrills.

“Freak!” Han Fei thought inwardly, then her expression sharpened and she said, “Hurry, Chu Jian is chasing us!”

Above, an extremely violent and furious aura approached; Chu Jian had clearly gone mad.

If this human escaped from his hands, he'd likely go mad, Han Fei thought inexplicably.

“I know,” Yang Kai nodded faintly, then asked, “Is your limit at the place where you made the space for my meditation?”

“About there; I can go a bit deeper,” Han Fei answered weakly.

“Then where do you think Chu Jian’s limit lies?”

“If he is two Stages into the Saint Realm, then another one hundred zhang down! After all, the yang qi here is far too dense—it greatly suppresses our Ancient Demon Clan.”

“Then he won’t catch us, hehe.” Yang Kai grinned with full confidence.

Han Fei’s eyes lit up; she suddenly recalled that before she came to fetch him the little fellow had apparently plunged deeper below—though she did not know how far he could go, judging by his tone and his current performance he should be able to reach even lower positions.

She immediately felt hopeful.

After a moment she added, “Can you hold on?”

“Don’t know, but trying is better than being caught.”

“Actually… he wouldn’t kill you. If he caught you it wouldn’t threaten your life. Why take such a risk?”

“I trust Li Rong more. If I’m correct, if Chu Jian captures me, once he’s done using me he will definitely kill me.”

“You still have a bit of self-awareness,” Han Fei said with a slight nod.

“Did you and Hua Mo think the same?” Yang Kai suddenly gave her a cold, faint smile.

Han Fei’s heart lurched and she looked at Yang Kai in astonishment.

“So it is true!” Yang Kai took a deep breath; his face darkened considerably.

“We did think that, but never made a decision. Our Ancient Demon Clan need not owe humans favors!” Han Fei replied in a cold tone; even in such circumstances she refused to show weakness and spoke bluntly.

“That very thought would be reason enough for me to kill you now and remove future trouble,” Yang Kai sneered.

“Do as you please!” Han Fei turned her head away.

“Rest assured, I will not kill you. Though you are wounded, killing you would still be somewhat difficult for me.”

“Hmph, at least you’re not overestimating yourself,” she snorted.

“But after today I think you should reconsider repaying kindness with enmity. If you dare think that way again, I will show no mercy. My not killing you now is not because I’m soft-hearted—it’s because I am currently under someone else’s roof.”

Han Fei curled her mouth and fell silent; she found that when speaking with this human she could not seize any initiative—he seemed able to see through her heart and perceive her thoughts.
