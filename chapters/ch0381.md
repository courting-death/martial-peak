## Chapter 381 — Mystery-Grade Middle-Level Jade

It was faintly recalled that the spirit formation left behind back then had a chance of enhancing the grade of the refined pill.

However, now Yang Kai had also grasped many secrets of the True Alchemy Formula. What Lü Si brought over this time was a spirit formation that could increase the success rate of alchemy, and its level was considerably higher than the previous one, which was why he was so confident.

With Xiao Fusheng's alchemy level, combined with this spirit formation, success was guaranteed.

“Are you sure it will succeed? There won't be any failures?” Lü Si asked uneasily.

“Absolutely!” Yang Kai nodded firmly.

“What if...”

“There is no 'what if'!”

Lü Si smiled bitterly, unsure of what to say.

Yang Kai rubbed his hands together and stood up, smiling as he said to Lü Si, “Elder Si, time is of the essence. I think you should hurry to Hidden Cloud Peak.”

“Right, right, right!” Lü Si was ignited with enthusiasm from Yang Kai's reminder.

The materials for alchemy had long been prepared; although these materials were hard to find, the Lü Family’s resources were not too weak. For Lü Si, they naturally spared no effort.

Lü Si decisively stood up, reached into the room, and took out several jade boxes, all containing the gathered medicinal materials.

After packing up, he turned around only to see Yang Kai had casually hoisted the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, which was beneath him earlier, onto his shoulder, grinning widely.

“Elder Si, it's a pleasure to cooperate!” Yang Kai chuckled, not being courteous at all, and strode out with the jade bed.

Lü Si gaped, about to say something but swallowed the words back down.

Now, all he could do was hope that what he said was true.

Lü Liang and the others were waiting with their heads lowered; upon raising their heads, they were met with Yang Kai's imposing figure, causing them to drop their jaws in shock.

This...this...

The Yang Crystal Jade Bed, which Elder Si used to save his life, was simply taken away by someone? Looking behind Yang Kai, Elder Si followed out with a face full of helplessness and conflict.

Everyone from the Lü Family was utterly astonished.

“Everyone, please wait!” Yang Kai laughed and waved to the crowd, then walked boldly outside.

He looked just like a robber, leaving with a full load. The people of the Lü Family could only watch in envy.

After taking a few steps, he felt someone pull him back.

Looking back, he saw Lü Si with a worried expression staring at him, hesitating and wanting to say something.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai instantly became impatient; he had spent so long entangled with Lü Si over a Yang Crystal Jade Bed, which was beneath his dignity.

“Young Master Yang, I must ask one last time—are you really sure it can succeed?” Lü Si clearly still had some reservations as he looked at the jade bed on Yang Kai's shoulder, as if it were his first love and he was reluctant to let go.

“If you are too afraid to bet, then return the trust to me. I do not wish to engage in such a thankless task,” Yang Kai said, revealing his displeasure with a cold snort.

Lü Si’s head throbbed; after much inner turmoil, he finally gritted his teeth and said, “I trust you!”

“Just like that,” Yang Kai responded lightly, “Let go!”

Lü Si awkwardly withdrew his hands, looking reluctantly at the jade bed before finally tearing his gaze away.

Yang Kai strode away!

After he disappeared, the people of the Lü Family became exceedingly worried, and Lü Liang hurriedly stepped forward, “Elder Si, isn’t this a bit hasty?”

“What do you suggest we do? The opportunity is right in front of me; should I let it slip through my fingers?” Lü Si was equally distressed. After speaking, he sighed, “So be it. It’s a gamble for life and death! I will go for a few days.”

After saying this, he soared into the air, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Once Lü Si disappeared, Lü Liang's face darkened as he considered for a long time, then spoke in a deep voice, “You few, personally go monitor that Master Yang; see what he does these days, and make sure not to expose yourselves.”

Several experts nodded gravely.

...

In the Lü Family's back courtyard.

Yang Kai swaggered back, and as soon as he entered, he saw Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman sitting in the courtyard, bored, with Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian accompanying them.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng was stunned, surprised to see the Yang Crystal Jade Bed he had brought back.

“Young Master!” Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian quickly approached. After several days of recuperation, they had nearly fully recovered, and there were no visible signs of their previous injuries.

“Where did you get such a huge piece of gem?” Qiu Yimeng asked with a laugh, astonished.

“A treasure from the Lü Family,” Yang Kai casually replied, walking over to the stone table in the courtyard and placing the jade bed down. 

“It’s really beautiful.” Luo Xiaoman, not quite recognizing its value, walked closer to touch the jade bed, marveling, “It’s quite warm, looks like it could be slept on.”

Qiu Yimeng's expression suddenly became serious. She initially thought Yang Kai had just taken a large piece of gem from the Lü Family, but now, upon a closer look, she realized it was clearly an energy-rich heaven-and-earth treasure.

If used for forging, it could definitely exert great utility.

Her delicate fingers gently stroked the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, and the more she sensed, the more peculiar her expression became.

This treasure... seems to be of considerable quality.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian also observed, their expressions gradually shifting.

Such a large piece of treasure was rare even in the Yang Family; who knew how much the Lü Family spent to acquire it?

“This is... a Mystery-Grade Middle-Level Yang Jade?” After a while, Tu Feng's expression changed as he confirmed.

Upon hearing this, everyone was stunned, their faces filled with shock.

Mystery-Grade Middle-Level... this quality was astoundingly high. In this world, the highest-grade heaven-and-earth treasure was the Upper-Level of Mystery-Grade; the gap between Middle-Level and Upper-Level was merely a small tier.

What was most precious was that this large piece of Yang Jade seemed to be naturally formed, exuding gentle warmth. It was perfect for use as a bed. Even if one did not cultivate a Yang attribute skill, sitting on it to cultivate over years would yield considerable benefits.

“Is it truly a Mystery-Grade Middle-Level?” Qiu Yimeng looked at Tu Feng in astonishment, asking, though her eyesight wasn’t as keen as those at the Divine Roaming Realm.

“It is a Mystery-Grade Middle-Level,” Tang Yuxian also confirmed, her beautiful eyes shining with an unusual light as she fixed her gaze on Yang Kai. “Little Master, did you really get this from the Lü Family?”

“Of course.”

Qiu Yimeng furrowed her brow, murmuring, “I remember Lü Si ran into some issues when promoting beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, causing his meridians to become obstructed. At that time, the elder of the Qiu Family had told him that it would be best to make a warm bed of Yang Jade to soothe and reopen his meridians with gentle Yang essence. Otherwise, in time, not only would his strength decline but even his life would be at risk... could this be Lü Si’s jade bed?”

Thinking of this possibility, Qiu Yimeng’s heart trembled slightly.

Yang Kai glanced at her in surprise, saying, “You seem to know quite a bit.”

“Really?” Qiu Yimeng immediately covered her mouth, unable to believe it.

Now even Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were shocked. They naturally knew Lü Si, a renowned master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

However, they could not fathom how Yang Kai had managed to get Lü Si to part with something as valuable as this jade bed, which was akin to his own life.

Could it be... Yang Kai had killed Lü Si?

“Little Master...” Tang Yuxian's expression was peculiar as she looked at Yang Kai, saying, “What price did you pay to get this from Lü Si?”

Qiu Yimeng and Tu Feng also gazed at him with curiosity.

Setting aside the immeasurable value of the jade bed itself, and its special use to Lü Si, if Yang Kai hadn’t paid a considerable price, how could he have brought it back unscathed?

“I helped him with a small task, and he offered it to me,” Yang Kai smiled nonchalantly, not elaborating further.

Qiu Yimeng’s eyes sparkled as if she were pondering something. Meanwhile, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian clearly did not believe Yang Kai’s words, their expressions uncertain.

“Hmph, I will ask Lü Liang myself!” Qiu Yimeng snorted lightly, speaking with a proud tone. 

Given the relationship between the Qiu Family and the Lü Family, she could easily find out the truth by inquiring with Lü Liang.

“Do as you wish!” Yang Kai shrugged indifferently; after all, it was not a matter to hide. He suddenly looked expectant, “We’ll stay here for a few more days, and if you can’t wait, Qiu Yimeng and the others could return to Zhongdu first.”

“I’ll wait for you to leave together!” Qiu Yimeng smiled sweetly.

Yang Kai again hoisted the Yang Crystal Jade Bed and returned to his own room, entering secluded meditation.

“Hmph, so mysterious!” Qiu Yimeng lightly huffed as she flicked her sleeves and led Luo Xiaoman out, clearly ready to inquire with Lü Liang.

“Miss Qiu, let us know what you find out,” Tu Feng said with a grin.

“En.” Qiu Yimeng replied casually.

Once Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman left, Tang Yuxian and Tu Feng exchanged glances and chuckled bitterly.

“I realize that the longer I stay beside Young Master, the less I can perceive him,” Tu Feng said quietly.

Tang Yuxian nodded deeply in agreement, “It seems that every once in a while, he brings forth something astonishing.”

When they first met Yang Kai, he didn’t flinch while acting ruthlessly in front of four experts of the Divine Roaming Realm, his imposing demeanor pleasing to Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian. Later, framing and forcing them to sever a finger with the young master of the Nan Family, then conquering the Golden Feather Eagle left them in awe.

Returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, they learned that Yang Kai and the evil lord actually came from the same source.

Within Lingxiao Pavilion, Qiu Yimeng extolled Yang Kai’s virtues with great fervor in her words, leaving everyone even more shocked.

Now, feeling him practice, despite their own injuries, he remained unharmed, but now he had effortlessly taken a priceless gem from an expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

With each event, how could they not be astounded?

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian silently calculated; from the time they found Yang Kai until now, it had barely been a month.

In such a short time, he had inadvertently displayed unparalleled abilities, and unconsciously, the two Blood Servants no longer dared to underestimate him in the slightest.

Leaving aside Young Master’s origin, it seemed that he was truly quite extraordinary!!
