## Chapter 96 — Taking the Initiative

Unable to bear dwelling on those embarrassing matters any longer, Xia Ningshang turned her head and looked around before asking, “How did you find this hiding place?”

This location was exceedingly concealed, truly an ideal refuge. How had this junior brother managed to pinpoint it so precisely in the darkness?

Yang Kai grinned broadly. “When you left earlier, I wandered nearby and stumbled upon it by chance. I never expected it would become a place to save our lives.”

“That is indeed our fortune,” Xia Ningshang sighed softly.

“Rest well. Once the storm subsides, I will find a way out and lead you away from here.”

Xia Ningshang’s expression darkened as she slowly shook her head. “We cannot leave.”

“Where there’s a will, there’s a way. How could we not leave?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“Because I have activated the Nine Yin Eight Locks Formation. This valley is now sealed by the array. Before dawn, no one can escape.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened with understanding. “So you left earlier to set up the formation?”

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly. “It was originally meant to counter the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, but circumstances forced me to activate it prematurely.”

“Those eerie chains just now were the work of the formation?” Yang Kai recalled the scene.

“Yes.”

“Could it be that they have already been killed?” Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed with hope. If those experts were all dead, then this time they might truly escape with their lives.

Xia Ningshang shook her head. “No. This formation is not designed to kill. Those people are no weaklings; it would be impossible to kill them all. At most, it could eliminate one or two weaker ones.”

“That’s still something,” Yang Kai thought regretfully.

“However… although it cannot kill them, the Yin energy chains have invaded their bodies, likely sealing away most of their strength. Before dawn, they will not be able to recover. I will see if I can restore some strength before then, and together we will escape.”

Yang Kai suddenly fixed Xia Ningshang with a pair of fiercely determined eyes, his voice trembling with excitement. “You say their strength is sealed? How much?”

Xia Ningshang pondered for a moment. “At least sixty to seventy percent. That True Essence Realm expert should be sealed about eighty percent.”

“So, they cannot fight at full power now?” Yang Kai’s expression brightened with anticipation.

Xia Ningshang looked at him anxiously. “What are you thinking? Even if their strength is sealed, you are no match for them. Junior Brother, do not act rashly.”

She had already guessed what was on Yang Kai’s mind.

Yang Kai chuckled slyly, eyes gleaming with eagerness. “How will I know if I don’t try? Don’t forget, this is a place where Yin energy converges. They are not only sealed but also resisting the invasion of Yin energy. They are probably even weaker than you expect.”

“But there are so many of them!” Xia Ningshang grabbed his arm, shaking her head repeatedly. “Don’t be impulsive!”

Yang Kai gently patted her hand. “Rest assured, I know my limits. If we keep hiding here, sooner or later we will be discovered. Once trapped like fish in a barrel, we will have no choice but to wait for death. If I take the initiative, there might still be hope.”

“No,” Xia Ningshang shook her head like a rattle. “I am your senior sister; you must listen to me. If you go out now, even if you cannot be defeated by those people, the Yin energy in this valley will exhaust all your Primordial Qi.”

“Little Senior Sister, if you want to live, do not stop me. You saw that scoundrel Long Hui’s face; you should know what fate awaits if you fall into his hands.”

Xia Ningshang’s body trembled violently.

“Enough. Don’t stop me.” Yang Kai broke free from her grasp.

“If you insist on going, then take this with you!” Xia Ningshang, powerless to stop him, handed over a jade pendant. There was no other way; in her current state, she could not hold him back.

“You need this more than I do,” Yang Kai refused it. “Don’t worry. Although I am only at the Open Origin Realm, Fourth Stage, I have my ways to restore my Primordial Qi. The Yin energy here won’t affect me much. But you—if someone finds this place, can you withstand them?”

“I have already recovered some Primordial Qi and can activate defensive treasures. Their strength is greatly reduced and will not threaten me,” Xia Ningshang nodded.

“Then there is no worry!” Yang Kai slowly rose and began to walk outside.

After being suppressed and powerless for so long, he finally had the chance to move his fists and feet. His expression was fierce.

After a few steps, he stopped and softly said, “Little Senior Sister, if I am not back by dawn, you must leave alone.”

A pang gripped Xia Ningshang’s heart, spreading an inexplicable pain.

Yang Kai turned and smiled. “If I do return, promise me one thing, will you?”

“What is it?” Xia Ningshang asked, suppressing the ache in her heart.

“I’ll tell you when I come back.” Yang Kai chuckled and vanished into the darkness after briefly covering the crevice and looking around.

Only Xia Ningshang remained, lonely and forlorn.

There were still three or four hours until dawn, but the enemy numbered more than a dozen! This would surely be a grueling battle.

In the dark forest, two people were running swiftly. Yang Kai hid behind a large tree, silently waiting.

He did not know which side these two belonged to nor their strength. He could only gather information first before making plans.

If they were too strong, he would have to avoid them and seek weaker targets.

The footsteps drew closer, and voices came through.

“Brother Xiong, where have they hidden? We’ve searched so long without finding them.”

“Junior Brother, don’t rush. Brother Nu Lang and those beasts from the Blood Battle Gang are also searching. Yang Kai won’t hide for long. We just need to put on a show. Maybe they’ve already captured Yang Kai and that woman.”

The junior disciple nodded. “That’s true. It’s a pity about that girl. She seemed quite pretty. If she falls into Long Hui’s hands, who knows what fate awaits her.”

Brother Xiong sneered. “Long Hui is lecherous and destined for no great achievement. When we grow stronger, we will have our chance to settle the score.”

As they spoke, a figure suddenly emerged about thirty feet ahead. The two Fengyu Tower disciples halted abruptly. Brother Xiong shouted angrily, “Who goes there?”

A light laugh came from the figure. “Weren’t you looking for me?”

“Yang Kai!” Brother Xiong’s joy was boundless. He had not expected to encounter Yang Kai, let alone have him walk into their trap. Truly, the iron shoes had been worn out in vain, yet the prize came effortlessly.

Brother Xiong was excited, and Yang Kai was pleased as well.

From the previous conversation, Yang Kai now knew their identity: the five from Fengyu Tower. Except for Nu Lang, who was at the Qi Movement Realm First Stage, the rest were all Open Origin Realm.

He had no fear at all of cultivators at this realm.
