## Chapter 1661 — The Mystic Frost Divine Sword

“The Fateful Cold Pool is one of Ice Heart Valley’s top secrets — no one outside the most important figures is permitted to enter. The pool is divided into twelve layers; the deeper one goes, the greater the difficulty and the higher the danger, but likewise, the greater the benefits to be gained,” Luo Li explained as she looked at Yang Kai.

"Oh? May I ask how deep you once reached, Senior?" Yang Kai asked with interest.

"The best I ever managed was down to the eighth layer; I could do no more beyond that." Luo Li showed a trace of shame on her face.

"Is Su Yan in there?"

"Yes. Her aptitude is peerless, and she possesses an Ice-Crystal Yu Body. I had planned to wait a few more years before letting her go deeper into the Cold Pool to seek her opportunity, yet unexpectedly she advanced to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in such a short time; now she is qualified to enter the Cold Pool. Although she is no longer a disciple of Ice Heart Valley, consider this my parting gift to her."

"Then thank you very much, Senior."

He naturally knew Luo Li was doing this mainly to ease the relationship between Ice Heart Valley and himself. With the Fateful Cold Pool already here, whether Su Yan entered or not would make little difference to it; letting Su Yan go in once would maximize the goodwill she felt toward Ice Heart Valley.

Luo Li smiled slightly. "Ice Heart Valley owes her. Young Hero Yang need not be so polite. Hmm... she should be coming out now; I wonder which layer she reached."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's expression shifted; through his spirit-sense he indeed perceived Su Yan's aura slowly rising from the bottomless Cold Pool.

A short while later, a small whirlpool suddenly appeared atop the cold pond. As it spun, it hollowed out the center of the pond, and an even more piercing chill began to spread through the air.

A moment later, a graceful figure shot forth from that whirlpool.

A glint of cold light accompanied the figure's flight. Yang Kai's eyelids tightened; at his current strength, the instant he saw that cold gleam he could not help feeling a chill across his skin, as though millions of needles pricked every pore.

Yang Kai's expression was one of astonishment as he fixed his gaze on that cold gleam.

"This is..." Luo Li also showed surprise and looked up toward the sky.

In the sky, Su Yan stood motionless in the void. Her aura of ice, compared to over ten days ago, was several times stronger. In her right hand she held a three-chi-long, narrow sword that glittered with cold light.

That piercing cold brilliance was emanating from the sword itself.

Yang Kai and Luo Li's eyes immediately fixed on the sword. After a momentary daze, he broke into a delighted smile, while her face registered horror and her delicate body trembled.

The sword in Su Yan's hand looked odd. Though three chi long, it was extremely slender—much narrower than an ordinary long sword—and gave the impression of being extraordinarily razor-sharp.

Waves of cold light flowed along the blade without cease. Su Yan held the sword in one hand and gently traced the blade with a finger.

The blade hummed; a flash of cold light flared, and a terrifying ice profound intent radiated outward from Su Yan as its center.

Even the summit of Ice Jue Peak, already bitterly cold, now showed signs of being completely frozen over.

The wind-bitten thatch shelter's barrier began to crackle as though it could no longer bear the strain and would soon shatter.

"Profound Frost?" Luo Li could no longer remain calm. She rose abruptly and cried out, her beautiful eyes fixed on the slender sword in Su Yan's hand in utter disbelief.

Yang Kai read the situation and knew Su Yan had certainly picked up a tremendous windfall—one Luo Li had not anticipated—and he could not help laughing aloud.

Su Yan, as if finally coming back to herself, turned and looked down. The icy profound intent dissipated, revealing a warm, heart-soothing smile. She swayed and came before the thatch shelter. "Junior Brother, why are you here?"

"Senior asked me to come over," Yang Kai replied with a smile, a flash of sharp light in his eyes.

He suddenly noticed Su Yan's aura was exceedingly steady and solid—far stronger than when they parted over ten days ago. She must have benefited greatly from the Fateful Cold Pool.

His gaze returned to the slender sword for a closer look. Even Yang Kai, who had seen Void King-Grade Secret Treasures before, could not help feeling a chill.

From that narrow blade emanated an ice-cold intent that condensed into an invisible edge, piercing into one's heart and mind of its own accord, as if resisting inspection.

“Su Yan, that sword… may I take a look at it?” Luo Li spoke solemnly after regaining her composure.

"Please look, Grand Elder!" Su Yan respectfully presented the slender sword with both hands and offered it over.

Luo Li reached out and grasped the sword.

A flash of radiance passed over the blade, and then an unimaginable cold arose from it and began to spread into Luo Li's body.

One of Luo Li's small hands visibly froze; a thin layer of ice formed over her skin.

But she seemed to have expected this. With a flick of her wrist the ice shattered into pieces.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow in surprise.

This slender sword was indeed extraordinary. Even without being commanded, it could trouble an expert like Luo Li; if someone were to command it, the result would be catastrophic.

With this sword alone, Su Yan's combat power would soar by several levels!

Could this be a top-tier Void King-Grade Secret Treasure? Yang Kai wondered silently.

"It truly is Profound Frost!" Luo Li studied the blade carefully and finally nodded with emotion. "I never imagined in my lifetime I would see the Profound Frost Sword again."

Yang Kai asked, "What is the sword's origin?"

A hint of reverence appeared on Luo Li’s face as she said in a low voice, “It was the personal sword of our Ice Heart Valley’s founding ancestress, Ancestress Bing Yun.”

Yang Kai and Su Yan exchanged a look and could not help being shocked.

Ice Heart Valley was founded some twenty to thirty thousand years ago. Rumor held that the founding ancestress possessed top-tier prowess at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, a true hegemon in the Star Domain. Although she left behind a legacy, Ice Heart Valley's development over these tens of thousands of years had not gone well; no one of her stature had appeared since, and the sect's strongest reached no higher than the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

In this generation, Luo Li herself only possessed the First Stage of the Void King Realm.

"The ancestress's sword?" Su Yan was stunned for a moment, then regained her composure and said in a steady voice, "If it is the ancestress's sword, let the Grand Elder keep it. I did not know this sword was so precious, which is why I brought it out."

Luo Li slowly shook her head. "You calling me Grand Elder again brings me much comfort. As for keeping this sword... hah... I am powerless."

As she spoke, her entire arm holding the sword became covered by a layer of frost. The ice shattered and reappeared in waves, growing worse as it crept toward her chest; in a moment she would be covered entirely in frost.

Luo Li dared not hold the sword any longer and handed Profound Frost back to Su Yan. "Since you obtained it, then it is your fate! I have no right to take it back. The ancestress left a decree: the Profound Frost Sword will choose its own master. If I kept it, I would be disobeying her will, a guilt I cannot bear."

"But..." Su Yan seemed to want to say more.

"Timing and fate—this is Profound Frost's choice, and the ancestress's choice," Luo Li sighed.

If Su Yan were still a disciple of Ice Heart Valley and obtained Profound Frost, Luo Li would have been overjoyed. But now Su Yan was no longer a disciple, yet she had received Profound Frost's recognition, which was a great loss for Ice Heart Valley.

The ancestress's decree stood there; Luo Li dared not defy it.

She very much wanted to ask Su Yan to return to Ice Heart Valley, but thinking of her and Bing Long and the others' previous attitudes, she could not bring herself to speak.

“Since Senior has said so, Su Yan, just keep it,” Yang Kai said calmly from the side. “As long as you hold Ice Heart Valley in your heart, what does it matter whether you’re counted as one of its disciples or not?”

Luo Li looked at him thoughtfully and showed gratitude.

Although Yang Kai's words were not explicit, Luo Li understood his implication: some things could not be undone, but with the bond of Profound Frost Sword, should Ice Heart Valley ever face an unresolvable crisis, Su Yan would not stand idly by.

For Ice Heart Valley, that was already the best possible outcome.

"By the way, Su Yan, since you obtained Profound Frost, does that mean you reached the twelfth layer?" Luo Li suddenly remembered and asked with slight tension.

"I do not know exactly which layer I reached, only that it was the Cold Pool's lowest level," Su Yan replied softly.

"The lowest level—then it must be the twelfth layer." Luo Li sighed. "It seems the Ice Phoenix's primal power has blessed you; your future is indeed far brighter than mine."

She had worked for so many years yet could only reach the eighth layer, whereas Su Yan, entering the Cold Pool for the first time, had rushed straight to the twelfth. This testified to the Ice Phoenix's primal power.

Without the Ice Phoenix's primal power, Su Yan could not have achieved this feat.

"Having reached the lowest level, did you see the ancestress's Void Mind Crystal?" Luo Li asked, growing more anxious.

"Void Mind Crystal?" Su Yan frowned. "I did not see it. Apart from an extremely powerful domain field at the lowest level, only Profound Frost was stuck there. I did not find a Void Mind Crystal."

"You did not find it!" A flash of light danced in Luo Li's eyes; she seemed to think of something and her expression kept changing. After a long while she smiled and murmured, "It seems the rumors are true—haha, the rumors are true."

At the end she could not help bursting into loud laughter, clearly exhilarated.

Yang Kai frowned and asked suspiciously, "What do you mean, Senior?"

“Our Ice Heart Valley’s founding ancestor… may not be dead!” Luo Li’s words were nothing short of earth-shattering!

Yang Kai's face changed, and Su Yan covered her mouth with her small hand.

"Of course, this is only a possibility," Luo Li smiled faintly. "After all, a figure like the ancestress, who could command heaven and earth, would not easily fall. Our valley's records note that the Fateful Cold Pool houses the ancestress's Profound Frost Sword, but there is no clear record on whether she truly passed on. Since there was no Void Mind Crystal found in the Cold Pool, that suggests she might still be alive."
