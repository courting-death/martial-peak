## Chapter 1310 — Hehuan House

This scene left Yang Kai dumbfounded; he thought to himself that the place Shen Fanlei had brought him to really was just as he had suspected.

This was clearly a brothel in a city where ordinary people lived!

Only this place was many times more upscale than a regular brothel, because the patrons were martial artists, and the women who accompanied them were martial artists as well; at the very least, when Yang Kai swept the area with his Divine Sense he didn't find any woman with cultivation below the True Yuan Realm, though their strengths were not high — the strongest were only at the Third or Fourth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

And the men indulging in pleasure here were at similar levels of cultivation, at most reaching the Saint Realm, only slightly higher than the women.

Shen Fanlei's interest in such a place greatly surprised Yang Kai.

Yang Kai turned to look at him and couldn't help but be utterly speechless.

At this moment Shen Fanlei seemed to have lost his soul; his mouth hung wide open, staring blankly at the exaggerated scene before him as if the visual impact had robbed him of thought and action, his face flushed crimson.

Yang Kai was about to shake him awake when a young woman suddenly walked toward them; her face was like a peach blossom, her eyes bright as stars, dazzling; her bosom rose high, her waist was lithe and graceful, and she came before them with a charming bow: "I, your servant, greet the two young masters."

As she spoke she casually glanced at Shen Fanlei and stifled a laugh.

However, she clearly wasn’t seeing such a thing for the first time, so she didn’t pay it much mind. Instead, she spoke up with a smile, “You two young masters look rather unfamiliar — is this your first time visiting our Hehuan Pavilion?”

Yang Kai glanced at Shen Fanlei, saw he still seemed a little out of it, sighed slightly, knowing he couldn't rely on him, and nodded: "That's right, it is our first time at your esteemed house, though we've long heard of it; passing through Black Crow City, we thought we'd come in for a look."

"I see," the woman said. She inclined her head, tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, revealing a hint of coquettish charm, pursing her lips with a smile: "Are the two young masters pleased with what you see? If so, shall I arrange a private room for you?"

Seeing that both Yang Kai and Shen Fanlei were not weak in cultivation, and knowing they wouldn't want to linger in the square, she took the initiative to propose it.

Yang Kai had no objections and nodded, leaving the arrangements to her.

The woman acknowledged with a word and led them through the square toward a cluster of exquisite pavilions at the back.

Meanwhile, deep within Hehuan House in a private room, an old man and a youth sat cross-legged facing one another; the elder's cultivation was at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while the youth's level was at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

The old man was calm, silently circulating his cultivation method without hurry; the well-dressed youth, however, seemed troubled, frequently frowning and glancing toward the outside.

"Yuhan, your temperament still needs more tempering," the elder said lightly without raising his eyelids.

The youth was startled by the words, showing some guilt on his face and answering respectfully: "Seventh Grandfather is right, Yuhan is still too young."

The elder smiled faintly, opened his eyes, and looked at the youth opposite him: "Don't be too hard on yourself — after all, this matter concerns your future. Be more attentive. Though our Wang Family isn't a small clan, we're not a great house either; among this generation, you are the most promising, able to be accepted into Jidao Sect, and you have cultivated to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; if the opportunity comes, breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm is not impossible. Then you will be one of the pillars of the Wang Family, and your background is far better than mine — I expect you'll go further than I have."

"Seventh Grandfather flatters me; if Yuhan has reached today it is all thanks to the family's cultivation back then. If I truly succeed in cultivation in the future, I will not disappoint the family."

"With words like that I'm relieved. If it weren't you, and some other clan member came asking this of me, I couldn't have agreed. Though I have arranged a steward position for myself within Hehuan House, you know this is an enterprise secretly supported by Quehe Sect, and the figure of the city lord is also present; if something really goes wrong, the Wang Family couldn't bear the consequences."

“Yuhan understands. But this time, the person we’re dealing with is only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, and we won’t be making a direct move against him — just creating a bit of embarrassment for him. There shouldn’t be any problem with that.”

"If that were so, why would I agree to such reckless action?" the elder snorted, then shifted tone and laughed: "The woman you have your eye on — is she really from a great force like Qiantian Sect?"

"Yes." The youth seemed to brighten, and immediately said: "Not only is she from Qiantian Sect, she holds a high position within the sect and comes from a wealthy family — at least a million Saint Crystals."

"A million?" The elder was shocked, a trace of greed flashing in his eyes. "She's merely a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; how could she possess such vast wealth?"

"She was lucky. Last time she found a Saint Crystal vein in Flowing Flame Sandland and mined it for five months, collecting nearly ten million Saint Crystals. After returning to Qiantian Sect most were handed over to the sect, but she still kept a portion for herself."

"I see!" The elder's doubts vanished; he pondered: "In that case you mustn't let her go. You must win her heart — once you attain that, your cultivation will have a smooth path ahead and you need never worry about resources again."

"Yuhan thinks the same; otherwise I wouldn't move against that Yang brat. I don't think that brat has any honorable intentions toward Miss Shen; if things here are exposed, Miss Shen certainly won't look upon him kindly again."

"This plan is good, but are you sure he'll come here?" the elder asked.

The youth smiled: "I can't be absolutely certain, but I'm at least eighty percent sure."

"Tell me how..." the elder asked with interest.

The youth explained his plan; the elder nodded from time to time, showing approval.

At that moment a soft sound came from outside. A glint flashed in the elder's eyes; after listening for a moment he whispered: "They truly have arrived."

"Really?" The youth rejoiced.

"Mm!" The elder smiled and tossed him an item: "Your plan is good — you may proceed to the next step. Handle this yourself. This is my steward's token; with this token, others will cooperate with you on matters that aren't of major consequence."

The youth took the token and hurriedly kowtowed: "Many thanks, Seventh Grandfather!"

......

In another private room of Hehuan House, Yang Kai and Shen Fanlei were installed to rest temporarily; the young married woman who led them had disappeared, and besides Yang Kai and Shen Fanlei there was no one else in the room.

A pot of spirit tea sat on the table — Yang Kai didn't drink a single drop, but Shen Fanlei kept pouring cup after cup, as if trying to use the tea to extinguish the raging flames inside his body.

While he drank, Yang Kai simply watched him with a faint smile.

After a while Yang Kai suddenly spoke: "Brother Shen, your first time at a place like this?"

"Mm..." Shen Fanlei nodded, embarrassed; then suddenly looked up at Yang Kai and said: "You seem very familiar with this, Brother Yang — have you had much experience?"

"Nonsense!" Yang Kai said sternly. "This is my first time as well."

"Heh..." Shen Fanlei gave an awkward laugh, unsure whether he believed him.

Yang Kai then looked at Shen Fanlei with meaning and said: "Brother Shen wouldn't have come thinking of such a place for no reason. You don't seem like someone of this path — is there a reason? Could you tell me?"

Shen Fanlei gave a bitter smile: "Have Brother Yang seen through me?"

"Just a guess," Yang Kai said noncommittally.

"In that case, I won't play coy," Shen Fanlei took a breath and steadied himself before speaking: "Brother Yang, do you think this place is purely for pleasure?"

"Isn't it?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Of course not. If it were merely for pleasure there are other establishments in Black Crow City; I wouldn't have come here specially," Shen Fanlei spoke, his expression returning to normal — after all, as a martial artist at the Saint King Realm his temperament had some cultivation.

"Oh? What special attraction does this place have for Brother Shen?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"It's not a forbidden secret, but anyone who knows Hehuan House comes with the same intention as I do — though the house runs ordinary flesh trade, there is a group of well-trained women who have specialized in a Dual Cultivation Technique. These women practice a very peculiar Dual Cultivation Technique that's of great use for breaking through bottlenecks!"

"Dual Cultivation Technique, breaking through a bottleneck?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up; he immediately understood what Shen Fanlei had come for.

"Exactly," Shen Fanlei nodded lightly. "Last time I intended to use that Thunder Pool to break through my current bottleneck, but was obstructed by the Silver Night Thunder Beast and failed; I soaked in the Thunder Pool for several days and felt I only lacked the final step. If I relied on hard cultivation alone I don't know how long it would take, so I thought to try here. If luck favors me I might save much effort and Spiritual Medicine; if luck doesn't, then it's no loss — I'll return to my sect and continue secluded cultivation."

"I see," Yang Kai suddenly realized; he had been puzzled how Shen Fanlei, someone who felt great pressure even from two attendants, could shamelessly come here — now it made sense: he came to use it to break through that bottleneck.

"Did Brother Shen find out about this method himself?" Yang Kai asked casually.

"Oh, Senior Brother Wang told me. While discussing my bottleneck with him during the day he mentioned there was such a secret place in Black Crow City. I originally wanted to ask Senior Brother Wang to come with me, but he never returned, so I could only invite Brother Yang to bolster my courage; please don't blame me," Shen Fanlei said apologetically.
