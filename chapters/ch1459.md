## Chapter 1459 — Ice Path

Listening to Yang Kai ask that, Biluo naturally knew what he was worrying about and smiled slightly, "Because Lady inherited the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!"

"Heavenly Moon Demon Spider?" Yang Kai's expression changed slightly.

"What, you've heard of it?" Biluo asked, somewhat curious as she looked at him.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider is one of the Ancient Divine Spirits; strictly speaking, it stands on the same level as dragons and phoenixes, though which is stronger or weaker cannot be rashly judged — no one has witnessed the clashes between Ancient Divine Spirits.

Yang Kai’s knowledge of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider came from his frequent encounters with beings of the Ancient Divine Spirit lineage in recent times. Whether it was the Golden Dragon’s remnant soul within himself or Su Yan’s Ice Phoenix remnant soul, both belonged to the category of Ancient Divine Spirits.

"How could Qingluo have the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider?" Yang Kai frowned, then, suddenly thoughtful, said, "Could it be that the spider corpse you encountered when you first arrived at the Yao Star Di Chen..."

"Exactly, that was the corpse of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider." Biluo cast him an approving look. "Lady also spent a great deal of time investigating it; she didn't know at first what that spider was. And the reason Lady Chi Yue took a fancy to Lady and adopted her as an adopted daughter was precisely because of that. Otherwise, do you think Lady Chi Yue would give Lady benefits for no reason?"

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded lightly; if that was so, it explained matters neatly.

The reason the Enchantress Queen possessed the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was that she absorbed the mysterious energy within the corpse of that Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, thereby changing her bloodline.

And Shan Qingluo's ability to reach the Yao Star Di Chen directly through that altar is probably also related to that dead Heavenly Moon Demon Spider — one could even say the altar was created by the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider.

The Shan Qingluo bloodline's Poison Widow constitution likely originated from that as well.

Everything makes sense!

"Where is your Lady now? Has she come into the Imperial Garden too?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

Biluo's expression immediately darkened, and she nodded, "She came in, but after we entered we separated; I don't know where she is now."

Hearing her say that, Yang Kai couldn't help but sigh.

"You're not completely heartless, at least." Biluo puckered her lips, seeing Yang Kai worry about Shan Qingluo and looking upon him more favorably. "But rest assured, even if Lady is alone, there won't be any trouble — her cultivation is now at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; fighters of that Stage are generally no match for her."

"That powerful?" Yang Kai was astonished.

Being invincible among equals was believable. After all, Shan Qingluo now carried the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's primordial power and could not be judged by ordinary standards, but her cultivation being the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm still shocked Yang Kai.

He had already been advancing at a fast rate himself and had not expected the Enchantress Queen to be even more outrageous. But thinking back, it wasn't surprising — she had absorbed all the mysterious energy from that Ancient Divine Spirit's corpse. She had advanced from the Second Stage of the Saint Realm to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in only a few years.

"Heh heh, you bastard, if you don't work harder, Lady will surely move her affections elsewhere — no woman wants a man who can't protect her." Biluo grinned with schadenfreude.

Back then the Enchantress Queen's cultivation had already been slightly higher than Yang Kai's. Now, when they met again, that gap had not shrunk but widened; Biluo instinctively felt Yang Kai was not quite worthy of her Lady. Between her gloating and worry she couldn't help but feel exasperated at him.

"None of your damn business!" Yang Kai snarled, twisting his mouth. At the thought of Shan Qingluo, he grew uneasy — not because he feared her, but because that woman was outrageously seductive. Yang Kai could resist other women's temptations; even if someone like Yin Sudie tried to use seduction techniques on him, he could remain unmoved, but Shan Qingluo...

He wasn't confident he could remain calm in her presence. If he were to inadvertently be captured by her body and soul's charms, his lifetime reputation would be ruined.

"Forget it, let's not talk about that now. The Imperial Garden is large; we might not meet her anyway." Yang Kai seemed to be speaking to Biluo but also consoling himself. Although long ago Shan Qingluo had planted a secret art called the Soul Pursuit Seal in his body that could sense his location, after so many years, even if he hadn't deliberately removed the Soul Pursuit Seal, it had almost faded away.

If Shan Qingluo wanted to find him through the Soul Pursuit Seal, she probably couldn't do it.

"Mm, in any case, when this trip to the Imperial Garden is over I'll return to Di Chen to tell Lady your situation." Biluo smiled faintly; Lady had suffered in sorrow for so many years; if she learned Yang Kai was safe and had already come to the Star Domain, she would surely be pleased. "Which cultivation star are you on now?"

"Dark Star; you can't come there." Yang Kai shook his head slowly and briefly explained the situation on Dark Star, which Biluo committed to memory to report to her Lady.

"By the way, were you looking for an Ice Path?" Having finished the serious business, Biluo suddenly seemed to remember something and asked Yang Kai.

"Yes, have you encountered one?" Yang Kai raised his brow.

"I think I have, but I'm not sure it's the same place you're looking for." Biluo thought back. When she had been pursued she fled in panic and had run to the entrance of a tunnel; she originally intended to enter to hide, but upon feeling the chill within she gave up, fled elsewhere, and then stumbled into three people from Qiantian Sect, pulling them into the muddle.

Hearing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed and hurriedly asked, "Do you remember the exact location?"

If Biluo's description was not mistaken, that place must be the Ice Path he sought.

"More or less; I'll take you there." Biluo stood up as she spoke.

Though still a little weak, she still had a solid cultivation base; after resting so long, as long as she didn't fight she should be fine, so Yang Kai didn't stop her. He carefully released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings as they two headed off in a certain direction.

The place wasn't too far; Yang Kai and Biluo reached it in less than half a day.

"This is definitely the place." Looking at the familiar surroundings, Yang Kai showed a pleased expression. Though many scenes in the Imperial Garden resembled each other, there were subtle differences.

After all, he'd been here before — how could Yang Kai forget this Ice Path?

Sensing the frigid chill emanating from within that Ice Path, Biluo’s expression revealed clear apprehension. Even at her peak, entering such a place would have meant certain death—let alone now, when her Yuan Qi was severely depleted.

"Shall I wait outside for you?" Biluo asked.

"No, come in with me!" Yang Kai shook his head. After passing through the Ice Path he would still have to search for Life Jade Nectar, so he couldn't turn back. He wouldn't feel at ease leaving Biluo alone outside.

"I'm coming in too?" Biluo's brows knitted in obvious unease.

"Don't worry, I've been down this road once before; protecting one person won't be a problem." Yang Kai grinned.

"Alright, I hope I don't die for no reason." Biluo sighed helplessly. Though her words were full of anxiety, she made the decision without hesitation, clearly placing great trust in Yang Kai.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai called, leading the way into the Ice Path.

The moment they stepped into the Ice Path, a biting cold wrapped around them from all sides, enough to freeze a person's soul.

Yang Kai remained calm, circulating Saint Yuan to form a protective shield that wrapped him and Biluo; in an instant the surrounding chill was cut off, and the blazing Demonic Flame burning outside the shield provided excellent cold resistance.

"Huh? Is someone here?" Yang Kai scanned around and raised his brow in surprise.

It was clear someone had been here before, and it even looked like a fight had occurred — many of the ice pillars around were broken, several lifelike ice sculptures not far off had been smashed to pieces, and the air still carried the aftermath of a great battle.

What was more, cries of alarm could be heard not far off, as if the battle were still ongoing.

Yang Kai and Biluo exchanged a glance, both silently suppressing their auras as they moved toward where the fight was taking place.

The deeper they went, the more terrifying the cold became; Yang Kai's Saint Yuan defense alone was no longer sufficient to block all of it, so he had no choice but to release the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit and let it form a curtain of flame to enwrap them both.

"An Artifact Spirit?" Biluo's beautiful eyes widened in astonishment. "You actually have such a powerful fire Artifact Spirit?"

In an instant, she couldn't help but look at Yang Kai with new respect.

"Shh..." Yang Kai glared at her and continued approaching.

Although they had deliberately suppressed their auras, the energy fluctuations inside the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit could not be concealed; he did not know whether those fighting over there had noticed them, but at this moment caution was best.

It took the better part of an incense stick's burning before Yang Kai came to the outskirts of the battlefield, hiding behind a small ice peak and peering forward. There, two women in pristine white gowns flew up and down, dueling with a white‑rabbit‑shaped being.

The white rabbit looked delicate and exquisite, its whole body crystalline and translucent as if carved from white jade, flawless like the most perfect work of art, yet every movement of it caused the surrounding chill to shift — in other words, the cold here could be controlled by it, forming terrifying attacks.

The two women fighting it were both cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; their practices were likely ice‑attribute techniques, for every martial skill and secret treasure they used exuded cold. In such an environment they could perform to the utmost.

Even so, the two women could not gain any advantage and were instead driven dizzy by the white rabbit‑shaped thing, their faces showing anxiety.

What that white rabbit‑shaped thing actually was had become clear.

Heaven and Earth Spirit! Yang Kai's eyes brightened.
