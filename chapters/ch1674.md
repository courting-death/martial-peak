## Chapter 1674 — Utterly Heartless

"It's you!" Fang Fengqi recognized the youth standing before him at a glance — it was the same man who had been on the high platform moments ago. Furious, he surged forward and thrust a fist into the void, roaring, "Be gone!"

He was desperate to flee for his life; there was no time to tangle with Yang Kai here, so his first strike was delivered with everything he had.

A strange force swirled about his fist — that hand, which had not looked especially powerful, instantly turned as solid as a Secret Treasure, and dark-red hairs like steel needles shot up along Fang Fengqi's arm.

Those hairs were grotesque, radiating an aura that made Yang Kai feel ill; they covered the entire arm and fist, causing the already-thrown punch to surge in power.

Yang Kai's brow knit, a flicker of suspicion passing over his face.

What martial skill is this?

He had never encountered a martial skill that could cause such changes to the body. Thinking this, he glanced up at Fang Fengqi and involuntarily let out a low exclamation.

He found Fang Fengqi's appearance had altered greatly. Where he had once seemed delicate and cold, now — whether by secret art or some other means — his face had become horribly twisted; two fangs jutted from the corners of his mouth, flashing with a deadly chill, and deathly qi drifted from his nose and mouth.

At the thought of the three words Corpse Spirit Sect, a flash of insight ran through Yang Kai's mind, and he suddenly formed a conjecture about Fang Fengqi's background.

The attack was about to land; Yang Kai did not dare delay. He flicked out a strand of Golden Blood Threads, which wound around Fang Fengqi's incoming arm and suddenly tightened.

A clear wound opened on Fang Fengqi's arm, yet even with the Golden Blood Threads' sharpness it could not sever the limb. From the wound a jade-green blood flowed, giving off a stench that made one's stomach turn — an ordinary person taking a breath of it would likely drop dead!

Poisonous! Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed.

That jade-green blood was not only venomous but fiercely corrosive; the Golden Blood Threads coiling his arm flashed wildly as they were eaten away, sending out sizzling, tearing sounds.

Fang Fengqi roared, opened his mouth, and spat a mouthful of foul, green gas at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and vanished from the spot. When he reappeared he was above Fang Fengqi's head, the Dragon Bone sword Dripping Jade held in his palm, inverted like an upended spike, driven straight toward his crown.

"Idiot!" Fang Fengqi sneered contemptuously. To him that blade could not even harm a hair on his head, so he did not dodge — instead he threw another punch to meet Yang Kai.

Yang Kai twisted his body slightly to the side, evading Fang Fengqi's heavy, forceful blow, and the Dragon Bone sword plunged into the top of Fang Fengqi's head.

The seemingly dull long sword suddenly erupted with unimaginable power; a dragon-like roar emanated from the blade as it smashed forward, breaking defenses like splitting bamboo, tearing through Fang Fengqi's flesh and skull and plunging deep into his chest.

Fang Fengqi's eyes went wide with astonishment; only then did he perceive the sword's strangeness, crying out in alarm, "A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure!"

Struck in such fashion, he did not die. Instead he thrashed violently, trying to wrench free from Yang Kai's control.

Spatial Force heaved and rose; fine, threadlike spatial rifts formed around Fang Fengqi and immediately wrapped and slashed toward him from all directions.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The clanging and ringing did not cease. Fang Fengqi's body was monstrously sturdy and could resist part of the spatial cuts, but no matter his cunning, he could not withstand Yang Kai's brutal killing technique.

Wounds appeared across his body, flesh after flesh being expelled into the void.

Green blood continued to pour from the wounds; the whole sky seemed stained and corrupted.

"Don't kill him yet!" Qian Tong's voice rang out unexpectedly. He had noticed something amiss. Standing on the high platform, he reached out and gripped; the struggling Fang Fengqi was instantly completely restrained and lifted back onto the platform.

Yang Kai frowned at Fang Fengqi, a sliver of unease welling up deep inside him.

The onlookers likewise noticed Fang Fengqi's strangeness. Many cowardly folk could not bear to look and turned their heads away; even the boldest displayed fright, staring at him in horror, unable to believe such a person existed.

"Old wretch, let me go, or when the Sect Master makes a move you'll die without a grave!" Fang Fengqi did not plead; he threatened Qian Tong instead.

Qian Tong's cold gaze swept over Fang Fengqi's body before fixing on his abdomen. He extended two fingers to that spot and in an instant pierced through Fang Fengqi's belly.

Even after being impaled through the skull by Yang Kai's Dragon Bone sword, Fang Fengqi had shown no fear. But when Qian Tong did this he revealed extreme panic, shouting, "You old thing, what are you trying to do?!"

Qian Tong paid him no mind, instead looking solemnly at the wound in his abdomen.

There sat a green bead the size of a fingernail, yet it housed astonishing power.

“If this old man isn’t mistaken, destroying that bead would mean your death, wouldn’t it?” Qian Tong said lightly, glancing at Fang Fengqi.

Fang Fengqi's face shifted slightly; he ground his teeth and said nothing.

"Yang Kai, restrain him first. I have questions to ask him." Qian Tong said.

Yang Kai nodded, pulled the Dragon Bone sword free from Fang Fengqi's crown, and with a snap shot out a dozen or so Golden Blood Threads, binding Fang Fengqi tightly.

The great disturbance thus ended. Qian Tong stood on the high platform, looked around, and proclaimed in a loud voice, "Everyone, I have been in seclusion many years; today I emerge and hear of the upheaval on Dark Star and am deeply pained. But rest assured — Tianyun City still falls under Yingyue Hall's jurisdiction. Henceforth none will dare encroach upon this place. As for the Corpse Spirit Sect, I shall pay them a visit and right the wrongs, returning Dark Star to a clear and just sky!"

The crowd erupted, shouting Qian Tong's name and gathering around the platform.

For two years Tianyun City had been under the Corpse Spirit Sect's control; people lived each day in fear, terrified they might not see tomorrow's sun. But now Qian Tong had returned, and as a Void King Realm expert he would protect Tianyun City — such tragedies would no longer happen here.

"Elder Qian! Please, Elder Qian, preside over justice! My young daughter disappeared a month ago; someone saw her at the City Lord's Mansion. Please allow me to go to the mansion to see if my girl is still alive."

"My child went missing three months ago as well — she must be inside the City Lord's Mansion!"

"And my daughter too!"

......

Qian Tong's eyes showed sorrow as he raised a hand to calm the crowd and said slowly, "Everyone, wait a moment. I will have people sent to the City Lord's Mansion to check. If your sons and daughters are still inside, I will see that you are reunited."

"Thank you, Elder Qian!"

"Elder Qian, your great kindness will not be forgotten!"

Qian Tong sighed lightly and turned to look at Wei Guchang.

"I will go see." Wei Guchang understood and immediately, together with Xuan'er, dashed toward the City Lord's Mansion.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, "I'll go as well."

Su Yan and Xia Ningshang followed closely behind.

At the City Lord's Mansion, those who had surrendered to the Corpse Spirit Sect moved to block the intruders, but their strength was too weak to stop Yang Kai and the others. They smashed through, killing hundreds, and after capturing one and extracting some clues from him, Yang Kai and company headed straight for the dungeons.

The dungeon was dark and damp; the cells imprisoned at least hundreds of people.

And without exception those imprisoned were children not yet five years old and young, beautiful women.

Whether child or woman, all showed dim, fading vitality, as though they had endured endless torment. Each bore wounds upon their arms—some shallow, some deep.

Recalling what Fang Fengqi had done to that child earlier, everyone knew the fate those in the dungeon had suffered.

"Utterly heartless!" Su Yan's feelings surged with fury. She, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er opened the cell doors one by one and freed the prisoners.

Xia Ningshang stationed herself at the doorway, checking each person's condition and giving them pills to restore their drained vitality.

As they released them, Yang Kai and the others wore grave expressions.

When they reached the very bottom of the dungeon, their faces grew even grimmer.

At the lowest level there were no living people — only white, desiccated bones. Judging by the size and body types, they were without doubt children and women. They had been subjected to unspeakable torture; their flesh had been stripped clean, and the white bones were casually discarded there.

The bones formed mountains, numbering at least several thousand.

In merely two years such horrors had occurred in Tianyun City alone — what, then, must the situation across Dark Star be like?

"Detestable!" Wei Guchang ground his teeth and let out a low snarl, his face contorted with rage.

......

The uproar in Tianyun City took two days to gradually subside.

Those children and women freed from the dungeon were reunited with their families, but many had already perished inside; two years of chaos had left Tianyun City's countless inhabitants with indelible pain.

Inside the City Lord's Mansion, Qian Tong and the others wore grave expressions. They all stared angrily at the subdued Fang Fengqi, eyes blazing.

"Great Elder, let me kill him!" Wei Guchang snapped as he rose to his feet.

Qian Tong waved a hand, signaling Wei Guchang to calm himself, then looked at Fang Fengqi and said, "If I'm not mistaken, you come from Zangxiong Valley, do you not?"

At that question Yang Kai's eyes flashed with understanding; he thought to himself, so that is it!

He had suspected as much.

Zangxiong Valley was an especially peculiar place on Dark Star. Rumor had it that more than two thousand years ago it was the headquarters of a vast force called Guyang Sect, but having offended Star Emperor Mountain it was uprooted overnight and its headquarters utterly destroyed.

Zangxiong Valley was fraught with danger — countless forbidden formations and seals — and the most terrifying thing there was a group of special beings: a band of people who ought to have already died.
