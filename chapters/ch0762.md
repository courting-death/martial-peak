## Chapter 762 — Unlucky Years

An Ling'er felt that if she had not on impulse struck Yang Kai with a Soul Technique in the Court of Divine Battle, he probably would not have comprehended the Nine Heavens Divine Technique; without mastering that technique he would never have attracted Saintess Nan's attention.

Thinking this filled her with guilt—she believed she had ruined Yang Kai, caused him to die young, to meet an untimely end.

"Damn it, you have to teach me those moves, or this time I lose big!" Yang Kai's face was as white as paper; he gritted his teeth against the brutal pain and spoke urgently.

He had not expected the Heaven-Slaying Spear to pierce even his body. After entering the Demonic State Yang Kai's flesh had become absurdly strong—strong enough to withstand a starry-sky storm head-on—yet even that power could not block Saintess Nan's killing strike.

The sheer force of that blow was plainly terrifying.

Any Transcendent Realm cultivator struck by that attack would likely meet a shredded, pulverized end.

"What are you still worrying about now..." An Ling'er reached out and pressed her small hand over Yang Kai's wound, feeling blood trickle through her fingers; panic seized her, tears falling and wetting her clothes.

"Can you stop crying? Your sobbing is making me unsettled!" Yang Kai said with a sneer for a moment. "Why are you women so unable to handle pressure?"

At his words An Ling'er hurriedly quieted her sobs, but she could not stop choked breaths or the steady stream of tears.

At a corner ahead, about three zhang above the ground, a black, abyss-like opening suddenly appeared; Yang Kai's face brightened. "We're here!"

With a burst of speed he vaulted into the air, taking An Ling'er and plunging headfirst into the Void Passage.

No sooner had his front foot entered the Void Passage than Saintess Nan's killing strike arrived from behind.

At the final moment Yang Kai did not slacken: he hurled An Ling'er into the Void Passage, then spun around. With a high, resonant dragon cry a massive black jiao dragon surged up from his back, jaws ferocious as it met Saintess Nan's technique.

Rumbling thundered out...

Energy ran rampant; Spiritual Qi twisted into chaos.

The black jiao dragon held only an instant before being shattered; Saintess Nan's move, its momentum unspent, surged toward Yang Kai and swept into the Void Passage.

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile, blood sliding from the corner of his mouth as the demonic aura, foul and violent, erupted and lashed out in every direction.

The Void Passage, which had lain beneath the sea for untold years, could not withstand such an outburst. It finally collapsed; the released void force dissipated Saintess Nan's killing strike and then rolled toward Yang Kai's body.

The next instant Yang Kai felt dizzy and his vision went black—he nearly passed out.

Forcing himself to stay conscious, Yang Kai gradually cleared the darkness; above him white clouds floated across a blue sky, but there was no sun, moon, or stars, and the air carried a faint warmth.

That warmth made Yang Kai feel exceptionally comfortable.

He was still falling. He must have been transported through the Void Passage to another place, for Saintess Nan's aura was nowhere to be found.

Before leaving Yang Kai had deliberately destroyed the Void Passage—even if Saintess Nan possessed earth-shattering power, she would not find this place easily in the short term.

With that thought Yang Kai exhaled heavily; being hunted by a Saint Realm expert was no small matter.

Furthermore, Saintess Nan was at least a Second Stage Saint Realm expert; she was far stronger than Qian Yue of the Ice Sect, and Yang Kai had been utterly unable to resist her.

As he fell, a pair of jade arms caught him. Turning his head he saw An Ling'er, who had arrived earlier, smiling at him with tear-streaked cheeks still fresh.

Yang Kai staggered free, dropped onto the trunk of a great tree, gasping heavily as he looked around in stunned surprise.

He and An Ling'er were standing on the trunk of a towering tree some thirty zhang above the ground, surrounded by dense, vigorous forest.

Yang Kai noticed something odd: the trees here seemed different from those outside—not just in shape, but their trunks pulsed with a faint Yang-attributed energy.

In short, these trees seemed to possess Yang-attributed aura.

Yang Kai frowned in puzzlement. These should be ordinary trees, not heaven-and-earth treasures or spiritual herbs—so why did they give off Yang energy?

Glancing up at the sky, Yang Kai frowned and weakly said, "Small Xuan Realm?"

Only the Small Xuan Realm lacked sun, moon, and stars; the Small Xuan Realm where the Ancient Demon Clan dwelt was exactly like this.

"Ah? Small Xuan Realm?" An Ling'er was clearly surprised, but curiosity shone in her beautiful eyes—she had apparently never entered such a space and had only heard of it in rumors; coming here for the first time naturally felt new.

"No doubt about it—this must be an enclosed Small Xuan Realm!" Yang Kai nodded faintly, coughing violently as fresh blood flowed once more from his wounds.

"You should rest now!" An Ling'er anxiously supported him. From outward appearances his injuries were grave: not only had Saintess Nan's Heaven-Slaying Spear pierced him, but when the Void Passage was destroyed at the end it had seemed the explosive power and void force had left him covered in wounds—clothes torn, hideous gashes exposing missing flesh; the sight was harrowing.

Such injuries would have killed most people many times over, yet Yang Kai still had strength to speak and even to inspect the surroundings, leaving An Ling'er simultaneously crying and smiling.

She took from the Spatial Pouch at her waist a bottle of pills and handed it over: "These are healing sacred pills from my Sacred Land—take them immediately!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly, feeling himself weaken; he took the bottle, poured out several pills, and swallowed them.

Before the medicinal effects could be absorbed Yang Kai suddenly felt scorching cords of energy shoot in from all sides and wrap around him and An Ling'er.

The two, taken completely by surprise, were bound and fell to the ground.

Upon landing Yang Kai discovered he could not move.

Already at the end of his strength, being restrained in this way caused Yang Kai to lose consciousness.

Damn it—captured again? That thought flickered through his mind as his expression darkened.

Twice he entered different Small Xuan Realms and both times he was captured—first dragged in by a Coffin-Bearer, this time bursting in himself only to be trapped before he could learn the terrain—truly an unlucky run.

"Damn demons!" Yang Kai barely heard a low curse before blacking out; shapes flickered before his eyes and then he lost consciousness.

......

In pitch-black gloom Yang Kai slowly came to; his entire body ached—no matter how tough his flesh, such injuries could not be ignored.

He did not immediately sit up but first checked his condition.

After a moment his face grew somber.

Just as he had suspected, both his True Yuan and his Sea of Consciousness had been bound by prohibitive formations. The True Yuan seal would take some effort to break—though not impossible; it was likely placed by someone stronger than he was—while he was confident he could easily dispel the seal on his Sea of Consciousness. Still, to avoid drawing attention he did not dare act rashly.

He did not know where he was or what kind of experts were present; if he acted recklessly he might meet a miserable end.

What made him uneasy was that the seal carried the same Yang-attributed energy as his True Yuan, and here the Yang-attributed Spiritual Qi was denser than outside.

The energies he had sensed in the ancient ruins must have seeped from this place.

His wounds had already largely healed; judging from the pace of recovery, at least three days had passed since he lost consciousness.

There were nearby auras, but none belonged to An Ling'er.

Where had that woman gone?

She was quite beautiful; if she had fallen into unscrupulous hands the outcome would be dire. Yang Kai felt some worry.

He judged the place he was in to be a cell, constructed of special wood that looked exceedingly sturdy.

After a while his eyes adjusted to the light and he slowly sat up.

The noise he made carried outside, and before long someone came over, exclaiming in surprise, "Huh — you're still not dead? You're sure hard to kill!"

"Where is this? Who are you?" Yang Kai asked, fixing his gaze on the man.

"Talk too much! Careful or I'll pull out your tongue." The man snorted and, opening the cell door, said, "Get out—our leader wants to see you."

"Leader?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Behave, or I'll bury you as food for the Divine Tree!" The man tilted his head, gave Yang Kai a sidelong glance, and led the way: "Follow me."

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he said nothing and followed, quietly observing his surroundings.

The corridor was dark and damp; cells lined both sides and contained many prisoners, who all turned to look with peculiar expressions at the commotion.

Yang Kai watched those imprisoned and felt something off.

The auras emanating from these people were not ordinary—strictly speaking there were traces of demonic qi in every one of them.

Among them Yang Kai could not find An Ling'er and did not know where she had gone.
