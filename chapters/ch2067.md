## Chapter 2067 — Sudden Change

Zhang Ruoxi's ordeal made Yang Kai truly both ashamed and furious!

After all, he was, at the very least, a Dao Origin Realm expert now, yet because of a moment’s carelessness he had failed to protect a little girl who had been seized and dragged here to mine.

He had gone to the Jiang Family to pry for information, but the Jiang Family's high-ups had lied to his face.

That alone would have been bad enough, but the Jiang Family had actually considered killing witnesses to silence them.

How could Yang Kai possibly tolerate that? He had secretly decided that once they got out of here he would go to the Jiang Family and turn their house upside down until even chickens and dogs could not live in peace!

“Where are the Jiang Family men guarding the entrance?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice, a cold light flashing across his eyes.

“They're still over there,” Mo Xiaoqi answered. “And there were more than just those two Jiang Family men here; I ran into some on the way and used means to knock them unconscious. As for those who had been dragged here, they've already been sent out through the Space Array.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Once they go out, the Jiang Family won't be able to hide what's happened here, which makes it convenient for me to go make a scene at the Jiang Family; that way the city lord's manor won't easily be able to intervene.”

“So shall we return now?” Mo Xiaoqi asked.

Yang Kai nodded.

Having agreed, the two of them prepared to return to Fenglin City, but at that moment a strange change occurred.

A tremor like the shaking of mountains rolled up from beneath their feet, and both their faces changed.

At the same time, a cracking, grinding sound came from not far away.

Yang Kai frowned and stared toward the sound, only to find that along the cliff ahead there were blood-red patterns spreading out — patterns so complex and abstruse they resembled a seal.

The patterns writhed without cease, and as they writhed more of the blood-red color was sucked inward.

Only then did Yang Kai realize that the blood-red was the hue of fresh blood, and its source was the corpse of the Jiang Family white-robed warrior who had fallen to the ground earlier.

The sealing patterns on the cliff were now ravenously devouring the blood flowing from the white-robed warrior; as the blood poured in, the crimson patterns writhed faster and faster.

"What is this?" Yang Kai's expression changed dramatically; he stared ahead, full of alarm and doubt.

Mo Xiaoqi's face also suddenly grew solemn; she stared fixedly at the seal, her brows knit, clearly unable to identify what sort of seal it was in the moment.

Then, as if the seal had consumed enough blood, the patterns all at once converged toward the center of the cliff and formed a hideous, terrifying human face.

The face opened its mouth wide and a pitch-black, ink-like aura surged out from within the cliff.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; instinct told him something was wrong and he quickly pulled Mo Xiaoqi back.

The black aura kept gushing from the seal and soon filled the mine tunnel; Yang Kai could clearly sense savagery and the smell of blood within that dark air.

There was another scent he recognized.

The black vapors rapidly divided, slithering like a host of inky spirit snakes, writhing incessantly.

One strand of black air slid into the mouth and nose of the white-robed man who lay dead on the ground and quickly vanished.

Then, in the next instant, something happened that left Yang Kai dumbstruck.

The white-robed man, whose upper body had been pierced with a thousand wounds, suddenly opened his eyes, but his eyeballs were not the normal black-and-white; they had turned a strange, pitch-black color, grotesque and terrifying.

At the same time, black patterns abruptly appeared on the man's face, his arms, and the exposed skin of his body.

“Demon Marks?” Yang Kai cried out.

He was far too familiar with those patterns. Back on the Tongxuan Continent, the Ancient Demon Clan members he had once rescued had practiced a secret art that could brand the body with various Demon Marks.

And when he himself had once used the Enter Demonic State technique, the changes to his own body had been very similar to what he now witnessed.

“Demonic Qi?” Mo Xiaoqi uttered in a startled, girlish voice as if she too had sensed it.

No sooner had the two of them spoken than the white-robed man sprang up; his pitch-black eyes fixed on Yang Kai, and with a feral snarl he lunged at him as if utterly fearless of death.

Yang Kai snorted coldly; one arm held Zhang Ruoxi while his other hand flicked out five fingers, sending streaks of Golden Blood Threads surging forth.

A sizzling sound rose as the sharp Golden Blood Threads pierced the white-robed man, and with a toss from Yang Kai the body was cut into several pieces that fell to the ground without spilling any blood.

Yet Yang Kai felt no joy at having succeeded; instead his brow furrowed deeply.

He could sense that after being demonized the white-robed man's strength had increased considerably; although Yang Kai had dispatched him at a glance, the transformed man was undoubtedly far stronger than he had been in life.

Ssss…

At that moment the black aura filling the mine formed into those inky spirit snakes, which crazily shot toward Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi like cats detecting fishy scent.

“Not good, run!” Yang Kai's face darkened; shouting, he thrust a hand forward and called softly, “Exile!”

The power of the Laws of Space surged down and a black hole roughly the size of a round table calmly took shape; within the hole was nothingness and chaos, and the inky spirit snakes all plunged in at once and vanished.

Yet still more inky spirit snakes came, surging forward in unending waves.

Even more black aura spewed from the mouth of the human face on the wall.

The spatial technique lasted less than three breaths before it shattered with a thunderous crack, and those spirit-snake entities broke through Yang Kai's barrier and rapidly pursued him from behind.

Without looking back, Yang Kai knew trouble was brewing behind him. With no time to handle those eerie things, he urged his Origin Qi, wrapped Mo Xiaoqi within it, and dashed toward the entrance like a man fleeing for his life.

After a winding route, the two soon arrived back at the spot where they had been teleported earlier.

There the two Jiang Family Void King Realm warriors still lay pale on the ground, watching as Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi stepped onto the Space Array; one of them opened his mouth as if to say something, but no words came out.

It was unclear what method Mo Xiaoqi had used, but somehow she had restrained them in place.

“Eldest Brother, they're almost on us!” Mo Xiaoqi looked back and cried; the innumerable inky spirit-snake entities were less than thirty zhang away, and her pretty face turned pale.

Yang Kai's expression was as dark as still water; he hurriedly poured Spatial Force into the Array.

In the next moment the array hummed and light flared; when the light faded, the two of them had vanished.

The inky spirit-snake entities rushed to where the array had been and struck at empty air.

But upon sweeping over that spot those uncanny things enveloped the two Jiang Family Void King Realm warriors.

Horrible screams immediately issued from the black air, sounds of agony beyond imagining.

Moments later, the screams cut off without warning. The two of them rose from the ground at the same time; though their outward forms remained unchanged, their auras were nothing like before. A savage, dark force radiated from their bodies, which were wrapped in black energy, Demon Marks crawling across their cheeks and arms, and their eyes turning pitch-black.

The two exchanged a glance and leered; one of them threw back his head and howled, a cry full of boundless joy and exultation, as if a prison of ten million years had been broken in a single instant.

They were not the only warriors to suffer this fate.

Within the pit many of the Jiang Family warriors whom Mo Xiaoqi had earlier knocked unconscious had experienced the same transformation, and some of the miners who had not escaped in time were likewise ensnared by the black aura; in a very short time their auras drastically changed and their original consciousness seemed to vanish.

Very quickly the entire mine was filled with that pitch-black air...

In the cave on the barren mountain, light flashed and Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi appeared on the Space Array, shaken but safe.

Beside the array the Jiang Family warrior Yang Kai had earlier stunned had mysteriously disappeared.

Yang Kai frowned and swept his Divine Sense outward, his face showing surprise.

“Eldest Brother, what's wrong?” Mo Xiaoqi asked in bewilderment as she watched him.

“Quite a few people are out there welcoming us,” Yang Kai sneered.

Mo Xiaoqi's brows creased; she released her Divine Sense and immediately detected something.

“Let's go take a look,” Yang Kai told her, confidently flying out of the cave first and hovering in midair.

A sweep of his eyes revealed that the area was surrounded by warriors, and every one of the faces was familiar — they were all people from the Jiang Family he had seen earlier.

He had no idea when the news had leaked, but the Jiang Family had clearly emptied the nest—every expert they could muster had rushed to this place.

Not far ahead, Jiang Lin, the Jiang Family's Family Head, and many high-ranking members stared at Yang Kai with cold eyes, clearly displeased.

In front of Jiang Lin stood an old man in a dark robe with his hands clasped behind his back; he gave off no discernible aura and looked like an ordinary person, yet an indescribable majesty hung about him.

When some Jiang Family warriors looked toward this old man their eyes were filled with reverence.

Even Jiang Lin stood behind the old man, appearing extremely respectful.

Yang Kai's expression moved; glancing at the old man he immediately knew this must be the Jiang Family's Dao Origin Realm expert, the Jiang Family's ancestral elder, Jiang Taisheng.

After all, Dao Origin Realm experts were few in number in Fenglin City, and any such name was widely known among the city's warriors.

At this moment Jiang Taisheng looked at Yang Kai with indifference, and his gaze only briefly flicked to Zhang Ruoxi in Yang Kai's arms before moving away.

It was as if to him no one warranted the slightest further attention.

Yang Kai let out a low, amused chuckle, his smile full of mischief.
