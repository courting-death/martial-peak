## Chapter 2518 — Gao Xueting in Trouble

The young man chuckled and said, "Sir, don't be so serious. I was just speaking casually just now, I didn't really mean to insult you. Alright, alright, I'm going into this shop to buy something now, could you please make way?"

For some reason, this ordinary sentence seemed to have a strange power. After a moment's hesitation, the leading guard actually stepped aside, letting the man and woman enter the shop.

The other City Lord’s mansion guards all looked at their Commander with odd expressions. They wanted to ask, but didn’t dare to be rash, each one full of doubt.

"What the hell!" In a nearby teahouse, the one responsible for monitoring Qingyang Pavilion, a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator, jumped three feet high and quickly sent out his Divine Sense to question the Commander: "What are you doing?"

"Lord Jia!" Hearing this transmission, the Commander immediately straightened up.

"Didn't I tell you not to let anyone in? You dare defy this Lord’s order? You must have a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall!"

"I let someone in?" The Commander was startled, but soon recalled what he had just done. In an instant, cold sweat drenched his forehead and his face turned pale as he said, "How could I have let someone in..."

He didn’t know what had happened just now. Although his mind was clear, he simply couldn’t resist the young man’s words and obediently made way, letting him walk straight into Qingyang Pavilion.

If not for Lord Jia’s transmission, he might not have remembered at all.

"Divine Soul attack!" Seeing the Commander’s expression, Lord Jia immediately knew he had fallen victim to a Divine Soul secret technique, making him act against his will.

"Lord Jia, what should we do now? Should I take some men in and capture that person?" the Commander asked quietly.

"No rush, this person seems quite formidable. Besides, we don’t know what he’s here for—maybe he really is just here to buy something. Let’s wait and see," Lord Jia replied.

"Yes!"

Inside the shop, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi looked around and found that the shop was indeed very small, with few goods inside. Everything was placed in a mess, and nothing seemed valuable.

Near the counter sat two shop assistants, both with weak cultivation. At this moment, they wore mournful faces, looking as if their world had ended. From time to time, they glanced nervously at the guards outside, muttering unconsciously, "It’s over, it’s over, we’re finished. Who knows what trouble the Shopkeeper has gotten into, we’re doomed!"

The nerves of these two assistants seemed stretched to the limit. When Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi entered, they didn’t even notice.

Yang Kai glanced at them but paid no further attention. Instead, he looked toward the back of the shop and walked straight to the rear courtyard.

Passing through a corridor, he arrived at a small garden. In front of a room at the inner side, Yang Kai stopped and gently knocked on the door.

"Who is it!" A woman’s voice suddenly came from inside. She sounded extremely tired and haggard, as if she hadn’t rested for days.

Yang Kai replied in a deep voice, "A customer."

The woman inside was silent for a moment, then said, "The shop has some trouble lately and is temporarily closed. Please leave, guest."

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said, "I’ve come all the way from the Southern Territory just to buy something, and you’re telling me to leave?"

"Southern Territory..." A low exclamation came from inside, followed by the sound of wind. The door creaked open, and a haggard young woman suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

The woman looked about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, dressed neatly. Though not especially beautiful, she was very pleasant to look at.

Perhaps something had happened to her recently, for her eyes were slightly bloodshot and her eye sockets sunken, but those bright eyes still shone as she stared intently at Yang Kai, as if trying to see through him.

"You... really came from the Southern Territory?" the woman asked nervously.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "That’s right."

With a glance, he could tell this woman was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and her aura was somewhat unstable. She had the cultivation, but clearly couldn’t bring out its full strength.

He didn’t know if it was because she hadn’t worked hard in cultivation, or if something had gone wrong in her practice.

"Do you have any proof?" the woman asked, still uneasy.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, took out his Qingyang gold token, and waved it in front of her.

The woman’s eyes instantly brightened, and all her wariness vanished as if she’d seen a family member. Her tense expression relaxed, and she stepped aside, saying, "Come in and talk."

Yang Kai nodded and entered the room with Zhang Ruoxi.

The woman glanced outside to make sure no one was hiding nearby, then closed the door and quickly set up several layers of restrictions with a wave of her hands.

When she finished, Yang Kai looked at her with a gloomy face and asked, "What trouble have you run into to be so on guard? And what’s with those people surrounding the shop?"

The woman didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she solemnly took out a token from her Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai with both hands.

The token looked exactly like Yang Kai’s Qingyang gold token, except his was gold and hers was bronze, symbolizing a difference in status.

Although Yang Kai wasn’t familiar with the ranking of Qingyang Shrine’s disciple tokens, he could guess that gold was the highest, followed by silver, then bronze—there was a two-level gap between them.

"Just so Senior Brother is aware, I am Lu Wen, disciple of Elder Chen Qian."

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. He knew Chen Qian, one of Qingyang Shrine’s Elders, a First Stage Emperor Realm cultivator mainly in charge of logistics and supplies. Yang Kai had dealt with her a few times, but she always seemed cold and hard to approach.

"Senior Brother, are you Senior Brother Xia Sheng?" Lu Wen asked curiously, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai curled his lip and snorted, "Could Xia Sheng be as handsome as me?"

Lu Wen’s expression turned odd, apparently not expecting this Senior Brother to be so narcissistic. She blushed and said, "Then are you Senior Brother Xiao Baiyi?"

Yang Kai’s face darkened. "I’m not Xia Sheng, nor Xiao Baiyi. My name is Yang Kai."

"Senior Brother Yang..." Lu Wen frowned, as if the name was unfamiliar.

Yang Kai said, "Since you’re a disciple of Qingyang Shrine, how do you not know Xia Sheng and Xiao Baiyi? They’re the most elite disciples in the Shrine."

Lu Wen replied awkwardly, "I left Qingyang Shrine a long time ago and haven’t returned in years, so I’ve never met those two Senior Brothers."

Yang Kai was surprised. "Is that so... Then how did you come to the Eastern Territory and open a shop here?"

Lu Wen replied, "I came here on a mission for the Shrine. The shop was opened for convenience, and I reported everything to my master, who supported me."

"Tell me about it," Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

"Although the Shrine is a Sect of the Southern Territory, it needs to gather intelligence from the other three territories as well. So in each territory, there are at least seven or eight, sometimes twenty or thirty fellow disciples collecting all kinds of information and reporting back regularly. I’m the one responsible for this in Kunyuan City. We usually hide our identities and only reveal ourselves if our lives are in danger."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai said in surprise.

Lu Wen smiled, "Senior Brother Yang must be an elite disciple of the Sect, so you don’t need to know about these things. You just need to focus on cultivation and becoming stronger. These tasks are usually handled by those with less talent, who have no hope of advancing in cultivation."

Managing these affairs required a lot of time and energy, which hindered cultivation, so elite disciples were never put in charge.

Yang Kai nodded, "You’ve worked hard."

Lu Wen smiled slightly, "It’s nothing. Only when Senior Brothers become stronger will the Sect flourish, and people like us have a place to belong. Everyone has their role. Not only Qingyang Shrine, but all the great Sects do this. Many disciples go to various places in the Star Realm to gather intelligence."

"So what trouble did you encounter?" Yang Kai asked.

Lu Wen’s expression dimmed. "It’s not me who’s in trouble, it’s Elder Gao."

Yang Kai was startled. "Elder Gao? Which Elder Gao?"

After asking, he suddenly realized and exclaimed, "Gao Xueting, Elder Gao?"

"Yes."

Yang Kai’s expression changed. "Elder Gao came to the Eastern Territory?"

"That’s right, and now she may be in mortal danger."

"What happened?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

Lu Wen said, "Please calm down, Senior Brother. I’ll explain in detail."

With Lu Wen’s explanation, Yang Kai finally understood what was going on.

Lu Wen had left Qingyang Shrine for Kunyuan City over twenty years ago, gathering all kinds of intelligence and sending it back to the Sect. For convenience, she opened a shop here—not to make money, but to cover her identity, so she didn’t run it seriously and the business was a mess.

Half a year ago, Lu Wen bought half a piece of beast hide from a down-and-out martial artist. The seller claimed it was a family heirloom hiding an ancient secret.

Lu Wen didn’t believe such nonsense, but seeing the man’s pitiful state, she bought the hide out of sympathy.

After buying it, she studied it for a long time without any results. Feeling strange, she sent the hide, along with the intelligence she’d gathered, back to Qingyang Shrine through special channels.

Three months ago, Gao Xueting suddenly came to Kunyuan City to ask her about the beast hide.

Only then did Lu Wen realize the hide might really be important, perhaps hiding some secret—otherwise, why would a powerhouse like Gao Xueting come?

When questioned by the Sect Elder, Lu Wen answered everything truthfully.

Unfortunately, Gao Xueting didn’t get any useful clues from her.

In the following period, Gao Xueting kept researching the secret of the beast hide, sometimes leaving Kunyuan City for a while. Lu Wen didn’t know exactly what she was doing.
