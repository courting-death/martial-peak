## Chapter 1752 — Saying No with the Lips

After a brief, thoughtful pause, Yang Kai bowed with cupped fists toward Ni Guang and said, "I appreciate your kindness, Elder; I accept it in spirit, but my strength is meager—if I go with you, I am afraid I will only hold you back."

"Heh." Ni Guang smiled faintly. "You have self-awareness, but... since I invited you, I am confident I can ensure your safety. What, are you questioning my methods?"

Yang Kai frowned, and Luo Lan's expression shifted slightly; she shot Yang Kai a glance to warn him to mind his words.

Yang Kai gave a small chuckle and again spoke, "Elder, your strength is profound and your cultivation superb; I would never doubt that. It's just... I came along with Elder Luo on this trip, so..."

“So much hesitation—spoiling everyone’s mood!” Ni Guang snorted coldly, clearly displeased with Yang Kai’s evasiveness. He gave Yang Kai a deep look and said, “Since that’s the case, you shall accompany Elder Luo. Elder Luo, how about joining forces with this old man to enter together?”

His last words were addressed to Luo Lan.

Luo Lan paused, a flicker of hesitation and inner struggle crossing her face, but she soon recovered and smiled, "Senior Ni is most kind; I will not refuse the courtesy."

Saying that, she glanced at Yang Kai, then led the way, flying over toward Ni Guang.

With her already gone, there was no point for Yang Kai to persist; he sighed and followed after her.

In no time the two of them had come to Ni Guang and Xue Yue's side, forming a small group.

Among those present, only Ni Guang had brought along Xue Yue, an Origin Returning Realm; the other Void King Realm cultivators had come alone. With Luo Lan and Yang Kai joining, Ni Guang's side immediately numbered four.

That numerical advantage alone crushed everyone else, but whether the two Origin Returning Realm fighters would be a drag or could play a significant role remained unknown.

After inviting Luo Lan and Yang Kai, Ni Guang lost the desire to speak and merely stood in the void with his eyes closed, cultivating.

Luo Lan, now at his side, also appeared restrained—after all, her cultivation was not as deep as Ni Guang's, and she did not belong to the same force, so she felt somewhat uneasy.

Yang Kai was even more sullen, silent and withdrawn.

Xue Yue folded her fan with a smile and said, “Brother Yang, the world is full of chance meetings—who would’ve thought I’d run into you here as well? Truly, fate has a curious way.”

“What do you want?” Yang Kai glared at her and said bluntly, “Let me make this clear first—I’ve got no interest in any fondness between men, so don’t get too familiar with me!”

Luo Lan suddenly turned her head; a strange light flickered in her beautiful eyes as she looked at Yang Kai and then at Xue Yue—her expression was shocked and bewildered.

Even Ni Guang, who had been about to close his eyes and cultivate, opened them in an instant; his face was as strange as could be.

"You..." Xue Yue had never expected Yang Kai to blurt such shameless words as soon as he arrived; her face flamed scarlet and her whole body trembled with anger, "What... what fondness between men? Don’t talk nonsense, will you?”

“Hmph!” Yang Kai snorted through his nose, putting on a haughty expression. “What’s in your heart—you’re the only one who knows.”

The ambiguous nature of that remark made Xue Yue even more flustered. Coupled with the odd looks from Luo Lan and Ni Guang, she suddenly found herself unable to control her emotions, the flush on her face quickly spreading to her neck.

"Heh... heh heh..." Luo Lan did not know what to say either; she let out a meaningless laugh, apparently trying to ease the awkwardness, but only made Xue Yue feel more embarrassed.

"You... if you speak rudely again, I'll kill you!" Xue Yue gritted her teeth, putting on a stance as though she and Yang Kai were sworn enemies, desperately trying to clarify her orientation.

"Could you bring yourself to?" Yang Kai sneered, looking straight into Xue Yue's eyes.

Xue Yue had no reply; her teeth ground together audibly and her Saint Yuan trembled as if about to run amok.

Ni Guang narrowed his eyes and chuckled. “Boy, you’ve got quite the nerve—daring to spout nonsense even before this old man. No wonder Third Young Master regards you differently. But… enough fooling around. Any further, and it’ll just look like you’re showing off for attention.”

Yang Kai grinned widely and shrugged his shoulders.

Since Ni Guang had already warned him like that, he naturally wouldn’t push his luck. He had only been annoyed that Xue Yue insisted on tying herself to him, so he merely wanted to disgust her a little, nothing more.

After saying that, Ni Guang closed his eyes again as if nothing had happened.

Luo Lan, however, was in turmoil; her gaze flickered between Yang Kai and Xue Yue as if trying to discover whether there was some unspeakable dirty secret between the two young men of talent.

Could the renowned Third Young Master Xue Yue actually prefer men to women? Otherwise why would he look so guilty? What, then, had occurred between these two promising youths?

Luo Lan's mind ran wild with fantasies until her own cheeks flushed...

"You, come here!" Xue Yue suddenly regained her composure, the flush ebbing from her face; she barked at Yang Kai and then flew off toward a distant spot.

She obviously wanted to find a quiet place to talk with Yang Kai, lest he say anything else embarrassing.

Yang Kai frowned, reluctant to follow, but thinking of how Ni Guang might react, he helplessly caught up.

"Young people are always reckless; Elder Luo need not mind it," Ni Guang said abruptly after the two had gone.

"Heh heh, Senior Ni is right," Luo Lan forced a laugh.

Thirty li from the entrance, Xue Yue halted and turned to glance back; complex emotions gleamed in her beautiful eyes. Once Yang Kai came up beside her, she sprang at him and scolded, "Why are you like this!"

"Why are you like this?" Yang Kai retorted.

"What do you mean by that?" Xue Yue ground her teeth.

"If you see me, just see me—pretend you don't notice and it's fine. Why drag me along?" Yang Kai said, full of annoyance.

"Do you know how dangerous the Lost Realm is? Even Void King Realm cultivators cannot guarantee their safety there. I asked you to go with Uncle Ni because I don't want anything to happen to you—can't you see I'm doing this for your own good?" Xue Yue snapped, nearly spitting on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suddenly gave a sly smile and stared at Xue Yue's face without looking away.

"What are you doing?" Xue Yue felt unsettled by the aggressive look and involuntarily took two steps back.

"Aren't you the one who said you'd kill me to silence me? Why are you so concerned about me now?" Yang Kai said with a playful smile. "I know your secret—wouldn't my death suit you just fine? Then your secret would be safe. You're acting like you care for me; it's almost as if you like me, beauty. That's not right, is it?"

Xue Yue sneered, "Spare me the self-importance. Who do you think you are, and who do you think I am, Xue Yue, that I would fall for a shameless fellow like you? You're giving yourself too much credit."

Yang Kai's face grew solemn; he stroked his chin in apparent thoughtfulness. That focused expression stabbed Xue Yue unexpectedly—she feared she had spoken too harshly and hurt his pride, and she felt a pang of regret.

Then, incomprehensibly serious, Yang Kai said, "Shouldn't a woman have a special feeling for her first man? Am I wrong?"

"Who is the first man?" Xue Yue ground her teeth and shouted each word.

"Although nothing substantial has developed between us, at least we have been physically close and honest with one another..." Yang Kai's words cut off as his expression changed and he reached out into the void before him.

From that void a surging burst of Saint Yuan exploded forth—the aura of death pouring from Xue Yue's hand as she struck.

With a thunderous crash Yang Kai's body trembled, but he took the chance to seize Xue Yue's small hand, twist his body, and throw himself behind her, looping her hand around her neck to bind her.

Xue Yue tried to struggle, but Yang Kai moved like lightning and seized her other hand.

In an instant Xue Yue was subdued!

Her expression changed, and she gasped, "You've become this formidable?"

"Don't underestimate me, beauty." Yang Kai breathed in her ear, tightening his hold. "And meeting like this—so much fighting and killing right away—isn't very proper."

"Let go!" Xue Yue bit her thin lip.

The warm breath at her ear made her tingle all over; the body pressed against her back radiated alarming heat—memories of what had happened between them on that Dead Star flooded Xue Yue's mind.

Those were scenes that always set her skin aflame whenever she recalled them...

"Don't do this!" Xue Yue struggled, but could not free herself from Yang Kai's grip; her voice dropped, "If someone sees us, how will I explain?"

Yang Kai stared at her reddened earlobe and laughed madly, "You say no with your lips, but your body’s being honest!"

That ambiguous remark made Xue Yue even more ashamed; she drew a deep breath and tried to steady her tone, "Stop fooling around—let go. I promise I won't lay a hand on you."

Yang Kai considered earnestly for a moment and nodded, "All right."

Xue Yue's earlier strike had not carried killing intent; she had clearly not meant to take his life, so Yang Kai did not hold it against her.

As he spoke he released both of Xue Yue's hands.

The moment she broke free, Xue Yue sprang forward some ten-odd zhang, rapidly widening the distance between them and glaring at him with the look of someone who would gladly rip him limb from limb.

After a while she tidied her somewhat-disheveled clothing and, using the motion, gradually calmed her emotions.

"Speak plainly—what is your motive?" Yang Kai's expression turned grave, a world away from his earlier lewdness.

Xue Yue felt terribly disoriented...

"Why did you have Ni Guang invite me for no reason? What are you trying to do?"

"For your own good—you don't believe me?" Xue Yue arched a brow.

"So you do like me..." Yang Kai said darkly.

"Shameless!"

Yang Kai laughed heartily, "Just joking—don't be so worked up."

Xue Yue took several deep breaths and finally spoke in a composed tone, "Our arrangement in the Imperial Garden wasn't completed last time; you haven't forgotten that, have you?"
