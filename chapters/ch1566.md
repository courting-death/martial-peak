## Chapter 1566 — Guidance

It was the same when entering this Huiyue City—Monster Race cultivators only needed to pay three middle-grade Saint Crystals, yet Yang Kai had to pay one upper-grade Saint Crystal.

Yang Kai had no real complaint about this; after paying two Saint Crystals he and Xia Ningshang entered the city.

The streets were exceedingly wide, wide enough for several four-horse carriages to drive side by side. Lining the avenues were shops of every kind, dazzling to the eye, and from time to time human and yao warriors streamed in and out, the whole place a picture of bustling activity.

The shopkeepers catered eagerly to customers, doing everything to attract business to their stalls.

As Yang Kai walked along he noticed that most shops were run by humans; yao-run shops were comparatively rare.

When it came to commerce, humans clearly had a greater talent for it than yao.

Strolling and taking in the sights, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened little by little.

He discovered that on this Di Chen Star there were many cultivation materials that did not exist on the Dark Star, which was to be expected—each place or region produced its own unique goods.

The Yao Star Di Chen, being a cultivation star dominated by the yao, naturally had markets overflowing with materials taken from demonic beasts—their body parts and Inner Cores were the most commonly traded items.

This discovery startled Yang Kai.

He had not expected that in a yao city people would so openly trade in demonic beasts.

It puzzled him; after all, many yao individuals were embodiments of demonic beasts—would they not feel disgusted by such commerce?

In a city on the Dark Star, if someone were to sell human limbs or organs, no one would dare patronize them.

But the more Yang Kai considered it, the more he accepted that the practice made a kind of brutal sense: if demonic beasts were plentiful here and trading in their parts was commonplace, people would simply grow accustomed to it. Besides, not all yao were former demonic beasts; even those who had been would, in their beastly days, kill weaker kin, gnaw their flesh, and swallow their Inner Cores to grow stronger.

Yang Kai watched with keen interest.

"Junior Brother, there are so many high-grade materials here," Xia Ningshang said, her eyes shining.

On the Tongxuan Continent she had been limited by the grade of materials produced there and so could not refine higher-tier pills, but arriving on Di Chen was like stepping into a vast treasure vault; the sight of so many premium materials made her wish she could buy it all and return home to refine pills.

Having absorbed the Stellar Origin, the rise and fall of the Tongxuan Continent was tied to her, so Xia Ningshang was eager to increase her power.

For her, refining pills was cultivation—through pillcraft she could raise her cultivation at a disturbingly fast pace.

"Hm, it’s a pity we don’t have many Saint Crystals left," Yang Kai said, a little troubled.

Xia Ningshang had her eye on many materials, and he did too; but most of the Saint Crystals he carried had been used when she refined the Stellar Origin. What remained was only for backup and could not buy in bulk.

Seeing the disappointment in Xia Ningshang’s eyes, Yang Kai smiled faintly. "But buying a few things is still fine."

Little Senior Sister immediately smiled; her eyes curved into pretty crescent moons.

The two of them entered a shop and began inspecting the goods, bargaining with the proprietor.

Half a day later, Xia Ningshang’s Spatial Ring was filled with many materials for pill-refining.

Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring still held much as well—herbs he had collected on the Floating Continent and in the Imperial Garden, and others bought on the Dark Star. Paired with those demonic beast Inner Cores, many ancient pill formulas from the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy could be used.

Yang Kai had long been unable to gather the materials these ancient formulas required—most demanded demonic beast Inner Cores, and powerful demonic beasts were scarce on the Dark Star; even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice.

But Di Chen abundantly satisfied his needs; while other things might be scarce here, body materials of demonic beasts were countless.

He was already considering whether to linger here for a while and thoroughly scour the place.

Besides pill-refining materials, his Blood Beast cultivation also required the spirit essences of demonic beasts, and refining Void King-Grade pills demanded them as well.

Yet... the lack of Saint Crystals remained the greatest problem.

After buying the materials, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang went to the nearest inn and rented an excellent side room.

Although Huiyue City’s architectural style was rough, the side room they occupied had been arranged with exquisite care. Not only were the room’s conditions superb, but formations had been set around it to block others from peering with Divine Sense.

This was, in a way, to protect the guests’ privacy.

The inn’s owner was a yao warrior, but unlike many of his kind he was not overbearing; the old man was gentle and affable, greeting Yang Kai, his Senior Sister and Junior Brother warmly, which slightly changed Yang Kai’s poor impression of the yao.

After settling Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai left the inn to begin gathering intelligence through Huiyue City.

He had not forgotten the main reason he had come: to see how to get close to Lady Chi Yue’s palace to find Shan Qingluo.

After lingering in Huiyue City for several days, Yang Kai remained at a loss over the matter.

He had, however, used his limited Saint Crystals to purchase some precious demonic beast materials.

"Young man, you seem to have something on your mind."

One day, while Yang Kai sat in the inn drinking and brooding, the proprietor walked over with a smile, added a side dish to Yang Kai’s table, and took a seat opposite him.

"I noticed you’ve been sniffing around the palace matter these past days; are you trying to see the Lady?" The yao elder’s expression was amiable; he looked to be in his fifties or sixties, a little stooped, and had been attentive to Yang Kai in recent days, trying to meet his needs.

Yang Kai chuckled when the man sat and said, “To be honest, I’m not trying to see the Lady.”

"Oh?" The innkeeper looked interested. "Then what do you plan to do? You should know your prying has attracted attention—yao aren’t exactly friendly to humans."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded slightly. In the days he had been asking around he had indeed felt that—those yao warriors either sneered at him, treated him with contempt, or spoke harshly and threatened him.

If not for so many rules in Lady Chi Yue’s domain, some yao might have already made a move against him.

A mere human actually dared to pry into the affairs of the Lady’s palace—truly ignorant of heaven’s height and earth’s depth.

"If you’re not trying to see the Lady, what then?" the innkeeper asked.

"To be frank, a friend of mine should be in the Lady’s palace. I haven’t seen her for decades; our last meeting was fleeting and we didn’t have a proper farewell, so I want to pay her a visit," Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Friend… heh heh, you mean a woman, right?” The innkeeper grinned slyly, wearing the knowing look of someone who’d seen it all.

Yang Kai let out an awkward chuckle.

"Does she fancy you?" the innkeeper pressed.

"Er, you’re a nosy fellow," Yang Kai said, his face reddening.

The old man smiled but did not press the matter; instead he sighed, "Young man, you’re a fortunate one. The girl who came with you is a fine lass—reclusive—and there are women outside who have you on their minds. Ah, this old man envies you."

Then he changed tack: "Actually, finding out about matters within the palace is quite simple."

"Oh? Please do tell, sir." Yang Kai perked up and listened humbly.

"People from the palace go out to purchase supplies about once a month. Huiyue City isn’t far from the palace and is fairly prosperous, so the palace usually makes it a priority; every month some people from the palace come here. You just need to wait a few days and you’ll see the palace’s maidservants; if luck is with you, you might even meet that woman directly."

The innkeeper had, like the first yao warrior Yang Kai had encountered, assumed Yang Kai’s friend in the palace was merely a maid.

After all, for a human to enter the Lady’s palace, such an identity was typical.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened.

Although the innkeeper had mistaken Shan Qingluo’s position, this was still a viable approach.

If a maid coming out of the palace could be persuaded to pass a message to Shan Qingluo, all the difficulties would be solved.

"Thank you for the guidance!" Yang Kai said joyfully, clasping his fist.

"No trouble, no trouble, I didn’t do much—no need to thank me," the old man replied.

"Sir," Yang Kai smiled and looked at him, "you seem different from other yao in your attitude toward humans. Do you not dislike humans?"

"Dislike? Why would I?" The innkeeper laughed and looked at Yang Kai. "Humans are good—when I was young I knew a very special human..."

Yang Kai clearly saw a flash of deep, almost indissoluble tenderness in the man’s eyes.

Suddenly he understood something.

"Never mind, go ahead and enjoy your meal. This old man is getting on in years; I’ll lie down for a while," the innkeeper said, his spirits suddenly flagging as he rose, his back seeming even more stooped.

Yang Kai sighed softly.

It seemed the innkeeper had once loved a human woman in his youth.

Cross-species love and unions were not easily tolerated anywhere, and here on the yao-dominated Di Chen humans had little standing.

Yet precisely because such unions were forbidden, many places produced tragic, heroic tales of lovers who were forced apart or who perished together—moving and mournful legends.

Yang Kai did not dwell on it; after a few drinks he returned to the side room, reminded Xia Ningshang of a few things while she refined pills, and then headed straight for the city gate.

According to the innkeeper, the palace maids would be coming out to purchase supplies in the next few days. Yang Kai planned to keep watch, hoping to find someone suitable to deliver a message to Shan Qingluo.
