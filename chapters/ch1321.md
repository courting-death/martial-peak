## Chapter 1321 — Ambush

Shen Shitao indeed brought good news: the Origin Returning Realm elder who knows Shen Fanlei returned on schedule last night, and when Shen Fanlei asked him this morning he refused nothing and agreed outright. Now the Space Array in Black Crow City has been fully prepared; Yang Kai can set out for Tianyun City at any time.

Moreover, Shen Fanlei paid all the expenses required for Yang Kai and the other two to use the Space Array.

Yang Kai was not surprised by this—after all, the Shen siblings are people who remember and repay kindness, and a few Saint Crystals mean little to them. Yang Kai made no fuss; he called to Yang Yan and Qian Yue, and under Shen Shitao's lead they headed toward the Space Array in Black Crow City.

Every city's Space Array is guarded in layers and overseen by many experts; Black Crow City was naturally no exception.

As they entered the hall where the Space Array stood, Yang Kai immediately sensed at least four Origin Returning Realm cultivators concealing their auras nearby. Beside the array a middle-aged man, dressed like a scholar, was speaking with Shen Fanlei—his face warm with smiles and nodding occasionally; he seemed to be on good terms with Shen Fanlei.

Yang Kai instantly knew that this middle-aged scholar was the elder the Shen siblings had spoken of.

Seeing Yang Kai and the others arrive, Shen Fanlei excused himself to the middle-aged scholar and hurried forward to meet them, smiling, "Brother Yang, I have not failed to deliver—everything is ready."

"Thank you, Brother Shen!" Yang Kai said politely, clasping his fists as he followed him to the Space Array.

Shen Fanlei pointed at the middle-aged scholar and said, "This is Jiang Wenjie, Elder Jiang. The reason we can use the Space Array so easily this time is because Elder Jiang assisted with it."

"My thanks, Elder Jiang," Yang Kai nodded lightly to the man.

The man swept his gaze up and down Yang Kai, then smiled faintly and said, “Truly, heroes emerge from the young. Nephew Yang looks quite young, yet like Nephew Shen, he has already reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. Given time, your future will surely be limitless.”

Jiang Wenjie spoke thus only out of courtesy to Shen Fanlei and was not personally close to Yang Kai, but faced with such praise Yang Kai naturally offered a couple of modest replies.

Soon after, Jiang Wenjie ordered the array to be activated. After bidding farewell to the Shen siblings, Yang Kai, Yang Yan and Qian Yue stepped onto the Space Array.

In the next moment the Space Array flared and the ripples of spatial power spread. As the three blurred, Jiang Wenjie suddenly looked at Yang Kai and his lips moved slightly.

A flash of sharp light passed through Yang Kai's eyes; there was no time to ask, and a faint dizziness washed over him.

Elsewhere, on a Space Array tens of thousands of li from Black Crow City, the three of them manifested.

Yang Kai had trained in spatial power, so such long-distance transmission posed little burden to him; he could even use it to ponder the mysteries of spatial force.

But neither Yang Yan nor Qian Yue could take it as lightly as he did. After the teleport they both felt their heads heavy and muddled—nothing serious; after briefly circulating their Saint Yuan they dispelled the discomfort.

Looking around, Yang Yan's expression turned utterly puzzled, while Qian Yue said in surprise, "Is this the Tianyun City you spoke of? Why is no one here?"

“This isn’t Tianyun City!” Yang Kai’s expression turned as dark as still water. At last, he understood what Jiang Wenjie’s final whispered warning—telling him to stay vigilant—had truly meant.

Scanning the surroundings, although this was also a great hall with a Space Array beneath their feet, it was utterly dilapidated—clearly not the Tianyun City from his memory, but more like an abandoned ruined city.

"Indeed, this is not Tianyun City!" a sinister voice suddenly came from the side. Qian Yue and Yang Yan were startled and turned to see a familiar face wearing a vicious, triumphant smile, strolling toward them. The man's gaze at Yang Kai seemed ready to spit flames, as if nursing a deep grudge.

The moment he saw that face, Yang Kai understood everything. Staring at the man, he grinned and said, “Brother Wang, it truly is a small world, isn’t it?”

Wang Yuhan sneered, "I waited for you here on purpose. This is the burial ground I chose for you, Brother Yang—see if it pleases you."

"Not bad, not bad. As a burial place it is indeed fitting—though I do not know whether it will be yours or mine!" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly. "Steward Wang has come too, hasn't he? Since he's here, why hide—show yourselves openly."

As he spoke he turned his head toward the ruins at the side.

From behind the rubble a sallow-faced old man slowly emerged. Behind him trailed several Saint King Realm cultivators, each regarding Yang Kai with hostile expressions. One or two cast lecherous, wicked looks at Qian Yue that made her shiver.

Seeing this, Qian Yue went pale—didn't she know they'd stepped straight into the gates of hell? Though ignorant of the precise scheme, she faintly suspected the earlier transmission had been tampered with.

"The young man's tone is arrogant—truly ignorant of how high the heavens are and how formidable those stand behind him!" Elder Wang snorted coldly.

Wang Yuhan laughed wildly, his face feral, "Yang Kai, when you spoiled my plans time and again you never imagined you'd have this day, did you? It's too late for regrets now."

"Regret? You flatter yourself too highly." Yang Kai looked at him coldly, without a shred of surprise or panic. Wang Yuhan was greatly astonished—he had expected the other to be flustered, perhaps even to beg on his knees so he could humiliate and torment him to vent his grudge. That such intimidation had no effect filled him with a deep sense of impotence.

Yang Kai knew Wang Yuhan would not let matters drop, but he had not expected there to be an abandoned ruined city here, nor that the Space Array would still function.

In his calculations the three of them would teleport from Black Crow City directly to Tianyun City; even if Wang Yuhan sought revenge, he would have no opportunity—and Yang Kai was not afraid of him in any case.

He had not expected his party to be sent here, nor that Elder Wang's capability was so great as to coordinate with Black Crow City. Jiang Wenjie must have known something, which was why he warned him at the last moment—doing Shen Fanlei a favor. As for Yang Kai's life or death, Jiang likely did not care much, since they had no personal ties.

“The longer the night drags on, the more dreams it spawns—do it!” The Wang elder, seeing how calm and composed Yang Kai remained, suddenly felt a faint sense of unease rise within him. He waved his hand decisively and gave a low command: “This boy is no ordinary one—I’ll handle him myself. Those two women are yours. That Miss Yue is still untouched and has cultivated Hehuan House’s Dual Cultivation Technique; she should be of great benefit to you all. As for the other woman…”

"I'll take her!" Wang Yuhan said coldly, smiling.

“Understood, Elder Wang. Then that woman shall be left for Young Master Wang!” The Saint King Realm cultivators standing behind the elder hastily nodded, grinning lewdly as their gazes fell upon Qian Yue. Their looks made her hair stand on end, her heart thrown into chaos.

"Since you seek death, I'll grant it!" Yang Kai's expression turned fierce; his Saint Yuan surged and a layer of pitch-black flame rose across his body, enveloping him like a burning black orb and exuding an extraordinarily strange and terrifying aura.

Suddenly a jet-black long sword appeared in Yang Kai's hand. As he swung it, blades of sword-light shot forth and cleaved with unstoppable momentum.

"A grain-sized pearl dares to shine!" Elder Wang, seeing Yang Kai dare to strike first, flew into a rage. He roared and an invisible force spread out from him.

The sword light that had shot forth suddenly faltered under the influence of that power, as though it had plunged into a mire—its speed dropped sharply. As it tore through space, faint hissing sounds of friction and slicing could even be heard.

Though only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Elder Wang had spent years immersed in that cultivation and had some insight into the use of Shi; with a single move he suppressed Yang Kai's blaze.

Seeing this, Wang Yuhan and the other Saint King Realm cultivators were overjoyed and were just about to strike when, before their eyes, the sword lights that had been slashing forward suddenly twisted and wavered—then turned into streaks of black radiance. They looked like fanged serpents brought to life, writhing and whipping their tails. Their previously slowed speed instantly surged back, and in a flash, they lunged at the Saint King Realm cultivators, jaws snapping down.

"The Yuan Control Art!" Elder Wang's eyes twitched in surprise as his Shi instantly thickened.

At the same time Wang Yuhan and the others hurriedly struck to block.

Boom—boom—boom...

A series of explosions rang out as the intercepted fang-serpents suddenly burst, turning into clusters of pitch-black demonic flame that scattered in every direction. Though they didn't wound anyone, they threw the attackers into disarray, leaving them embarrassed and showing wary, terrified expressions.

Elder Wang's face turned deathly pale!

Confident in his status—and having agreed beforehand to Wang Yuhan’s request—he had never intended to personally kill Yang Kai, only to restrain him a little so Wang Yuhan could take revenge with his own hands. Who could have expected that a moment’s carelessness would nearly cause his grandson to suffer a disastrous loss?

The Yuan Control Art is an exceedingly profound technique; it is not something Saint King Realm cultivators can master. Only those who reach the Origin Returning Realm and comprehend Shi can penetrate the secret of Yuan Control.

Yet today he had seen it exhibited by a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior—how could he not be shocked?

Moreover, that pitch-black flame seemed wrong; as he probed with his divine sense he sensed an aura that filled him with dread—an influence that, once tainted by it, seemed to lead to exceedingly dire consequences.

He no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest. At once, he condensed and strengthened his own Shi and pressed it down toward Yang Kai. Standing beside Yang Kai, Yang Yan and Qian Yue both let out muffled groans as they suddenly felt their limbs bound by invisible shackles—unable to move, even the flow of their Saint Yuan was completely blocked.
