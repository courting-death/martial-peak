## Chapter 4 – The Black Book

After washing the grime from his body, Yang Kai lifted the bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment, brought it to his nose, and inhaled lightly. The medicine really was fragrant; the scent left him clear-headed, almost cheerful.

Removing the cap, he scraped out a bit of salve and was about to apply it when he paused, fetched a small bowl of water, and stirred the ointment into a thin solution. Only then did he tend his wounds. Diluting the ointment would weaken its effect, but he owned only one bottle and had to make it last.

When the bowl was empty, his injuries were finally dressed. Yet he noticed the fragrance had changed—no longer sweet but faintly pungent.

Pulling on his robe, he grabbed a blackened roasted sweet potato from the stove and swallowed it whole. Then he collapsed onto his bed and fell into a deep sleep.

Light spilled through several holes in the roof, brightening the hut. The furnishings were sparse: one low bed, no table or chairs, and on the bed only a deerskin blanket the size of a tabletop and a square black stone pillow—Yang Kai’s entire worldly wealth.

The deerskin blanket came from a deer he had hunted; though thin, it kept out the chill. The black stone pillow he had found a year ago while hunting in the Black Wind Mountain Range behind Lingxiao Pavilion.

The stone was a neat foot-long block, three fingers thick. It looked like stone but felt unlike any rock and weighed far less. Yang Kai had never figured out what it was, but as a pillow it was perfect, and so he stopped wondering. In the year since, he had always slept easily on it.

In his dreams that afternoon he relived the morning fight—thrown again and again by Zhou Dingjun, rising each time. His stubborn will fermented, hot blood surging in his chest.

The tide of heat swelled fiercer. Sleeping Yang Kai frowned in pain, yet his expression was unyielding; even if he walked knife mountains and sea of fire, he would not retreat.

He did not notice the Black Stone Pillow beneath his head begin to glimmer with a deep, ghostly light. As his emotions rose, the light intensified.

In the dream he stood once more, charged, and finally hurled Zhou Dingjun to the ground. Yet the fallen figure blurred—then took on his own face.

Calm spread through him—not because he had bested an enemy, but because he had conquered the fear and surrender within himself.

A subtle feeling surfaced—nothing under heaven could make him bow again.

Reality answered. The pillow burst with black radiance; the light twisted upward, hovered, then drilled into the crown of Yang Kai’s head and vanished.

An ancient, desolate aura descended—like tides against cliffs, avalanches crushing peaks. Beneath it every being seemed insignificant.

Yang Kai’s eyes flew open; sweat drenched him. That aura had wrenched him from sleep. Laughing dryly, he scolded himself for being scared by a dream. He gauged the light through the roof holes and groaned—he had slept two full hours, nearly to dusk.

He hurried up, folded the deerskin neatly, and adjusted the pillow. About to step down, he paused, staring at the pillow.

It felt… different.

Puzzled, he lifted it. The weight was clearly lighter.

How could a stone suddenly lose weight? He tossed it—then froze.

Like a heavy book flung open, pages rustled in mid-air. Startled, Yang Kai forgot to catch it. With a thud the “stone” hit the floor—and lay there spread like a tome.

Wasn’t this a stone? How had it become a book?

He knew every line of that pillow after a year. Never had it shown a seam—yet today the tortoise shed its shell and turned into a snake.

After a long silence he stooped and picked up the Black Book. The moment his fingers touched the cover, blood-deep familiarity surged through him.

He leafed through; sure enough, it was a book—thick cover, thick pages. Yet not a single word, only blank sheets. Stranger still, the pages resisted tearing when he tried.

Interesting: a year sleeping on it, and only now its true face.

But what use was a wordless black book? He turned it every which way—nothing.

On impulse he opened to the first page and glared at the blank sheet, refusing to yield.

Moments passed. A change stirred. That primordial aura from his dream returned; golden characters slowly surfaced:

> With blood as guide, the Golden Body descends.  
> Should the divine art fail, the Golden Body endures.

The aura pierced his heart. Yang Kai slammed the book shut, limbs shaking. Only after several deep breaths did he calm.

What secret lay hidden here? This thing he had picked up in the Black Wind Mountain Range was surely extraordinary.

After a long while he opened it again. The golden lines remained.

So it was no dream.

More words emerged:

> Proud Bone Golden Body, a sovereign’s pillar;  
> Only an unyielding soul can command it.

Eight lines, thirty-two characters, spanning the whole page—each stroke exuding absolute dominance.

Yang Kai’s thoughts churned. The mystery of the Black Book had only begun.
