## Chapter 4 — The Black Book

After cleaning his body, Yang Kai picked up the bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment, holding it under his nose to gently inhale its scent. Sure enough, the medicine smelled fragrant, refreshing his mind and making him shake his head as if clearing it.

He opened the bottle and was about to scoop out some ointment to apply to his injury when he hesitated. Hastily, he fetched a bowl of water, dipped the ointment-covered finger into it, and stirred it thoroughly. Only then did he begin treating his wounds with the diluted medicine.

Though the Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment was effective for external injuries, diluting it like this would certainly weaken its potency. But as that was the only ointment Yang Kai had, he naturally had to use it sparingly.

When the bowl was empty, his injuries were finally dressed. However, he found it puzzling that the ointment’s smell now differed from before; it was no longer fragrant but carried a somewhat spicy scent.

Dressing himself, he grabbed a blackened roasted sweet potato from the stove and devoured it in one go. Then, Yang Kai collapsed heavily onto the bed and quickly fell into a deep sleep.

A few beams of light pierced through cracks in the roof, faintly illuminating the humble room. The furnishings inside were extremely sparse—just a single bed, without table or chairs. Even on that bed was only a piece of deer-hide bedding the size of a tabletop and a square black stone pillow. This represented the sum total of Yang Kai’s possessions.

The deer-hide bedding came from a deer Yang Kai had once hunted; he skinned and cured it himself. Though thin, it was just enough to keep out the cold. As for the Black Stone Pillow, Yang Kai had found it on a hunting trip into the Black Wind Mountain  behind Lingxiao Pavilion.

This black stone was square, about one chi long and three fingers thick. Although it looked like stone, its texture felt different, and it was lighter than a normal rock. Yang Kai didn’t know what exactly it was, but it made a perfect pillow, so he never gave it a second thought.

He had been resting his head on this Black Stone Pillow for over a year now. Whether it was illusion or not, it always helped him fall asleep easily.

In his dream, Yang Kai relived today’s battle, being repeatedly knocked away by Junior Brother Zhou Dingjun. Each time he was thrown down, he forced himself to rise again. The unyielding spirit and persistence within him fermented, a burning heat surging in his chest.

As the dream continued, the hot blood in his chest boiled more fiercely. In sleep, his face twisted in pain but was resolute, harboring a stubborn adherence—even if he had to tread on blades or endure fire, he would face it without fear.

He did not notice the Black Stone Pillow beneath his head begin to glimmer with a deep, ghostly light. As his emotions rose, the light intensified.

In the dream, Yang Kai was repeatedly crushed to the ground by Zhou Dingjun. But the moment he rose once more, the fermenting will to persist exploded forth. Charging forward with relentless determination, he struck Zhou Dingjun down. At that instant, Zhou’s face blurred and transformed into Yang Kai’s own.

Yang Kai’s heart calmed—not because he defeated his opponent in the dream, but because he had overcome himself, conquering the fear and submission inside.

A subtle feeling arose—as if nothing and no one in the world could make him yield.

Awakening in reality, the Black Stone Pillow beneath his head suddenly burst forth with a sphere of black light. This swirling light drifted from the stone and hovered in midair before diving into Yang Kai’s Baihui acupoint at the crown of his head, disappearing instantly.

Simultaneously, a desolate, ancient wild aura descended like crashing waves and shattered snow. Anyone confronted with this aura would feel utterly insignificant.

Yang Kai gasped awake, drenched in sweat and filled with lingering dread.

It was this aura that had startled him awake.

Gathering his composure, he dryly laughed at himself—how ridiculous it was that a dream could scare him. Rubbing his face and judging the time by the light filtering through the roof, he frowned in annoyance: he had slept for two whole hours, and evening was fast approaching.

He quickly arose, carefully folding the deer-hide bedding and adjusting the Black Stone Pillow. Just as he was about to get off the bed, he frowned and turned to look at the Black Stone Pillow.

Something felt off... the texture seemed different.

Perplexed, Yang Kai picked up the Black Stone Pillow again, noticing it had become much lighter.

Strange—a stone suddenly becoming lighter? Tossing it casually in one hand, the surprise came.

Like a heavy book thrown into the air, its pages suddenly scattered and fanned out. Astonished, Yang Kai forgot to catch it.

With a soft thud, the Black Stone Pillow fell to the ground—but it was no longer a stone. It had truly transformed into a book, lying open before him.

Wasn’t this a stone? How could it suddenly become a book?

Yang Kai had used this Black Stone Pillow for more than a year and knew its form perfectly. He had never realized it was a book before—how did the old turtle suddenly shed its shell and turn into a snake?

After a long moment, Yang Kai bent down and picked up this Black Book. The instant he held it, a strange sense of bloodline affinity arose within him.

Flipping through it carefully, Yang Kai had to admit—the Black Stone Pillow truly was a book, with thick covers and thick pages. But frustratingly, the Black Book had no words written anywhere. The pages were empty.

Moreover, the texture of the pages was unfathomable. He tried to tear a page gently with his hands—and to his astonishment, it wouldn’t tear.

This was truly curious. He had been resting on it for more than a year and only now discovered its true nature.

But what use was such a wordless Black Book? Yang Kai flipped it over again and again with no clues.

Out of some strange impulse, Yang Kai turned to the first page and glared at the blank page stubbornly.

After just a moment, he noticed subtle changes on the page. Focusing intently, the wild aura that had appeared in his dream surfaced once more, and a line of burnished golden characters gradually manifested before his eyes:

"With blood as the guide, the Golden Body descends. Should the divine art fail, the Golden Body will not perish."

This aura pierced his heart. Yang Kai snapped the Black Book shut, his limbs trembling uncontrollably. He took several deep breaths to calm his racing mind.

What secrets this Black Book concealed, Yang Kai could not say. All he knew was that the item he had picked up in Black Wind Mountain carried tremendous significance.

After a prolonged silence, Yang Kai opened the Black Book again. This time, the burnished golden characters on the first page were clear at a glance.

So... it was not a dream.

Gradually, several more lines of characters appeared:

"Proud Bone Golden Body, the sovereign’s pillar, only the soul of unyielding resolve may summon it!"

Eight lines, thirty-two characters, filled the entire page, exuding a domineering aura of unrivaled supremacy, as if immersed with mighty, savage power.
