## Chapter 438 — Provocation

The senior brother and fellow disciples were chatting when Yang Kai hurried out from inside.

“Brother Chen, Little Sister Shu, I hope all is well,” Yang Kai greeted with a bright smile, looking happier than he had in a long time.

Chen Xue and Shu Xiaoyu had just been speculating whether this Yang Kai was the one from the Zhongdu Yang Family they knew of. When they actually saw him, both were momentarily stunned, forgetting to respond as they stood there dazed, gazing ahead.

In that instant, their hearts thumped wildly, for neither expected to be fortunate enough to befriend such a figure. Both of their faces flushed with excitement.

“Is there something on my face?” Yang Kai teased, noticing their hesitation.

Hearing the friendliness in his voice, the senior brother and fellow disciples regained composure and returned to their normal demeanor.

Chen Xue greeted calmly, “Junior Brother Yang, it’s been a long time.”

Shu Xiaoyu pouted and sized up Yang Kai, playfully complaining, “You really are from the Zhongdu Yang Family, aren’t you? And we had no idea—how annoying!”

“Junior Sister!” Chen Xue tugged at Shu Xiaoyu’s sleeve, glaring, “The Yang Family has rules: when disciples go out for experience, their identities must not be revealed. Junior Brother Yang is not deliberately hiding it from you.”

“I know.” Shu Xiaoyu smiled, “Just a little surprised.”

“It’s not too late to know now. Come in.” Yang Kai warmly gestured for them to enter.

As they walked, Shu Xiaoyu chattered incessantly, like a sparrow, asking endless questions. She came from a second-rate Sect, Yingyue Sect, destined to be a pillar of her Sect but of modest status. Normally, she rarely met heirs of first-rate forces, so suddenly seeing someone from a super power naturally filled her with curiosity.

Especially since they had shared hardships before.

Shu Xiaoyu’s questions were scattered and chaotic, much like a country girl entering a grand city for the first time, with countless varied inquiries coming one after another.

Yang Kai answered casually while leading them inside, Chen Xue smiling wryly and shaking his head repeatedly.

“Is your Yang Family really that big? I heard it occupies a tenth of Zhongdu’s area, and it takes three days and nights on horseback just to circle it. Is that true?” Shu Xiaoyu’s excitement only grew.

Before Yang Kai could answer, a disdainful laugh rang out.

Startled, Shu Xiaoyu turned to look, only to realize unknowingly they had arrived at a side hall where many already sat.

Those young masters and ladies dressed splendidly, their noble origins obvious. They were accompanied by powerful guardians, their jewelry and pendants radiating light, clearly high-grade treasures.

In contrast, even though she and Chen Xue had treasures and proper attire, they looked worlds apart.

The laughter came from a young master seated arrogantly, casting a condescending glance at them like looking at country bumpkins.

Shu Xiaoyu’s face immediately flushed red, wishing she could find a hole to crawl into and never show herself again.

Yang Kai frowned slightly but smiled, “Don’t listen to the nonsense outside. While the Yang Family’s territory is large, it’s not that exaggerated.”

“Oh.” Shu Xiaoyu blinked, still embarrassed despite Yang Kai’s reassurance. Chen Xue discreetly squeezed her palm in comfort, which eased her mood considerably.

She truly did not expect so many people waiting here. Had she known, she would not have asked so many foolish questions.

Though unaccustomed to this world, she knew how to behave when out and about. Yang Kai had always been approachable, never looking down on them because of their humble origins. Shu Xiaoyu had simply been overjoyed to ask a few more questions, not realizing others overheard.

“Let me introduce you...” Yang Kai lightly swept away the awkwardness, radiating warmth, “These two are my companions who shared hardships with me in another world, Chen Xue and Shu Xiaoyu from Yingyue Sect.”

In that distant place, Chen Xue had guided Yang Kai significantly. Afterwards, the senior brother and fellow disciples wished to travel together, caring for one another.

At that time, they were all True Yuan Realm third stage; Yang Kai had just reached Separation and Union Realm third stage. Chen Xue and Shu Xiaoyu obviously wished to look after him.

Because of this, Yang Kai held great affection for them.

Chen Xue smiled and shook his head, “Junior Brother Yang exaggerates. It was Junior Brother Yang who saved our lives. Without you, the two of us would have long turned to dust. Your life-saving grace is etched in our hearts.”

“If they are Yang Kai’s friends, then they are friends of Dong Qinghan,” Fatty Dong smiled, standing and cordially cupping his fists. He knew all the friends Yang Kai made in these years outside were sincere, devoid of any ulterior motives.

That was precisely the kind of person Yang Kai valued most. Generally, heirs of wealthy families first suspect others of seeking advantage.

Thus, Fatty Dong was very serious.

“Ah, Lord Dong!” Chen Xue's eyes lit up, clearly having heard of him before, and he promptly returned the greeting.

“Ziwei Valley, Fan Hong!”

“Greetings, Brother Fan.”

“Qiu Family, Qiu Yimeng.” Miss Qiu smiled gently, her youthful face radiating stunning beauty.

Chen Xue’s expression shifted; Shu Xiaoyu was likewise surprised and looked toward Qiu Yimeng.

“So it is Miss Qiu, I have long admired you!” Chen Xue spoke sincerely with admiration shining on his face.

Qiu Yimeng chuckled appreciatively, casting a provocative glance at Yang Kai, as if to say, “You may not regard me, but my reputation precedes me.”

Everyone present, out of respect for Yang Kai, greeted Chen Xue willingly—except Lü Song, who sat arrogantly with disdain upon his face.

Chen Xue turned to him and smiled while cupping his fists, “May I ask who you are...?”

He naturally sensed Lü Song’s contempt for him and the junior sister. Lü Song had been the one laughing earlier. It was not unusual for those from a second-rate Sect to be looked down upon by first-rate families. Chen Xue was used to this and held no grievance.

Moreover, everyone here should be Yang Kai’s allies. He would not let Yang Kai be embarrassed and wished to ease tensions with Lü Song.

After all, if everything went well, they would work together—allies should not be at odds, and as the host, Yang Kai would find it difficult otherwise.

Unexpectedly, despite Chen Xue’s humility, Lü Song said nothing, seemingly deaf, leisurely blowing on his tea.

Yang Kai’s gaze sharpened, a cold smile creeping to his lips.

Then he turned to look at Qiu Yimeng.

Lü Song was her cousin, after all, and Yang Kai wanted to see who gave Lü Song the courage to act so arrogantly and who supported him.

Their gazes met; Qiu Yimeng’s eyes sparkled with a smile, and she slowly shook her head at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, narrowing his eyes, the cold glint intensifying.

Chen Xue waited a moment, still no answer from Lü Song. Feeling awkward, he patiently continued, “Brother, have I offended you in some way? If so, I apologize sincerely and hope you can forgive me.”

Upon hearing this, Shu Xiaoyu’s eyes filled with tears, nearly moved to cry.

Chen Xue was her senior and lover. She could endure being mocked by Lü Song, embarrassed as she was, but seeing her hero apologize so humbly for no reason, how could she not ache?

Especially since the insult was baseless.

Turning her head, she pleaded silently with Yang Kai, hoping he could intervene to save her senior from further humiliation.

Yang Kai grinned and mouthed something they couldn’t hear clearly, but Shu Xiaoyu understood the meaning clearly.

“Wait patiently.”

Her heart immediately calmed, confident Yang Kai would not stand idly by. She sniffled softly and held back tears.

After two attempts, Lü Song finally set down his tea, arrogantly shaking his head. “No offense taken, just that I’m a loner, poor at socializing, especially with people lacking discernment. I have nothing to say.”

Chen Xue’s expression flickered and he smiled awkwardly, “I see, then forgive my intrusion.”

Lü Song raised his eyelids and looked at Chen Xue with a light laugh, “You’re from Yingyue Sect?”

“Yes, my fellow disciple and I belong to Yingyue Sect.”

“Coming to take part in the succession war, how many have you brought?”

Chen Xue looked embarrassed and hesitant, “Only the two of us so far, but—”

Before he could finish, Lü Song interrupted with a sneer.

The eldest son of the Lü Family stood arrogantly, hands behind his back, “Only two people... both seventh stage True Yuan Realm, and you think you can participate in the succession war? Are you children playing house?”

His mockery rendered Chen Xue speechless, cheeks flushed red.

Lü Song bragged, glancing at Qiu Yimeng. She smiled approvingly, increasing his confidence to push these would-be social climbers away.

“Do you know how many have come from the Lü Family?” Lü Song looked down disgustedly at Chen Xue. “Two seventh stage Divine Roaming Realm, one fourth stage Divine Roaming Realm, two third stage Divine Roaming Realm, and over twenty True Yuan Realm warriors, not to mention countless resources.”
