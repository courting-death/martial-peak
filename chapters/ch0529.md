## Chapter 529 — Crushed

Before Yang Zhao’s residence, there was silence as still as a dead crow.

Countless pairs of eyes were intently fixed on Yang Kai, their expressions extraordinarily vivid.

The shock that Yang Kai’s recent ascension brought to everyone was simply indescribable.

Each person harbored immense doubts in their hearts, staring at Yang Kai with dazed looks.

Breaking through to the Divine Roaming Realm could bring forth a cataclysmic heavenly and earthly anomaly? Could a fighter who had just stepped into the Divine Roaming Realm’s first stage and opened his own Sea of Consciousness possess such powerful, solid Divine Sense?

Those who witnessed it could barely understand it.

The usually unshakable First Young Master of Zhongdu, Liu Qingyao, finally smiled wryly. He realized that Yang Kai now exerted an overwhelming pressure upon him, making him feel utterly helpless and unqualified even to brush the hem of his clothes with his current strength.

With a bitter expression, Liu Qingyao quietly said to Yang Wei, standing beside him, “Eldest Young Master, you were right. Your Ninth Brother’s achievements far surpass mine.”

Then he shook his head, murmuring, “What a monster!”

Yang Wei wore a look of pride.

The experts from the Eight Great Families furrowed their brows deeply, their expressions extremely grave.

Had they not known Yang Kai had just broken into the first stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, unable even to gauge his depth, the overwhelming Divine Sense power that blocked all their attempts at probing shook them to their core.

That he could completely seal off their Divine Sense meant that Yang Kai's power was by no means inferior to theirs—at the very least, it was comparable, if not slightly stronger.

How had he achieved this?

How was he cultivating?

Each of these men were over a hundred years old and had cultivated their Divine Sense for countless years, yet in terms of Divine Sense power, they found themselves matched by a youth not even twenty years old.

Not one among the eight could help but feel a sting of shame.

“This youngster, is he human or demon? Brother Yang should know best, right?” Ling Taixu teased Yang Liting with a knowing smile.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s aura was calm and unremarkable—no True Yuan fluctuations leaked forth, no ominous energy clouded his body. His eyes were clear, black and white distinct, perfectly normal—except for the extraordinary power he wielded within.

If he still insisted on labeling him as having gone into Qi Deviation, earning the infamy of a demonic cultivator, Yang Liting would truly be blind.

With a cold snort, Yang Liting said, “It’s just luck that he can still maintain his sanity now. One day, he will lose control of his power. When that day comes, don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”

Having spoken, he transformed into a streak of light and dashed toward the Fengshen Hall.

He no longer wished to stay. Though he was the Grand Elder of the Yang Family, this time he felt like a villain.

All he cared about was the family’s honor—he didn’t want any demon-tainted cultivators in the Yang Family. But when his attempts to purge them failed and he was instead despised, it unbalanced his mindset.

After Yang Liting left, the other seven also found no reason to remain and quietly departed.

Before leaving, Qiu Daoren frowned slightly at Yang Kai and quietly admonished, “Do not cultivate evil arts again.”

The fat elder also warned Yang Kai, “Listen well. Evil arts will do you no good. With your talent, you can cultivate any technique and have a bright future. There is no need to seek shortcuts.”

He apparently believed Yang Kai’s strength at such a young age came from practicing forbidden arts.

Though this was not the case, Yang Kai nodded silently, choosing not to explain.

He had never practiced evil arts. The sinister energy in his body was solely due to the Proud Bone Golden Body.

Moreover, he did not wish to divide light and darkness so clearly; that was simply each person’s own path.

The power was his own cultivation, and how it was used mattered most.

“Yang Kai, congratulations,” Qiu Yimeng approached smiling warmly.

Others quickly stepped forward, their congratulatory voices filling the air.

Yang Kai smiled at everyone and sincerely replied, “Thank you all.”

Even though his mind was unclear during the ascension, Yang Kai could sense how much effort others had put forth on his behalf. His gratitude was accepted with peaceful hearts.

Looking over the crowd, Yang Kai lightly nodded toward the eight Blood Servants.

Originally imposing and arrogant, all eight Blood Servants were now pale and weak, their Qi and blood fleeting.

This was the price of using the Blood Fury Technique! Though they had paid greatly and failed to directly confront Yang Liting and the others, their unhesitating stubbornness in protecting Yang Kai had played a significant role.

Had they not acted so fiercely, Yang Liting and the others would not have backed down.

Though fatigued, the eight Blood Servants still smiled cheerfully.

Finally, Yang Kai turned respectfully toward Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya, bowing deeply, “Grandmaster, Shopkeeper Meng!”

“Rise, rise,” Ling Taixu said, stroking his long beard. “It’s good that you’re safe.”

Shopkeeper Meng snorted lightly. “You brat, don’t cause old man any more trouble in the future.”

“Certainly, certainly,” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. He had indeed troubled Meng Wuya many times lately and felt some guilt.

Turning to Ling Taixu, Yang Kai asked, “Grandmaster, will you stay?”

Yang Kai had never known that Ling Taixu was hiding in War City nor when he arrived. Only Meng Wuya likely had some knowledge. After so long with no news, seeing him now put Yang Kai’s mind at ease.

Ling Taixu nodded, “No plans to leave for the time being.”

“Good,” Yang Kai smiled. “I have recently located Su Yan and the others. They should arrive at War City soon. With you here, I can rest assured. The disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion must be taught by you.”

Ling Taixu smiled faintly and said, “Don’t butter me up. I’m only staying to keep Brother Meng company.” He then glanced at Qiu Yimeng and suddenly added, “I recognize your aura—you were the one who led people to set fire to my sect.”

Qiu Yimeng’s face flushed red; she wished she could crawl into a hole. In her panic, she pulled Luo Xiaoman over and blurted, “She was in on it too!”

Luo Xiaoman was on the verge of tears…

For a while, both were at a loss.

Ling Taixu laughed heartily, showing no intent to press the matter. Qiu Yimeng finally understood he wasn’t serious, just speaking casually.

Yang Kai chuckled softly and glanced not far away before taking a deep breath and saying, “Second Brother, I bid you farewell.”

Over there, Yang Zhao’s face looked pale and deflated, as if soulless and numb. Even after all of Yang Kai’s group had left, he showed no reaction.

Yang Wei glanced at him and slowly shook his head. He knew that Second Brother had taken quite a brutal blow this time, unlikely to accept such a result anytime soon.

He had failed to protect Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu. Yang Kai had killed them right in front of him at his own residence.

That was bad enough, but Ninth Brother’s personal charm and potential were what truly terrified everyone.

One person in distress, countless supporters rising to defend him—who could achieve that? Even in the face of beings beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, those people had never once retreated!

Yang Zhao’s warriors would never sacrifice themselves so much for Yang Zhao. Yang Wei felt those under his care wouldn’t either.

This time not only had Yang Zhao been struck down, but Yang Wei had also suffered a heavy blow, though comparatively his endurance was better; at least he had not collapsed outright.

Was there any need to continue the Succession War?

Yang Wei’s usually resolute expression suddenly turned lost.

After eight or nine months, from the perspective of personal ability, talent, and connections, Ninth Brother was far ahead.

The other brothers had no qualifications to compare.

Perhaps in the early stages, the brothers were ahead of Yang Kai, stronger with more gathered warriors. But as time passed, Yang Kai’s residence had grown into a colossal force. Under his leadership, those warriors had unmatched cohesion.

The Yang Family needed such a person as head.

Given the current situation and comparison of strength, the Succession War truly no longer needed to continue.

With a sigh, Yang Wei suddenly felt somewhat disheartened. He said farewell to Liu Qingyao and hurried away with his Blood Servants.

“Second Young Master, please return to the residence!” One of the Blood Servants who had dueled Tang Yuxian pressed his lips and urged.

Yang Zhao remained motionless, pale beyond measure.

“Second Young Master, I’m sorry, but my faction cannot continue to participate in this Succession War,” a young man spoke with difficulty, shame in his gaze as he approached Yang Zhao.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu had only wounded one of Yang Kai’s men but were in turn mercilessly killed. What reason was there to keep fighting in this Succession War? Who would dare oppose Yang Kai now?

Two Blood Servants’ faces turned cold as if to shout in anger but abruptly restrained themselves.

From their position, they understood how difficult that choice was. After such long effort, to quit at the last moment without any gain but only disgrace—but compared to their lives, what was that?

The Blood Servants could look down on their weakness but could not openly blame them for abandoning Yang Zhao in his ruin.

“Farewell,” the young man said and hastily left without the face to stay any longer.

“Second Young Master, sorry, we cannot continue either,” another stepped forward, apologizing before also leaving.

In less than the time of a cup of tea, Yang Zhao’s house had lost nearly half its martial forces.

Before leaving, each group greeted Yang Zhao, but he said nothing, seemingly not hearing.

“Who else is leaving? Leave quickly if you want to!” One Blood Servant struggled to control his anger and shouted coldly.

Several factions that had hesitated immediately left.

“No more leaving?” The two Blood Servants swept their cold gaze over everyone.

All stood at attention.

“Good,” the two Blood Servants nodded lightly, a trace of satisfaction on their faces, impressed by those who chose to stay.

Yet Yang Zhao still wore the same lost and despondent look.
