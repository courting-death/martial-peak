## Chapter 1462 — A Clash of Words

The Heaven and Earth Spirit had been within her grasp, yet Yang Kai’s Ice Phoenix had snatched it away halfway. The joy of gain turned instantly to bitter loss—the Demon Blood Sect’s Sect Master could well go mad with fury. At this moment, she wished she could flay Yang Kai alive, grind his bones to dust, and scatter his ashes to vent the hatred in her heart.

But after sizing up the situation carefully, the beautiful woman's anger unexpectedly receded; she smiled coquettishly, her eyes darting about as she purred in a soft voice, "Young Brother, what a fate brings us together again."

She looked at Yang Kai with an excited expression; as she spoke her little pink tongue slipped from between her lips to lick them, as if she had just spotted a delectable feast and her appetite was whetted.

"Indeed, a timely fate," Yang Kai grinned, nodding lightly.

Biluo's brows shot up beside him, glaring hatefully at Yang Kai as she hissed, "You know this wench? You lecher, have you been gallivanting again?"

She clearly despised the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master for her wanton, unrestrained demeanor and assumed there must be something shady between her and Yang Kai.

Hearing the question, Yang Kai skimmed a look at her and deemed no further explanation necessary.

“Young Brother, we’re all from the Dark Star—one family, aren’t we? Why spoil this Sect Master’s good fortune?” The alluring woman’s smile remained as charming as ever; every movement of hers seemed to radiate endless allure. Swaying her slender waist, she stepped forward gracefully and parted her crimson lips: “Be sensible and hand over that Heaven and Earth Spirit obediently. I can pretend none of this ever happened. How about it?”

"Fine, once we return to Dark Star, come to Flowing Flame Sandland and fetch it from me; I'll return the Heaven and Earth Spirit to you then," Yang Kai replied with a smile, as if making small talk with the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master, showing not the slightest trepidation.

The beauty's face chilled. Her heart, stirred, turned a touch angry. The perfunctory tone in his words was obvious even to a fool — if they truly returned to Dark Star, there was no way, even with all her power, she could penetrate Flowing Flame Sandland to look for him; what chance was there of his returning the Heaven and Earth Spirit?

He was clearly intent on taking the Heaven and Earth Spirit for himself.

With a long sigh, the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master's eyes took on a tragic cast, as if Yang Kai had once toyed with and abandoned her; she said slowly, "Young Brother, I bear no wish to be your enemy, but if you persist in your folly, I won't hesitate to teach you a lesson. Think carefully—if I strike, you and the young woman at your side will hardly leave this place in safety."

"If you've got the nerve, try it!" Yang Kai scoffed.

"Impudent brat!" Jin Shi boiled over in fury, roaring, "Sect Master, spare the pleasantries—seize this fellow! A mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm dares to act so boldly; he knows not how high the heavens are nor how deep the earth!"

"Hm." The Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master inclined her head slightly; an odd light flashed in her eyes as she chuckled softly, "This one is mine. Such a robust man—I've never come across one like him; he should greatly replenish my qi and blood power!"

When they entered the Imperial Garden earlier that day, she and Jin Shi had passed by Yang Kai as he was condensing his Shi; they had personally seen him use his body to withstand Imperial Might. At once she had deemed Yang Kai a marvel, recognizing his extraordinary bodily constitution and becoming greatly stirred.

The stronger a man's body, the more useful he was to her. Over the years the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master had frequently preyed upon vigorous men, but none had ever compared to Yang Kai.

Even without the Heaven and Earth Spirit incident, had she encountered him within the Imperial Garden she would not have let him go; her previous civility had merely been a ruse to distract Yang Kai and make him lower his guard.

Now that the facade was ripped away, there was nothing more to say.

"Then I'll take these three women!" Jin Shi laughed loudly, treating Biluo as already in his grasp and even claiming the two women from Ice Heart Valley who were badly injured and unable to move.

At his words, the two women from Ice Heart Valley changed color, inwardly cursing their luck; at their prime they might not have feared Jin Shi and the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master, but not now...

With only twenty to thirty percent of their strength available, they could only pin their hopes on Yang Kai, but a mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior, accompanied by someone clearly weakened and with shallow qi and blood, could they hold off the combined assault of that man and woman?

The two women from Ice Heart Valley watched the developments with terrifying tension, fixing their eyes on the scene for fear that Yang Kai might be killed at a single glance.

Were that to happen, they too would be doomed; unwilling to admit it, they nonetheless realized they were bound to Yang Kai like locusts on a single rope—harm to one harmed all.

"Boy, I know your fire-type Artifact Spirit is formidable, but will you dare to release it here to fight?" Jin Shi sneered, his expression savage, striking at Yang Kai's soft spot.

The Artifact Spirit now formed a protective barrier around Yang Kai and Biluo; if unleashed it might let Yang Kai persist a short while in this frigid environment, but with Biluo's condition she would likely perish at once.

Jin Shi had accurately judged that the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit would be useless in the coming fight, at most offering some protection.

"So what?" Yang Kai returned his gaze coldly, unconcerned.

“Won’t cry until you see your coffin, will you?” Jin Shi snorted coldly. As he spoke, he drew in a deep breath—and in the next instant, golden light erupted from his body, enveloping him completely. Within that dazzling radiance, the faint outline of a cicada-shaped phantom appeared behind him, its form entirely golden. With a flicker, it dove into Jin Shi’s body, and immediately his aura underwent a drastic change. A suffocating, violent energy surged out from him, as if it could draw forth the brutality and bloodlust buried deep within everyone’s hearts.

The Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art!

Jin Shi loathed Yang Kai with a vengeance; the grievance of a severed arm had consumed him. Now, with a single move, he activated the technique that had made his name, clearly aiming to finish the fight swiftly.

As the golden light faded, his exposed skin seemed to sprout tiny scales, and a pair of wings, thin as cicada membranes, unfurled from his back.

His cheeks bulged as he voiced a word, and a cicada-like cry rang out; the visible soundwave surged straight at Yang Kai.

The casual indifference on Yang Kai's face began to fade—he had seen this trick used against the Heaven and Earth Spirit earlier and knew how strange and powerful the art was; he would not be careless.

His Divine Sense surged; a vast Divine Sense force erupted from his mind like an army unleashed, coalescing into a defense before him. That Divine Sense took on a visible form—a crimson mist like a veil of fire that captivated the eye.

"Divine Sense Manifestation?" Jin Shi's eyes bulged in astonishment, disbelief written across his face.

Though Divine Sense is formless, at extreme power levels it can become visible; such a degree is called Divine Sense Manifestation!

On Dark Star no one could do that—at least among those Jin Shi knew there was no such ability. To make Divine Sense take form required the cultivation of the Void King Realm.

This youngster had only recently advanced to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—how could he possibly possess such immense Divine Sense?

Moreover, judging by the hue of the barrier formed by that Divine Sense, it seemed not to be ordinary Divine Sense but a mutated Divine Sense Fire!

Not good! Jin Shi’s thoughts raced—something was wrong. He had already tried to overestimate this boy’s strength, yet it seemed he had still underestimated him.

The soundwave attack unleashed by the Golden Cicada rushed to Yang Kai's position but was wholly stopped by the crimson mist, sinking like a stone into the sea and achieving nothing.

Fortunately, Jin Shi was not fighting alone. At the same moment he struck, the Demon Blood Sect Master also made her move. The bracelet-shaped Secret Treasure was once again summoned forth, transforming into countless overlapping shadows of bangles that rained down upon Yang Kai—each strike carrying a terrifying force.

Faced with such a situation, Yang Kai remained utterly calm—as if he had anticipated it long ago. With a twist of his wrist, a sword-shaped Secret Treasure appeared in his hand, three chi in length, its entire body a translucent emerald green, without edge or blade.

The Dragon Bone Sword—Dripping Jade!

Saint Yuan poured into it madly; the green blade erupted with verdant radiance, seeming to come to life in Yang Kai's hand. With a high, resonant dragon cry, the Dripping Jade sword transformed into a jade-green dragon dozens of zhang in length, baring its fangs and claws as it lunged at the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master.

The dragon's might descended upon the world—this tangible pressure was even more terrifying than the Ice Phoenix had been.

Before the shower of bracelet-images could reach Yang Kai, the jade-green dragon swept them to pieces. It then opened its jaws and breathed a cloud of green mist at the Demon Blood Sect's Sect Master; the stench was almost nauseating, clearly poisonous, and the Sect Master cried out in alarm, hastily dodging as her beautiful eyes trembled violently.

During the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain she had not personally taken part, yet she received a detailed report from Jin Shi and knew Yang Kai possessed such an odd, wondrous Secret Treasure.

When Jin Shi first reported it, she had not taken it to heart, thinking he exaggerated to cover his loss—after all, treasures are dead and men are alive; no matter the treasure's rank, if the user lacks sufficient strength its power cannot be fully realized.

But seeing it with her own eyes now, she dared not think that way.

The jade-green dragon the Secret Treasure formed seemed as if it had blood and flesh; like an Ancient Divine Spirit descending, it made her unwilling to test its edge casually.

Such a result was not surprising—during the Dragon Lair Mountain conflict Yang Kai could barely force the Dragon Bone Sword to move; the dragon soul had not cooperated then and had resisted, preventing him from freely wielding it.

Now, however, the Dragon Soul within the Dragon Bone Sword had completely submitted to him—its will bound to his own. The power he could draw from it was far greater than back at Dragon Lair Mountain. The Demon Blood Sect Master’s attacks shattered upon contact, leaving her with no choice but to dart frantically about the Ice Path realm, struggling to fend off the emerald dragon that relentlessly pursued her.

Witnessing this, Jin Shi was not alarmed but overjoyed!
