## Chapter 2234 — Invasion and Counterattack

"Ghost-faced, huh..."

Just as Yang Kai was reeling in shock, a soft, enchanting voice drifted out from behind the pink curtains. The sound seemed to pierce straight into his soul, stirring up invisible ripples that left Yang Kai's mind unsettled for a long time.

He hurriedly took a deep breath, focusing his mind to steady his spirit.

"For you to call this Lord that... it's not entirely improper," the woman behind the curtain continued, her tone unhurried and calm.

"Could Senior be the ruler of this Divine Roaming Nation?" Yang Kai asked, his brows tightly knit.

"Correct!" the other party admitted frankly. "But no one has ever seen this Lord's true face, not even Zhou Dian."

Yang Kai was stunned by her words, but soon, a faint sense of foreboding welled up from deep within his heart.

Although she hadn't revealed any crucial information, her words gave Yang Kai a very bad feeling, as if she had exposed a great secret in front of him, and he would inevitably have to pay a price for it.

Yang Kai forced a wry smile and said, "It is this Junior's greatest honor. May I ask why Senior is treating me with such favor?"

As he spoke, his mind raced, but he couldn't think of any key detail.

"Because... this Lord must do so." The languid figure on the couch finally sat up, straightening her posture. Through the curtain, she beckoned gently to Yang Kai. "Come here!"

Yang Kai's brows furrowed, his eyes cold and glinting. He said lightly, "I suppose this Junior has no way to refuse, does he?"

"You can try!"

Yang Kai couldn't help but curl his lips, but could only slowly walk forward.

As he moved ahead, he clearly sensed a momentary instability in the woman's soul across from him, as if she were anticipating and yearning for something.

That anticipation and longing were so intense that even such an expert could barely keep her soul steady.

Yang Kai would never naively believe she was interested in him. If that were the case, she wouldn't need to go to such lengths. With the strength she had shown before, any simple trick would have made him submit.

Since it wasn't him she wanted, it must be something on him.

Realizing this, Yang Kai's heart skipped a beat.

When he reached the curtain, Yang Kai took a deep breath, lifted his hand, and drew it aside. He looked up inside.

The woman's appearance was instantly imprinted in his eyes.

Yang Kai couldn't help but lose himself for a moment. Her beauty was truly enough to topple cities and nations, enchanting all living beings, flawless to the point of being unreal.

Yet... the instant Yang Kai saw her, he felt a strange sense of familiarity, as if he had seen her somewhere before.

Carefully recalling the faces of all the Emperor Realm experts he had encountered, Yang Kai found that none matched her. He was left puzzled and suspicious deep inside.

As their eyes met, a terrifying light burst forth from the woman's beautiful gaze, the brilliance almost becoming tangible as it enveloped Yang Kai.

Yang Kai instantly froze in place, feeling as if he were about to fall into an endless abyss.

In great alarm, he cried out, "Senior..."

The woman ignored his plea, her face growing excited as she declared, "You are the last one, just as expected. That thing must be on you. If I can obtain that treasure, this Lord can refine this world and truly become its master! Cooperate obediently, and perhaps I will spare your life and grant you a lifetime of glory and wealth. But if you resist, you will find neither life nor death!"

By the end, her once-beautiful face had twisted into a hideous mask, her tone chilling to the extreme, as if she had gone mad.

Yang Kai could only listen in confusion.

The so-called last one, and the treasure to refine this world—he had no idea what she meant.

He wanted to resist, but under the influence of her soul secret art, even thinking became a struggle, let alone fighting back.

The woman rose gracefully, and with a sway of her delicate body, appeared before Yang Kai. She extended a slender jade finger and pressed it directly to his forehead.

In the next instant, a surge of pure soul power invaded Yang Kai's body through her finger.

Yang Kai shuddered all over, his eyes instantly becoming vacant, his whole body convulsing as if suffering unbearable torture.

His consciousness sank, his thoughts grew chaotic—these were normal reactions to having one's soul disturbed.

Yang Kai finally understood why Xia Sheng and the others had become like that after being brought back.

Clearly, they had suffered the same fate he was now enduring. Under the soul assault of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, how could a Dao Origin Realm cultivator maintain themselves? The fact that their souls hadn't been scattered was proof of their strength.

The woman continued casting her spell, seemingly searching for something within Yang Kai. Her expression shifted constantly, while Yang Kai drifted in a daze, half-awake and half-dreaming.

In his haze, he heard the woman exclaim in admiration, "Such pure soul power! Boy, you truly are different from the rest. To possess such a strong soul at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—given time, you would surely achieve greatness!"

After a short while, the woman suddenly burst into wild, crazed laughter, her voice echoing through the air. “Found it! Hahahahaha! It truly is the Warm Spirit Lotus—just as I thought! And it has already reached the seven-colored stage, fully capable of bearing the weight of the Mirror Soul! Wen Zishan, once I refine this world, I will make sure you pay dearly!"

As her words fell, a fierce light flashed in her beautiful eyes. Her delicate body spun, transforming into a stream of light that shot straight into Yang Kai's brow, entering his Spirit Body as if she were immaterial.

If anyone else had seen this, they would have been shocked. Such a method was extremely dangerous—two different souls could not easily merge. A single misstep would mean soul destruction. Unless one had absolute control, even success could mean being polluted by the other's thoughts and losing oneself.

But the woman clearly had strong control and was not worried about being affected by Yang Kai's thoughts.

She shot into Yang Kai's Spirit Body, heading straight for the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus. In an instant, she landed at the center of the lotus.

Pure power wrapped around her from all sides, and the gentle sensation made her moan involuntarily.

The Warm Spirit Lotus is the supreme treasure for nourishing the soul between heaven and earth. Nothing else can compare. Even in the entire Star Realm, it is a treasure that can only be encountered by chance.

Though ancient texts record the Warm Spirit Lotus, its true appearance has occurred only two or three times in tens of millions of years.

If not for a stroke of luck, the woman would never have known Yang Kai possessed such a thing.

She laughed joyfully, as if seeing a broad, bright road stretching out before her.

Yet...

Just as she was about to refine the Warm Spirit Lotus, a seven-colored radiance suddenly burst forth from the supreme treasure, forming a halo of light.

That halo seemed to contain unstoppable power, crashing into the woman's Spirit Body and dimming her complexion.

Her face changed dramatically as she cried out, trying to resist the rejection from the Warm Spirit Lotus.

But before she could act, a strange buzzing sound suddenly filled her ears.

The woman was startled. Looking up, she saw a dense swarm of tiny insects gathering into a cloud, surging toward her like a plague of locusts.

"Soul-Devouring Worms!" the woman's face changed drastically as she cried out in shock. "How can there be Soul-Devouring Worms?"

In the next instant, she realized with disbelief, screaming, "The boy actually raised Soul-Devouring Worms on the Warm Spirit Lotus? Madness, utter madness!"

Boom boom...

As she spoke, the seven-colored halo from the Warm Spirit Lotus struck again. Even someone as strong as the woman had to retreat, unable to resist, for this was the treasure's own rejection, a counterattack against any aura not belonging to its master.

The light on the woman's body dimmed further. Seeing more halos and the aggressive cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms, she cursed in frustration and had no choice but to retreat for now.

In the private room, light flashed and the woman's figure reappeared. Compared to her earlier composure, she now looked a bit disheveled.

Before she could steady herself, a wave of cold suddenly descended from above, slashing down at her.

The chill was so intense that even she felt a trace of threat.

Startled, the woman shuddered, unleashing a tidal wave of invisible power that radiated in all directions.

A muffled grunt sounded as Yang Kai's figure was sent flying backward.

Buzz buzz buzz...

The cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms followed the woman out of Yang Kai's body, forming a dense swarm that enveloped her.

For the Soul-Devouring Worms, a soul as powerful as the woman's was the most delicious feast between heaven and earth.

So there was no need for Yang Kai to command them. The Soul-Devouring Worms, as if crazed, surged toward the woman, instantly wrapping her up layer upon layer, leaving no gaps.

Seeing this, the woman dared not be careless. With a shudder, she formed a protective barrier on her body to prevent the Soul-Devouring Worms from harming her Divine Soul Origin.

Soul-Devouring Worms are the nemesis of all souls. So even with her powerful cultivation, the woman could not kill them—at best, she could only suppress and defend against their attacks.

But this was not a long-term solution. The barrier she formed was also condensed from soul power, and as the Soul-Devouring Worms gnawed at it, it quickly grew thin.

The woman had no choice but to keep pouring power into maintaining the barrier.

She turned her head again, her gaze gloomy as she looked at the long saber in Yang Kai's hand. Her expression changed as she cried out in shock, "An Imperial Treasure! And it's even a Soul Imperial Treasure!"

The chill she had sensed earlier, and the attack that threatened her, clearly came from this Imperial Treasure. Only a Secret Treasure of this grade could achieve such an effect.

She couldn't help but sneer, looking at Yang Kai. "You do have some skill, boy. Not to mention all these strange treasures helping you, but to break the seal and recover your strength right under this Lord's nose is enough to make me see you in a new light."
