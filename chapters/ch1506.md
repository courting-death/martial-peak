## Chapter 1506 — Extinction Thunder Bead

Half a month later, three streaks of rainbow light shot out from that cavern, streaking swiftly toward the horizon until they vanished from sight.

After such a long period of recuperation, Qian Tong had basically recovered, and Yang Kai as well; only Fei Zhi Tu remained an exception.

Although Yang Kai had hauled him back from the gates of death, the aftereffects of the Exploding Origin Pill were truly severe — he still could not fully mend. His hair remained snow‑white, yet his complexion had become ruddy and he no longer looked like he was about to die.

His cultivation, meanwhile, had at last been restored to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

What remained, however, was not something that could be healed in a short time; it would take at least ten to twenty years before Fei Zhi Tu had any hope of breaking through to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Although that outcome was dispiriting, at least it fell within an acceptable range.

Yet this rise in cultivation was mere recovery, not a true breakthrough — Fei Zhi Tu would not encounter a bottleneck; he only needed time.

Given sufficient years, he would surely be restored to his former state.

With all three no longer in grave danger, after a brief consultation they set off together for Flowing Flame Sandland.

Yang Kai had already told the other two the reason the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had gone to such lengths against him. Upon learning that Star Emperor Mountain had intervened behind the scenes, both Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu felt deeply uneasy.

They did not dare return to Yingyue Hall for fear of giving that side another opportunity to seize upon and use them to threaten Yang Kai.

After all, within Yingyue Hall only those two had any ties to Yang Kai; as long as they were absent, Star Emperor Mountain would likely not strike at Yingyue Hall.

Heading to Flowing Flame Sandland was the best option — its defenses were as solid as iron and stone. Even if Star Emperor Mountain threw its whole army at it, they would be unable to penetrate the interior.

When Yang Kai had come here before, he had flown, entering cities along the way to lavishly purchase supplies for cultivation; times had changed now, and he would not squander time on unnecessary travel.

After some hassle with transmissions, in less than ten days they arrived at the outskirts of Flowing Flame Sandland.

During those ten days the three of them made many inquiries, but found nothing of value.

No one on Dark Star knew about what had occurred that day within the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

Instead, the headquarters of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect suddenly went on high alert, broadcasting orders that allowed exit but forbade entry — news of which spread far and wide.

The world at large did not know why these two titans would react so; only Yang Kai and the other two were fully aware — they were clearly afraid of being sought out for revenge and had already begun making preparations.

But would that alone stop him? Yang Kai sneered coldly inwardly.

He did not wish to stir up more trouble. He harbored no deep hate with the Battle Sky Alliance or the Leitai Sect. Yet since they had chosen to initiate an attack against him, Yang Kai would not let the matter drop.

Before departing Dark Star for his voyage, it seemed he had to first settle this lingering threat; otherwise he would not be able to leave with peace of mind. This upcoming voyage would not be completed quickly — if he were gone for too long, who knew what changes might occur.

Outside Flowing Flame Sandland, in front of the palace housing the Space Array that connected the interior and exterior, Yang Kai's face was overcast.

For the palace containing the Space Array had been razed to the ground and could no longer be used; many bloodstains dotted the earth, evidence a fight had taken place.

The Lingxiao Sect disciples guarding the place were generally weak in strength; whether they lived or died was unknown.

Unable to use the Space Array directly to enter Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai could only take out his Transmission Compass and communicate with those inside.

Though he could also employ the Star Emperor Token to come and go safely, the protection it provided covered only one person; Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu could not safely pass through the Heat‑Flame Zone.

In less than an hour a small craft the size of a warship burst out of the rolling heatwaves, darted through the Heat‑Flame Zone, and stopped before the three of them.

It was the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle that Yang Yan had previously forged.

The hatch opened to reveal Wu Yi's figure.

"Yang Kai, you're finally back," Wu Yi said with some anxiety; upon seeing Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu she quickly bowed.

"Get on and we'll talk," Yang Kai nodded lightly, leading Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu aboard the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle. The hatch closed, the shuttle rocked slightly, and then sped rapidly toward the interior.

"Who destroyed the Space Array? Were any of the guarding disciples killed or injured?" Yang Kai asked once they were inside.

"I'm not entirely sure who destroyed it, but the guarding disciples did sustain some injuries, nothing fatal. Some ten days earlier a batch of uninvited guests suddenly appeared outside Flowing Flame Sandland, attempting to seize the Space Array. Fortunately the disciples were quick; they triggered the self‑destruct formation Yang Yan had set up and were then teleported back."

"Good," Yang Kai nodded lightly. Lingxiao Sect's disciples were few and mostly consisted of warriors who had left the Haike Family with Wu Yi; they had supported one another to reach this day — if there had been casualties, the disciples would be deeply grieved.

"Yang Kai, do you know who targeted our Lingxiao Sect?" Wu Yi asked angrily.

"Most likely the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect," Yang Kai replied calmly.

"Them?" Wu Yi's delicate face shifted. "Why would they come after us? We haven't offended them."

"Young girl, you should understand the old saying — an innocent man bearing treasure draws trouble. You didn't offend them, but they covet what you have and thus act. Yang Kai was also ambushed on his outing," Qian Tong sighed from the side.

"What audacity!" Wu Yi snapped, her face hardening with fierceness. "Lingxiao Sect keeps to itself and does not court trouble; do they think we are easy to bully? Clearly they need to be taught a lesson."

The three of them stared at her in astonishment.

Fei Zhi Tu clapped his hands and laughed. “The young lady may not be that old, but her ambition is impressive! As expected of someone by Yang Kai’s side—she’s got courage!”

Wu Yi blushed at the praise and mumbled that she had only been speaking casually, that what to do must still depend on the Sect Master, and begged the elders not to mock her.

"Naturally we must teach them a lesson," Yang Kai snorted. "A wrong must be repaid — there is nothing to discuss."

Wu Yi's expression trembled.

An hour later the shuttle docked in Lingxiao Sect's plaza. The group emerged and Yang Kai asked Wu Yi to arrange for Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu to rest briefly while he walked alone toward the Hundred Flowers Residence.

He intended to seek out Ye Xijun to ask her about a matter.

Inside the Hundred Flowers Residence, Ye Xijun was tending plants. Her cultivation had reached a point where further advancement was impossible — Dark Star's suppression of the world's laws prevented her from breaking through to the Void King Realm, and she had already reached the limits of the Origin Returning Realm; no amount of striving would help.

Thus, in ordinary times she performed small, trivial tasks to temper her heart, hoping one day to find an alternate path to ascend to the Void King Realm.

Her nature had always been serene.

"The Sect Master has returned?" Ye Xijun called before Yang Kai reached her, clearly having noticed him.

"Yes," Yang Kai nodded lightly and came to her side, finding her pruning a plant.

"Did the journey go smoothly?"

"Not very well."

"Oh?" Ye Xijun turned her head. "What happened?"

"We were set up!" Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he briefly recounted the events that had taken place in the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

"You mean Star Emperor Mountain was stirring things from the shadows?" Ye Xijun's pretty face chilled.

"Yes, but it matters little. No matter who the enemy is, if they dare provoke me I will not let them off."

“Sect Master is a man of true character—clear in gratitude and resentment, and decisive in both kindness and vengeance.”

"I have come to ask whether Star Emperor Mountain possesses a bead‑shaped secret treasure that can split into countless fragments and is of the thunder attribute."

"Are you referring to the Extinction Thunder Bead?" Ye Xijun's brows knit. "Were you attacked by that secret treasure?"

"Yes — I nearly died!" Yang Kai shuddered; at the thought of that treasure's power his heart remained unsettled. He had never seen a secret treasure with such formidable might. "Is it called the Extinction Thunder Bead? Could it be a Void King‑Grade secret treasure?"

"It is not Void King‑Grade." To Yang Kai's surprise, Ye Xijun slowly shook her head. She set down her scissors and rose as if falling into memory. After a while she moved with light steps toward a stone pavilion and said, "Sect Master, come and sit, let's speak."

Yang Kai followed.

In the stone pavilion the two took their seats. Ye Xijun poured a cup of tea herself and pushed it to Yang Kai, then smoothed back her hair and said, "That the Sect Master emerged unscathed from beneath the Extinction Thunder Bead proves you are extraordinary — I confess I have underestimated you."

"Just luck," Yang Kai said, lifting the tea and taking a sip. He looked at her with suspicion. "If the Extinction Thunder Bead has such power, surely it must be Void King‑Grade?"

"It is Star Emperor Mountain's treasure that guards the mountain; it has surpassed the Void King‑Grade — it is an Imperial Treasure!"

"An Imperial Treasure?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "A treasure of an emperor?"

"Indeed," Ye Xijun nodded lightly.

"Impossible," Yang Kai's face changed. He had seen an Imperial Treasure before — the Three Flames Ring was one. Sadly, Yang Yan had only taken one of the flame rings then; the other two remained embedded in Dark Star's surface, forming the Flowing Flame Sandland and creating Lingxiao Sect's most formidable defense.

"The Extinction Thunder Bead is indeed an Imperial Treasure, but with the strength of those on Star Emperor Mountain they cannot unlock its full might. Even I, if I personally attempted to wield it, could not unleash even ten percent of its power!"

"Ten percent is that terrifying?" Yang Kai's color changed.

"Yes. The might of an Imperial Treasure is beyond imagination. Moreover, forcibly activating an Imperial Treasure at low cultivation exacts a heavy price. After that person used the Extinction Thunder Bead against you, was his aura very feeble?"

"Indeed."

"That is the point. If one could fully unleash the Extinction Thunder Bead's power, even a Void King Realm cultivator could be killed in an instant, let alone you, Sect Master."

Yang Kai's expression was stricken with horror.

If it had not been for Fei Zhi Tu using the Blue Jade Bowl to shield him at the crucial moment, he would have been gravely injured; this time he escaped by luck — what about the next time?
