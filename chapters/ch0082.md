## Chapter 82 — That Night’s Person Was Indeed You

“Who knows what kind of scoundrel keeps staring at a young lady’s buttocks and thighs all day long,” Yang Kai retorted without mercy.

“You’re bringing this up again?” Meng Wuya looked around nervously, as if afraid someone might overhear. He quickly cupped his hands in apology. “Young Master Yang, Elder Yang, can we just not mention this? The old man was only checking on their development, not planning to do anything to them.”

Seeing him back down, Yang Kai ceased his relentless teasing and spoke seriously, “The favor you want me to do, is it related to these matters?”

“That’s right!” Meng Wuya’s expression turned grave as he spoke of the real issue. “So, Young Yang Kai, you must tell me the truth. Have you ever been... involved with a woman? This is very important.”

Yang Kai’s face flushed slightly as he sniffed and replied, “No.”

“Good!” Meng Wuya finally felt a weight lift from his heart. “Excellent! Young Yang Kai, you’re a good man.”

In this era, many young men had experienced intimacy with women by the age of fourteen or fifteen. The children of poor families married early simply to continue their lineage. As for the wealthy, it was even more common—those young masters barely had any hair on their bodies, yet already had several concubines.

Only cultivators, devoted solely to their training, tended to remain pure much longer—some never engaging in close contact with the opposite sex throughout their lives. To those pursuing cultivation and strength, the worldly pleasures were but illusions; the beauties of the world would all turn to dust in a hundred years. Only the pinnacle of martial arts was their true pursuit. And once strong enough, why fear being unable to find a woman?

Among the male disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, many at fifteen or sixteen frequented places of pleasure. Although Meng Wuya trusted that Yang Kai was not such a person, prudence compelled him to ask clearly.

“So, you mean I can help you with this matter?” Yang Kai glanced at Meng Wuya sideways.

“If even you can’t, then no one in the world can. Consider this hurdle passed!” Meng Wuya laughed heartily, his mood brightening.

“But you just said you need another person to be satisfied?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.

Meng Wuya’s smile faded, his expression turning strange as he nodded. “Yes, she must be satisfied. If she isn’t, this won’t work. To be honest, I found someone suitable a few months ago, but she refused. So the matter was dropped. Forget it, I’ll take you to meet her. If it works out, great; if not... well...” 

He trailed off, unsure how to continue, sighing deeply before leading Yang Kai outside.

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “Let me make it clear—I’m only here to help you out of gratitude. If that person asks me to do anything too outrageous, I won’t agree.”

“You brat!” Meng Wuya was annoyed by Yang Kai’s evasiveness. If he knew what kind of help was needed, he’d be eager to agree. Yet here he was, pretending to be prudent after getting a good deal.

As they walked, Yang Kai realized they were heading toward Dragon Confinement Ravine.

What were they doing there? He often trained nearby, but he had never seen anyone there. The ravine was a dangerous place, rarely visited.

When they were still about a hundred zhang from his usual training spot, Meng Wuya suddenly stopped and pointed ahead. “Look there.”

Yang Kai looked up, startled.

Where he usually trained stood a woman. She was right before the few Three-Yang Fruit trees he had planted. Wearing a pale green dress, she seemed lost in thought, unmoving despite the howling wind that fluttered her clothes.

Her face was veiled, hiding her true features.

On her forehead, a faint blue gem adorned her, making her appear ethereal and refined.

Her figure was slender and delicate, seemingly fragile yet gracefully shaped.

Her clear, watery eyes were filled with innocence, resembling a child who had yet to grow up.

Seeing her, Yang Kai recalled that night—the beauty on his broken bed beneath the moonlight.

“It’s her!” Yang Kai’s gaze softened suddenly.

“You know her?” Meng Wuya became alert. His treasured disciple had told him she had never even spoken to Yang Kai. How could they already know each other?

“Is she the one you want me to help?” Yang Kai asked Meng Wuya.

“Yes,” Meng Wuya nodded.

“I’ll help!” Unexpectedly to Meng Wuya, Yang Kai agreed without hesitation or delay. All the speeches he had prepared—reasoning, emotional appeal, promises, or threats—were rendered useless.

A strange unease crept into Meng Wuya’s heart. Suddenly, he regretted having sought Yang Kai’s help.

“Why did you agree so quickly?” the old man asked warily.

“Weren’t you the one asking for help?” Yang Kai frowned, puzzled by Meng Wuya’s sudden change in attitude.

“I did ask, but you agreed far too readily,” Meng Wuya waved his hands. “You owe me an explanation.”

“Do you want my help or not?” Yang Kai grew impatient.

“Yes, of course I do.”

“Then why ask? Isn’t it good that I agreed?”

Indeed, wasn’t it good that he agreed so quickly? Why did Meng Wuya feel something was amiss? He was left speechless.

Yang Kai stepped forward toward the woman.

His footsteps startled Xia Ningshang, who was deep in thought. When she came back to her senses, Yang Kai was already beside her.

Xia Ningshang was clearly taken aback, looking at Yang Kai with some embarrassment.

She had no choice but to be flustered—twice now, their nighttime meetings had led to awkward situations. How could she remain calm?

“Senior Sister Xia,” Yang Kai said, “what are you doing here?”

“I... I came to watch over your fruit,” Xia Ningshang hurriedly explained. “You haven’t been here these past few days, and I was afraid someone might pick them.”

Yang Kai turned to look and found that all the fruit on the first three trees he had planted were gone. Only the last tree still bore three nearly ripe fruits.

“These are your fruits. I refined them into pills,” Xia Ningshang said as she produced a small bottle and handed it to Yang Kai.

Taking it, Yang Kai saw nine red pills swirling inside, radiating strong True Yang Primordial Qi.

They were pure, without any other ingredients mixed in. But how could pills be made from only one kind of Three-Yang Fruit?

“Senior Sister, you knew I was training here?” Yang Kai looked up. If not, why would she be guarding the Three-Yang Fruit trees?

Xia Ningshang’s gaze flickered nervously. “I saw it by chance.”

“That night’s person was indeed you,” Yang Kai smiled slightly, warmth blossoming in his heart.
