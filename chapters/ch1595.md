## Chapter 1595 — Domain Stones

It wasn’t that the man’s strength was inferior to Xue Sun’s—in a true one-on-one fight, their abilities were about the same, more or less evenly matched.

Even if Xue Sun was somewhat stronger, she probably wasn't that much stronger; at the very least she didn't have the ability to kill her opponent by herself.

Yet Yang Kai's lightning-quick combat left the man in utter shock.

The seductive woman's dying shrieks and pleas for help disturbed his mind, preventing him from fighting at full capacity.

Moreover, Yang Kai stood not far away, watching him like a tiger stalking prey; the man grew ever more panic-stricken.

He couldn't make sense of it — in only a few breaths, how had his Junior Sister died!

He knew his Junior Sister's strength; she was roughly on par with him. How could she have died so quickly at the hands of a warrior of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

He was shaken to his core, utterly ignorant of what had occurred between his Junior Sister and that youth.

The fear of unknown made him lose his footing; how could he possibly display his full strength? Xue Sun naturally seized the chance, venting all the fury of being pursued and unleashing various Secret Treasures and secret techniques unique to the yao.

The man was thoroughly suppressed; the battle turned into a one-sided affair.

He clearly didn't intend to sit and await death. In a desperate moment he bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of Essence-Blood, performing a tremendously powerful secret technique that stalled Xue Sun for an instant. Then his figure became a residual afterimage and he suddenly vanished from the spot.

He conceived the idea of retreat; he no longer dared to entangle with Xue Sun.

Before leaving he cast a glance at Yang Kai and saw that this unfathomable youth was merely standing there, seemingly not intending to stop him; this made him breathe a sigh of relief.

Just as he thought he had escaped death, the surrounding space suddenly grew viscous.

His body involuntarily faltered; his eyes narrowed and he cried out in alarm, "Shi!"

He was also a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, so he naturally understood the mysteries and effects of Shi. The moment he stepped into that viscous space he knew he had fallen into a powerful Shi.

The force of this Shi was far thicker than what he himself possessed — terrifyingly strong — and within it there seemed to be mixed other strange energies.

Not daring to neglect it, he hastily released his own Shi to counter it, but that only restored a little freedom. It was impossible to break free of that Shi in a short time.

A figure entered his sight. He looked up and cried out in shock, "How could you possibly be here?"

At that moment he was horrified to discover that Yang Kai, who should have been watching from afar, had actually come to a point not far from him — yet he hadn't sensed the other's movement at all.

"Why shouldn't I be here?" Yang Kai sneered, gradually amplifying the power of his own Shi.

The man trapped within immediately broke out in a cold sweat; each step became arduous.

Hiss...

A faint sound came from all directions. The man looked around and found the surrounding space seemingly collapsing — dark, hair-thin, bizarre cracks constantly appearing and then vanishing.

Terror seized him; he had never known someone's Shi could have such unfathomable effects on space.

In that instant he finally understood that his Junior Sister hadn't died so quickly by accident — this Second Stage youth was the truly terrifying enemy.

Allowing him no chance to resist, Yang Kai flicked his fingers in succession and a dozen or so black Space Blades shot out one after another. They easily shattered the man's Saint Yuan and defensive Secret Treasure, carved his body into pieces, and banished most of his flesh and blood into the endless void.

The man collapsed with a thunderous crash; his body lay in pieces.

Xue Sun's beautiful eyes trembled as she watched; her delicate frame grew chilled.

Although she knew Yang Kai's killing of the man had some hint of a sneak attack, his strength was indisputable.

No wonder Xue Lian was taught a lesson, no wonder Mi Tian treated him with such caution. There was reason for all of this.

Judging from his earlier display, when he dealt with Mi Tian and Xue Lian he probably hadn't used his full might; otherwise those two wouldn't still be alive.

Xue Sun had always thought that within the Origin Returning Realm, Xue Lian and Mi Tian were already powerful enough — she admired them — but today she realized she had been narrow-minded.

The Origin Returning Realm could be even stronger!

The arrogance and disdain in her eyes quickly receded; she began to reassess Yang Kai.

Perhaps... Qingluo's choice wasn't wrong, she thought.

Yang Kai's gaze turned toward her. Xue Sun quickly averted her eyes, not daring to meet his. She didn't know why, but in the depths of her heart a strand of fear toward the youth stirred.

He could effortlessly, in a very short time, kill the two who had been chasing her — and he could kill her without breaking a sweat!

Xue Sun swayed and picked up the Spatial Rings of the two dead men, then came to Yang Kai and handed them to him.

"Thanks." Yang Kai chuckled lightly and accepted the two Spatial Rings without refusing or even looking. After a moment's thought he asked, "So, where are those Domain Stones you mentioned?"

"I'll take you there!" Xue Sun volunteered, employing her movement technique and heading in a direction.

"How are your injuries?" Yang Kai followed behind her and asked casually.

"Minor wounds, nothing serious," Xue Sun replied coldly.

Yang Kai said no more and followed her through the Blood Prison.

The place where Xue Sun had discovered the Domain Stones wasn’t too far from their previous location—at most, it would take about an hour to reach.

"There's one thing I must tell you," midway Xue Sun's lovely eyes flickered and she seemed somewhat guilty.

"What?" Yang Kai asked, suspiciously.

"Actually, the two you killed had companions as well," Xue Sun glanced at Yang Kai.

"Where?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"Right by the Domain Stones..." Xue Sun grew more uneasy and, gritting her teeth, told the truth: "Earlier I discovered those Domain Stones and intended to go in and take them, but I ran into those guys. There were five people in total, seemingly from the same Cultivation Star. Those two pursued me relentlessly while the other three stayed behind. I don't know if they've succeeded yet; if they have..."

"Then that's perfect — we'll just seize it," Yang Kai grinned.

Xue Sun's brows furrowed and she looked at him earnestly: "Aren't you angry? I didn't tell you the truth earlier. I lied to you."

"A little," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Xue Sun's expression shifted slightly.

"But it doesn't matter to me, so I'm not bothered," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Keep leading the way."

"Alright." Xue Sun exhaled and finally relaxed.

After a while, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, a look of pleasure on his face, and asked, "It's just ahead, right? I can feel the fluctuations of the domain field."

"Mm." Xue Sun nodded and quickened her pace considerably.

In an instant, Yang Kai and Xue Sun arrived before a Domain vortex.

The Domain vortex covered an area of about two hundred zhang across; within it surged energy fluctuations that made one wary, and at the very center of the vortex lay several fist-sized stones that gave off a strange sheen.

Domain Stones! Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he fixed his gaze on those stones.

It was his first time seeing Domain Stones of this kind, so he was naturally curious. But because of the Domain vortex's barrier he couldn't release his Divine Sense to examine them closely and couldn't tell exactly how many Domain Stones there were.

Yet undeniably, any Domain Stone was immensely valuable; if brought out it could be exchanged for many precious cultivation resources, or one could absorb the Domain Stone's power and comprehend the mysteries of the Domain.

Within that two hundred zhang area three people sat cross-legged at different positions, seemingly meditating on the Domain's mysteries in hopes of pushing inward to seize the Domain Stones.

The enormous value of a Domain Stone stemmed not only from the Domain secrets it contained but also from the risk involved in obtaining it.

Rarity has always made things precious, and this was vividly exemplified by Domain Stones.

Domain Stones are only born within Domain vortices; to retrieve one you must first comprehend the vortex's secrets to reach its deepest part and safely take the Domain Stone.

Countless Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts had died within Domain vortices; their lives and blood endowed Domain Stones with supreme value.

To obtain a Domain Stone, one might even die for it.

And the fact that several Domain Stones had been born in this vortex naturally excited Yang Kai greatly.

He only cast a casual glance at the three strangers deep within the vortex and paid them no further heed.

The Domain vortex before him felt neither strong nor weak — somewhat weaker than the one that had strangled Xu Dingyang; otherwise those three wouldn't be able to sit there calmly.

Yang Kai and Xue Sun's arrival naturally startled the three meditating within the Domain. They opened their eyes and surveyed Yang Kai and Xue Sun. A white-haired elder lightly exclaimed and said in surprise, "Yao woman, how are you still alive?"

Xue Sun let out a cold snort. “Old bastard, are you disappointed that I’m still alive?”

“Where are Senior Brother Li and his Junior Sister?” another man, a one-eyed fellow with a vicious expression, asked coldly, his brow furrowing.

Xue Sun sneered, "Since I returned alive, what do you think their fate was?"

“Impossible!” The one-eyed man’s expression changed as he caught the implication in Xue Sun’s words, his face twisting in disbelief.

"Don't be ridiculous. You yao wench — do you really think you could kill Brother Li and his Junior Sister? You're way out of your depth," the third person scoffed, clearly thinking Xue Sun was babbling.

"Believe it or not as you wish." Xue Sun didn't want to explain further; she ground her teeth and said, "Those two are dead, and next it'll be your turn!"

The white-haired elder was momentarily stunned, then burst into loud laughter. "Yao woman, you're arrogant and full of hot air. Fine, fine — I'm trapped within the Domain vortex and can't act for now, so let your words be. If you truly have the ability, wait until I get out of here and we'll have a proper contest."
