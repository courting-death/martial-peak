## Chapter 1446 — To Fight or Not

"Then what benefit do you want?" The young woman sounded displeased; Yang Kai was actually bargaining with her at a moment like this.

Yang Kai had not yet replied when Kong Wendong cut him off, refusing to give him the chance—how could he stand by and watch Yang Kai be wooed over by that woman? His expression hardened and he barked, "Brat, Kong has already given you a chance; you sought your own death, so don't blame others. A mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—if Kong wants to kill you, who can stop me?"

As he spoke, Saint Yuan surged through his body with a thunderous roar; scorching heat radiated from him, and the surrounding temperature instantly jumped a notch.

He put on the air of someone about to slaughter, but it was largely for show—meant to drive Yang Kai off. Having already insulted the other side verbally, he naturally didn't want Yang Kai to stay, but not knowing Yang Kai's true ability, he also didn't wish to truly go all out.

The plan was sound, and the logic clear—but the woman in a palace dress was no fool. How could she just watch as a potential wild card like Yang Kai walked away? Before Kong Wendong could finish speaking, she snapped coldly, “Go ahead and try, if you dare!”

A fiercer chill issued from her lithe form; she stared at Kong Wendong without the slightest retreat.

Yang Kai frowned and cast a slightly sullen glance at the beauty.

At first the woman's words sounded innocuous, even protective, as if she were standing up for him, but if Yang Kai's instincts were right, her kindness was anything but sincere.

She seemed to be itching for Kong Wendong to strike him!

That made sense—if the bald man really attacked him, it would push him onto the side of the three women, making him their ally; willing or not, to survive he'd have to join forces with them.

This woman…was not the pure, untouched beauty she appeared; she was scheming. Yang Kai's impression of her sank considerably.

Now the key was whether Kong Wendong would take the bait. Thinking this, Yang Kai glanced at the bald man and sighed softly.

The man was a cultivator of the Fire Radiance Sect; his technique was surely fire-based. Practitioners of that art commonly shared a fault—their tempers were quick to flare and aggressive. This stemmed from the method itself, not merely personal temperament.

The young woman's words had put Kong Wendong on the horns of a dilemma. Coupled with the fact that he was not a man of mild disposition, what hesitation would remain? Moreover, a mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—he truly had not taken Yang Kai seriously; otherwise, when Yang Kai first arrived he would not have kicked him out so rudely.

Kong Wendong sneered, "Brat, when you reach the underworld don't blame me—blame that bitch; she forced me!"

As he spoke, he opened his hand in a mock grabbing motion and struck down toward Yang Kai's head.

Fire-attributed Spiritual Qi in the world suddenly gathered, coalescing above Yang Kai's crown. In moments a towering inferno flared—a massive flaming palm formed, burning fiercely as it came crashing down upon Yang Kai.

Seeing this, the women on the young woman's side all narrowed their eyes in alarm, their faces full of shock. They'd sparred with members of the Fire Radiance Sect before, but had never witnessed an attack of such scale—Kong Wendong had unleashed fire in its most consummate form!

Though shocked, the leading young woman did not let the rare chance slip by.

Just as Kong Wendong struck toward Yang Kai and nearly everyone’s attention was drawn to him, the palace-dressed woman suddenly moved—her hands weaving like fluttering butterflies. A chill that pierced to the bone spread from her body as a pure white ice spear quietly formed before her. With a sharp cry, the spear quivered in midair, then shot forth like an arrow loosed from the string, streaking straight toward the weakest cultivator on the opposing side.

That man's cultivation matched Yang Kai's—a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—and among the seven he was effectively at the bottom.

Better to sever one finger than to wound ten. The young woman's looks were refined, but her strike was ruthless and merciless.

A scream immediately rose; the targeted cultivator spat a fountain of blood. Though he instinctively shifted his body at the moment the enemy closed in, the ice-tipped spear still pierced his lower abdomen entirely—blood gushed, and he was grievously wounded.

After all, the ambush had been launched by a cultivator two Stages higher; it was a wonder he had survived at all. Even so, he lost most of his fighting capacity and, if a major battle broke out next, would be unable to contribute much.

With a successful strike, a satisfied smile bloomed on the young woman's delicate face.

Kong Wendong's expression contorted into an ugly snarl as he ground his teeth, "Bitch, so that's what you were planning!"

He had underestimated her cunning; he thought that after his attack she would rush to rescue Yang Kai, ingratiate herself to him, and recruit this new force, making it four versus four.

Little did he know she hadn't cared in the slightest about Yang Kai's life; instead of saving him she seized the chance to grievously wound one of his own.

Trading the life of an unknown youth to eliminate one of the enemy’s combatants — Ice Heart Valley had come out well ahead on this deal!

Kong Wendong’s face was uglier than that of a corpse, his expression like he had just swallowed a fly—disgust written all over him.

The young woman's smile was as pretty as a flower as she leisurely said, "Kong Wendong, if you're sensible then leave now, or don't blame me for being ruthless."

“Wench!” Kong Wendong roared furiously. “You think you’ve got me cornered? You really don’t know your place!”

The woman paid no heed to his insults; with the utmost composure she tapped her palm, and a delicate flower drum appeared in her hand—exquisite in appearance, yet radiating violent Spiritual Qi fluctuations.

"Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum!" The bald man narrowed his eyes and cried out, astonished—this secret treasure clearly had a pedigree. He stared at the woman in disbelief, "How do you have this thing!"

The young woman chuckled, "If one is entering the Imperial Garden, one must bring some decent secret treasures—what, you don't have a Void King-Grade secret treasure?"

Those words choked Kong Wendong; he and the woman were of similar cultivation and standing within their respective sects, but now she held a Void King-Grade secret treasure and he did not—by comparison he looked shabby and overlooked.

That might have been tolerable, but the true issue was the treasure's potency. As a Void King-Grade secret treasure it would surely be devastating, and the bald man deeply understood the weirdness of the Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum—fear crept across his face.

Yet he soon laughed, as if reaching some conclusion. "Wench, don't put on airs—if you could fully unleash the drum's power, why didn't you use it earlier? If I'm not mistaken, you haven't fully refined it, have you?"

Now the young woman's expression darkened.

Indeed, as Kong Wendong had guessed, the Void King-Grade secret treasure had been borrowed from her elders specifically for the Imperial Garden trip and had to be returned afterward; she hadn't had time to fully refine it, and at most could bring out only fifty percent of its strength. Otherwise she would have used it to drive Kong Wendong off right away instead of lingering to haggle.

Seeing her change in countenance, Kong Wendong laughed heartily, "With a half-refined treasure you think you can scare Kong? Stinking woman, do you think Kong is to be cowed?"

"So what? A Void King-Grade secret treasure is a Void King-Grade secret treasure. If you want to try it, come on—if you don't have the guts, then leave now!" the woman said coldly and sharply.

Kong Wendong frowned, hesitating; he found himself at a loss.

On one hand he coveted the hidden cave and its treasures, on the other he feared the Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum's might; he was loath to test it on himself, and so he wavered.

"Hey, are you actually going to fight or not? I still have to get to another place." A languid sigh came from not far off; in an instant everyone stared that way in stunned disbelief.

Where their gazes fixed, a cluster of firelight had been enveloping the spot where Kong Wendong had gathered fire Spiritual Qi and struck, but now the dense flame seemed to be shaken apart by something, rolling back to reveal a hidden figure.

"Impossible!" Kong Wendong nearly bit his tongue—he couldn't believe his eyes.

There stood the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm youth he'd struck earlier, utterly unharmed; not only was he alive, there wasn't even a sign of injury.

How could this be?

Kong Wendong knew the strength of his attack—let alone a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, even an unguarded Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would have been left crestfallen and battered. A mere First Stage should have been killed outright.

The youth had not used any defensive secret treasure nor employed protective Saint Yuan—how could he be completely unhurt?

Kong Wendong could hardly believe he wasn't dreaming.

It wasn't just him; the three women on the young woman's side were equally shocked, their pretty eyes full of astonishment.

Yang Kai's expression was one of complete helplessness. After Kong Wendong's strike he had restrained his own aura, planning to sit back and watch the tigers tear each other apart, but that hope now looked unrealistic. The two sides had formed a balance that could stalemate for a very long time unless some new change occurred—no one would strike first.

Helpless, he could only show himself.

At his appearance, not only did Kong Wendong's face sour, but the young woman's look likewise faded; the former had struck at him and the latter had used his moment of attack to ambush an opponent, claiming to be rescuing him while in truth letting him die—her face naturally could not remain straight.
