## Chapter 916 — The Change in the Sacred Tomb

In a plaza within the Sacred Land, bodies pressed close together as practitioners who had entered the Saint Stage gathered here in force.

Yang Kai introduced Shopkeeper Meng and Xia Ningshang to the elders of the Sacred Land; the elders and several leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan nodded in acknowledgment, offering polite greetings.

When they learned Xia Ningshang and Yang Kai came from the same sect and were Senior Sister and Junior Brother, expressions across the crowd grew solemn—no one dared show the slightest disrespect.

Seeing the intimacy between Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang made the onlookers instantly form a clear guess about the nature of their relationship.

"I thought our Saint Lord would never fall for a woman; turns out he’s already attached," Elder Yu Ying said from the edge, pursing her lips in a faint smile.

"Poor Ling'er…" Cheng Yuetong couldn't help but feel sorry for An Ling'er; the elders assumed she had begun cultivating the inheritance with Yang Kai, unaware that An Ling'er had long been conspiring with him.

"Ling'er should be aware of this," Yu Ying chuckled. "A figure like the Saint Lord having a few women is normal enough; Ling'er isn't petty—why would she begrudge someone else? Besides, that young woman seems mild by nature; she won't contend with Ling'er for favor."

"I hope that's true," Cheng Yuetong murmured, nodding slightly.

"Meng Wuya?" Just then Xu Hui suddenly gasped, his eyes widening as he stared at Shopkeeper Meng with an excited look on his face.

“Great Elder, what are you saying? Didn’t I just introduce you a moment ago?” Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

"I remember that name—centuries ago the human race's foremost expert had the same name! You wouldn't happen to be…"

"Foremost expert?" Shopkeeper Meng frowned and smiled wryly. "People flatter me—I'm nothing but a hotheaded fellow. I don't deserve the title 'foremost.'"

"Is it really you?" Xu Hui's face showed shock.

The other elders stood dumbfounded, staring at Meng Wuya as if struck senseless by a giant hammer.

Xu Hui's reminder finally jogged their memories of the name Meng Wuya.

"I've long admired you; I never expected to see you in this life—truly a thrice-blessed fortune," Xu Hui kept clasping his hands in salute; when Yang Kai had first introduced Meng Wuya he had only exchanged formal pleasantries.

After all, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land now held great renown; as a grand elder of the Sacred Land, Xu Hui's status was lofty, and he had rarely paid much heed to ordinary people.

It was only because Yang Kai's seniority connected them that Xu Hui had initiated conversation.

But now, upon confirming the man's identity, his attitude changed entirely—there was even a trace of reverence.

"Enough—Shopkeeper Meng and our Little Senior Sister will live in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land from now on; there'll be plenty of time to talk," Yang Kai waved, cutting off Xu Hui's babbling.

"Oh? Brother Meng is staying at the Sacred Land—you're most welcome!" Xu Hui's eyes brightened with delight.

"Let Shopkeeper Meng and Little Senior Sister stay at the Saint Lord's Courtyard, where I normally reside. What do you think?" Yang Kai asked Meng Wuya.

"Fine, as long as it's quiet," Meng Wuya nodded.

"Then follow me." Yang Kai called out.

"Saint Lord, let Elder Yu Ying handle this—I have matters to report," Xu Hui hurried to stop Yang Kai when he tried to leave.

"Can't it wait a moment?"

"This concerns something serious!" Xu Hui's face turned grave.

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then helplessly said, "Very well, Elder Yu Ying, please take them to the Saint Lord's Courtyard and have An Ling'er make the arrangements."

"Yes—please come with me." Yu Ying invited them along.

Xia Ningshang glanced at Yang Kai with reluctance before following Yu Ying.

“Master, since there’s nothing more here, I’ll return to rest first.” Li Rong offered her apologies, then departed together with the other commanders of the Ancient Demon Clan, heading back to the peak where they resided.

Soon the plaza had only Yang Kai and a few elders of the Sacred Land left.

"What is so urgent that you must be so cautious?" Yang Kai, annoyed at Xu Hui interrupting his time with his Little Senior Sister, gave him a look and asked.

"The Sacred Tomb!" Xu Hui answered quickly. "Something's gone wrong with the Sacred Tomb—Saint Lord, you should see for yourself."

"What could possibly happen to the Sacred Tomb?" Yang Kai replied indifferently.

The Sacred Tomb was the Sacred Land's forbidden ground—the resting place of past Saint Lords. But since Yang Kai's last entry, the Sacred Tomb had been empty; three thousand disciples had even taken refuge inside for a couple of years.

That abandoned Small Xuan Realm had little use besides serving as a place to isolate and cultivate.

Yang Kai couldn't fathom what could have gone wrong.

Before the Sacred Tomb a group halted; Yang Kai looked at the huge blue stone and his expression turned serious.

The enormous stone bore a sealing formation; only the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring in Yang Kai's possession could activate the entrance to the Small Xuan Realm.

Yet now, in the very center of the stone, a black Void Passage silently opened like the maw of a beast.

A hundred zhang from the Sacred Tomb, elders had jointly set up a barrier preventing ordinary disciples from approaching.

"What happened?" Yang Kai asked. "How did the Sacred Tomb open?"

"We don't know either—it just opened of its own accord. To prevent disciples from blundering in, the elders set repressing formations around it," they replied.

"Has anyone gone in to investigate?" Yang Kai turned to Xu Hui.

"Elder Shi Kun and I went in."

"What did you find?"

"Nothing. It seems the interior was unaffected."

"I'll go look—wait here." Yang Kai said and dove in.

After an incense stick's worth of time he returned from the Sacred Tomb with an odd expression.

As Xu Hui had said, apart from the entrance opening on its own, the interior remained unchanged—still thick with Spiritual Qi and apparently harmless.

He observed for a long while but couldn't make sense of it, and asked, "When did this happen?"

"Two or three days ago."

"Two or three days ago?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and felt a sudden unease.

"Is something the matter, Saint Lord? Have you discovered anything?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

Two or three days ago seemed to coincide with the time he had rescued Shopkeeper Meng and Xia Ningshang.

But there shouldn't be any connection; the distance between those events was vast—about two months' journey.

Was it a coincidence?

"Don't let disciples near this place for now—there may be danger. Observe it for a while," Yang Kai admitted he was at a loss; he couldn't fathom why the Small Xuan Realm's entrance had opened.

The elders received the order and hurriedly made arrangements.

Returning to the Saint Lord's Courtyard, Yang Kai had barely set foot inside when he felt a dozen gazes turning toward him.

Five masters stood there—apparently they had rushed out upon hearing of his return.

"You brat, you were so thoughtless. You were gone three months and nearly ruined us!" Chang Bao, always blunt, shouted the moment they met.

As the head of the Alchemists' Association in Shining City and a Saint-Grade pill master, Chang Bao enjoyed high status; he brewed pills as his mood allowed and only occasionally crafted a Saint Pill.

He had never done anything like this before: manufacturing pills nonstop for three months, every day meeting strict quotas.

It was as if he had been working for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land with no benefit.

After three months, Chang Bao had lost dozens of jin of fat and looked noticeably slimmer.

"Indeed—we were talking the other day about quitting if you didn't return; we'd just stop and walk away, leaving the Sacred Land's reputation to the winds," Hong Fang chimed in.

"Cut it out—don't act like you didn't gain from it," Kong Ruoyu glared. "Thanks to these three months you all made gains; Du Wan has reached Saint-Grade Middle-Level pill master—haven't you seen some hope? It was hard work, but the harvest was worthwhile."

Scolded by Kong Ruoyu, the two had nothing to retort and merely glared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hurried forward and, apologetic, clasped his hands. "I'm sorry—I didn't expect it to take so long. I thought it would be only a few days, but many unexpected things happened. I owe you masters thanks; because of you the Sacred Land preserved its reputation these past months."

"Good that you know that," He Feng nodded in approval. "You left us to slave away—tell me what you'll do to make us satisfied."

Yang Kai's eyes flicked to his Little Senior Sister whispering with An Ling'er. Brightening, he grinned and said, "I've ordered all those seeking pills outside to wait ten days; in these ten days the Sacred Land won't make pills for others—masters, take this time to rest."

"Rest alone won’t satisfy our appetites," Chang Bao said, shaking his head.

"In ten days—I'll make sure you masters are satisfied."

"Good!" Chang Bao's plump face lit up. "We ask for nothing more—just brew some pills in front of us and we'll be content."

"Masters, wait and see—I'll give you a surprise," Yang Kai chuckled.

The masters exchanged puzzled looks, unsure what trick Yang Kai had up his sleeve.

Du Wan smiled. "Don't overexert yourself; you have ten days—rest. I see you're eager to speak with that young woman, so we old men won't disturb you. We haven't seen much of this place yet; friends, shall we go tour the Nine Peaks?"

"Sounds good—sitting inside all day has made us stiff."

The masters laughed and left the Saint Lord's Courtyard, apparently planning to tour the Nine Peaks' scenery.
