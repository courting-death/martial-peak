## Chapter 12 — The Scheme

A fierce beating ensued. Although the merchants on this street were all ordinary folk, at this moment they unleashed a shocking combat prowess. Many of these merchants had been extorted before and harbored deep hatred for such scoundrels. Now that they had a target for their anger, they showed no mercy.

Especially the assistant from the He Family Rice Shop, who grabbed two cloth sacks and threw them over the heads of the two men—one sack per man—then proceeded to pummel them mercilessly.

This only fueled the crowd’s fury further. Since the two burly men could not see who was attacking them, they had no fear of retaliation later.

Strength in numbers prevailed. Yang Kai merely pretended to act and had no chance to strike before the merchants pushed him out.

After a long while, the merchants gradually ceased their assault, leaving the two men curled up on the ground, wailing incessantly. The cloth sacks covering their heads were knocked off, and Su Mu’s eyes widened in disbelief. His feet even cramped from the effort. The two originally towering and muscular men now had noses flattened beyond recognition, eyes swollen shut, and faces puffed up like pig heads—almost unrecognizable even to their own mothers.

This outcome was because the two men had little real strength. Though they carried swords and knives at their waists, it was all for show. If they were true experts, would they care about attacks from ordinary people?

But then again, true experts would never stoop to such despicable deeds.

Having knocked the two down, the merchants felt a measure of relief but still lingered nearby, unwilling to leave.

The two men sensed the hostile expressions around them and grew terrified. One weakly stretched out a trembling hand toward Su Mu, feebly calling out, “Su…”

Su Mu’s face darkened. He roared, “Su what? You want me to soothe your muscles?”

Yang Kai observed this with a smile hidden in his heart and stepped forward, loudly declaring, “These two despicable scoundrels have ruined countless merchants, driving families to ruin. They are utterly detestable!”

Yang Kai’s words were somewhat exaggerated, but with so many merchants present, it stirred a genuine sense of shared grievance. The assistant from the He Family Rice Shop spat disdainfully, “Bah! Worthless trash! How dare they cause trouble in our rice shop.”

The assistant was merely venting his anger, unaware that Yang Kai immediately followed up, “Indeed, these people deserve death. Young brother, why don’t we each take one and kill them? That way, they’ll never dare to act wickedly again. It would be justice served.”

At these words, the crowd was stunned. The two men on the ground broke out in cold sweat, staring at Yang Kai in horror. They never expected this slender youth to harbor such ruthless intent.

Su Mu’s eyes widened as he stared at Yang Kai, trying to determine if he was joking. But Yang Kai’s solemn expression made it clear he was deadly serious.

To be honest, although these two men were vile, they hardly deserved death. Yang Kai’s suggestion was undeniably cruel.

Su Mu stammered, “Senior brother, isn’t this going too far?”

“Too far?” Yang Kai shook his head gravely. “If their scheme succeeds today, Boss He’s rice shop will likely collapse. If that happens, how will Boss He’s family survive? This would drive them to desperation. How is killing them too much? One must pay the price for their deeds.”

At first, the merchants felt uneasy at the idea of killing, but after hearing these words, they found some truth in them and were unsure what to do. However, since they would not have to act themselves, they all watched silently. Only Boss He wanted to speak but was silenced by a sharp look from Yang Kai.

“But… even so, killing someone casually is wrong,” Su Mu said anxiously. He had never expected his senior brother to be so cold-blooded. The original plan was simple: have these two men come to slander Boss He, then step in to save the day and earn Boss He’s gratitude. But now this ruthless senior brother wanted to kill them outright.

This was very troubling.

Su Mu clearly saw the two men on the ground casting pleading, even somewhat threatening, looks at him—hoping he would save them. Su Mu understood perfectly what they meant.

They were all grasshoppers tied to the same string: if we suffer, you won’t fare well either. That was the message in their eyes.

At that moment, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Junior brother, Confucians use literature to disrupt the law, knights use force to break the rules. Among us in the martial world, who doesn’t have a few lives on their hands? Are you unwilling to strike? Or… do you already know them? Is that why you hesitate to kill?”

Su Mu’s heart skipped a beat. He suddenly turned to look at Yang Kai, who was smiling mischievously.

“What do you mean by that, senior brother?” Su Mu’s face darkened. Could it be that his plan had been seen through? But he had been so careful—how could it have been uncovered?

What he did not know was that Yang Kai’s insight came from a mere glance, a coincidence. Without that, Yang Kai himself would have been fooled.

Boss He, sharp as he was, caught the implication in Yang Kai’s words and suspiciously asked, “Young man, what play are you putting on here?”

Yang Kai’s tone clearly targeted Su Mu, and Boss He was not blind to it.

Yang Kai shook his head without answering or revealing anything, instead turning back to Su Mu. “Junior brother, you seem a decisive person. Why hesitate now when it’s time to uphold justice and benefit the village? Besides, I am here with you. What is there to fear?”

“What am I afraid of?” Su Mu laughed awkwardly, muttering to himself, “What am I afraid of? It’s just killing someone. Who hasn’t done that?”

It was as if admitting he had never killed before made him feel inferior to Yang Kai.

Youthful spirit stirred by Yang Kai’s words, Su Mu suddenly found himself unable to back down.

Steeling his resolve, Su Mu’s eyes gleamed with killing intent as he looked at the two men on the ground. The men immediately sensed danger. This youth had been completely fooled and was no longer in his right mind.

“Junior brother, let’s go,” Yang Kai urged, fanning the flames.

Su Mu gasped for breath and slowly nodded.

The two men, seeing the situation, knew their lives were in peril. The one supporting the other could no longer hold back. He jumped up and pointed at Su Mu’s nose, shouting, “Su Mu, you treacherous villain! You promised we’d cause a scene at the He Family Rice Shop, and then you’d come to save Boss He and win his favor. Now you want to attack us? You’re worse than pigs and dogs, trash raised in the filth!”

“You’re talking nonsense!” Su Mu was furious and humiliated to be exposed.

The big man sneered coldly but winced from his injuries, clutching his mouth and gasping for breath. Regaining his composure, he said, “Everyone, today my brother and I came to cause trouble at the He Family Rice Shop on this scoundrel’s orders. He fancies Boss He’s daughter, but since she doesn’t like him, he came up with this scheme.”
