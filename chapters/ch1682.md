## Chapter 1682 — What Are You Guilty Of

In barely an hour, Lingxiao Sect, nestled among the mountain peaks, came into view.

The mountain road paved with white jade was clearly visible.

At the summit of the road hung a huge plaque bearing the words 'Lingxiao Sect'.

“Truly a place nurtured by spirit and talent.” Ling Taixu stood inside the warship, peering down through the crystal glass, thoroughly pleased with the current appearance of Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters.

“This is only the tip of the iceberg.” Yang Kai chuckled as he stood to one side, explaining to Grandmaster: “What we see now is only part of Lingxiao Sect. The entire Lingxiao Sect comprises eighty‑one peaks: nine main peaks and seventy‑two subsidiary peaks, each with its own scenery. Because of our previous small numbers, we only chose to settle here. Many of the peaks I myself have not fully explored; once everyone settles, you can find whichever peak you prefer to live on.”

“Good, good!” Chu Lingxiao's face glowed with relief.

Before this, they had worried: Yang Kai had led nearly ten thousand strong from the human, yao, and demon races here at once, and there might be nowhere to put them all; after all, the three races numbered quite a lot, and to accommodate them fully would require a very large place.

But now, as far as the eye could see, everything was verdant: towering peaks rose and fell in mist, pavilions and terraces peeked through clouds—eighty‑one peaks, enough to safely house the experts of the human, yao, and demon races, with a great portion left empty.

“So we’ll live here from now on?” Lei Long, the Great Lord, looked down with a flushed face; this place was hundreds if not thousands of times better than the Beast Sea Great Forest on Tongxuan Continent.

Not only was the Spiritual Qi here supremely dense, the scenery was top‑tier. The yao could cultivate and live here; their future attainments would assuredly be far from low.

A headquarters means a foundation. As a Great Yao Lord, Lei Long knew better than anyone how important a foundation was to a race.

“Yang Kai, my demon clan owes you; if you ever need anything, give the word and my clan will obey without question.” Even the proud Changyuan spoke sincerely—words that effectively signaled a desire to join Lingxiao Sect.

Yang Kai nodded.

The yao and demon clans had been brought out by Yang Kai when he left Tongxuan Continent. Strictly speaking, Lei Long and Changyuan indeed owed Yang Kai a debt of kindness; but members of the Ancient Demon Clan like Li Rong and Han Fei would not see it that way—Yang Kai was their lord, and they had long sworn to follow him for life; they felt only honor in serving him.

Letting the experts of the three races bask in shock and joy, Yang Kai guided the warship down toward the vast plaza. Meanwhile his Divine Sense swept about to take the measure of Lingxiao Sect's current situation.

Yet after a moment his brow tightened.

He discovered that at present there were about a thousand people gathered inside Lingxiao Sect—yet among them there was not a single familiar presence.

Ye Xijun, Wu Yi, Chang Qi, Hao An, Huang Juan and the others seemed all absent; even the presences of those who had submitted from Star Emperor Mountain had vanished.

Despite the warship's conspicuous descent from the sky, no one from Lingxiao Sect came out to greet them.

Instead, countless unfamiliar Divine Senses extended from the nearby pavilions and kept sweeping over them.

This discovery darkened Yang Kai's expression.

Sensing something amiss, Ling Taixu leaned in and asked softly, “Yang Kai, is something wrong?”

Yang Kai gave a faint, cold snort. “Something is off, Grandmaster. Stay inside the warship for a moment; I'll go have a look.”

“All right!” Ling Taixu answered.

Yang Kai waved and had the warship's hatch opened, then led Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao out.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others had also noticed the problem; after exchanging confused glances, Yang Xiuzhu drew on his Saint Yuan and let out a long cry: “The Sect Master has returned to the sect!”

The long cry echoed through all eighty‑one peaks of Lingxiao Sect and lingered for a long time.

Still, no one came out to receive them.

Those Divine Senses that had been investigating the warship seemed to be entwined together, silently communicating.

The atmosphere within Lingxiao Sect suddenly became deeply strange.

After a while, those Divine Senses dispersed, apparently having reached some consensus; only then did figures shoot out from the pavilions on all sides.

Yang Kai stood on the plaza like an abyss and a towering peak, his aura cold and severe, waiting in silence.

Swish, swish, swish…

One figure after another fell nearby, gradually converging into an extremely fearsome force.

They were all experts of the Origin Returning Realm and above; Third Stage Origin Returning practitioners were plentiful. Yet when these people looked at Yang Kai, their gazes were furtive and evasive, as if they felt guilty, hardly daring meet his eyes. A few maintained cold, challenging expressions, staring at Yang Kai like he were an enemy.

Yang Kai scanned the crowd and fixed his gaze on an old crone leaning on a dragon‑headed cane, her head full of white hair.

Beside the crone stood a pretty, delicate girl of First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—one of Dark Star's rising talents.

Yang Kai stared at the crone because he recognized her.

She was Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain! In the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain she had once intervened at the last moment, attempting to seize the Imperial Jade that had been left at Dragon Lair Mountain.

Yang Kai had never held a good impression of that crone; though she had not colluded openly with the Demon Blood Sect's Great Elder Jin Shi, she harbored no good intentions.

The fair‑faced girl beside her, whose bright eyes nonetheless shone with shrewdness, was Feng Yan—Old Woman Feng's granddaughter.

At this moment Feng Yan was sizing Yang Kai up with curious eyes, her gaze eager as if she wanted to test her strength against his to see which of them was stronger.

Yang Kai had no interest in her; she was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—he could crush her with a single finger.

Turning his eyes, Yang Kai saw a mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces; most names he could not call, but by their garments they were from Dark Star's first‑tier sects or powerful forces.

He even saw Gong Aofu, current leader of Liuli Sect, and the young disciple Yin Sudie.

Liuli Sect's previous leader Gong Xinghe had fallen while exploring the Imperial Garden, and his daughter Gong Aofu had taken up the sect's leadership; over the years Gong Aofu had become a Third Stage Origin Returning expert.

Daiyuan was not present!

Yang Kai frowned; he did not know where the girl who disguised her beauty behind an ugly visage had gone. By rights she should be with Gong Aofu as Liuli Sect's disciple.

Of all Liuli Sect's members, Yang Kai had liked only Daiyuan, since he had cooperated with her a few times.

The plaza fell into silence; Yang Kai merely glanced around coldly, and those Origin Returning warriors opposite made no move to speak.

After a long while Yang Kai smiled: “How amusing. The Sect Master returns to his sect, yet none of the elders come greet him—so you've taken the trouble to welcome us yourselves.”

As for why these people had appeared in Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai could make a few guesses.

In Haicheng City he had heard from Du Yanling that during the calamities of the past two years Lingxiao Sect had done much: frequently dispatching experts to rescue human elites, and under Great Elder Ye Xijun's orders opening Lingxiao Sect to accept fleeing warriors.

These people should have come to Lingxiao Sect to seek refuge; after all this was the last pure land on Dark Star, guarded by the Three Flames Ring—no matter how powerful the Corpse Spirit Sect's forces, they could not break in.

No one could fault Ye Xijun's actions, not even Yang Kai.

If he had been in Lingxiao Sect at the time, he would have done the same. Yang Kai was not so hard‑hearted as to abandon those who fled here.

But the present situation roused his deep anger.

Although it was not yet clear what had happened inside Lingxiao Sect, why Ye Xijun and the others were all absent while these people had taken over, Yang Kai could sense that something rotten was afoot.

The Origin Returning experts opposite exchanged glances and finally focused their gazes on Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain. Old Woman Feng stepped forward with a benign smile on her wrinkled face: “Sect Master Yang, you’re too serious,” she said warmly. “The world is in chaos now, and your Lingxiao Sect has become the most unshakable refuge of our Human Race — our final bastion of hope. It’s only natural that we’ve come to pay our respects and seek your shelter.”

“Our Human Race?” Yang Kai looked at Old Woman Feng with a smile and caught the key point in her words. “Elder Feng, do you mean to say that Lingxiao Sect has become common property of the human race? How come I, the Sect Master, know nothing of this?”

Old Woman Feng's face stiffened; for a moment she did not know how to answer. She had not expected Yang Kai's words to be so sharp.

A burly man suddenly stepped forward and barked loudly, “Sect Master Yang, isn’t it? Your Lingxiao Sect, protected by natural barriers, is a fortress the Corpse Spirit Sect’s armies can’t even breach. A place like this should naturally serve as our Human Race’s final bastion! Now that the Corpse Spirits have thrown the world into chaos and nowhere outside is safe, shouldn’t Lingxiao Sect do its duty for our race and share this sanctuary with everyone? Or does Sect Master Yang think otherwise?”

“Who are you…” Yang Kai glanced sideways at him.

The big man snorted, “I am Tang Fushui, Hall Master of Piaomiao Hall!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly; he had heard of Tang Fushui—the top expert of Piaomiao Hall, a Third Stage Origin Returning master. Previously he had been on par with Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong; after all, Piaomiao Hall's strength on Dark Star was considerable.

Tang Fushui continued: “If Piaomiao Hall had such a treasure, we would of course open our gates and accept human elites, contributing what we can to the survival of our race. Yet when Sect Master Yang returns and assumes a posture of interrogation, are you perhaps trying to drive us all away?”

At these words many faces changed; anxiety and unease showed across them.

They had barely escaped into Lingxiao Sect—if Yang Kai truly drove them out, their good days would end; from then on they'd constantly face the Corpse Spirit Sect's sieges, and in such times no one could guarantee their safety.

“When did I ever say that?” Yang Kai gave a faint, cold laugh, his sharp gaze sweeping over the crowd. “What are you all afraid of?”

Everyone his eyes fell upon instinctively turned their heads away, unable to meet his gaze.
