## Chapter 1339 — Ancient Ruins

About half an hour later, once everyone's condition had recovered, Fei Zhi Tu beckoned, "Let's go."

With that he led them along the subterranean riverbed toward the direction Yang Kai had been staring at earlier.

The deeper they went, the stronger that ancient, desolate aura Yang Kai had sensed before became; even Cai He and the others noticed it, exchanging glances that revealed a hint of excitement in each other's eyes.

An aura like this could only be emitted by something age-old; the group had gone on many expeditions and were especially sensitive to such traces. It seemed this place truly held an ancient ruin!

Although they knew Fei Zhi Tu would not deceive them, as they neared their objective everyone couldn't help but grow expectant.

For them, rescuing Qian Tong was naturally the main objective this time, but if they could also venture deeper into the ancient ruins and pick up some benefits along the way, they would certainly be more than happy to do so.

Especially in a ruin hardly trod by anyone, the chances of finding good things would be high.

Yet a moment later, when a Space Array appeared before them, every one of them froze.

That desolate aura they'd felt earlier was being emitted by this very Space Array, and although its overall structure resembled the array gates currently seen on Dark Star, there were noticeable differences in the finer details.

Yang Kai, who had seen many Space Arrays and cultivated spatial power himself, immediately understood that this array must date from a much older era.

That explained why it differed from the Space Arrays now on Dark Star; after so many years those arrays had been repaired and altered here and there.

At this moment, in several hollows at the array's base lay a few spent Upper-Level Saint Crystals; apparently they had been used to activate the array.

Fei Zhi Tu picked up one of the discarded Saint Crystals and examined it for a moment before nodding, "No mistake — Old Qian must have been transmitted into that ancient ruin by this array; these Saint Crystals were only used for a short while."

"Then let's go in," Ning Xiangchen urged hastily.

Fei Zhi Tu slowly shook his head. "We will go in, of course, but we don't know what lies beyond that Space Array. The message Old Qian sent back was far too vague. It's already a blessing I could find this place, but whatever trapped him in there must not be trifling. You youngsters mustn't act rashly once inside. Stick close to us; if anything dangerous occurs we'll handle it. Understand?"

Cai He and the others dared not contradict him and hastily agreed.

Seeing the four at Saint King Realm all behave obediently, Fei Zhi Tu nodded in satisfaction, waved his hand, and began placing Upper-Level Saint Crystals into the hollows at the array's base; then with a surge of Saint Yuan he cloaked everyone and activated the Space Array.

The next moment the array flashed, and amid a dizzying, world-turning hum the eight of them vanished from sight.

When the eight reappeared, they were already somewhere else.

Just as they steadied their footing, Fei Zhi Tu and the other Origin Returning Realm masters had already released their Divine Senses, scanning their surroundings warily. At the same time, their Saint Yuan surged quietly within them, ready to strike at a moment’s notice.

Only after detecting no immediate danger did Fei Zhi Tu and the others relax and begin to examine their position and the environment.

Yang Kai took the opportunity to scan the area as well, and after a moment he couldn't help but show a peculiar expression; he realized that the place they had arrived at through the Space Array was an odd, peculiar space.

The Spiritual Qi here seemed richer than outside, far surpassing even Dragon Lair Mountain, and the sky above was clear blue with white clouds and a bright sun — a flawless, sunny day.

Where they stood was amid a vast complex of buildings; it resembled the site of some Sect.

Yet by Divine Sense there were no other living people here besides the eight of them.

"Is this the ancient ruin?" Ning Xiangchen and the others exchanged glances, showing a hint of doubt.

"No doubt about it — this is surely an ancient ruin," Fei Zhi Tu replied in a low voice, as if he'd discovered something; he pointed ahead. "These characters have since evolved on Dark Star; only tens of thousands, maybe over a hundred thousand years ago would they have been used."

Following his finger, they looked to a nearby pavilion, exquisitely built, with a plaque hanging on the second floor bearing a few lively, calligraphic characters that were full of spirit; yet no matter how the eight examined them they could not determine what the characters were, not even Fei Zhi Tu could recognize them.

Likewise, other pavilions and buildings all bore plaques carved with characters, and without exception none of them were recognizable to the group.

"Sure enough, it's an ancient ruin — and it's remarkably well preserved!" Ning Xiangchen exclaimed, his expression excited, his face flushing; the old woman and the Origin Returning cultivators were likewise stirred.

Ancient ruins had been found on Dark Star before, but none preserved so completely; intact preservation meant its treasures had yet to be plundered. Once they rescued Qian Tong, they'd have ample time to thoroughly explore.

The Origin Returning cultivators warmed to the thought at once.

"First find Old Qian — the ruin can be explored afterward!" Fei Zhi Tu, aware of priorities, gave the order and everyone agreed.

After all, his strength was supreme here, and given his good terms with Ning Xiangchen and the others they naturally wouldn't disobey.

Fei Zhi Tu then began searching for the marks Qian Tong had left; fortunately Qian Tong had been cautious and had left secret marks along the way after entering the ruin, otherwise Fei Zhi Tu would have had no lead at all.

After a short while Fei Zhi Tu fixed on a direction and led them that way.

The others trailed behind, passing row after row of side rooms and pavilions, sighing inwardly — had they not been here to rescue Qian Tong they would have already started ransacking these buildings.

With so many rooms and pavilions, there had to be good things among them.

But for now they could only force themselves not to think about such matters.

After about the time it took a incense stick to burn, to everyone's surprise nothing had occurred; the interior of the ancient ruin seemed free of danger, but the more peaceful it was the grimmer their expressions grew.

Suddenly a strange medicinal fragrance wafted to their nostrils; everyone was startled and in an instant felt as if a sudden enlightenment had washed over them, leaving them thoroughly invigorated.

"This is…" Ning Xiangchen's eyes widened as he pointed, "the fragrance is coming from up ahead!"

Fei Zhi Tu's expression brightened and he quickened his pace; anything that emitted such an extraordinary scent had to be valuable, and he wanted to see what it was.

A moment later they stopped before a flowerbed planted with many strange flowers and herbs, most of which were ornamental with little practical use — except for a small purple grass growing in the center, only a foot high, as straight and sharp as a sword, catching the eye.

The fragrance they had inhaled came from that purple little grass.

"Sword Soul Grass! And it's actually turned purple?" the old man Ning Xiangchen cried out, his gaze burning as he stared at the purple sprout; even Fei Zhi Tu could not conceal his excitement.

Sword Soul Grass is the principal ingredient for refining the Sword Soul Pill; it is most suited for cultivators who have trained in Sword Dao techniques, increasing their grasp of sword intent and greatly enhancing the power of their Sword Dao abilities.

The Sword Soul Grass itself is an Origin-Grade Middle-Level medicinal herb; across Dark Star it is a rare Spiritual Herb, and even when mature it is only light blue in color — only with great age will its hue deepen.

For this plant to have turned purple it must be at least ten thousand years old, making it unimaginably precious and rare.

If refined into a pill, and consumed by a cultivator versed in Sword Dao techniques, the benefits would be incalculable.

This was unquestionably a spiritual herb of immeasurable worth — of great use even to Fei Zhi Tu and the other Origin Returning cultivators.

Though not all of them specialized in the Sword Dao, each had dabbled in it and mastered some sword martial techniques; naturally they coveted Sword Soul Grass, and even if they didn't use it themselves they could exchange it for many valuables.

"Brother Fei…" Ning Xiangchen turned to Fei Zhi Tu. The thing was valuable, but not worth the loss of their friendship; besides, they had only just arrived in this ruin and already found such a thing — if they lingered here a while longer they would surely find more treasures.

Ning Xiangchen called for Fei Zhi Tu to speak his opinion on how to handle the Sword Soul Grass; they would avoid rashly exploring the pavilions and rooms and risk complications, but if a treasure presented itself they would not let it slip.

"If you all trust me, then leave the Sword Soul Grass in my care. We'll discuss it properly after we exit," Fei Zhi Tu declared loudly.

"I have no objection," the old woman said at once.

"City Lord Fei is an honest man — we'll do as you say!" another Origin Returning cultivator agreed, and Ning Xiangchen did not object either.

With the matter settled, Fei Zhi Tu produced a jade shovel and approached the Sword Soul Grass, apparently intending to dig it up by the root.

"Brother Yang, why such a solemn expression?" Cai He suddenly came up beside Yang Kai and asked; he had noticed Yang Kai's furrowed brow and heavy expression and couldn't help but show concern.

Yang Kai ignored his question, his brow still tightly knit, then a look of sudden realization crossed his face and he cried out in a low shout, "No — this isn't Sword Soul Grass; City Lord Fei, stop!"

Cai He was startled and glanced toward Fei Zhi Tu, but Yang Kai's warning came too late — Fei Zhi Tu's jade shovel had already struck the soil of the flowerbed.
