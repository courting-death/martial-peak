## Chapter 1115 — Well Done!

Perhaps because it had absorbed Golden Blood, the little stone man obeyed Yang Kai absolutely, executing every order with meticulous precision.

But Yang Kai couldn't communicate with it; he had hoped it might, like the Divine Tree, evolve its own consciousness, but judging from this, that seemed unlikely — it was a total simpleton, more like a living puppet.

A few more days passed, and Yang Kai discovered a very peculiar skill it possessed: it could dig tunnels!

Its speed at burrowing through the mountain was almost inconceivable; Yang Kai discovered this by accident. Under his orders the little fellow dared not approach the cave where Yang Yan stayed, yet for some reason it kept trying to burrow into the ground, and in the space of a single breath it would reach dozens of zhang beneath the surface. No matter how compact the earth, it couldn't stop its progress.

Yang Kai even tested it on solid ore and found that no matter how hard the rock, it could easily bore a large hole through it.

That ability was impressive, but Yang Kai couldn't understand why it had such power; its head was squarish and not sharp at all — he truly couldn't figure out how it did it.

He had at first thought there might be some rare ore underground attracting it, but Yang Kai's careful investigations disproved that hypothesis.

The entire Dragon Lair Mountain had neither Spiritual Herb nor Spiritual Medicine, nor any valuable ore. Before Yang Kai set up his formations, apart from decent scenery it was a desolate mountain. Even now the only difference was that the Spiritual Qi was a bit denser than nearby places; there was nothing particularly outstanding.

As long as he didn't hollow out Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai was too lazy to bother with the little fellow. It had hatched only because it had somehow acquired a Blood Essence Stone, whereas another little stone man wrapped in a Jet-Black Sphere wasn't so lucky; to get it out would probably require finding another Blood Essence Stone.

But such things were exceedingly rare; Yang Kai had been in the Star Domain for quite some time and had never heard of or seen anyone possessing a Blood Essence Stone — it seemed they were a rarity even in the Star Domain.

One day, while Yang Kai was cultivating, he suddenly felt an earth-shattering energy fluctuation coming from the cave; the wave of power flashed and vanished quickly and then retracted. The next moment, Yang Yan's triumphant laughter echoed in his ears.

Succeeded? Yang Kai's expression brightened and he hurried into the cave.

Inside the stone chamber, the furnace, taller than a person, still radiated terrifying heat; Yang Yan stood there soaking wet. It was clear she had poured enormous effort into forging this Secret Treasure, sweating profusely, her hair in disarray, looking like a madwoman. Her black robe had somehow been discarded; she wore only a thin gauze dress.

Sweat had soaked her clothes, clinging tightly to her body, and the first thing Yang Kai saw when he rushed in wasn't the Secret Treasure but an extremely enticing, ravishing figure.

Those rounded buttocks were so perky it was almost scandalous, as if a pair of great hands were lifting them up. Swaying with seductive charm, her waist's exaggerated curve was soul-stealing; her lower abdomen was smooth and flat beneath the wet fabric. Through the soaked garments Yang Kai could even clearly make out the shape and color of the undergarments Yang Yan wore.

Hm — pink panties. Small, only the size of a palm, just covering her sensitive parts and provoking imagination; she wore a similarly pale red dudou underneath the upper garment, the twin mounds on her chest so distinct.

Yang Kai froze for a moment, unsure whether he should avert his eyes.

Yang Yan, however, excitedly ran over, oblivious to her indecent exposure, and presented an oval shield-like Secret Treasure in her hands like an offering, cooing, "Look, look — an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure. I wasn't lying; I'm an Origin-Grade artificer!"

Yang Kai took it and found the shield-shaped Secret Treasure was much lighter than he had imagined, seeming almost weightless, yet the shield's face shimmered with a purple glow — Yang Kai recognized this as the natural sheen of the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion's shell. The shield's surface wasn't flat; there were sharp barbs running across it, their purpose unknown.

Yang Kai astutely noticed that the interior of the shield was infused with both Wind and Earth attributes.

Seeing him inspecting it closely, Yang Yan eagerly explained, "I even fused the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion's Inner Core into it. The main material of the shield is the demonic beast's shell; by fusing the Inner Core, it can inherit part of the beast's abilities. Of course, you'll have to experiment to develop them yourself — I don't know what exactly this scorpion's powers were in life."

"A sandstorm?" Yang Kai murmured, immediately recalling when he had followed Guiche and the others and discovered the area where the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion had been — a sandstorm spanning tens of miles. The scorpion had been hiding inside that sandstorm, making it difficult to detect.

"A sandstorm, huh?" Yang Yan nodded. "Not bad. This shield is the product of my blood and sweat; treasure it and use it well. It can defend, and the spikes on it can counterattack. Used properly, you can fight above your rank — no, no, no, fighting above your rank is definitely fine. With this Secret Treasure in hand I guarantee Saint King Realm warriors won't be able to hurt you! Unless you stand there like a target and let someone shoot at you!"

As she spoke she thumped her chest vigorously, swearing it to be true, completely ignoring that just a few days ago Yang Kai had killed several Saint King Realm warriors by his own skill.

Her little hand struck her supple bosom but was bounced off by the high-rising jade peaks.

Their elasticity seemed astonishing…

Yang Kai couldn't help but glance, looking at the pale cleavage.

"If you hadn't rushed me this time I could have refined it even better, but never mind — Origin-Grade Lower-Level is only its temporary rank. If you bring better ore later I can refine it further and raise its grade… Are you listening to me? What are you looking at?" Yang Yan, puzzled by Yang Kai's distracted expression, followed his gaze and immediately understood why he was like that.

Her face, already flushed from the heat, reddened even more in an instant, as if it might bleed. After three breaths a scream erupted from the cave; Yang Yan hugged her arms around herself and crouched on the ground, pressing her forearms across her chest to block the exposed sight and glared at Yang Kai with grievance, scolding in a soft voice, "Pervert, shameless, disgraceful! I worked so hard to make you this Secret Treasure and you… you…"

She was utterly aggrieved.

Yang Kai gave a sheepish, awkward laugh and said nothing.

After she scolded him a bit he said, "There's a pool outside fed by the mountain spring; go wash yourself."

"I know that!" Yang Yan bit her lip, hugged herself into a ball and urged, "Go on, get out!"

"All right, all right, I'll go!" Yang Kai hurriedly nodded. Before he could leave, a series of clattering, chittering noises came from underfoot; immediately a small hole opened in the ground and a gray head poked out, the square-shaped head staring at Yang Yan with bewildered eyes.

"Ah!" Yang Yan screamed even louder and slapped, sending the gray little head back into the hole; then, like a frightened rabbit, she sprang up high and leapt straight into Yang Kai's arms.

Warm fragrance and softness filled his arms, and the two mounds at her chest pressed against him, making Yang Kai's mind wander.

Most exasperating of all, Yang Yan's legs had wound themselves around his waist.

He had known she was timid, but he hadn't realized he had still overestimated her courage!

She seemed terrified, her delicate body trembling as she clung to Yang Kai and wouldn't let go, constantly looking back, her beautiful eyes full of fear.

After she saw there was nothing in the hole she still asked anxiously, "What was that? What was that? I felt like it was looking at me just now."

Yang Kai didn't know how to explain; the normally obedient little stone man had gone into the cave on its own today, and it had come up from underground, no wonder it had scared Yang Yan half to death.

"Has it left?" Yang Yan asked.

"It's gone."

"Really gone?" She released her Divine Sense to scan and indeed found nothing there, then drew a long, heavy breath.

When she came back to her senses, she was shocked to find herself clinging to Yang Kai’s neck, indecently hanging onto him. Their bodies were pressed tightly together, her lower abdomen against his, and a wave of searing heat surged toward her face.

Yang Yan felt as if smoke were about to come out of her head.

She had never been this close to any man before. For some reason, her blood began to surge rapidly, and from her chest came the sound of her heartbeat—thumping faster than a war drum. The heat coming from him made her feel as though she could hardly breathe.

She wished she could crawl down through the small hole in the ground and never come out again.

Especially that strange smile on Yang Kai's face made her feel utterly ashamed.

"Put me down!" Yang Yan nearly buried her face in her chest as she weakly called.

"I'm not holding you!" Yang Kai spread his hands wide.

Yang Yan was mortified; only then did she realize it was her own arms around Yang Kai's neck and her legs straddling his waist that had made them so intimate.

She hastily let go with hands and feet, fell backward onto the ground and couldn't help but yelp.

"Are you all right?" Yang Kai looked at her with an exasperated face, feeling awkward to help her up; she was not only timid but thin-skinned — even if he pulled her up she probably wouldn't get up.

"I'm fine." Yang Yan curled up and indeed refused to get up, covering her face and saying, "Could you please go out first? I want to wash off the dust."

"Oh." Yang Kai nodded, stifling a laugh, and turned to walk out.

Outside the cave the little stone man staggered and twisted as if drunk, and before it realized it its left leg tripped over its right and it fell flat on its face.

It struggled up painfully, looked up with an innocent face and stared at Yang Kai as if without guile.

"Well done!" Yang Kai suddenly realized the little fellow actually had delicate, handsome features, clever and quick-witted — where was the dullness of before?
