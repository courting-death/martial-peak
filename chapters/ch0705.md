## Chapter 705 — How Do You Want to Die

Right after Zhai Yao finished his pill formation, Yang Kai lightly tapped the furnace before him, and a mottled brown Pill shot out with a soft sound; he caught it in his hand.

"Impressive!" Zhai Yao truly admired him; from the fragrance drifting out of the other's furnace he could already conclude that the Pill was certainly a Spirit-Grade Pill, though its exact tier would require closer appraisal.

Most remarkable was that the other party's speed in refining the Pill was scarcely any slower than his own.

His own alchemical speed had long met his master's standards.

Since he first understood the world, he had stayed at his master's side, learning the Way of Alchemy in the hills and fields, listening to instruction and receiving hands-on guidance for nearly twenty years to reach his present skill — who, then, could this fellow's teacher be, to have produced such a disciple?

Zhai Yao was genuinely interested in Yang Kai now, his eyes burning with a competitive spark that would not yield.

"You win on time; you're a bit more skilled," Yang Kai said with a calm expression, showing no great emotion over this slight defeat. "Let's compare the quality and grade of the Pills next."

Zhai Yao smiled faintly, opened his hand, and presented the Pill he had just refined before Yang Kai with full confidence. "Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Pill!"

"Mine is also a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Pill!" Yang Kai opened his palm as well.

Fei Yu's face dimmed when she heard that.

Both Pills were of the same grade and quality, yet Zhai Yao had used slightly less time — the outcome of this contest seemed decided.

"Ha! I win!" Zhai Yao laughed heartily.

"Not necessarily." Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Zhai Yao's expression suddenly darkened; he stared at Yang Kai with hostility, as if on the verge of striking. "You planning to cheat?"

"See for yourself." Yang Kai nonchalantly tossed his Pill over; Zhai Yao caught it and scrutinized it suspiciously. In the next instant his eyes widened and his face went pale with shock. He blurted out, "Pill Patterns?"

Yang Kai's Pill bore countless fine lines across its rounded body, like the meridians of a human body through which flowed potent medicinal effect; if one listened carefully, one could almost hear the gurgling sound of the medicine coursing along those lines.

The medicinal efficacy of this Pill had evidently been refined by Yang Kai to an extreme degree.

"How is this possible?" Zhai Yao could scarcely believe his eyes, then drew in a steady breath and fell silent to appraise it properly.

Yang Kai did not rush; he waited quietly. Fei Yu's countenance brightened, the previous anxiety swept away into a beaming smile.

After a long moment, Zhai Yao finally inhaled deeply. His upright frame sagged as though deflating in that instant; he regarded Yang Kai with a complex expression. "You truly are formidable."

Whether the Pill Patterns on this Spirit-Grade Pill were born of Yang Kai's luck or not, his alchemical technique and skill were indisputable; without refining a Pill's efficacy to the utmost, no amount of luck could produce such Pill Patterns.

Once a Pill bears Pill Patterns, its value multiplies several times over.

Thus masterful alchemists, when refining Pills, all strive for the birth of Pill Patterns — doing so can significantly amplify the value of the materials they collect.

Yet even Zhai Yao's master could not produce Pill Patterns at will; only when in his most perfect state could he possibly achieve such a thing.

Pills with Pill Patterns have always been prized by martial artists; they can often save a cultivator's life in critical moments, providing powerful protection.

"I lost." Zhai Yao drew a deep breath, stilled his lingering resentment, and in an instant brightened again, accepting defeat with a sunny air and no bitterness.

Yang Kai chuckled softly and said nothing more.

Fei Yu said, "Since the young brother admits defeat, that Earthfire Core shall belong to my master’s nephew."

"Mm, a bet is a bet; the item is his." Zhai Yao nodded heavily.

Fei Yu handed the Earthfire Core to Yang Kai; he accepted it and slipped it into the Black Book Space.

“Friend, may I be so bold as to ask — who is your master?” Zhai Yao asked, a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

"I can't say." Yang Kai shook his head; it wasn't that he couldn't say, it was simply awkward and hard to explain.

"I understand." To everyone's surprise, Zhai Yao did not press further; instead he shrugged with a carefree nod and hinted, "These masters all prefer not to reveal their identities."

Yang Kai glanced at him thoughtfully and immediately realized Zhai Yao must indeed have a high-level teacher; it was quite possible the man behind him was a famed alchemical master on the continent.

"I have an impertinent request — could you grant it, friend?" Zhai Yao asked Yang Kai earnestly.

"What is it?"

"Would you be willing to give me that Pill?"

"You can have it." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

A Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Pill with Pill Patterns was indeed priceless, but it still paled beside the Earthfire Core in value. Besides, Zhai Yao was genuinely fond of Yang Kai's temperament; there was no point quibbling over gains and losses now.

"Thanks." Zhai Yao was overjoyed and quickly pocketed the Spirit-Grade Pill.

"Senior Aunt, could you pour us a cup of tea? I wish to speak with Brother Zhai a little." Yang Kai looked at Fei Yu. Encounters like this, rare though they might be, deserved cultivation of friendship.

Truth be told, Yang Kai had few companions with whom he could truly converse; he had only a small circle of female friends, and thinking of that made him a little embarrassed.

"You won't have the chance to drink any tea." Fei Yu made no movement; her lovely face turned icy.

A gleam flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he sensed trouble; outside the inn a group was rapidly approaching, and though the people had not yet arrived, the murderous intent was already palpable.

"The reinforcements actually came?" Zhai Yao shook his head helplessly.

"Kid, I don't know what you're counting on, but since you caused this, don't expect others to help. I won't offend the Deputy City Lord of Fuyun City." Fei Yu said with a teasing smile.

"Don't worry; I didn't intend to drag you into it." Zhai Yao said as he walked to the window and glanced outside. Seeing the situation, he gave a careless whistle. "There really are a lot of them."

Turning back, he smiled at Yang Kai. "Brother Yang, we'll chat another day. Oh, you must go to Wangtian Cliff — the distilled elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower will do you great good. I'm looking forward to collaborating with you."

Yang Kai's expression stirred; he was about to inquire further, but Zhai Yao had already leapt from the window and left.

Fei Yu lounged against the window, watching the tense scene below with a shake of her head. "That kid..." she murmured lazily.

"He seems to know secrets others don't." Yang Kai frowned; Zhai Yao's parting remark stuck in his mind.

Their visit to Fuyun City was chiefly for the elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower — that elixir greatly assisted a Transcendent Realm cultivator ascending into the Saint Realm — but from what Zhai Yao said, refining the elixir could also benefit Yang Kai.

How refining the elixir could help him, Yang Kai could not yet fathom.

Gazing out the window, he saw the street below and the surrounding houses jammed with people.

Most of those present had come from the trading district, knowing a spectacle was about to unfold and taking up advantageous positions to watch.

Some had gathered after hearing the rumors.

The remaining group was a band of martial artists brought by a middle-aged beauty whose aura was sharp; her pretty face had twisted into a feral snarl as she bared silver teeth and glared at the suddenly appearing Zhai Yao.

Beside that beauty, Nie Cong, who had earlier lost one hand, was rubbing his stump and staring at Zhai Yao with hatred and venom, as if he longed to kill him.

"Huh, this one's interesting — not only did he not run, he actually showed himself." A murmured exclamation went up from the crowd when Zhai Yao appeared.

"I told you this young brother has backing; he doesn't fear that bitch Nie Chufeng!"

"How much backing could he have? Even a mighty tiger doesn't trample a local lord; this is Fuyun City — I think this kid's done for."

"He couldn't have picked worse to offend than Nie Cong. Everyone in Fuyun City knows Nie Cong is that bitch's biological son; only outsiders think they're merely aunt and nephew. She won't let matters rest after a hand is cut off."

Whispered talk rippled through the crowd; the middle-aged beauty heard it and a killing intent flared in her eyes as she swept her gaze around coldly.

Everyone fell silent at once, afraid of inviting disaster.

"It was you who cut Cong's hand off?" Nie Chufeng glared at Zhai Yao and asked coldly.

"Yes." Zhai Yao nodded brazenly.

"Why would you do that?" Nie Chufeng ground her teeth and demanded.

"I warned him; he didn't listen. What could I do?" Zhai Yao shrugged and chuckled. "Who dares ruin my herbs, I will take their life!"

"You have some nerve!" Nie Chufeng sneered. "A mere medicinal herb comparable to my Cong's hand?"

Zhai Yao's expression turned cold. "What is your Cong compared to the herb I coveted?"

"Auntie, don't bicker — let me kill him!" Nie Cong snarled savagely.

Nie Chufeng fixed Zhai Yao with a hard stare and said coldly, "Where are the other two? Bring them out and I'll send you all on your way."

"Each man must answer for his own deeds; this doesn't concern them." Zhai Yao shook his head slowly.

Nie Chufeng inhaled deeply; her ample chest rose and fell, her eyes ice-cold. "You want to die how? Tell me and I'll grant it."

"I don't want to die yet!" Zhai Yao smiled faintly, showing no trace of nervousness.

"That may not be your choice." Nie Chufeng slowly raised a jade hand, and True Yuan coalesced in her palm, emitting in an instant a putrid stench that made people want to vomit.
