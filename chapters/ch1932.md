## Chapter 1932 — Blood Battle

Ai Ou and the others were figures who had shocked the cosmos, their wills and resolve far beyond ordinary men, yet before Yin Lesheng's abyssal, heaven-reaching power their strength—what they had long taken pride in—suddenly seemed like the faint glow of fireflies, utterly negligible.

After that strike, no one dared act rashly; every face had gone extremely grave as they watched Yin Lesheng with wary eyes, fearful he might strike again.

"Interesting!" Yin Lesheng smiled coldly. "But you trying to stand against this Lord with only the power you have now is far too soon. This Lord will give you one last warning: if you do not want to die, drop your Sea of Consciousness defenses!"

"Never!"

"Kill us then!"

"Heh heh, this Lord has no taste for being anyone's slave!"

Although Ai Ou and the others had a bad feeling, they still answered with firm resolve.

"Fine, since you insist on courting death, do not blame this Lord for being merciless!" Yin Lesheng's gaze grew cold; his figure flickered and vanished from where he stood. When he reappeared, he was suddenly right in front of Gu Cangyun.

He thrust out a hand and brazenly slapped it down toward Gu Cangyun.

Within that palm, boundless might swirled, so overwhelming that an expert of Gu Cangyun's caliber felt no will to resist; he could furiously urge his own power but could not break free, forced to watch that palm fall.

"My life ends here!" raced through Gu Cangyun's mind.

A moment later, a figure suddenly appeared before him, radiant with five-colored light that burst forth, dazzling the eyes.

"Alliance Master Gu, fall back!" Yang Kai's voice sounded in Gu Cangyun's ear, and as the words hit him he was thrilled to find that the force clutching him slackened by a fraction.

He did not dare delay; he poured his power into fleeing from the spot.

Yang Kai abruptly threw a punch; the Undying Five Elements Sword qi shrouded his fist, the five elements restraining and generating one another in endless cycles.

Boom...

The fist met the palm with a violent crash; Yang Kai emitted a muffled grunt as the five-colored radiance on his knuckles shattered like foam, and he was sent flying backwards like an empty sack.

Yin Lesheng, by contrast, staggered and took several steps back before barely regaining his balance.

The scene happened so suddenly that everyone was frozen in shock.

By the time they recovered, Yang Kai had been flung away, his life or death unknown.

"Yang Kai!" Ai Ou and Chi Yue's faces changed drastically as they hurried over at high speed to see what had happened.

Gu Cangyun and Wudao, who had barely escaped death, together stood before Yin Lesheng, watching him warily, afraid he would strike again and finish them off.

Liu Qianyun, who had been standing within the Huangquan Nether Veil, narrowed her beautiful eyes and stared in astonishment toward the direction Yang Kai had been knocked, her delicate face full of disbelief as she whispered, "He actually blocked Senior Brother Yin's strike?"

Not only that, but he had forced Senior Brother to retreat several steps!

Although his survival was uncertain now, for a Void King Realm warrior to accomplish such a thing was shocking enough—moreover, that fellow was only Second Stage of the Void King Realm!

Beside Liu Qianyun, Feng De's mouth hung open, his heart violently shaken.

He well understood how mighty Yin Lesheng was now; when Yin Lesheng had struck at him earlier, he had been deprived of any courage to resist and his life had been controlled. Yet this youth from an unknown Star Domain could do what he did—Feng De could hardly believe his eyes.

"He should be dead, right?" Feng De thought to himself, but even if dead it would be a source of pride—after all, he had faced Yin Lesheng head-on at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Before the thought finished, a violent coughing was heard from that direction.

"He's not dead?" Feng De cried out in alarm, looking as if he had seen a ghost, wanting to pluck his eyeballs and set them on Yang Kai to see clearly.

Liu Qianyun also uttered a soft cry, covering her mouth with her small hand.

On the other side, Yang Kai struggled to rise, waved weakly to Ai Ou and Chi Yue who had rushed over, his face as pale as paper; his chest churned and he could not help but spit out a mouthful of Golden Blood.

"Impressive!" Yang Kai drew several breaths, straightened his body, and squinted at Yin Lesheng.

Since being shoved back by Yang Kai's strike, Yin Lesheng had stood there with a strange expression; he did not pursue to finish them, but furrowed his brow as if questioning and pondering something.

Hearing Yang Kai's words, Yin Lesheng came back to himself and glanced faintly at him, nodding: "You are not bad. This Lord misjudged you—turns out you are the strongest among this group!"

Yang Kai sneered arrogantly, spitting blood to the side as he slanted a look at him: "Don't flatter yourself. I only converted a bit more power than they did. Aren't you the same? Surely your internal power has been fully converted as well?"

Yin Lesheng's eyelids narrowed and he tapped his palm: "Kid, your eye for things is sharp!"

Yang Kai grinned and said, "If not, then two warriors of equal power at the same stage—how could you face five at once? It's not that they were weak; it was simply that time wasn't enough."

At Yang Kai's words, Ai Ou and the others suddenly realized.

Previously they had already tasted the improvement in strength from converting the internal power, but because the duration had been short, the differences among them were not obvious.

Before they could adapt to the new power in their bodies, they had suddenly met someone like Yin Lesheng, causing Ai Ou and the others to doubt their own strength.

With Yang Kai's hint, they understood the reason for the scene before them was not their problem but Yin Lesheng's.

His internal power had been fully converted—how could they, even if at the same cultivation rank as him, possibly beat him?

It was like two warriors with equal might: one wielded a wooden sword, the other a divine weapon—the latter would naturally hold absolute advantage.

"I'm curious—how long have you been here?" Yang Kai asked, calmly probing for information.

"Not long, only five years!" Yin Lesheng admitted, seeing through Yang Kai's intent but not hiding it.

"Five years... then you must be a Star Lord as well," Yang Kai mused.

"Your mind is sharp!" Yin Lesheng's eyes brightened approvingly. "This Lord admires you. Submit to this Lord and endless benefits will be yours—this Lord might even spare your friends!"

Yang Kai laughed loudly: "If I submit, you would hand over every benefit I ask for?"

Yin Lesheng lifted his chin arrogantly: "Anything this Lord possesses."

"Then I want your life!" Yang Kai snarled.

Yin Lesheng slowly shook his head: "You seek death! Though clever, you do not even know what this new power is called—how could you contend with this Lord? Also, one more thing: this Lord only used a third of his strength just now!"

At those words, every face changed.

A third—yet everyone had been helpless; if he went all out...

"Hahahaha, die in despair—this Lord loves seeing that look on your faces!" Yin Lesheng laughed uproariously, taking a step forward until he stood before Gu Cangyun and Wudao.

"Nether Prison—Seven-Prisons Refined Flower!" he intoned, forming hand seals as pure Origin Qi burst forth, and with the motion of his hands a flower of extravagant, corrupt beauty blossomed and flew straight at Gu Cangyun and Wudao.

"Set the Rivers and Mountains!" Wudao's face changed, his long sword spun as radiant light flared across the blade; all his life force poured into the sword as he slashed forward.

"Sun Sword, illuminate all directions!" Gu Cangyun's body radiated bloodlight as he bit his tongue to draw blood, burning his Essence-Blood and spitting it onto his sword, which shot forward like a great rainbow piercing the sun.

The two combined their efforts to block Yin Lesheng's killing move.

"Before this Lord, you are all ants—what right have you to resist?" Yin Lesheng's eyes went cold as he pointed like a blade toward the two.

Two soft popping sounds rang out as Wudao's and Gu Cangyun's Saint Yuan defenses were instantly perforated; their bodies gushed blood and they cried out in pain.

Yin Lesheng swept his hand and, like flicking flies, sent the two flying; in midair they vomited blood, bones dislocated across their bodies.

"Kill them!" Yin Lesheng snorted and strode forward without haste.

Hearing his order, Feng De and Liu Qianyun, who had been hiding within the Huangquan Nether Veil, could only step out.

Feng De charged at Gu Cangyun with a face full of murderous intent, intent on finishing him.

He dared not disobey Yin Lesheng's command.

Liu Qianyun sought out Wudao and hissed, "Forgive me!"

As she spoke, her Delicate Jade Palm struck at Wudao; the move was harsh, yet it bore no real intent to kill.

If not forced, she would not slaughter innocents; after all, within the Great Wilderness Star Domain her reputation was rather good—sadly, under the other's roof now, she had to bow her head.

A black curtain suddenly appeared, wrapping the wounded Gu Cangyun and Wudao and instantly teleporting them to a distance. When the veil dispersed, the Ghost Ancestor's silhouette emerged, his body swathed in black qi with only two ghost-fire eyes flickering with evil light.

"Are you two all right?" the Ghost Ancestor asked softly.

"Not dead!" Wudao replied.

"This is troublesome!" the Ghost Ancestor said gloomily. "That fellow just said they were here for five years—meaning they spent five years converting the power within their bodies; they're far more formidable than we are."

"So what? Even if we die, they won't find it easy," Gu Cangyun snarled, his face fierce as he watched Feng De and Liu Qianyun approach.

Yang Kai, drawing breath, saw the danger to the Ghost Ancestor and the others and said quietly, "Leave this to me—go help them!"

Ai Ou and Chi Yue were startled by his words and instinctively shook their heads.
