## Chapter 1540 — You May Close Your Eyes

"Liang Yong, oh Liang Yong, don't you dare tell your Sect Master that you had no knowledge of this," Yang Kai said with a cold, mocking chuckle as he looked toward Liang Yong.

Liang Yong trembled, his expression terrified as he cried out, "Sect Master, Heaven is my witness — I truly knew nothing of this matter. Today is the first time I heard of Bibo City's situation being so wretched and terrible."

He dared not admit it — he had seen Yang Kai's methods before, and if he confessed, this place would become his grave.

He could not admit it under any circumstances, so Liang Yong denied it outright.

“Won’t shed tears until you see your own coffin, eh? Must I drag out the proof before you’ll give up?” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold as he barked, “Since you insist—this Sect Master will oblige you. Hand over your Spatial Ring!”

Liang Yong was drenched in cold sweat and unwilling to comply; he managed to stammer, "Sect Master, please think it over. I am utterly loyal to you and would never go against your will to do anything that would stain the Sect's reputation. The Spatial Ring is my secret; even if the Sect Master demands it, I would rather die than agree. Please, Sect Master, have mercy."

"Spare me the nonsense." Yang Kai snorted, reaching out to grab the ring from Liang Yong's hand.

Liang Yong's face flickered with a trace of struggle; his eyes hardened, and as Yang Kai's hand reached toward him, he began to mobilize his Saint Yuan to resist.

But no one expected that the moment he moved, the surrounding space suddenly stiffened unbearably, and violent pressure pressed in from all directions, making each step he took agonizingly difficult.

Hissing sounds erupted. Tiny spatial rifts, visible to the naked eye, swam around him like schools of fish.

Liang Yong felt as if his liver and gall were torn apart; he no longer dared move for fear that even the slightest motion would see him swallowed by those spatial tears.

In the blink of an eye, his Spatial Ring had already fallen into Yang Kai's hand, and Liang Yong's face went deathly pale.

Holding the ring, Yang Kai gave a faint cold laugh as his Divine Sense swept through it; his expression slowly turned grim.

Then he waved his hand. A rustling cascade of sounds followed.

In front of the city lord's mansion, a pile of Upper-Level Saint Crystals as tall as a small mountain instantly appeared.

The onlookers staring at that massive amount of Saint Crystals couldn't help but gulp, cries of astonishment and shouts bursting forth.

Had they ever seen such a fortune before?

Though no one counted them, such a quantity of Saint Crystals was nearly in the hundreds of millions. If one obtained it, they'd have no worry about cultivation for several lifetimes.

Besides the Saint Crystals, there were various boxes whose contents were unknown. The boxes themselves were crafted from costly materials, so it was easy to imagine that whatever was inside was likewise valuable.

"Where did you get all these treasures? Give me a reasonable explanation and I won't kill you!" Yang Kai said with a stern face as he turned to Liang Yong.

Liang Yong's complexion drained; he couldn't explain it clearly.

The evidence lay before them. If he hadn't extorted the wealth of the nine cities under Battle Sky City's jurisdiction, how could he alone possess such an enormous fortune?

No one could have the ability to do this!

"Sect Master, spare me! I know my mistake — please give me a chance to redeem myself by deeds; I will not betray your trust!" Liang Yong cried out.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "Some things may be tolerated once or twice, but not a third time. Liang Yong, I spared you at Fallen Emperor Mountains and in Battle Sky City, for you still had some use. But now... you may close your eyes!"

As soon as his words fell, Yang Kai reached out to envelop Liang Yong.

Liang Yong seemed to try to dodge, but for some reason couldn't, and Yang Kai seized his head with one hand; his Saint Yuan burst forth. Liang Yong screamed as violent explosive sounds echoed from within his body.

With those sounds came the abrupt extinction of his life force.

When Yang Kai withdrew his hand, Liang Yong was lifeless, collapsed on the ground, dark red blood pouring from his seven orifices.

Everyone fell silent like struck insects, gazes complex as they looked at Yang Kai.

Many of them knew Liang Yong's strength; he was a top-tier expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Even if he wasn't as strong as the deceased Alliance Master of the Battle Sky Alliance, he was no weakling.

Yet such a powerful man had been crushed to death by Yang Kai's single hand.

It was no more difficult than crushing an ant.

Though most had heard rumors of Yang Kai's extraordinary power, those were only tales — seeing him in person proved the rumors true, and his strength was even more terrifying than the stories.

Shan Ying had already gone numb, collapsing weakly to the ground, his eyes vacant.

He had pinned all his hopes on Liang Yong, thinking the city lord would stand up for him and teach Yang Kai a lesson.

But the turn of events filled him with fear.

First, Liang Yong addressed the youth as Sect Master, which hinted Shan Ying at the latter's true identity; then the very man he relied on was crushed to death.

He had always treated Lingxiao Sect as his backing and had been riding on its coattails; he never imagined he had inadvertently offended the sect's helmsman.

There was no way out for him now.

He saw Yang Kai's gaze sweep over him indifferently without pausing — a look that completely ignored his existence, as if he posed no threat whatsoever.

"Heh heh. I don't know how many of you are involved in this, but don't be too nervous. Liang Yong is dead and I have no desire to slaughter further. This matter ends here. If you want to live, you know what to do," Yang Kai said, looking at the warriors who had followed Liang Yong.

Most of those men had originally been Battle Sky Alliance fighters, while some were recruits of Liang Yong; each was Origin Returning Realm.

"We thank the Sect Master for sparing our lives!" they shouted in unison, then turned and fell upon Shan Ying with murderous intent.

"No!" Shan Ying cried out in terror.

Too late — they surged forward and engulfed Shan Ying, unleashing secret arts and treasure attacks until his bones were gone and he died miserably on the spot.

"Xiao Qi, handle things over here and report back to me as quickly as possible," Yang Kai instructed Ge Qi.

"Yes."

"Where is the Deputy City Lord of Bibo City?" Yang Kai asked, looking ahead.

"It is I." A leering old man hurried forward, his calf trembling as he kowtowed and fawned at Yang Kai.

"Good. Take me to inspect Bibo City's storerooms."

"This way, Sect Master!" The old man dared not be discourteous and hurried to lead the way.

A moment later, Yang Kai stood inside Bibo City's storerooms, looking at the dazzling array of goods and piles of Saint Crystals, clicking his tongue repeatedly.

This was probably what people meant by "squeezing the people's fat and marrow."

"Clear out the storerooms and hand everything over to Ge Qi. He knows how to handle it," Yang Kai ordered, then turned and left.

The old man replied respectfully from behind.

Three days later, in the city lord's mansion, Yang Kai sat in a chair listening to Ge Qi's report.

"Sect Master, Liang Yong and Shan Ying's Spatial Rings and the goods from Bibo City's storerooms have all been dispersed. I had Bibo City's warriors report the Saint Crystals they once paid; after verification, those goods were returned to them. I informed the people that these events were not ordered by Lingxiao Sect but by Shan Ying's unilateral actions. Those who heard rejoiced and praised the Sect Master's great benevolence."

"Cut the flattery." Yang Kai gave him a glance; the more he looked at Ge Qi the more sleazy the man seemed, and he wondered how Ye Xijun had ever taken him in.

Ge Qi gave an awkward smile.

"Liang Yong is dead and Battle Sky City has no head now. You'll need to stay there and maintain order for a while. If you can cultivate capable hands to take over the city lord position, you can return to the Sect and leave these trivial matters behind."

"Yes, that's what I planned," Ge Qi nodded.

"What about the other cities under Battle Sky City's jurisdiction? Is it the same situation everywhere?" Yang Kai asked again.

"Not exactly — the severity varies. Some are worse, some are untouched. Bibo City was the worst."

"Good. Handle things as you see fit."

"Sect Master, rest assured. I would never do anything cruel. Oh, Sect Master, I've already sent word of your return back to the Sect. Great Elder is eager to know how you are."

"Me? I'm fine. Tell her I'll return soon so she need not worry."

"Yes." Ge Qi nodded. "There is one more thing to tell the Sect Master."

"Speak."

"Outside the city lord's mansion, a few people wish to see you, saying they know you," Ge Qi said, looking at Yang Kai with a peculiar expression.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and immediately knew who wished to see him. He nodded, "Bring them in."

Ge Qi left to carry out the order. Shortly after, an old man led several timid young people in.

Yang Kai rose and greeted them with a smile.

"This old man greets Sect Master Yang!" the old man hurriedly saluted.

"Sir, no need for formalities," Yang Kai chuckled, his gaze sweeping to the green-clad girl behind him. She stared at him with wide eyes, unblinking, full of curiosity.

"What are you all standing there for? Bow properly, you rude lot," the old man scolded.

Yang Kai waved his hand, "No need, no need — this is fine."

The old man smiled wryly, "Sect Master Yang, forgive me. These young people have little experience of the world; if any offense was taken, please forgive us. I have come to thank you for upholding justice for all of Bibo City's residents and for avenging my family's Fourth Brother. Please accept my bow, Sect Master."

"Sir, don't be so formal. In truth, Lingxiao Sect bears some responsibility for what happened here. If our negligence hadn't occurred, you wouldn't have ended up like this — the fault is mine. Still, it's fortunate we discovered this in time; I hope we can make amends going forward."

"We live in Bibo City under Lingxiao Sect's rule — it is our honor," the old man said solemnly.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and grinned at the green-clad girl, "Why are you staring at me so much? You don't recognize me?"

The green-clad girl blushed and mumbled, "Are you really the Lingxiao Sect Master? You're not lying, are you?"
