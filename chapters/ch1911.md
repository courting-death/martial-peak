## Chapter 1911 — Laugh at Your Ignorance

Although he harbored complaints in his heart, Ai Ou showed no hint of it on his face; with his strength and position laid out for all to see, Ai Ou had long since learned to remain calm even with mountains crumbling before him.

"Hehe, Chairman, my teacher's Spiritual Pill has already been refined; I wonder about this friend..." Zhan Yuan stepped forward, pointing at Yang Kai as he spoke.

In the past he would never have dared to call Yang Kai a "friend" — though an Origin-Grade alchemist by title, Yang Kai was in truth a genuine Second Stage Void King expert.

He simply did not have that qualification.

But now the larger situation had been decided, and Zhan Yuan naturally had no need to be courteous to a man who would be his obedient servant for the next two thousand years.

Calling him a "friend" was entirely natural.

“Seems he still hasn’t refined anything,” Ai Ou said evenly, stating it as it was.

Zhan Yuan smiled slightly. "Chairman, you are mistaken. I think it's not that it's unfinished, but that it cannot possibly succeed. Two days have already passed; no matter what, there should be some smell of pill incense drifting from the furnace by now."

Hearing that, the hundreds of alchemists who had come over were all slightly startled and thought he had a point.

No matter whether Yang Kai's progress was fast or slow, two days had gone by. Master Zuo De's Taichu Soul-Returning Pill was complete; even if Yang Kai were slower, there should at least be some aroma wafting out.

Now there was no scent at all; clearly something was amiss.

"He makes a fair point!" Zong Ao, who had been standing by and had gained some insight, nodded slightly.

Ai Ou glanced at Zong Ao and thought, "Which side are you on?"

"I'm only speaking plainly," Zong Ao added.

Ai Ou could only laugh and cry inwardly; he knew these alchemists were single-minded. Their attitude toward alchemy was rigorous to the extreme; they would not profane the Dao of pills out of personal ties.

"Indeed..." Ai Ou did not know what else to say; after all, he knew nothing about alchemy and did not dare speak recklessly.

"There is no pill aroma, but there is also no burnt scent, which shows the ingredients in Yang Kai's furnace are still fine," Xue Yue suddenly stepped forward. "That doesn't prove his refining failed, does it?"

Zhan Yuan was taken aback, his mouth opening; he was at a loss for words.

Indeed, although there was no expected pill aroma from Yang Kai's furnace, there was also no smell of failure and burning. Everyone was puzzled — what exactly was going on here?

"Moreover, the Master earlier said he imposed no time limit on Yang Kai; it's only been two days. You might wait a bit longer," Xue Yue said.

"The Master did indeed say no time limit," Zhan Yuan frowned. In a low voice he added, "But if this man continues refining like this, won't we be waiting forever? The contest could never reach a result..."

As he spoke, he suddenly seemed to recall something and slapped his hand. "That's it. I know what he's up to. He must have tossed all the ingredients into the furnace and then left them be, letting time pass. When we grow impatient no one will pursue it any further."

Although Zhan Yuan's words were conjecture, when the others thought it through, they found some merit in it.

Master Zuo De had relied on his status and had not imposed a time limit; if Yang Kai exploited that, he could indeed defuse the present crisis.

After all, no one would wait here for him for a year, two years, five years, or ten years...

He was an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm who often entered seclusion for ten or more years; if he used this chance to comprehend some profound secret technique...

He would not waste the opportunity, but others would not be so patient.

Zhan Yuan's words made the alchemists suddenly feel they understood Yang Kai's intention, and their looks toward him turned to displeasure and hatred.

Daring to challenge Master Zuo De at alchemy was itself a profanation; now to use such a trick to delay was outrageous!

Immediately an Upper-Level Origin-Grade alchemist stepped forward, face grave, and cupped his fist toward Ai Ou. "Chairman, please give us an explanation. If this man truly behaves as Master Zhan described, we ask you to give Master Zuo De justice."

"Indeed, the Dao of alchemy is sacred and must not be profaned. This man's conduct insults our pursuit of the Dao and all the alchemists in the Star Domain; we cannot tolerate or indulge it!"

"Please, Chairman, do what's right."

"If we receive no satisfactory answer, we will immediately leave the Hengluo Commerce Guild and seek other positions!"

"Count me in — this man is detestable."

Hundreds of alchemists surged forward; more than half rose as one, demanding an explanation from Ai Ou. Even facing the Hengluo Commerce Guild's chairman, they did not flinch, their eyes fixed on Ai Ou.

Ai Ou's head throbbed.

He had never expected the matter to escalate this far; a mere contest had stirred the anger of two or three hundred alchemists!

He knew that if this were not handled well, the Hengluo Commerce Guild's strength would be severely damaged.

The alchemists stepping forward were not the Guild's own cultivated talents but those he had hired at great expense. They were free to leave the Commerce Guild and join other powers, and those powers would gladly accept them.

Anxious and annoyed, Ai Ou was inwardly angry at how foolish these people were to make a racket.

Meanwhile, Zhan Yuan couldn't help but grin; he had not expected his offhand remark to produce such an effect.

But the scene pleased both him and Zuo De. He glanced at Zuo De and saw the other watching him with an approving look, as if praising his boundless future.

Zhan Yuan straightened his waist at once!

Like a spear.

"Chairman, the matter is clear today; please give us an answer!"

Seeing Ai Ou remain motionless, the alchemists urged him on.

Ai Ou frowned, pondered a moment, and said in a deep voice, "Do you all truly conclude Yang Kai is playing tricks to stall? Isn't that too hasty a judgment? I think we should observe a while longer."

"What else is there to observe?" someone said resentfully.

Zuo De suddenly spoke up. "Everyone, calm down. Chairman Ai Ou has a point, and I did indeed say I would not impose a time limit on him. Let us wait — that was my oversight."

Those words only made the alchemists despise Yang Kai all the more — how could a master of his stature be driven to compete in alchemy with a mere rogue? That scoundrel deserved to die!

"Master, you are too soft-hearted!" one alchemist shook his head and sighed. "If you say that, some will mistake your tolerance for weakness. This must not be tolerated."

"Indeed!" the first speaker snorted. He was an elderly man, his face creased with wrinkles, nearing the end of his days, yet he glared fiercely at Ai Ou. "Look closely: which alchemist doesn't exhaust themselves and give their all when refining? Even someone like Master Zuo De would be pale and spent after two days. But look at this man — serene, eyes closed in meditation, with no ripple of Saint Yuan, no drawing in of earth-fire power. He may have Divine Sense Fire, but I feel no sign of him using it! If he's not stalling, what is he doing? If you, Chairman, favor him, we'll be disappointed in you."

Ai Ou's face sank; his head felt as if it would split.

He raised his eyes and glanced into the void, wanting to ask Long Tianshang hiding in the void what to do about the situation.

But Long Tianshang showed no intention of intervening.

Just as Ai Ou looked helpless and uncertain how to calm the crowd, a sneer suddenly rang out.

At that sound everyone was startled and turned toward it.

They saw Yang Kai, who had been sitting with eyes closed, open them at some point and cock his head, listening with interest to the crowd's talk.

He looked like an outsider.

"This friend is no longer putting on airs?" Zhan Yuan sneered. He was sure Yang Kai's furnace contained little more than categorized herbs, perhaps not even brewed into liquid, and he spoke with full confidence.

"Do I need to put on airs?" Yang Kai glanced at him.

"Hmph, you know the truth yourself," Zhan Yuan scoffed.

"Young man, what did you just laugh at?" Zuo De's lids narrowed; in a tone that leaned on his seniority he asked.

"I was laughing at your ignorance!"

"What did you say?" Everyone was furious and glared at Yang Kai; as alchemists they had never been so despised.

"Aren't you ignorant?" A mocking smile crept to Yang Kai's lips. "Who told you an alchemist must be exhausted and give everything when refining? Who told you an alchemist cannot close his eyes and meditate while refining? Who told you there must be pill aroma wafting during refining?"

"What are you getting at?"

"Nothing in particular." Yang Kai curled his lip and looked at Zuo De. "Master, if you were asked to refine a Minor Recovery Pill right now, would you make yourself drenched in sweat and gasping for breath?"

"Hmph, of course not!" Zuo De snorted.

"Exactly. You wouldn't, because the Minor Recovery Pill is too low a grade for you; you can refine it at will without giving your all. Your Saint Yuan fully meets the demand of the refining, so you do not become exhausted."

"You mean... the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is to you what the Minor Recovery Pill is to me?" Zuo De's eyelid twitched.

"Exactly!" Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Arrogant!"

"Shut up!" Yang Kai snapped at the man who spoke, his voice stern. "I am an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. I am not exhausted while refining because I don't need to give my all; I close my eyes to meditate because I have no need to fuss over every detail. You can't sense me using Divine Sense Fire because your strength is insufficient! You know nothing and yet you yap on — don't you find that ridiculous?"

The group of alchemists were left speechless by Yang Kai's words.

Damn it, this guy sounds so reasonable!

They were all alchemists and had never considered things from a martial practitioner's perspective; now carried along by Yang Kai's logic, they suddenly found themselves at a loss for words.
