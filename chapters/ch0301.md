## Chapter 301 — You Are Quite Bold

In the dense forest, Qiu Yimeng and her companions were frantically fleeing. Behind her, Luo Xiaoman and Bai Yunfeng appeared disheveled, with numerous wounds on their bodies. Moreover, among the original group of over a dozen True Essence Realm martial artists, two or three had already fallen.

As they ran, Luo Xiaoman's perky bosom bounced up and down, resembling two snow-white jade rabbits nestled within her embrace.

Under normal circumstances, Bai Yunfeng, a notorious lecher, would have undoubtedly stared at such a beautiful sight without blinking. However, at this moment, he was far too preoccupied with preserving his own life to care about beauty.

It seemed that there were pursuers behind them, and the group was in a panic, losing their way in unfamiliar territory. They could only follow closely behind Qiu Yimeng.

As they sprinted, the True Essence was depleting too quickly. Ahead, a small valley appeared. Qiu Yimeng took a light breath and said, “Let’s stop and rest up ahead. The pursuers shouldn’t catch up so quickly. We’ll recover for a bit before continuing.”

Upon hearing her words, everyone involuntarily let out a sigh of relief. After fleeing for a day and a night, no one could endure such exhaustion.

Before long, they reached the secluded valley, each finding a spot to sit down and take out Pills to recover.

Nearby, a clear spring flowed down from the mountaintop. Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman hurried over to scoop some water to moisten their dry throats and washed their faces, feeling much more relaxed afterward.

Ever since encountering that enchanting woman in the red dress, their group had begun to experience a streak of bad luck.

Three Divine Roaming Realm martial artists who had followed them were killed by that woman in a single strike. Subsequently, over a dozen True Essence Realm martial artists, led by Qiu Yimeng, were scouting the surrounding terrain when they were surrounded by a group of martial artists who practiced evil techniques. After a fierce battle, they managed to break through, but the commotion attracted even more enemies.

Their group was not weak, yet the sheer number of enemies was overwhelming. In desperation, Qiu Yimeng could only lead them into this dense forest, hoping to find an opportunity to break free using the terrain.

The two women sat down, both looking exhausted.

“Qiu sister, where exactly is this place?” Luo Xiaoman's large eyes were filled with fear.

Hearing Luo Xiaoman's inquiry, Qiu Yimeng's expression froze for a moment. After hesitating, she slowly said, “If I’m not mistaken, this should be Cangyun Evil Land!”

“Ah, Cangyun Evil Land?” Luo Xiaoman exclaimed, her beautiful eyes trembling.

The others were equally astonished and looked at her in disbelief. Bai Yunfeng frowned and asked skeptically, “Miss Qiu, how can you be sure this is Cangyun Evil Land?”

Qiu Yimeng glanced at him lightly and casually replied, “Where else would there be so many martial artists who have fallen into the evil path? Did you not see their demeanor during battle?”

“Well, that doesn’t necessarily mean this place is Cangyun Evil Land…” Bai Yunfeng still found it hard to believe. “Perhaps this is the territory of some evil sect.”

Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, her tone firm. “I can assure you, this is indeed Cangyun Evil Land!”

“What should we do?” Luo Xiaoman, lacking confidence and not as self-assured as Qiu Yimeng, turned pale at her words.

“I don’t know either!” Qiu Yimeng shook her head in distress. This time, she had only led the group to Lingxiao Pavilion, but unexpectedly found herself thousands of miles away in Cangyun Evil Land.

The distance of deviation was too great.

Cangyun Evil Land was filled with countless experts and evil beings. Their group had no powerful guardians around them, making it impossible to break through the blockade and leave safely.

Moreover, right now, Cangyun Evil Land was in fierce conflict with the outside forces. If they fell into the hands of the enemies, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Especially for Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, both of whom were exceptionally beautiful. If those wicked martial artists captured them, their fate would be one of humiliation and torment.

“Let’s take this time to rest. Fortunately, among the pursuers this time, there aren’t many experts. Otherwise, we would have run out of places to escape to!” Qiu Yimeng sighed deeply.

“Okay!” Luo Xiaoman nodded and obediently closed her eyes.

The group had barely recovered for half an hour when Qiu Yimeng suddenly opened her eyes and exclaimed, “Hurry and go, someone is coming!”

Hearing her shout, everyone quickly woke from their meditative state and followed her in haste.

Over the past month, Qiu Yimeng had often sensed the movements of enemies in advance, leading the group to avoid many dangers. Although no one knew how a True Essence Realm Ninth Stage martial artist could accomplish this, everyone had long been convinced by her abilities and naturally obeyed her commands.

…

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo were walking through the forest.

After nearly a month of interaction, Yang Kai found that this enchanting woman actually had a decent heart. She appeared delicate and charming, likely around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, but her beauty was maintained so well that she looked no different from a teenage girl, with an added unique charm from the passage of time.

This charm was particularly attractive to men, and combined with her allure, it could be said that Shan Qingluo was a bane to men, captivating both young and old alike.

During this time, Yang Kai also behaved quite steadily, no longer calling her “sister” as he had before, which made Shan Qingluo regard him with newfound respect.

It was rare to see a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy with such a composed demeanor.

Although they had spent quite some time together, their conversations were few. Shan Qingluo was not talkative, and Yang Kai did not want to annoy her by forcing conversation. Most of the time, he simply followed her, practicing his cultivation during breaks, never letting his guard down.

Traveling with beauty was a joy, and he felt far from lonely.

According to Shan Qingluo, she had come out this time to search for something that was greatly related to her. Years ago, her mother had come to search for it, and even earlier, her grandmother had sought it. Now it was her turn.

However, plans could not keep up with changes. Before coming here, her strength had been exceptional, so there were no issues. But after being backfired by her cultivation technique, her strength had plummeted significantly. Now, she had only recovered to the True Essence Realm Third Stage and could no longer venture into that dangerous place.

Without superior strength as a foundation, going there would only mean death.

Yet the two had wandered in this dense forest for over ten days and still remained within it.

As they walked, Yang Kai furrowed his brows and suspiciously glanced at her, halting his steps. “Beauty, may I ask you a question?”

“What is it?” Shan Qingluo also stopped, looking at Yang Kai indifferently.

“Are you… lost?” Yang Kai voiced his suspicion.

A hint of unnaturalness appeared on Shan Qingluo's face, and her gaze flickered.

“Uh…” Yang Kai was taken aback. “You’re not really lost, are you?”

Shan Qingluo’s face turned slightly red, and she snorted coldly, “What if I am lost? Is that strange?”

Yang Kai smiled wryly. “If you’re lost, you should have said so earlier. I thought you had a clear goal, and I’ve been wandering around aimlessly with you for so many days.”

If she hadn’t been so calm and indifferent during their journey, Yang Kai might not have remembered that the scenery here seemed somewhat familiar.

But how could she, as a master, be lost? Yang Kai found it hard to believe.

“You don’t know anything,” Shan Qingluo huffed, her delicate nose wrinkling. “This is a maze forest, with a natural formation at work, covering an area of hundreds of miles. If my strength were still intact, I would naturally find a way out. But now, I can only rely on luck!”

As she spoke, she glared at Yang Kai with resentment, gritting her teeth, “In the end, this is still your fault.”

“It has nothing to do with me!” Yang Kai retorted angrily.

“Who drained my energy during my breakthrough? Who caused me to suffer the backlash of my cultivation technique and have my strength plummet?” Shan Qingluo bombarded him with questions.

When she had brought Yang Kai into this maze forest, she had not expected to suffer the backlash of her cultivation technique, leaving her unable to escape now.

“Alright, alright, it’s my fault,” Yang Kai admitted, knowing he was in the wrong. He didn’t want to argue with her. He slightly released his Divine Sense but found its effective range greatly reduced, covering less than a mile around him.

Shan Qingluo looked at him with a light smile, exhaling like orchids, “I know you’re a bit strange, having cultivated Divine Sense at the True Essence Realm Fourth Stage, but without the level of Divine Roaming Realm, you can’t possibly find a way out. Save your energy.”

“Beauty, we’re in trouble!” Yang Kai stared at her blankly, his expression changing slightly.

“What?”

Before she could finish her sentence, a series of rustling sounds came from not far away, and then six or seven figures suddenly descended from the sky, landing not far in front of the two.

Shan Qingluo’s expression darkened, and she narrowed her beautiful eyes to observe the newcomers.

Once she recognized the appearance of the people, her demeanor suddenly changed, becoming imposing and aloof.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, inwardly marveling at her poise as one of the six great evil kings. This kind of powerful presence, cultivated over years, was not something ordinary people could imitate, and he also secretly prepared himself for the approaching figures.

“Eh…” As soon as the six or seven people landed, they spotted Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo. This group had come here chasing after Qiu Yimeng and her companions. Upon seeing Shan Qingluo in her red attire, their expressions changed drastically, and they all took a step back.

Shan Qingluo merely smiled at them, her high-and-mighty aura becoming even more pronounced.

Under her gaze, the expressions of those people grew increasingly grim, each one appearing as if they were facing a great enemy, utterly at a loss.

“I wondered who it was; turns out to be a few blind fools under the Beast King!” Shan Qingluo snorted lightly, speaking slowly, her demeanor exuding a chilling arrogance.

Those people trembled, their faces turning pale. One of the Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage experts hurriedly stepped forward, respectfully bowing, and stammered, “Subordinate Guo Yuanming greets Your Majesty. I didn’t know you were here. If there has been any offense, please forgive me!”

As he spoke, he lowered his eyes, staring at his toes, not daring to meet Shan Qingluo's gaze.

“Greetings, Your Majesty!” The others hurriedly bowed as well, their expressions filled with respect mixed with fear.

Every one of them raised their arms slightly, trembling, clearly terrified to the extreme.

“Hmph!” Shan Qingluo snorted lightly, causing them to grow even more anxious. “You all have quite the nerve… Did you come here to chase me?”

As she spoke, her expression turned unfriendly, and a murderous intent flickered in her enchanting phoenix eyes.
