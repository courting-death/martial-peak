## Chapter 1285 — You Won't Regret It?

It must be said that the Charm Technique cultivated by Yin Sudie is ingenious in execution and by no means weak; with such a strange art she needn't confront opponents head-on and can easily defeat warriors of the same rank.

Unfortunately, using that Charm Technique against Yang Kai proved somewhat insufficient.

For one, Yang Kai's Divine Sense is far more powerful than that of same-rank warriors and will not be beguiled; for two, Yang Kai himself cultivates the Dual Cultivation Technique, giving him a natural resistance to Charm Techniques.

Amid a chorus of pained cries and shrieks, the girls inside the pink mist barrier were sent sprawling by Yang Kai's slaughter.

Yang Kai did not attack them for their own sakes—those phantoms were all illusions conjured by Yin Sudie, not truly killable. What Yang Kai targeted were the Secret Treasures they held or wore.

Those Secret Treasures were all Saint King-Grade Upper-Level, more than twenty in number. It was astonishing that Yin Sudie had gathered so many and could even trigger their powers. Even if she animated them through those girls' phantoms, Yin Sudie herself would have had to refine the Secret Treasures beforehand to use them.

Refining over twenty Secret Treasures must have taken a long time; if they were destroyed, she would be truly distressed.

Sure enough, as one after another the Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures she had painstakingly refined were melted into molten iron by the Demonic Flame in Yang Kai's hand—five or six ruined in the blink of an eye—Yin Sudie, shocked, trembled with rage, her silver teeth clenched, and she cried, "If you damage my Secret Treasures again, I'll make you pay!"

Hearing her frantic shout, Yang Kai felt a sudden surge of relief and shifted his stance. He fixed his gaze on a girl standing by the wine pool; she held a long whip that flashed with lightning-like sparks, each lash crackling and explosive, the thunder-power not to be underestimated. Among these more than twenty Secret Treasures, in terms of power and value it ranked among the top three.

Such a Secret Treasure must be of considerable value; if it were destroyed, Yin Sudie's mood would surely worsen.

Yang Kai immediately rushed at the girl, blurred a few times, and appeared before her. The girl, mentally linked to Yin Sudie, instantly sensed the ambush; her pretty face changed and she flicked her whip, casting countless whip shadows to envelop Yang Kai. Blue lightning leapt from the whip in sprays.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. With a sweep of his hand the pitch-black Demonic Flame rose like a canopy before him; every incoming bolt that touched the flame vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai thrust out another hand and grabbed fiercely at the void.

The myriad whip shadows froze; the long whip was snatched into Yang Kai's palm. The Demonic Flame churned again, and a glow flickered along the whip—whatever material it had been forged from, its color dimmed and its spirit weakened, and in a moment it would be like the Secret Treasures destroyed before.

At that moment a dreamlike murmur sounded in Yang Kai's ear; the whisper contained boundless seduction and, without shape, surged into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai's Saint Yuan stalled involuntarily, and the Demonic Flame rolling in his hand weakened noticeably with a whoosh.

At the instant the murmur sounded, a colossal figure shot up from the pool—towering, muscles like iron plates, eyes beastly and fixed on Yang Kai. He gripped a jagged blade that, instead of cutting an enemy, tore his own hand; strangely, not a drop of blood flowed from the wound—the blood seeped into the blade, dyeing the three-foot blade blood-red.

The soaring stench of blood spread, making one want to retch.

That hulking man was in fact the warrior surnamed Hou whom Yang Kai had wounded earlier.

No one knew when he had slipped into the pink mist barrier and hidden in the wine pool; with Yin Sudie's cooperation, not even Yang Kai had detected the slightest flaw.

Seizing the moment while Yang Kai's attention was fixed on the whip Secret Treasure, the hulking man made his move.

A mere tremble of the blade and, with a clang, a ribbon-like bloodlight shot forth, slashing toward Yang Kai's midsection. The hulking man's face was full of savagery; killing intent surged like a tide and a cold smile twisted his lips.

He had suffered a heavy loss to Yang Kai before and knew his strength, but since he dared to rush out now he must have absolute confidence. The jagged blade in his hand was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure he had obtained while out on an mission, and it was extremely sinister—twenty to thirty percent more powerful than ordinary Secret Treasures.

At his cultivation he would not normally dare to trigger such a treasure casually; overuse could allow the blade's sinister influence to corrupt his mind.

But having been humiliated repeatedly today and desperate to save face before Yin Sudie, he no longer cared. He immediately used the Secret Treasure, preparing to deliver a killing blow to Yang Kai.

His timing was perfect: Yang Kai was distracted by Yin Sudie's murmur and busy trying to destroy the whip, and he believed that no matter how strong Yang Kai was, he could not avoid this slashing blade.

If struck by the blade, death would be certain!

Yang Kai naturally sensed something strange about the blade and for the first time his expression turned grave. As he sought to evade, the girl by the wine pool flicked her whip and it coiled around Yang Kai.

Before Yang Kai could free himself, she bound him tightly; at the same time lightning sparks danced along the whip and the Secret Treasure's power was instantly unleashed.

Bolts of lightning crawled over Yang Kai, crackling as they assaulted his body. His face turned icily fierce; roaring flames erupted from within and burned back toward the whip.

In an instant the whip was destroyed, snapped into countless segments that fell to the ground, but in that brief delay the blood-red blade had already slashed forward—Yang Kai could no longer avoid it!

Facing the blade inches from his body, Yang Kai calmly produced a Purple Shield. He poured Saint Yuan into it; a purple halo swirled on the shield and a massive rune appeared. The rune spun madly, burst forth from the shield and exploded, and the afterglow formed into a larger illusory shield that rose before him.

Boom...

With a thunderous crash the blood-red blade struck the shield; the shield's illusion shattered and the bloodlight vanished.

Seeing this, the hulking warrior's expression froze—he had not expected Yang Kai to possess such an outstanding defensive Secret Treasure that could block his killing strike head-on!

He had underestimated Yang Kai's foundation.

When the Purple Shield was first forged it was only an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure, but after Yang Yan refined it once it upgraded to Origin-Grade Middle-Level. Later, in the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai used the Purple Shield to battle an Artifact Spirit and it lost much of its spirit; after he brought it back Yang Yan refined it a second time. Now the Purple Shield is an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure.

Its defensive power was far superior to before.

Being the same Origin-Grade Upper-Level as that jagged blade, the Purple Shield was of equal rank and could naturally withstand its attack; otherwise Yang Kai would not have produced it with such confidence.

After blocking the blood blade, Yang Kai retracted the Purple Shield, stared coldly at the hulking man and a grim smile curled his lips.

He could sense that the previous strike had been filled with murderous intent; how could he not perceive it?

This man had already harbored the thought of killing him!

If before these people had merely intended to take him back to Liuli Gate, Yang Kai would not have slain without restraint, but now...

With a flick of his hand a scroll-like thing unfurled. As Yang Kai bared a feral grin, mountain-peak phantoms burst from the scroll; once projected they swelled, blotting out the sky, and with thunderous force they smashed down upon the hulking warrior.

The hulking man's face changed drastically. He could no longer care for anything else and hastily unleashed the jagged blade's power, frantically pouring blood into his body as he cleaved out ribbons of bloodlight.

The bloodlight struck the bases of those mountain phantoms, toppling several askew and sending them crashing to the ground, shaking the earth and leaving huge pits.

But Yang Kai this time used over a dozen mountain phantoms, each larger than the last—how could the hulking warrior defend against them?

He held on less than three breaths before losing strength; as a mountain loomed to crush him his face turned ashen and his eyes went blank.

He realized he would likely die the next moment. Instant remorse flooded him—he regretted ever coming out with Yin Sudie.

At that moment the surrounding pink haze and the wine pool twisted and vanished; Yin Sudie's figure appeared before the hulking warrior like a wraith, solemn in expression. A trace of dignity crossed her coquettish face as she held aloft a pure white pearl that emitted a soft glow and spread wildly around.

Bathed in the pearl's light, Yang Kai suddenly felt the murderous intent in his heart abate and became composed, even hesitating whether to completely annihilate the hulking warrior.

But in an instant Yang Kai dispelled the hesitation in his mind and stared coldly at Yin Sudie.

He knew that this reaction had to be related to the pearl in her hand.

Yin Sudie, however, now stared intently at the pearl as if searching for something. The next moment her face lit with joy; her beautiful eyes looked at Yang Kai and she softly said, "You really intend to do this? You won't regret it?"

As she spoke those two sentences she stood before the hulking warrior, treating the mountain phantoms bearing down as nothing, as if unafraid of life or death.
