			## Chapter 93 — July Seventh, Gathering of Yin Qi

Wen Feichen’s strike was not meant to kill, but merely to block Xia Ningshang’s retreat.

Her reaction was swift as well. Though Yang Kai had unexpectedly thrown her out, before Wen Feichen’s palm could strike, she had already turned around and met his attack head-on. Using the force of his strike, she lightly floated down beside Yang Kai.

“Ah!” Seeing this, Yang Kai sighed deeply. With a True Yuan Realm expert stationed here, and the enemy well-prepared and strong, this time it truly seemed like an inescapable calamity.

“Chief Wen, capture this woman for me. If she dares resist…” Long Hui’s cold eyes gleamed with a sinister smile, “Break her limbs if you must, just don’t damage her face! I want to see what unparalleled beauty hides beneath that veil!”

Wen Feichen chuckled softly, “Young Master Long, rest assured, I will not fail in my task.”

He had initially worried that injuring Xia Ningshang during the fight might bring Long Hui’s blame, but now that the latter openly declared breaking her limbs was acceptable, Wen Feichen had no more reservations.

This young master of the Long family was quite spirited, and at least somewhat self-aware—knowing he was no match for this woman. If he could cripple her, he could do as he pleased.

Their conversation reached Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang’s ears, igniting a fierce anger in both their eyes.

Wen Feichen laughed loudly, “Young lady, you heard Young Master Long’s words. If you know what’s good for you, surrender quietly. I promise not to harm you. But if you insist on resisting, don’t blame me for hastening your demise!”

Xia Ningshang spat lightly, “In your dreams!”

“Very well!” Wen Feichen smiled coldly. “You asked for this.”

With that, he sprang into the air like a swift swallow, palms striking out in rapid succession. The fierce power of a True Yuan Realm expert erupted. Amid the roaring palm winds came the howls of tigers, as the gusts suddenly transformed into snarling tiger heads lunging toward Xia Ningshang.

Sensing the power behind these strikes, Xia Ningshang’s expression turned serious. Her delicate hands danced gracefully, swiftly releasing several finger winds to meet the attack. Then she formed a strange hand seal and pressed it against the sapphire on her forehead. Her Yuan Qi surged violently.

Though the finger winds she sent out were powerful, they could not stop Wen Feichen’s assault. They only slowed the tiger heads momentarily before being swallowed whole.

In the next instant, the attack reached Xia Ningshang’s front.

The sudden turn of events unfolded so quickly that by the time Yang Kai reacted, it was already too late.

One tiger head after another snapped toward Xia Ningshang, about to inflict grievous wounds. Suddenly, the sapphire on her forehead rippled with a mysterious and wondrous wave. Accompanying this ripple, a semicircular light barrier appeared, like an inverted bowl, enveloping both her and Yang Kai.

Wen Feichen’s attack finally arrived, but the majestic tiger heads barely touched the light barrier before whimpering and dissipating into nothingness.

Xia Ningshang remained motionless, her face calm and serene.

Wen Feichen landed on the ground, eyes wide with shock as he stared at the barrier, exclaiming, “A Heaven-Grade Secret Treasure!”

At this declaration, everyone’s eyes burned with intensity, including Long Hui, who had been leering lecherously.

“What?” Long Hui finally tore his gaze away from Xia Ningshang and looked at Wen Feichen, his voice trembling slightly, “Chief Wen, what did you just say?”

Wen Feichen’s face twitched, greed flashing in his eyes. Swallowing hard, he said, “A Heaven-Grade Secret Treasure! It easily blocked my attack. There’s no doubt about it!”

“Really?” Long Hui grew excited. He had only intended to eliminate Yang Kai, a minor player, but unexpectedly, fortune smiled upon him. Not only might he gain a beauty, but also acquire a Heaven-Grade Secret Treasure! And a defensive one at that—far more valuable than an offensive treasure.

Heaven-Grade Secret Treasures were priceless. The Blood Battle Gang possessed only one, held by Hu Man.

If he could present this treasure to his grandfather, his grandfather’s strength would soar to new heights—perhaps even surpassing Hu Man.

It must be taken, no matter what! Long Hui shouted excitedly, “Chief Wen, if you can seize this treasure, the position of Deputy Leader of the Blood Battle Gang will surely be yours!”

Wen Feichen’s expression brightened at these words, “Thank you for your trust, Young Master Long!”

Though he spoke thus, Wen Feichen knew breaking through the defense of this Heaven-Grade Secret Treasure would not be easy. His previous strike had been completely ineffective, proving this was a tough nut to crack.

Fortunately, this young girl’s strength was not high enough to maintain the barrier for long. As long as he kept attacking relentlessly, there would be a chance to shatter it.

“Attack!” With this thought, Wen Feichen called out and launched another strike at the barrier. At the same time, the Blood Battle Gang’s experts unleashed their formidable skills.

Ripples spread across the barrier, layer upon layer, but Xia Ningshang and Yang Kai inside remained unharmed. All attacks were blocked.

The sudden change gave Yang Kai a glimmer of hope for escape. His eyes gleamed with sharp intelligence as his mind raced to find a way out before the barrier broke.

“Junior Brother, are you afraid?” Xia Ningshang suddenly asked.

“Hm?” Yang Kai turned to look at her.

“We might die. Are you afraid?”

“What is there to fear? You shouldn’t be afraid either!” Yang Kai replied. From a distance of over ten zhang, he stared coldly at Long Hui. If he could capture this man, he would gain a bargaining chip.

However, breaking through the Blood Battle Gang’s blockade and capturing Long Hui was no easy feat. Even Xia Ningshang might not manage it.

“I’m not afraid!” Xia Ningshang smiled lightly. “They don’t even know what they’re about to face!”

Yang Kai was stunned by her words, still trying to grasp their meaning when the entire valley suddenly darkened.

The hour of the Rat had arrived.

July Seventh, the gathering of Yin Qi! In this place where the Nine Yins converge, cold Yin energy suddenly surged from the ground, rising in eerie waves like countless sinister hands clawing upward from the earth itself. The sight was chilling.

In the blink of an eye, the valley’s temperature plummeted. The bone-chilling cold made everyone shiver involuntarily.

The Blood Battle Gang’s experts attacking the barrier sensed the danger and hurriedly circulated their Yuan Qi to resist the Yin Qi’s corrosion.

Fortunately, though uncomfortable, the Yin Qi was not lethal. With cultivation, it could be resisted. Even the minor characters from Fengyu Tower could withstand it, let alone the Blood Battle Gang’s members. But if they lingered too long, their Yuan Qi would be exhausted, and they would freeze to death.

Moments later, the entire valley was engulfed in Yin Qi. Xia Ningshang suddenly moved, her figure graceful as if dancing. With a series of strange hand seals, her Yuan Qi split into countless streams, spreading in all directions.
