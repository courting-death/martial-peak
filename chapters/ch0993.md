## Chapter 993 — A Mad Spree

The secret treasures wielded by those Purple Star cultivators—Star Shuttles, war chariots, flying carriages—were all styled for combat in the starry sky, dazzling to behold.

From the Sword Alliance fleet, a large number of fighters suddenly appeared outside their warship, unafraid, heading straight for them; when the two sides met, a fierce battle erupted instantly.

Halos of light spread through the starry sky as magnificent, powerful Martial Skills detonated and the Secret Treasures shone brilliantly.

From the outset, Purple Star and the Sword Alliance fought with bloodshot eyes, locked in a life-or-death struggle.

In the melee, many high-grade Secret Treasures were pounded to pieces, ripped and shattered.

Burning fragments of Secret Treasures rained down like a shower of flame, their searing light spectacular as if the most brilliant fireworks had burst—stunningly beautiful, yet accompanied by corpses stripped of life, forever lost within this Chaos Abyss.

The chaotic battlefield was dominated by figures from the Saint Realm; cultivators of the Transcendent Realm were like ants in comparison, utterly insignificant.

There were even figures radiating the domineering aura of the Saint King Realm, opening and closing forces with disdain; they unleashed earth-shattering divine arts, slaughtering weaker cultivators without mercy, leaving devastation in their wake—countless fighters smashed to bone dust, souls scattered.

Both sides suffered tremendous losses.

No one was willing to show weakness or concede easily; reinforcements were continuously dispatched from each warship, joining the fray.

For a time, the two sides were truly evenly matched.

In this starry void, whether the Sword Alliance or Purple Star, both were first-tier powers; each controlled at least four or five cultivation stars, with countless mining and medicinal stars under them. Using those vast reserves, they could supply unimaginable resources to support the growth of their cultivators.

Their leaders did not care about such small losses.

Yang Kai remained silent for a long while.

He was utterly shaken.

He was still reeling from the divine light that had blasted out from that warship; he had never imagined such incomprehensible things existed within the boundless starry void.

Since arriving in the starry void, what he had seen and heard had already exceeded his imagination.

He suddenly realized the starry void was even more wondrous than he had thought; his eyes grew bright with spirit and his blood surged hot within his body.

Far from retreating in horror at these sights, he felt ever more eager.

Only in a place this exciting could he live a more spectacular life.

"Yang Kai! Yang Kai!" Shen Tu's shouted voice came again.

Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at him.

Shen Tu's face was bitter. He pressed his cracked lips together and said, "Can you give me a few more Saint Crystals? I can't hold on."

At this moment his strength was nearly exhausted; he was clearly at the point of burning out.

Without a word, Yang Kai tossed him five or six Saint Crystals.

"Thanks!" Gratitude flooded Shen Tu's face. He thanked him sincerely and hurriedly began to absorb them.

Yang Kai calmed himself, eyes cold as he scanned the surroundings, quietly listening to footsteps within the hull and sensing energy fluctuations from all directions. His eyes gradually brightened.

After a long while, Shen Tu finally exhaled heavily and said, "I'm finally back on my feet. Damn it, if they had fired the Crystal Cannon again just now I would have died immediately. That was a close call."

With tears of gratitude he looked at Yang Kai. "A great favor needs no thanks—I won't forget this."

"Shen Tu, what's your true cultivation level?" Yang Kai suddenly glanced at him and asked in a low voice.

Shen Tu was startled; his expression flickered as if he wanted to evade the question, but then he half-smiled. "You saw through me?"

"If I couldn't see, I'd be blind!" Yang Kai said coldly.

Shen Tu's internal power fluctuations were around the First Stage of the Saint Realm, roughly on par with Yang Kai.

But at that critical moment when Shen Tu absorbed crystals, unusual power ripples had emanated from him.

Yang Kai judged that he had concealed his true strength.

The ability to hide one’s cultivation on a Purple Star warship was not something everyone possessed—this Shen Tu was not ordinary!

"Third Stage of the Saint Realm!" Shen Tu's expression suddenly grew serious and he answered in a low voice.

Yang Kai nodded; he believed Shen Tu was not lying.

"Why are you asking?" Shen Tu regarded Yang Kai oddly.

"Nothing much. If you have that strength, we might be able to do something. There don't seem to be many people left in this warship—most of the masters went out to meet the enemy, and even the power room’s defenses are far weaker than before," Yang Kai hinted.

Originally a Saint King Realm expert had been secretly stationed in the power room, but after the clash their aura had vanished; Yang Kai guessed that expert had gone out. Moreover, the Purple Star cultivators remaining in the power room had been reduced by more than half. Aside from Ke Meng, a Third Stage of the Saint Realm master, the rest were First and Second Stage Saint Realm cultivators, fewer than ten in number, each manning formations within the power room to keep the warship running.

"What are you trying to do? Don’t get reckless. These shackles have Hun Yuan Stones mixed into them—bound by that, we can’t use our power at all," Shen Tu's face changed as he suddenly realized Yang Kai's intent.

"Then have someone undo them," Yang Kai said with a sly smile, suddenly feigning extreme weakness; the ebb of his Qi and blood dimmed.

He signaled Shen Tu with a look.

Shen Tu's face went grim; he hesitated for a moment before biting the bullet: "Fine. Since you saved my life, I'll go along with your madness."

He then began shouting loudly.

Ke Meng, who was watching the battle from beside the power room, heard the shout; his expression chilled and he turned his gaze sharply toward Shen Tu and Yang Kai, giving a cold, surprised "You two are still alive?"

It was beyond his expectations.

When the fleets clashed, most of the cultivators bound in that place had been drained of power and had died from exhaustion.

Shen Tu and Yang Kai, however, were still alive—this astonished him.

"My vitality has always been abundant, but he's about to die!" Shen Tu kept shouting. "This lord, isn't this fellow someone Bi Ya needs? Letting him die just like that—wouldn't that be improper?"

Ke Meng frowned. He probed Yang Kai with his divine sense and detected his weakness, then impatiently said, "What a nuisance. If he's dead it's settled—why keep him breathing?"

Saying that, he strode quickly toward Yang Kai.

When he had been commanding the warship in battle, he had not considered Yang Kai's situation much, so he hadn't paid attention to him.

Now, calm, he had to carefully consider the consequences if Yang Kai truly died—would Bi Ya punish him for it?

He could not shoulder that responsibility.

So he stepped before Yang Kai, took out a special key, and unlocked the shackles, freeing him from bondage.

Yang Kai offered no resistance.

After all, Yang Kai looked feeble and his strength barely moved; moreover, a Third Stage of the Saint Realm master like Ke Meng would naturally look down upon a First Stage Saint such as Yang Kai.

That arrogance would be his downfall.

The instant the shackles were opened, Yang Kai suddenly thrust his hand into his mouth and bit down hard.

He then wiped the wound at his fingertip across his left eye.

Golden blood surged into his left eye, instantly turning what had been black and white into a blaze of gold.

Yang Kai snapped his head up and stared coldly at Ke Meng.

When their eyes met, Ke Meng went slack-jawed; he was overcome by an overwhelming fear, as if some unseen force made him feel insignificant.

A vortex formed within Yang Kai's golden eye. From that whirlpool came an intense suction that tugged at his spirit, pulling on Ke Meng’s soul until it trembled, as if about to be drawn out.

Turning pale, Ke Meng let out a howl and strove to resist.

Yang Kai had already activated Demon God Transformation; dark energy filled his body, his entire temperament shifting—suddenly the temperature in the power room seemed to plummet, chilling to the bone.

The evil and violent aura surged outward in a roar.

Like a cannonball, Yang Kai slammed into Ke Meng's chest; an unimaginable force erupted through his flesh as he rained blows on Ke Meng relentlessly.

Blood spurted. Clear impressions of fists and palms rose on Ke Meng’s back; his garments were shredded to dust in an instant.

Even one as strong as Ke Meng could not withstand Yang Kai's onslaught while stunned. His exquisite divine arts and Secret Treasures had no time to be deployed; he was battered senseless.

In the blink of an eye, Ke Meng's body burst into a cloud of blood mist; crimson rain sprayed everywhere, as shocking as a blooming red rose.

A shadowy, ethereal figure, identical to Ke Meng, stood where his body had been.

That was Ke Meng’s Spirit Body.

Even then, he seemed not to understand what had happened, staring at Yang Kai in a daze.

From Yang Kai's left golden eye, a powerful attraction emanated, drawing Ke Meng's Spirit Body into his Sea of Consciousness.

Amid the blood mist, Yang Kai moved with lightning speed, seizing the special key that had unlocked the shackles and tossing it to Shen Tu.

"Open it yourself!" Yang Kai instructed, then vanished like a gust of wind. The next moment, a scream and chaotic commotion erupted inside the power room.

Shen Tu was shaken to the core, his eyes nearly bulging from his sockets.

He could not believe what he had seen.

When Shen Tu had perceived Yang Kai's intention, he had agreed to join him in a lunatic gamble, but he had not asked precisely what Yang Kai planned to do; he assumed Yang Kai would leave temporarily and look for a chance to act.

Whether Yang Kai could also take Shen Tu along was not something Shen Tu had dwelled on—after all, Yang Kai had saved him once, and he felt too ashamed to demand more.

Who could have expected this man to go so mad—striking the instant the shackles were unfastened.

What left Shen Tu speechless was that Ke Meng, a cultivator of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, had actually been taken down by Yang Kai in a single exchange.
