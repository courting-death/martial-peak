## Chapter 666 — Divine Roaming Realm Peak

Cradling the jade box, Yang Kai's face lit with surprise as he hurriedly asked, "What is this?"

"Wind-and-Thunder Wings!" Han Fei answered calmly. "It's a strange treasure; no one can say clearly where it came from. Over the years Li Rong and I have both tried to refine it many times, but never once succeeded. I saw you have a pair of wings imbued with the Laws of the Heavenly Dao, so I thought I'd let you give it a try."

Yang Kai glanced at her, a trace of hesitation on his face. By principle he intended to refuse—no merit, no reward—but at that moment an unusual tingling arose at the position of his shoulder blades, as if something were about to break free of its restraints and burst out from within him.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly; beyond his control, the Wings of Yang Flame actually wanted to spread of their own accord.

In that darkness, the Wings of Yang Flame and the Wind-and-Thunder Wings inexplicably formed a subtle connection.

Yang Kai involuntarily clenched the jade box tighter and extended a finger to touch the Wind-and-Thunder Wings.

The exquisitely ornate Wind-and-Thunder Wings leisurely transformed into a streak of light and flashed into Yang Kai's body. At the same time his face changed; an unbearable, crushing pain surged from the shoulder blade at his back, as if his entire body were being torn apart.

His face instantly turned ashen, beads of sweat appeared on his brow, and his body trembled.

Li Rong and Han Fei watched coldly from the side, offering no aid. Yet both pairs of their beautiful eyes were full of worry and expectation as they fixed their gaze on Yang Kai without blinking.

After a long while Yang Kai slowly straightened, gasping heavily. The shoulder-blade pains still came in waves, but they were no longer utterly intolerable.

Seeing this, Li Rong couldn't help but clap lightly, laughing softly, "Looks like you really do have some affinity with these Wind-and-Thunder Wings."

"I haven't refined it yet!" Yang Kai frowned. He could clearly feel two mighty energies hidden at his shoulder blades, constantly tearing at his body; the sporadic eruptions of wind-and-thunder force left him in agony.

Only his willpower and resilience were beyond ordinary; that was why he had not let the pain show on his face.

"I know," Li Rong smiled faintly. "But Han Fei and I experimented many times and could barely force it into our bodies. Without exception, before an hour passed we had to force it back out; otherwise we would have died long ago. I don't know how long you can endure, or whether you can make it acknowledge you and truly be refined."

"I'll try my best." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

He also realized that refining the Wind-and-Thunder Wings was like refining a Secret Treasure; it required persistent infusion of True Yuan to subdue it and make it serve him.

Before it fully merged into his body it was merely a foreign object within him—unable to be used and actively destroying his body, doing him tremendous harm.

"I'll see you back to rest. You have too much to do; don't rush. Grow step by step—no one becomes great all at once." Li Rong soothed him in a gentle voice, reached out, took Yang Kai's arm, and with a flourish of her technique swept upward.

Back in the stone chamber, Yang Kai had no leisure for anything else; he hurried to his bed, sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and focused his mind.

In the octagonal tower, Li Rong and Han Fei sipped fragrant tea in silence.

After a long while Li Rong suddenly became serious and asked, "Han Fei, what do you think of him?"

Han Fei set down her teacup and inclined her slender head slightly. "Aptitude, perseverance, boldness, courage—there's nothing to criticize. He's superior to any young member of our clan. Even when we were his age we couldn't compare. If he doesn't die young, his future will surely be bright."

Li Rong agreed and lightly tapped the table with her jade hand, a disappointed look appearing on her pretty face. "It's a pity he's human-born. If only the blood of our Ancient Demon Clan ran through his veins."

Han Fei's expression changed. "Li Rong, you—"

Li Rong burst into an embarrassed smile and shook her head. "What are you thinking? I'm not that vicious. I was just sighing. I'm not one to go back on my word."

Han Fei relaxed; after Li Rong's remark a moment before she had suspected Li Rong of harboring some foul intent.

Li Rong suddenly smiled oddly. "Why do you seem to care for him so much?"

"He saved me under the volcano. Without his protection I would have died." Han Fei said lightly.

Li Rong smiled knowingly. "It's not that simple; you even gave him the Wind-and-Thunder Wings." She said this and fixed Han Fei with a look full of meaning.

"You're overthinking. He's just a kid!" Han Fei averted her gaze.

"He's not a kid!" Li Rong shook her head. "Alright, enough of that. I'm only lamenting that despite our showing goodwill and trying to befriend him, he seems to have no sense of belonging or dependence on our Ancient Demon Clan. He is too self-reliant and confident."

"Naturally—he has grounds for confidence. Besides, he was brought here captured by Senior Coffin-Servant; we haven't done him any favors, so why would he feel any sense of belonging or dependence?" Han Fei said bitterly.

Both she and Li Rong understood that the Ancient Demon Clan's future now hinged on Yang Kai. But because he felt no belonging here, he would not care for the clan and would not devote himself to it—at least not sincerely.

If he could leave, Han Fei and Li Rong were almost certain he would not hesitate to abandon the Ancient Demon Clan and walk away without looking back.

"You want him to feel some attachment to our clan?" Han Fei suddenly realized Li Rong's plan.

"I hope so." Li Rong did not deny it, rubbing her white forehead. "But he seems rather impervious. Didn't the elders' records say young human men are greedy for women and lust? Yet he doesn't seem so. I had Guan'er keep him company for over a year and he behaved himself, never crossed any line with her."

"Maybe Guan'er isn't his type?" Han Fei wondered.

Having lived their whole lives in the Small Xuan Realm, their understanding of humans came only from ancestral records; if the elders said humans were treacherous, greedy for beauty and power, then that was the truth to them.

"What kind of woman does he like? In Mo Shen Fort there are plenty of maidens of marriageable age with all sorts of temperaments, yet he's never made a move on any of them."

"Indeed, he behaved properly when he protected me under the volcano..." Han Fei reflected.

"Why don't you try testing him again?" Li Rong suggested with a smile to Han Fei.

"What are you saying?" Han Fei blushed.

"I'm serious." Li Rong's expression turned solemn. "We must make him feel a bit of attachment to our clan, by any means necessary so long as we don't harm him."

Han Fei was stunned, staring at Li Rong, unable to detect any hint of joking in her face.

"I won't do it." Han Fei's brows knit tightly; asking her to seduce Yang Kai put her in an awkward position.

Li Rong gave a bitter smile and stopped pressing. She sighed deeply, feeling a headache coming on; given the circumstances, this clumsy plan was all she could think of.

The scheme filled her with a sense of shame; she would not have considered such means to tie Yang Kai down if she were not forced.

………………

A fierce pain kept surging from his back, but Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent, as if he had grown used to such agony; he meticulously poured True Yuan into the pill furnace and refined a spirit pill.

His manner was focused, his technique practiced, and his skill in the True Alchemy Formula outstanding. In less than half a day a spirit pill was produced.

Testing the pill's quality, Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction—Spirit-Grade, Middle-Level!

Now, without relying on a spirit formation and by only his own skill and methods, he could refine Spirit-Grade Middle-Level pills.

If he employed a spirit formation and added Wan Yao Ling Ye into the ingredients, he could very likely refine a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill, and the step to a Saint-Grade pill would be only one stride away.

He took out a spirit stone, held it in his palm, sat to recover for a short while, and once his essence, qi, and spirit were full, Yang Kai left the stone chamber and strolled into Li Rong's octagonal tower.

Descending into the tower's depths, he entered the Demonic State and advanced the progress of the Demon God Transformation to the Second-Tier.

Since Chu Jian's death several months had passed. During these months Yang Kai had lived like a mendicant monk, shuttling between stone chamber and secret room.

Half a day refining pills, half a day cultivating Demon God Transformation—every day was fully scheduled, with no waste.

The Wind-and-Thunder Wings hidden inside his body were constantly being suffused and refined by True Yuan, and the progress was gratifying.

Moreover the Demon God Transformation had seen substantial advancement; the golden radiance in Yang Kai's blood had grown. At least one third of his blood had turned golden, and that golden blood contained destructive might.

Months of bitter training had brought Yang Kai's strength to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm!

His foundation was firmer than anyone's; his corporeal cultivation reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, and his comprehension of martial Dao was not inferior to that of a Saint Realm expert.

After all, he had devoured the dead and absorbed much of their insight; within his Divine Sense lay graspings and understandings of the Heavenly Dao.

Even living such a full life, Yang Kai always felt something was lacking. To his surprise, after ascending to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm his cultivation advanced extremely slowly, as slow as a turtle's crawl.

The Transcendent Realm was a vast chasm!

In Zhongdu, the Transcendent Realm cultivators were the pinnacle. Because of the constraints of heaven-and-earth laws, very few could reach this level. Among the Eight Great Families each only had a mere three or four people; the top First-rate forces had at most one or two—most had only a single Transcendent Realm master.

Even on Tongxuan Continent, where Spiritual Qi was plentiful, the majority of warriors stopped at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm in their lifetimes and could not break through to the Transcendent Realm.

Still, overall there were quite a number of Transcendent Realm elites here; on his travels Yang Kai had met dozens of Transcendent Realm cultivators, and even several who had entered the Saint Realm.

Now Yang Kai stood at the threshold of the Transcendent Realm, unable to peer into the mysteries within.
