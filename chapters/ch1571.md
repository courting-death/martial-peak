## Chapter 1571 — Ba He

Yang Kai's aura carried with it his grasp of spatial force; this was one of his ace cards, and he hadn't revealed it unless absolutely necessary—but the yao experts shrouded by his Shi could still sense that strange murderous intent within.

Magna's face turned ashen; Mi Tian's expression was equally grave.

Neither of the two yao experts had expected Yang Kai's mastery of Shi to be so profound. Coupled with the ferocious combat prowess and terrifying Divine Sense the human had displayed earlier, they found themselves hesitant to act rashly.

The innkeeper, who had been lowering his eyelids, leisurely opened them and his gaze suddenly brightened; he stared at Yang Kai in surprise.

Then he looked up again, scrutinizing the strange phenomenon in the sky, his nostrils fluttering slightly.

Very quickly, as if he had discovered something, an astonishing light burst from his eyes!

"Stop!" he barked, "Everyone, remain calm for a moment."

Yang Kai shot him a glance, his expression somewhat odd.

Magna furrowed his brow, a trace of displeasure flashing across his face. After all, he was the lord of Huiyue City—when had anyone else earned the right to boss him around, especially some old innkeeper?

Scanning the man with Divine Sense, Magna found no trace of cultivation at all, which only soured his mood further.

"Old man, this isn't a place for you to speak—step aside!" Mi Tian snorted.

The innkeeper merely chuckled without a hint of fear, and cast Mi Tian a look laden with meaning.

Mi Tian frowned, feeling that something was off. He eyed the innkeeper suspiciously and hesitated, "Have I seen you somewhere before? You look strangely familiar."

"You could discern that—truly worthy of being the son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord; your eyesight is indeed extraordinary!" the innkeeper praised, speaking to the younger man with the tone of an elder.

Mi Tian's face darkened and he demanded in a low voice, "Who exactly are you?"

Magna was stunned too. He had never imagined that the owner of an obscure inn in his city might have such a background. If the man weren't of elevated status, who would dare speak to Mi Tian like that?

Yang Kai glanced at one then the other, his eyes darting about, and suddenly cracked a grin.

With the innkeeper's disruption, all attention shifted away from him—just the outcome he liked. He was also curious about this innkeeper's background. Despite displaying no energy fluctuations, the man spoke confidently before Magna and Mi Tian and showed no fear; this was not something an ordinary yao could manage.

The old man kept smiling faintly, and under the gaze of everyone present, his body underwent a jaw-dropping transformation.

His once-hunched waist slowly straightened, his short frame stretched taller; the dry, wrinkled skin vanished, replaced by a healthy, ruddy complexion, and the lines on his face smoothed away.

In an instant he seemed decades younger, changing from an old man into a composed, imposing middle-aged figure.

Not only that—along with the change in his form, his aura shifted dramatically.

Previously, anyone's Divine Sense scanning him would find no energy fluctuations and assume he had never cultivated; yet now a surging and extremely potent energy ripple erupted from within him, steadily strengthening until it reached the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

He appeared to be slightly stronger than both Magna and Mi Tian.

Yang Kai was stunned, staring dumbfounded at the innkeeper, scarcely believing his eyes.

Magna and Mi Tian were frozen as well; none of them had expected someone could conceal themselves so thoroughly.

Had the innkeeper not revealed himself, no one present would have been able to detect his true depth.

"You… you are Lord Ba He?" Magna exclaimed, peering closely at the innkeeper's face in shock.

After the innkeeper changed his appearance, Magna immediately recognized him, his voice trembling and his features filled with alarm.

"What? He actually is Lord Ba He?"

"Impossible—didn't they say Lord Ba He was struck down by the Lady herself? How can he still be alive?"

"No mistake, that is Lord Ba He. Two hundred years ago when I accompanied the city lord to the palace to pay respects to the Lady, I saw him—I remember back then he was the Lady's foremost general!"

"Tsk tsk, Ba He? This is truly interesting."

Shouts and exclamations rose around them; Yang Kai listened with a strange expression.

He could vaguely tell the innkeeper had quite a reputation—even Magna showed some reserve and respect.

Who exactly was this man? Why did others claim he was the first general under Lady Chi Yue and that she had personally slain him? What was really going on?

Yang Kai was baffled and couldn't make sense of it.

"So it's Senior Ba He!" Mi Tian drew a deep breath. "No wonder you look familiar—I've seen Senior Ba He before!"

Though also at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Ba He's seniority exceeded that of any yao present. Even as the Thousand-Eyed Lord's Young Master, Mi Tian did not dare be lax in his manners.

"Heh heh, Young Master Mi Tian needn't be so formal—you are also a promising yao, and have a good chance to advance to the Void King Realm in the future," Ba He praised.

Mi Tian smiled confidently and said, "Senior Ba He, you are mistaken—it's not that I have a good chance, I will definitely advance; it's only a matter of time."

What arrogance from the brat! Yang Kai glanced at him, smiling inwardly.

Still, one couldn't deny he had reason to be so cocky.

Ba He nodded lightly. "May your wishes come to fruition."

"Lord Ba He…" Magna's forehead broke out in a cold sweat as he looked at this storied figure who had vanished for nearly two hundred years, then at the phenomenon in the sky, and asked, "What is happening here?"

"What is happening?" Ba He pondered for a moment before replying, "I don't know either, but for now you all should remain calm and do not disturb whatever is occurring inside. I am the inn's owner, and I bear the responsibility to protect guests sheltering here—please give me some face."

"Uh… since Lord Ba He says so, we'll wait then," Magna nodded.

In front of Ba He he truly dared not act wantonly.

"What about this human?" Mi Tian suddenly looked at Yang Kai with a sneer, "Senior Ba He, will you protect him too?"

"Of course—this young man is also my guest," Ba He answered matter-of-factly.

"Heh heh, then I'll grant Senior Ba He some face, but only while he's under your protection—he killed two of my cart-pulling demonic beasts, and that debt will be settled one day," Mi Tian laughed coldly, casting an aggressive glare at Yang Kai and jeering, "Human, don't let me get the chance, or else…"

Yang Kai sneered and paid no heed to the threat. His priority now was to prevent anyone from disturbing Xia Ningshang; everything else was secondary. If someone could calm this commotion for him, he would welcome their help.

But… what did Ba He intend?

Yang Kai's amused gaze lingered on the innkeeper. From the earlier murmurs of the crowd he had caught hints of secrets—Ba He had hidden his name for two centuries, yet now he had voluntarily revealed his identity and stood to shield him and Xia Ningshang.

What was his purpose?

Yang Kai did not believe Ba He had exposed himself solely to protect his guests.

Men grow crafty with age; he did not imagine Ba He to be that selflessly noble.

"Eh, what's that smell!" a cry suddenly rang out from the crowd.

"How fragrant—seems like the scent of a spiritual pill."

"Has a supreme spiritual pill been produced?"

"Could these phenomena have been caused by pill refining?"

One word stirred a thousand waves; the crowd erupted into excited clamor.

Xia Ningshang's pill refining had produced a remarkably conspicuous phenomenon. At first few might have been able to discern it; even well-traveled experts like Magna and Mi Tian couldn't tell. But as the rich medicinal aroma began to spread, the inn's hidden secret could no longer be concealed.

As the scent intensified and spread, almost everyone's burning gaze turned to the inn.

They had already determined the fragrance came from that seemingly shabby inn.

Nearly every martial artist's face showed intoxication and delight—just inhaling such a medicinal aroma felt enlightening; what effects might the pill produce if ingested?

What sort of spiritual pill could create such aroma and such phenomena?

The eyes of many martial artists grew hot with greed…

If not for Ba He and experts like Magna standing before the inn, that little establishment would likely have been crushed by the surging crowd.

"Young Master Mi Tian…" After determining the phenomena were indeed caused by pill refining, Magna glanced at Mi Tian and sent a Divine Sense message.

"That old Ba He seems intent on monopolizing that spiritual pill—no wonder he hid his name for two centuries yet exposed himself today! If so, that pill must be extraordinary; the question is which human alchemist is inside refining it," Mi Tian responded with a cold snort.

"Then what shall we do…"

"Even if he wants to monopolize it, he must have the means! Two centuries ago he quarrelled badly with Lady Chi Yue; whatever plot he used to escape her subordinates and survive is unknown. Now that he's revealed himself, his good days are over—if we kill him here, I doubt Lady Chi Yue will blame us."

"Uh… very well, we'll follow Young Master Mi Tian then," Magna replied. Though he disliked Mi Tian's style, he acknowledged that joining forces was the best option; Ba He's reputation was too great, and he lacked the nerve to oppose him alone. As for the spiritual pill—this is Huiyue City; it's his territory, and who could contend with him?
