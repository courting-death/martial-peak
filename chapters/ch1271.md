## Chapter 1271 — Fondling

Charm technique! A flicker of surprise crossed Yang Kai's eyes; it was the first time he realized Yin Sudie had actually mastered a charm technique, and was very skilled at it. No wonder every time he saw her she was gorgeously adorned and radiated boundless allure from head to toe—so this woman had indeed mastered the charm art.

Hearing Yin Sudie's words, Daiyuan's pretty face darkened and she snapped, "You had someone watch me?"

Yin Sudie paid it no mind as she smoothed her hair and laughed softly. "Senior Sister, what are you saying? Little Sister was only concerned for you. The last time you left without saying where you were going, even Master didn't know, so Little Sister had people keep an eye out for news about you. In fact, I just heard a transmission saying you've safely returned—good news. Not only am I pleased, Master is too and wants to see you."

"Master…" A complex expression flitted across Daiyuan's face; she seemed unwilling to fuss further with Yin Sudie and said, "You're not minding your affairs on Hundred Butterflies Peak and came over here—there's more to this than just those words, isn't there?"

"What else is there to say?" Yin Sudie wore a demure, graceful look, then her eyes brightened as if remembering something. "Oh, there's another piece of good news to share with Senior Sister. Master has asked Master Xiao to refine an Origin Condensing Pill. Although two furnaces have failed, Master Xiao says the next batch has an eighty percent chance of success. When that happens, Little Sister will likely have to seclude herself to break through to the Origin Returning Realm and won't have time to visit Senior Sister. If Senior Sister feels lonely, Little Sister can have a few maidservants come keep you company—how about that?"

She wore an ingenuous smile, as if truly caring for Daiyuan; the sisterly affection was plain for all to see.

Yet anyone could hear the mockery and smugness threaded through her words.

"Origin Condensing Pill, huh…" Daiyuan nodded coldly. "Then congratulations, Junior Sister."

"Indeed. It's all thanks to Senior Sister finding a few Cui Luo Grass back in the Flowing Flame Sandland; otherwise the pill couldn't be made. Little Sister was out of luck and couldn't find a single Cui Luo Grass, alas!" She shook her head and sighed as if sincerely vexed.

A sneer curled Daiyuan's lip; she paid no mind that the Cui Luo Grass she had struggled to find had been used on Yin Sudie. Instead she said, "Nothing else? If that's all, Junior Sister, take your leave. Since you're preparing to break through to the Origin Returning Realm you should properly make preparations—if you fail, you would be betraying Master's painstaking efforts."

The smile on Yin Sudie's face vanished, replaced by a much colder countenance.

She hadn't even attempted the breakthrough yet, and Daiyuan was already cursing her to fail; though it was only one sentence, it still left a snag in her mind.

“Since I have guests to attend to, Senior Sister, I won’t be accompanying you.” Daiyuan ignored her unpleasant expression entirely as she bluntly saw her out.

But Yin Sudie showed no intention of leaving. Seeing that needling Daiyuan yielded no reaction, her beautiful eyes turned sly and shifted toward Yang Kai. With a sweet smile, she said, “This young brother looks quite familiar—have we met somewhere before?”

Yang Kai was taken aback; he hadn't expected that upon arriving at Liuli Gate he'd be drawn into this Senior Sister–Junior Sister's quarrel. He didn't mind, though, and grinned: "Yes, Miss Yin and I have met a few times. I've long admired you, Miss Yin, but I'm of no consequence—perhaps you simply didn't notice."

Yin Sudie's face immediately blossomed into a flowery smile; she giggled with girlish delight, pleased by Yang Kai's flattery.

Daiyuan frowned and shot Yang Kai a strange look. As for Yang Yan, she stood motionless and silent, as if she didn't exist.

"Ah, I remember now—you should be the one who is with that Wei Guchang. So you also know Senior Sister?" Yin Sudie's voice suddenly softened. To others it sounded harmless, but Yang Kai felt his blood quicken and a susurrating whisper in his ears, like invisible little hands caressing his cheeks, leaving him deliciously lightheaded.

"Yes, we met in the Flowing Flame Sandland," Yang Kai nodded, answering obligingly.

"I see. But since Senior Sister invited you back as a guest, you must be quite close." Yin Sudie hinted and prodded, then flashed a smile that sent ripples through her eyes and exuded a strange charm that tugged at Yang Kai's heart. She breathed like orchids and said, "If young brother doesn't mind, why not visit my Hundred Butterflies Peak sometime? It's not close, but it has its own charms. I promise you won't be disappointed."

Yang Kai's eyes suddenly glazed over and his face flushed unnaturally; he nodded unconsciously. "Yes, yes, I couldn't wish for more!"

His mouth even seemed on the verge of drooling—an obscene, lascivious look.

"Yin Sudie!" Daiyuan suddenly snapped. Realizing Yang Kai must be under her Junior Sister's charm, Saint Yuan surged wildly through her body and she looked dangerous, as if she might attack Yin Sudie if she did not desist.

"What is it?" Yin Sudie looked innocently toward Daiyuan, while the irresistible charm she gave off surged all the more violently at Yang Kai.

At that moment Yang Kai exhaled two hot breaths from his nostrils and, seemingly compelled, rushed forward two paces. Before anyone could stop him, he had inexplicably reached Yin Sudie and, to the astonishment of both women, seized Yin Sudie's jade hands.

A furious bout of groping—hard, brutal, unrestrained.

It was as if he'd grasped the most precious thing in life and refused to let go. His eyes burned with a terrifying ardor and his body temperature rose noticeably.

Yin Sudie stood frozen, and Daiyuan gaped in shock.

The instant Yang Kai surged forward, both Daiyuan and Yin Sudie had wanted to stop him, but neither managed to. By the time they recovered, Yang Kai had already seized Yin Sudie's hands.

Feeling the searing pain in her hands and seeing the madness in the disheveled man's eyes, Yin Sudie was furious and stunned. Saint Yuan thundered through her, but in the next breath she tamped down, her eyes filling with watery sheen as she drew close to Yang Kai and said, "You hurt me…"

"Ah?" Yang Kai was startled and wore an expression of guilt, yet his large hands still gripped Yin Sudie's wrists tightly; no matter how she tried to pull away she couldn't. As he groped, savoring her delicate softness, he shamelessly said, "Not hurt, not hurt. I have time now—how about we go to Hundred Butterflies Peak this very moment? Senior Sister isn't terribly occupied here, so there's no need to stay."

“Hehe…” Yin Sudie let out a dry laugh. Though she wished she could slap Yang Kai away, she forcibly suppressed the anger boiling in her chest. The strange light in her eyes flickered ever faster as her gaze bore straight into Yang Kai’s own.

"You invited me to go, didn't you? So what are we waiting for?" Yang Kai even began to hurry her along, as if impatient to leave with her.

Seeing that, Yin Sudie's face changed several times; she would no longer delay. With a jolt of Saint Yuan she snapped Yang Kai's hold aside and, spinning like a whorl, had already landed several zhang away. Her two small hands were hidden inside her sleeves so their condition couldn't be seen, but after Yang Kai's rough handling they surely didn't feel pleasant.

She stared coldly at Yang Kai, who still seemed intoxicated by her charm, her expression volatile.

But a figure flashed and Daiyuan stepped in front of Yang Kai, saying coldly, "Junior Sister, please return."

Yin Sudie ground her teeth, drew a deep breath, and her chest heaved exaggeratedly, outlining sensual curves. She snorted, "Senior Sister, don't forget to pay Master your respects—she's been thinking about you. Little Sister takes her leave."

After speaking she narrowed her phoenix-like eyes and cast one last cold glance at Yang Kai, as if imprinting him on her soul. Then with a stomp she activated a Star Shuttle and departed swiftly.

It was not until she was ten li from Qianhuan Peak that she slipped her hands out from her sleeves to glance at them, and her face drained of color in anger.

Her once-flawless jade hands were now covered with large bruises! She had no idea where that filthy man had gotten so much brute force, nor did he know how to cherish beauty—he had used such force when groping. This time her attempt to steal a chicken backfired and she lost the rice; Yin Sudie was furious and swore to make Yang Kai pay.

On the stone platform of Qianhuan Peak the three stood there; Yang Yan and Daiyuan watched Yang Kai's retreating back, while Yang Kai stared in the direction Yin Sudie had vanished, a look of regret on his face.

After a while Yang Kai sighed softly, slowly shook his head and turned. Seeing the two women staring at him he asked in surprise, "What is it? Do I have something on my face?"

"You weren't affected by her charm?" If Daiyuan still couldn't see what had happened, she would have wasted her years—Yang Kai's demeanor no longer carried the earlier shame; his eyes were clear as a bell.

"Charm technique?" Yang Kai's mouth curved into a cold smile. "She cast it on the wrong person."

Daiyuan's eyes were complex as she shook her head with an incredulous smile. "You're bold—taking advantage of her while she tried to attack you. If she'd seen through it on the spot she certainly wouldn't have let you off so easily."

"But she didn't see through it, did she?" Yang Kai chuckled softly.

"Thank you!" Daiyuan suddenly showed a look of gratitude and offered sincere thanks. She knew that if Yang Kai hadn't been unable to stand Yin Sudie's bullying, he wouldn't have done what he did.

Yang Kai waved a hand and snorted lightly, "No need. She struck at me first—I only fought back."

Yang Kai had no interest in meddling in Senior Sister–Junior Sister grudges; his trip here was mainly for the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, and helping Daiyuan was just a pretext. But Yin Sudie had recklessly tried her charm on him—if this weren't Liuli Gate, Yang Kai wouldn't have merely groped her a few times and let her go.
