## Chapter 1262 — Divine Tree Awakens

Over the past six months the Artifact Spirit and the Stone Puppet brawled more than a dozen times, nearly every match ending in a draw. Yang Kai naturally couldn't be bothered to manage them and never intervened in their disputes. In the end, the two little things even developed a mutual respect of sorts, sometimes huddling together as if exchanging secrets, wearing a very mysterious air.

During these six months, besides consolidating his own Second Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation and refining the artifact furnace, Yang Kai also slightly refined the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl. Now these two heaven-defying materials were both stored in the refining furnace, and the furnace was stored inside Yang Kai's body. As a result, even if he didn't deliberately refine them, the Artifact Spirit could still use the Saint Yuan within Yang Kai's body to activate the furnace's effect, and together with Yang Kai's pure spiritual qi it kept continuously refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl.

Those two things truly were materials from a true dragon; after two full months of refining the Artifact Spirit still saw little change. They were only a little tainted by Yang Kai's aura and could not be used by him. It seemed impossible to fully refine them in less than three or five years unless Yang Kai specially devoted time to force the furnace's power, which might accelerate the process.

Yang Kai wasn't in a hurry; he took the opportunity to study the Demon Blood Threads secret technique that Demon Blood Sect disciple Deng Ning had given him.

Originally he wanted that secret technique only as an excuse to deal with Ye Yangrong and to keep Deng Ning from betraying him; he didn't take the technique to heart. But during the month he spent returning to Dragon Lair Mountain, he found the Demon Blood Threads method extraordinarily strange and, moreover, perfectly suited to his cultivation.

This surprised Yang Kai immensely.

The Demon Blood Sect was an utterly evil force, at odds with many factions on Dark Star, and internally it suffered minor upheavals every five years and major ones every ten. The reason it hadn't been exterminated owed largely to the Demon Blood Threads technique. The Guest Elders and protectors within the Demon Blood Sect all practiced this technique; when used in a fight it behaved so bizarrely that enemies could not defend against it, so most people avoided provoking them. As long as the Demon Blood Sect didn't commit crimes that aroused the world's wrath, there was little threat of extermination.

To cultivate this technique one had to use one's own Essence-Blood as the foundation.

Every warrior's Essence-Blood was extremely precious; once used, a practitioner's Yuan Qi would suffer heavy damage. Using even a single drop of Essence-Blood could force a cultivator to recuperate for months at the shortest and years at the longest. Within the Demon Blood Sect there was another set of secret arts that complemented the Demon Blood Threads, allowing disciples to use Essence-Blood as the foundation for cultivation without suffering overly severe harm.

Once cultivation succeeded and the method was turned against foes, combat strength would soar. Because it was refined from one's own Essence-Blood, it was far more handy than any secret treasure; Demon Blood Threads were thus called the secret treasure that was not a secret treasure.

Essence-Blood was likewise precious to Yang Kai, and he would not waste it lightly. But Golden Blood he possessed in countless drops, and the vast vitality and surging qi-and-blood contained within Golden Blood made it an unimaginable source of power—practically the perfect foundation for cultivating the Demon Blood Threads.

When Yang Kai first discovered this, he couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. Before that, however, he had long been weighing the pros and cons of cultivating the Demon Blood Threads secret technique — it was only some time ago that he finally decided to begin.

With this technique the more Essence-Blood one invested, the more Demon Blood Threads one produced, and the greater their eventual power would be.

It was practically a secret art tailor-made for Yang Kai! There was no way he would pass it up.

In combat he usually relied on the Nine Heavens Divine Technique and his own mastery over Saint Yuan, but those lacked variety; if he could cultivate the Demon Blood Threads, many of those shortcomings would be patched.

Another huge advantage was that his cultivated threads would be stronger than those of ordinary Demon Blood Sect disciples, because the technique's foundation was Essence-Blood—the stronger the Essence-Blood, the more terrifying the Demon Blood Threads would become.

During this half-year seclusion he spent most of his time cultivating the Demon Blood Threads, and now some preliminary results had already appeared.

Inside the Stone Mansion, at a thought from Yang Kai, a barely perceptible golden gleam appeared at his fingertip. That gleam stretched like a thread several zhang long, drifting back and forth under the control of Yang Kai's divine sense, lively and nimble. It emitted a hissing, space-tearing sound, as if it could slice through the void—just like holding an invisible golden whip.

Yang Kai tested the might of the Demon Blood Threads and felt fairly satisfied; after all, this was something cultivated from a single drop of Golden Blood, and it already possessed such potency before being fully formed. If it were perfected, its power would surely increase considerably.

That was only a single thread; if he cultivated dozens, Yang Kai could hardly imagine how much trouble they would cause enemies.

The predecessor who devised the Demon Blood Threads was indeed a celestial genius, conceiving of using Essence-Blood to cultivate this secret treasure that was not a secret treasure. He probably never expected someone like Yang Kai—who could expend countless drops of Golden Blood—to appear in the world; given time, Yang Kai would surely expand and glorify the method the predecessor created.

However… this thing could no longer rightly be called Demon Blood Threads; calling them Golden Blood Threads felt far more appropriate.

Yang Kai grinned and drew the Golden Blood thread back into his body, continuing his cultivation.

During this period he also expended Ethereal Crystals, drawing upon their energy to strengthen his spatial power.

Another three months passed. Yang Kai still showed no sign of emerging from seclusion, but Dragon Lair Mountain had nothing requiring his presence, so everything remained safe and sound.

One day, while cultivating Golden Blood threads, Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed; he opened his eyes with a rush of delight, then closed them again and slipped his mind into the Black Book Space, manifesting his spirit body.

When he saw the sight before him, the words he had been about to speak were swallowed back down; he stared dumbfounded at a large tree ahead, suffused with intense yang energy.

That tree was the Divine Tree he had placed into the Black Book Space many years ago.

The last time it had swallowed two drops of his Golden Blood it had fallen into an evolutionary slumber. Now, after two or three years, it had awakened. Because he had perceived its summons, Yang Kai manifested his spirit body into the Black Book Space.

Its appearance after evolution was somewhat strange. Yang Kai remembered that before evolving it had been a towering tree, its branches and leaves luxuriant, each leaf and branch full of concentrated yang attribute energy.

But now, after its evolution, it had actually shrunk by severalfold — standing only seven or eight zhang tall. Yet at this moment, its leaves and branches had clearly changed: its entire body seemed cast from pure gold, shining brilliantly and dazzling to the eye. Among the branches, a few unripe fruits the size of longans had begun to form. Once mature, these fruits would be great nourishment for someone like Yang Kai — though for now, they had only just begun to take shape.

What astonished Yang Kai more than these changes was that a face had appeared at the center of its trunk.

The face was peculiar—eyes, nose, mouth, but no eyebrows—and because it was so large it appeared somewhat distorted, resembling the wrinkled visage of a very old man.

On either side of the trunk two arm-like branches had grown, their branchlets splaying like fingers.

Those two arms and the palms were enormous and clearly formidable at a glance.

The tree's rootstock had likewise turned into many tendrils, supporting its massive body like countless legs. When Yang Kai entered, the Divine Tree seemed to be adapting to its changes; its tendrils shifted and it slowly walked within the Black Book Space.

When it sensed Yang Kai's arrival it immediately lifted two huge eyes to look at him, and as if smiling at him, it stood motionless.

"You…" Yang Kai gazed at it in astonishment, for a moment at a loss for words.

"No need…" To Yang Kai's greater surprise, the Divine Tree actually spoke human words. Its voice was deep and rough, as if it were speaking for the first time and still a little unaccustomed.

Previously the Divine Tree had always communicated with him through divine sense; this was the first time Yang Kai had heard it speak aloud, and his eyes widened in disbelief.

After a long pause the Divine Tree continued: "Although I do not fully understand why I became like this after evolving, I can sense that it is for the better. It seems your Golden Blood aided me greatly. I am not the same as before."

Hearing this, Yang Kai relaxed considerably and asked with concern, "Is there anything amiss?"

"No, not at all. I feel marvelous." The Divine Tree's speech gradually grew clearer as if, after speaking a few times, it had mastered how to use this manner of communication. As it spoke it slowly began to walk through the Black Book Space. "If there is anything wrong, it is that this place is no longer suitable for me. It is oppressive and does not help my growth."

Yang Kai paused and instantly understood what it meant.

Before the Divine Tree evolved it was merely a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object that had awakened some intelligence, so keeping it within the Black Book Space had posed no problems. Now that it had become a strange living being, however, remaining in the Black Book Space for long would be inappropriate; it could not receive the external laws of heaven and earth, and in time it might wither and die. If that happened, Yang Kai would be held responsible.
