## Chapter 1036 — Make Plans Early

The three of them did not linger on the second floor.

They continued up to the third floor before the attendant stopped; he smiled and said, "Please browse at your leisure, guest—if any item catches your eye, just tell me."

Yang Kai nodded and began moving from counter to counter on the third floor.

The finished Star Shuttles came in varying lengths and sizes, and even their shapes were no longer uniform; it seemed that to satisfy different customers' needs, the refiners here had deliberately forged Star Shuttles into different forms, though this did not affect a Star Shuttle's performance.

The cultivators who came to the third floor to purchase Star Shuttles clearly differed in strength; those lingering at the counters all possessed cultivation in the Saint Realm or Saint King Realm and carried commensurate status and power.

Yet no matter how powerful, they all behaved honestly and properly.

In any shop of the Hengluo Commerce Guild no one dared act rashly—this was the guild's main star, its foundation, and the guild would not permit anyone to interfere with its business.

Yang Kai walked and looked, searching only for Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttles; when he found one he liked he had the attendant take it out so he could feel it.

Xue Tong trailed behind him; seeing that he had been searching a long time without finding a suitable one, he couldn't help but say, "If you're willing to wait, we can have a refiner custom-make one for you."

"How long would that take?" Yang Kai asked, turning to inquire.

"Even with Young Master Shen Tu's connections, it will still take a month or two," came the answer.

Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. “Forget it—no need to make things so troublesome. I’ll have to replace this thing once my strength improves anyway. For now, I’ll just make do with something temporary!”

As he spoke, his gaze suddenly fixed on a smoothly shaped, fish-like Star Shuttle in the counter; he told the attendant, "Take that one out for me."

The attendant complied and brought it out.

Yang Kai gripped the Star Shuttle and tried to channel his power through it; he couldn't help but brighten at the sensation.

His Saint Yuan flowed through the Star Shuttle unobstructed, performing better than the several he had tried before.

When refining Star Shuttles the materials added by each refiner could differ, and the engraved spirit formations might not be identical, so each Star Shuttle developed its own characteristics; whether it could perfectly fuse with a cultivator's power became the test of its usefulness.

The one in Yang Kai's hand was undoubtedly very well suited to the power within him.

Deciding not to continue searching, Yang Kai nodded: "This one then. How much does it cost?"

The attendant, upon hearing this, glanced at Xue Tong.

Xue Tong said, "Just charge the normal price."

"Yes." The attendant nodded and said, "A Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle typically costs ten thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, with some price fluctuation; the one you have is the best on the third floor. It's worth twelve thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals!"

"Twelve thousand…" Yang Kai frowned; he suddenly realized he did not fully understand the value of Saint Crystals here and had no clear sense of what twelve thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals represented.

He turned his gaze to Xue Tong.

Xue Tong smiled and told the attendant, "Put it on Young Master Shen Tu's tab; we'll go to the manor another day and have the Young Master settle it."

"Very well!"

"No need, I have Saint Crystals," Yang Kai said. "I'll pay myself."

Yang Kai indeed had a fair number of Saint Crystals—these had originally been taken from Purple Star and cultivators of the Sword Alliance on the Floating Continent; he had swept them up, and their quantity was considerable, more than enough to pay for this Star Shuttle.

Thus he did not want to owe Shen Tu a favor.

The attendant looked somewhat embarrassed at Xue Tong; Xue Tong's eyes flickered but he said nothing more—only gave a slight nod.

The attendant then breathed a sigh of relief and smiled: "Please follow me."

They went down to the first floor. Yang Kai repeatedly took Saint Crystals from the Demon God's Secret Codex; after a while he settled the bill, and the attendant respectfully escorted him and Xue Tong to the door.

After leaving the shop, Xue Tong led Yang Kai to several other stores, lavishly purchasing rare ores.

On Shuiyue Star, you could buy anything as long as you had the price—even a warship, a super-large Secret Treasure, could be obtained.

The warships produced by the Hengluo Commerce Guild were the best quality and fastest in the entire Star Domain, so many forces were willing to order warships from Shuiyue Star.

Yang Kai had no thoughts of such things for the time being; he also knew he could not afford the price of a warship.

He did not comprehend the true value of Saint Crystals nor had a refined sense of worth; he simply followed Xue Tong and lavishly collected ores, selecting only Saint King-Grade materials, spending his Saint Crystals until only a few hundred remained before he stopped.

Inside the Demon God's Secret Codex a large pile of rare minerals—hard to come by outside—was added and placed beside the two Jet-Black Spheres, letting them draw out the essence from the ores.

Because Yang Kai had not made Shen Tu spend on his behalf due to his guest status, Xue Tong's attitude toward him grew increasingly kind; he felt this youth had principles and had not befriended Shen Tu in order to climb to higher circles.

After the shopping was finished, Xue Tong treated Yang Kai to a raucous drinking session at the most luxurious wine house in the city.

It was not until the next day that the two set off to return.

Xue Tong's speed was extremely fast, and his Star Shuttle was of high grade.

After about two hours the two returned to Shen Tu's manor; Xue Tong apologized and then departed.

Yang Kai walked alone into the manor, where Jia Long stood at the entrance; seeing Yang Kai return, he smiled and asked, "Young Brother, did you get what you wanted?"

"Yes. Shuiyue Star's cities are rich and well supplied—everything one could want. It didn't disappoint."

Jia Long laughed heartily: "Throughout the Star Domain, if there's something you can't buy on Shuiyue Star, you won't find it anywhere else."

Pride colored his words.

"Has Shen Tu returned?" Yang Kai inquired.

"No." Jia Long shook his head. "Don't worry—though the guild leader is somewhat severe, he treats Young Master Shen Tu well; this summons was likely just a reprimand. Before the Young Master left he told you to remain here—if anything arises, tell us and we'll handle it."

"Understood. I intend to seclude myself for a while—do not let anyone disturb me; I'll inform you when I emerge."

"Very well!" Jia Long bowed slightly.

Yang Kai returned to his quarters, closed the door, took out the Star Shuttle worth twelve thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, held it in his palm, channeled his internal power, and began to refine it.

Any Secret Treasure must be refined and harmonized with a cultivator before it can unleash its true power.

When Yang Kai was on Tongxuan Continent it had taken him several months to refine a Star Shuttle, but at that time his strength was low; that Star Shuttle was Saint-Grade Upper-Level, which explained the lengthy process.

But now it was different—the new Star Shuttle had been carefully chosen by Yang Kai, its attribute matched his Saint Yuan perfectly, and Yang Kai himself had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, so fully refining it would not take long.

As he exerted his power, a layer of pitch-black demonic flame flared on the Star Shuttle; the flame was sometimes cold, sometimes hot, emitting two utterly opposite yet eerily coexisting properties; its tongues of fire writhed unpredictably like fanged serpents, horrifying to behold.

In an instant Yang Kai felt a tenuous bond form between the Star Shuttle and himself; his Divine Sense began to flow through the Star Shuttle, probing its internal structure and the Star Chart imprinted within.

He forgot the passage of time, devoting himself entirely to refining the Star Shuttle.

The entire process went unexpectedly smoothly. He refined it into his body, engraved his Soul Imprint upon the Star Shuttle, and infused it with his life aura, allowing it to merge with him in perfect harmony.

There were no obstacles at all.

By the time Yang Kai had completely refined the Star Shuttle he estimated it had taken no more than a month.

He could not help but feel exhilarated—he knew this was the clearest proof of his realm and power having risen.

He did not choose to end his seclusion but remained in the room, letting his Saint Yuan nurture the Star Shuttle while he probed and studied the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness.

Time flowed; days passed and moons rose.

Yang Kai had been here for a while; during these days he had stayed inside the manor, not stepping outside except for that one time with Xue Tong to buy items—he had not left his room nor spoken to outsiders.

Stillness bred restlessness, and he suddenly wanted to go out to see and learn—to take in the whole of Shuiyue Star, to see how this prosperous star differed from Tongxuan Continent, and to get familiar with his new Star Shuttle's performance.

Ideally, by observing the Star Domain's conditions he could gain deeper insight, allowing him to make plans for himself sooner.

He still had no clear objective.

With that thought, he left his room.

Outside he found Jia Long and, upon learning Shen Tu still had not returned, told him of his intentions.

Jia Long did not stop him; he only handed him a token and said it was a Hengluo Commerce Guild token that granted privileges in many places and could save him many hassles.

Yang Kai placed the token into the Demon God's Secret Codex and then sent his Star Shuttle racing outward.

He had no specific destination; he simply sped along at will.

A Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle was indeed different—several times superior to the previous one; just in terms of speed when pushed to the limit, the two could not compare.

He flew along, stopping and going, gradually gaining a comprehensive understanding of Shuiyue Star.

This was a star and also a continent, not much different from Tongxuan Continent: mountains, waters, land, and seas—various races lived together.

The difference was that any cultivational star within the Star Domain stored Heaven-and-Earth Energy far richer than Tongxuan Continent.

As the Hengluo Commerce Guild's main star, this was especially true; although the Spiritual Qi here did not match that of the Floating Continent, it still ranked relatively high among the many cultivational stars in the Star Domain.
