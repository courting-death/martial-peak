## Chapter 1244 — Pulling the Fire from Under the Cauldron

The Yuan Control Art was impressive, but it placed a tremendous burden on Divine Sense; not every warrior could comprehend or wield it. Only those whose Divine Sense was far stronger than ordinary cultivators could possibly penetrate such a strange method.

The Heaven-Slaying Spear’s transformation clearly startled the fire bird. When it saw the cold flames spat by that pitch-black Jiao able to withstand its own waves of fire, it flew into a rage. Its wings unfurled and a sudden gale rose; clusters of ghostly little flames burst from its wings, bypassing the Jiao and the fire dragon and rushing straight toward where Yang Kai stood.

Wind-and-thunder power surged behind Yang Kai, and a pair of delicate, translucent wings drifted into being, flashing with the wind’s agility and the thunder’s ferocity. His figure flickered and vanished from the spot, letting those clusters of flames strike empty air.

Before the fire bird could launch another attack, Yang Kai had already swept out a dozen Space Blades!

Intending a quick finish, Yang Kai had no desire to dally; he immediately used his trump card.

The Space Blades that could almost devour anything shot forth at high speed. A trace of fearful alarm flickered in the fire bird’s humanlike eyes — last time it had suffered a little under the Space Blade and knew how strange and fierce such things could be — so it dared not linger. Its wings fluttered and it became a streak of fire, darting aside. Before it could fully take shape again, Yang Kai closed in, opened his hand, and snatched viciously at it.

Now shielded by the Cold Flames, Yang Kai didn't fear the artifact spirit’s heat; after all, an artifact spirit itself had been born from the earthfire that burned for tens of thousands of years, and Yang Kai was no stranger to enduring its torments.

The artifact spirit reacted with incredible speed. The instant it sensed danger, a feeling of coagulation rippled outward. Yang Kai’s large hand froze in place about half a chi away from it, unable to advance an inch.

It was that kind of Shi-like force again, but this was not a cultivator’s Shi — it was the artifact spirit’s innate mastery of laws of fire.

Crack, crack...

Explosive pops sounded through the air, and the fire-type Spiritual Qi pervading the stone chamber instantly rose several grades. Yang Kai had to activate his Saint Yuan and push the Cold Flame’s power to the limit; an ice-cold aura spread from his body. In a moment he shattered the artifact spirit’s law-based restraint and regained his freedom.

The last time he’d been bound by the artifact spirit’s law he had to rely on spatial force to sever it, but this time merely invoking the Cold Flame sufficed. The reason was simple: the Cold Flame was antagonistic to that law.

Grinning, Yang Kai flicked his wrist and, while the spirit’s form had not fully manifested, a rain of pitch-black spears pounded toward the artifact spirit.

The artifact spirit’s body had only just fully revealed itself when several spears pierced through it. Sharp cries rang out. The two little eyes instantly filled with fury and fear; it could not fathom how, in barely over a month since it had last been charged and routed, that same defeated weakling had somehow grown to have the qualification to contend with it.

The artifact spirit lacked a physical body; even pierced by the Heaven-Slaying Spear it would not truly die. Yet the spear’s contained chill made it deeply uncomfortable. Its shifting body writhed for a long while before returning to normal.

Yang Kai’s move thoroughly enraged the artifact spirit. Its form convulsed and the pure strands of fiery Spiritual Qi that made up its feathers coalesced into shafts of red light that surged toward Yang Kai like a covering.

Yang Kai’s easy expression snapped stern. Sensing the terrible killing intent bound up in those fiery feathers, he didn't hesitate: he condensed a Vast Heaven Shield for protection while simultaneously unleashing the Hundred Mountains Painting — a dozen mountain peaks surged toward the attack.

With a thunderous roar, the Vast Heaven Shield shattered under the onslaught, and the mountain phantoms from the Hundred Mountains Painting likewise suffered grievous damage; their illusions flickered and vanished. Yang Kai hastily withdrew the painting and, driven by his Wind-and-Thunder Wings, darted aside.

The chamber shook as if mountains were collapsing, and the surrounding seals activated once more to prevent the cave from being destroyed. Even so, it seemed two layers of the seals had been broken by the fire feathers.

After launching the feathers, the artifact spirit’s body suddenly shrank a size and looked somewhat exhausted.

Those feathers were clearly not ordinary attacks; they were likely closely related to its very existence.

Moreover, when a feather missed it did not dissipate; instead it changed direction and became a dense string of red light that pursued Yang Kai, intent on giving no quarter.

Seeing he could not dodge, Yang Kai’s face flashed cold. He held his ground and stared calmly at the incoming feathers.

Only when they were about three zhang away did Yang Kai suddenly thrust both hands out as if to tear something apart, violently pulling them apart to the left and right.

A rift in space about one zhang long was torn open by him in an instant, like a beast’s gaping maw, facing the flying barrage of feathers.

Seeing this, the artifact spirit cried out; the returning feathers proved alarmingly nimble and turned direction in a flash, hastening back to where the artifact spirit remained.

It seemed to understand that it could not allow its feathers to enter the space rift — once inside, they might never be retrieved. In the blink of an eye the feathers returned to the artifact spirit’s body, and its previously shrunken form swelled back to its original size.

But a figure flickered by its side — Yang Kai had already appeared like a specter. A huge black hand slowly reached out; above the stone chamber a gigantic ebony palm suddenly manifested, as if to blot out the sky.

Heaven-Covering Palm!

The artifact spirit truly had nowhere to hide. It could only drive forth waves of heat from within; its small eyes stared heavily at the descending massive palm, attempting to withstand the blow by force.

In an instant of thunder and lightning, the Heaven-Covering Palm struck the artifact spirit.

With a roar, the coldest and the hottest forces collided and surged through the chamber like an avalanche at sea, their momentum astonishing. The fire waves and the pitch-black Jiao that had been contesting nearby were struck by the impact and dissolved into luminous particles, disappearing.

When the tumult settled, the artifact spirit floated a little askew in midair while Yang Kai stood several dozen zhang away, coldly regarding it.

The artifact spirit appeared not too badly wounded, but the red light on its body was noticeably dimmer than before; it had clearly suffered losses under Yang Kai’s successive measures.

“I don’t know how much of your intelligence has awakened, or whether you can understand my words. If you’re willing to surrender, I’ll spare you. If not, I’ll have to go hard on you — you’ll suffer, and perhaps your Yuan Qi will be grievously harmed!” Yang Kai said coldly as he stared at it.

This artifact spirit did indeed possess great sentience, but Yang Kai could not be certain it understood his language; after all, it had spent tens of thousands of years inside a refining furnace and might never have met other living beings.

What surprised Yang Kai was that, after he finished speaking, the creature’s little eyes immediately flashed with fury.

It could actually understand!

At the next moment it emitted an angry shriek and the refining furnace that had quietly rested in the chamber’s center began to hum. The furnace suddenly glowed red-hot and jets of flame shot out from its belly, all streaming into the fire bird’s body.

The artifact spirit, which had been somewhat wounded, was suddenly enlivened by the furnace that gave birth to it. Its body swelled mightily; it circled above Yang Kai with wings unfurled, blotting out much of the cave’s ceiling.

Throughout this the only thing Yang Kai did was watch; he made no move to stop it. Instead, a trace of derision crept into his eyes.

After all, an artifact spirit was still an artifact spirit. Though its intelligence had awakened, it lacked combat experience compared to him.

He had been waiting for this moment.

From the last skirmish with the artifact spirit, Yang Kai already knew the refining furnace was no ordinary object. With it the artifact spirit could draw great replenishment, but there had to be limits; it could not replenish endlessly.

That was why Yang Kai had been so forceful at the start, forcing the artifact spirit to use the reserve heat of the furnace. If it refused to draw on the furnace’s searing fire, Yang Kai could not have executed his next plan.

By now the refining furnace likely had little fire-type Spiritual Qi left, Yang Kai thought, his peripheral vision darkly watching the Void King-Grade giant furnace.

After its body swelled to immense size, the artifact spirit once again assumed an arrogant, triumphant expression, its little eyes full of contempt.

But before it could strut, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and he vanished. When he reappeared, he was already beside the furnace.

Immediately, to the artifact spirit’s horror, a burst of Demonic Flame surged from his palm and slammed down on the refining furnace.

In an instant the furnace was engulfed by the Demonic Flame as Yang Kai fiercely drove his Saint Yuan, pouring it in without cease.

The ice-cold Cold Flame exerted its power to the utmost; in the space of a blink the giant furnace’s surface began to ice over — black ice forming and spreading inward.

The lofty artifact spirit was grievously wounded; gleams of cold light appeared across its crimson, massive body, which trembled violently.

Only then did it realize what Yang Kai intended.

The refining furnace was the vessel that birthed it; it was the artifact spirit of that furnace. If the furnace were damaged or attacked, the artifact spirit could not remain unharmed.

In truth, Yang Kai did not need to engage it head-on; he only had to deal with that lifeless furnace. That was the sadness of being an artifact spirit: possessing tremendous power but unable to make full use of it.

The artifact spirit’s body twisted and shifted violently. Yang Kai’s actions had enraged it to the extreme, but the cold spreading from within the furnace terrified it beyond measure.

No longer daring to hesitate, it opened its mouth and unleashed a torrent of heat toward Yang Kai. It did not expect to kill him, only to drive him away from its vessel so he could no longer assault the refining furnace.
