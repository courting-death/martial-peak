## Chapter 1264 — Exiting Seclusion

Inside the stone chamber, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged where he had been, his face flickering with uneasy expressions; his open eyes seemed hollow, lifeless, yet a torrent of qi churned within him, whipping the air into a savage gale with terrifying momentum.

Not far off, a hole in the ground showed the head of a stone puppet poking out to peer this way; its simple, adorable face wore an expression of perplexed suspicion — it could not understand what had happened to Yang Kai — while the artifact spirit had long since slipped into Yang Kai's body and vanished from sight.

When the stone puppet saw Yang Kai's two eyes, it suddenly appeared frightened; it drew its body in and, using hands and feet, slipped back into the hole and in an instant fled dozens of zhang away.

If anyone stood before Yang Kai now and looked into his eyes, they would discover that within their depths a faint flow of seven‑colored radiance shimmered; observe more closely, and one would see that the seven‑colored light refracted from a bud of a lotus about to bloom, as if two seven‑colored flower buds had sprouted in the depths of his eyes.

Yang Kai still sat motionless, time slipping by, while the seven‑colored radiance pouring from his hollow eyes grew steadily stronger and far more intense.

Gradually, above Yang Kai's head a virtual image of a lotus bud also appeared, the lotus shrouded entirely in seven hues, exquisitely beautiful, whirling round and round, and a startling surge of Divine Sense energy thundered outward in all directions.

That apparition expanded as Yang Kai's Divine Sense spread; petal by petal of different colors unfurled outward, like a bashful maiden slowly shedding her garments, revealing her alluring forms.

The entire process was exceedingly slow, and Yang Kai himself remained completely unaware. His Spirit Body was immersed within his Sea of Consciousness, quietly perceiving the myriad subtleties and profound mysteries emanating from the Warm Spirit Lotus as it prepared to bloom.

No one knew how long passed; when the seven‑colored lotus apparition finally bloomed, it had somehow swelled to immense proportions, its projection nearly filling the whole stone chamber, and then, all at once, the lotus image shattered into motes of luminous light — like a sky full of fireflies — which, drawn by some force, surged toward Yang Kai and plunged into his body until they vanished.

Yang Kai's body trembled; his hollow eyes instantly cleared, his expression bizarre to the extreme, and he sat there utterly still, lost in thought.

Since the Soul‑Devouring worms completed their evolution half a month ago, he'd tested their post‑evolution power and been greatly pleased; then the Warm Spirit Lotus unexpectedly completed its evolution as well, finally taking on its ultimate seven‑colored form.

What Yang Kai had not expected was that this evolution of the Warm Spirit Lotus would lead him to comprehend a wondrous Soul Technique!

Although the Warm Spirit Lotus is a treasure of heaven and earth that nourishes the soul, according to the records Yang Kai had read it wasn't supposed to grant the ability to comprehend a Soul Technique. He had no time then to ponder; he immediately submerged himself in the understanding of that Soul Technique.

Now that the Warm Spirit Lotus had finished evolving and he had thoroughly grasped the Soul Technique, he finally had time to consider the reason behind it.

If the credit did not belong to the Warm Spirit Lotus, then it was highly likely that the colorless crystal was involved. Yang Kai had inadvertently acquired that colorless crystal from the pool of Soul Cleansing Divine Water; after the Warm Spirit Lotus devoured it, the lotus began evolving. The colorless crystal had since disappeared, and the Warm Spirit Lotus had successfully become seven‑colored.

Yang Kai surmised that the Soul Technique he had comprehended was probably related to that colorless crystal — perhaps some profound secret lay within it that allowed him, by chance, to understand this divine art.

Though untested, Yang Kai knew this Soul Technique was extraordinary; calling it his trump card would not be an exaggeration.

Fortunes had come in quick succession — first the Divine Tree awakened from slumber, then the Soul‑Devouring worms completed their evolution, and now the Warm Spirit Lotus had become seven‑colored; it seemed all the good omens had fallen upon Yang Kai at once.

He had recently worried over how to house the newly evolved Soul‑Devouring worms, but that problem had now been solved.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai waved his hand and a gray, fog‑like mass floated into his palm; the mist writhed and shifted, looking extremely strange.

Though inconspicuous at first glance, a careful look would reveal that the gray mist was in fact a cloud of tiny worms barely visible to the naked eye.

The Soul‑Devouring worms were originally unseen by the naked eye, but after evolving and gathering they formed this gray mist. Each worm's killing power had been greatly enhanced; Yang Kai estimated they could now slay ordinary Saint King Realm warriors with ease, and even if they infected an Origin Returning Realm practitioner, it would not be easy to purge them quickly.

Yang Kai was completely unconcerned; he cast out his Divine Sense, wrapped the gray mist, and enclosed them within his Sea of Consciousness.

The worms, familiar with the place, made straight for the island formed by the seven‑colored Warm Spirit Lotus and soon settled there.

After such a long seclusion, Yang Kai had done all he needed to do.

He had refined the artifact furnace, refined the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, refined the Flowing Flame Fireblazes, strengthened the power of his Divine Sense Fire, and studied the Demon Blood Threads secret art...

The Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl were things Yang Kai could not yet make use of — he could only let time temper them until they truly became his own. As for the Golden Blood Thread technique, derived from the Demon Blood Sect’s secret art of Demon Blood Threads, he had cultivated only a single strand so far. Though he had yet to use it in combat, Yang Kai already knew its power was extraordinary. These threads, refined from his own Golden Blood and akin to Secret Treasures, fit his will more naturally than any weapon ever could.

Of the eight Flowing Flame Fireblazes, he had used six; as he had suspected, the Fireblazes could induce a mutation in a warrior's Divine Sense and indeed strengthen the power of his Divine Sense Fire.

However, after fusing the fifth Fireblaze the enhancement became less noticeable, so Yang Kai left two in reserve; they might have other uses later.

Though his realm had not advanced much after more than a year's seclusion, his combat strength had indisputably risen a tier — the Golden Blood technique and the newly comprehended Soul Technique would have to wait for future opportunities to prove their might.

It was time to emerge from seclusion; cultivation done in isolation was not everything. Those who only practiced in solitude might rise in realm quickly, but their combat power often failed to match their realm. Having fought his way up from the start, Yang Kai understood this truth intimately.

Besides, he couldn't stay secluded forever — someone had come to Dragon Lair Mountain a month ago and was waiting for him. He'd been unable to go out because the Warm Spirit Lotus was about to finish evolving and he had to comprehend the Soul Technique.

Thinking of that person made Yang Kai frown; he wondered what she wanted of him. Given their relationship, her concern seemed oddly intense.

With that in mind, Yang Kai stepped out of the stone chamber.

Moments later, he appeared outside; his Divine Sense flared, quickly locating Yang Yan, Wu Yi and the others. After sending them a message, he headed straight for a nearby pavilion.

A short time later, as Yang Kai sat in the pavilion sipping the spiritual tea Yang Yan and the others had somehow gathered, two graceful figures slipped in — Yang Yan in a black robe and Wu Yi in a verdant palace dress.

Both women smiled as if some happy event had occurred; seeing Yang Kai they hurried over with small, eager steps.

"You're finally out of seclusion," Yang Yan said, eyes appraising Yang Kai; noticing he showed no obvious increase in realm, she couldn't help but be puzzled.

"What's happened that has you so delighted?" Yang Kai sipped his tea and asked.

Wu Yi’s face blossomed into a bright smile as she continued, “Isn’t it because our Dragon Lair Mountain’s reputation keeps growing? Many cultivators without the protection of a Sect or family now wish to join us. In the past, there weren’t that many people coming here, but over the past few months, we’ve had ten to twenty visitors every single day — once, even thirty in one day! Among them were even Origin Returning Realm experts. Sister Yang Yan and I have been discussing whether we should establish a small Sect of our own.”

"A small sect?" Yang Kai shot her a sharp look. "You two think too simply. We have no great masters here; what sect could we found? Besides, we can remain here untroubled only because Qian Tong watches over us. If one day Qian Tong loses power or falls in some dispute, do you think Yingyue Hall will let us expand openly under its nose?"

Hearing this, Wu Yi's smile faded; after a moment's hesitation she said, "Impossible? Elder Qian seems to wield considerable power in Yingyue Hall, second only to the hall master."

"Anything can happen, especially among the great powers. Though things seem stable now, internal upheaval can come suddenly. Those who appear most secure can suffer sudden misfortune. Also, while Qian Tong has been kind to us, I don't want to always rely on his reputation and shelter; it makes one feel inferior. Without a Third Stage Origin Returning Realm expert to garrison here, don't even think about founding a sect."

Wu Yi's brows knit as she considered, then she nodded. "You have a point. I was being too simple."

Yang Kai had considered establishing a sect to pave the way for people from Tongxuan Continent, but certainly not now. That idea had come from Wu Yi; Yang Yan favored forging and formation arrays, not such planning. The Haike Family Wu Yi came from was small and short‑sighted — with Qian Tong's protection they assumed Dragon Lair Mountain would be eternally secure.

"What about those who came — did you refuse them all?" Yang Kai asked, unconvinced.

"Of course we refused. You were in seclusion; we didn't dare decide on our own," Wu Yi nodded.

"Good," Yang Kai stroked his chin and suddenly looked up. "Did Daiyuan from the Liuli Sect say why she wanted to see me?"
