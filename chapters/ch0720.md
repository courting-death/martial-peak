## Chapter 720 — Meeting Elder Li

Zhai Yao had never seen Yang Kai's true face before; it was no surprise that he could not recognize him now.

Yang Kai gave a soft chuckle and offered a greeting.

Hearing the timbre of his voice, Zhai Yao immediately realized and shook his head with a wry smile. "So you never show your true face to others. Very cautious of you."

As he spoke his eyes narrowed; his expression was calm, yet he could not conceal the shock in his gaze as he said in a low voice, "I think Yang brother is quite different from before. Could it be that you've already advanced to the Transcendent Realm?"

His gaze was keen and ruthless; he had instantly seen where the problem lay.

"A lucky break." Yang Kai smiled modestly and did not try to hide it.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu both started at this, and only now did they realize that Yang Kai truly had reached the Transcendent Realm. In their earlier joy over Yang Kai's safe return, neither of them had noticed this fact.

The two of them were also invigorated.

"You brat, give you another ten or twenty years and you might catch up to this Senior Uncle," Cang Yan laughed heartily, slapping Yang Kai on the shoulder with the proud look of someone who believed Tianxiao Sect would continue to prosper.

"Yang brother, you weren't actually in the starry void for a year, were you?" Zhai Yao asked uncertainly; even having seen Yang Kai's exceptionally hardy body, he could not believe the other could have spent so long safely in the starry void.

Yet if it were not so, how else could Yang Kai have broken through an entire great realm?

"Mm, I ran into some trouble out there and only found my way back a few days ago," Yang Kai nodded.

Zhai Yao's face fell in utter dejection; he was rendered speechless.

He had fought tooth and nail in the starry void for three months, and when he could no longer hold on he had escaped via the Void Passage back to the Tongxuan Continent; even so, upon returning his master had praised him greatly for his effort.

Zhai Yao himself felt that such an achievement was enough to be proud of.

But now, compared with Yang Kai, the difference was stark and clear!

"The starry void?" Cang Yan and Fei Yu both stared in astonishment, incredulous. "Did you say the starry void? Could it be you actually went there?"

"Sit and I'll tell you." Yang Kai chuckled.

The mysteries of the starry void were something everyone wanted to know about; Cang Yan and Fei Yu were no exception.

The four took their seats. Yang Kai recounted, one by one, the strange things he had encountered during his time in the starry void. Not only did Cang Yan and Fei Yu listen with rapt interest, but even Zhai Yao, who had also been to the starry void, focused intently, his expression solemn.

Many of the wonders Yang Kai described were things Zhai Yao had never seen.

During his three months in the starry void, Zhai Yao had spent most of his time near that Void Passage, honing his body while staying ready to withdraw at any moment. He had not gallivanted about like Yang Kai, who had run here and there and even met a starry void tempest capable of destroying heaven and earth.

When they heard that the starry void tempest had shattered hundreds or even thousands of meteors in an instant, their faces went pale.

They could hardly imagine how Yang Kai had survived such a calamity; a storm like that would doom even a Saint Realm expert caught within it.

Yet Yang Kai had not only survived, he had come back stronger than before.

Yang Kai did not elaborate on events inside the starry void tempest; he only said he had skirted its edge and suffered some injuries. Matters involving the Great Demon God's bones and the Demon God's Blood were too sensitive for him to reveal lightly.

He took out four drops of the elixir distilled from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower and placed them in a jade vial, handing it to Cang Yan.

Even steady Cang Yan trembled slightly when he received those four drops; his large hand quivered and his expression was full of deep emotion.

With those four drops, the four of their protectors would have a very good chance of advancing to the Saint Realm!

Although only a single Stage separated the Saint Realm from the Transcendent Realm, the gap was vast; the distance between them exceeded even the difference between the Transcendent Realm and the Divine Roaming Realm.

On the Tongxuan Continent there was no shortage of Transcendent Realm experts, but Saint Realm experts were rare; each Saint Realm expert was the backbone of their sect and an exceedingly precious asset.

In a great sect like Tianxiao Sect, there seemed to be only two Saint Realm figures: the founder Chu Lingxiao and another seinor ancestor who had long been in seclusion. Forces like the Leiguang Divine Cult had no Saint Realm experts at all.

"Now that we have the Thousand-Year Demon Flower elixir and our little junior nephew has returned, Cang Yan, we should head back to the sect," Fei Yu said softly; she was eager to return to Qixiu Peak to go into seclusion and challenge the greatest hurdle of her life.

"Indeed." Cang Yan clearly felt the same. "But before that, little junior nephew, you must go and bid farewell to Elder Li. Had he not taken care of things, this would not have gone so smoothly."

"I was going to do that." Yang Kai nodded. Cang Yan need not mention it for he himself intended to speak with Elder Li. After all, among all the alchemists in the world possessing Divine Sense Fire, they were perhaps the only two; Yang Kai felt he could learn much of value from Elder Li.

"My master told me to make sure you came by," Zhai Yao chuckled. "Then let's go. Don't keep Master waiting. You two elders staying or going?"

"We won't go," Cang Yan shook his head. "Send our respects to the revered teacher."

"All right!" Zhai Yao replied, and he and Yang Kai left the inn, heading toward the city lord's mansion.

After a short while they reached the city lord's mansion and, led by Zhai Yao, passed through unimpeded.

They stopped before a side chamber in the mansion's rear courtyard. Zhai Yao respectfully announced, "Master, Brother Yang has arrived."

"Come in." Elder Li's hoarse voice came from inside.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious; he straightened his appearance and followed Zhai Yao into the chamber.

After seeing Yang Kai's true face, Elder Li did not show much surprise, as if he had already suspected; he smiled and motioned for them to sit. "Have a seat."

"Sorry to trouble you, Elder Li." Yang Kai clasped his hands and sat cross-legged before him.

Zhai Yao personally poured tea for the two and handed it over, then sat down beside Yang Kai.

Sipping the fragrant tea, an uneasy stillness settled over the room. Elder Li said nothing, and Yang Kai did not dare to speak first; this man before him was practically revered like a sage by the world's living creatures.

After a long while, Elder Li waved his hand. Yang Kai immediately felt an invisible force wrap the entire side chamber; from within they could observe the outside, but from outside not so much as a whisper could be heard within.

Yang Kai's face grew solemn; he realized that this white-haired elder was not only a top alchemist but also a cultivator of exceedingly high realm.

"I hear from Yao'er that this young brother hails from Tianxiao Sect?" Elder Li asked.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"May I be so bold as to ask whether you have been in Tianxiao Sect since birth, or only joined the discipleship in recent years?" Elder Li suddenly posed a seemingly irrelevant question.

Yang Kai stared in astonishment. "How did you know? I indeed only became a disciple not long ago, roughly a year and a half."

"So it is." Elder Li nodded slightly. "I'll withhold the reason for now and explain it to you later. One more question: do you possess Divine Sense Fire?"

At those words, Zhai Yao's face went pale with shock and he turned to stare at Yang Kai in horror.

Yang Kai gave a light laugh. "Your gaze is like a torch. You must have sensed it when you met me earlier, elder."

"Indeed. Those with Divine Sense Fire can sense one another; the higher the power, the stronger the sense. That's why I noticed. But do not worry: so long as you do not recklessly use your Divine Sense Fire, even a Saint Realm expert will find it difficult to probe you."

"You truly have Divine Sense Fire?" Zhai Yao widened his eyes.

Yang Kai nodded.

"You bastard... you make people green with envy," Zhai Yao said with a bitter smile. He had dreamed of possessing Divine Sense Fire because he had seen his master use it and witnessed the many marvelous effects it provided in alchemy. As an alchemist of superb aptitude, how could he not long for it?

But such a thing was not obtained at will. Divine Sense Fire was a mutation in Divine Sense cultivation and largely depended on chance.

Over the years Elder Li had tried many methods to help Zhai Yao, but Zhai Yao's Divine Sense was as before, showing no change at all.

"What can you do with your Divine Sense Fire now?" Elder Li asked again.

Yang Kai scratched his cheek sheepishly. "Surprise attacks — catching people off guard."

Elder Li laughed heartily, greatly pleased. "Indeed, that is a marvelous use of Divine Sense Fire. A mutated Divine Sense is far more lethal than an ordinary Divine Sense; even stronger opponents, if unprepared, can suffer grievous harm—perhaps even having their souls burned away. That is a grave danger to anyone. However... that is only one use. Do you know the greatest applications of Divine Sense Fire are in alchemy and artifact forging?"

"I had thought of that, but I did not know how to apply it," Yang Kai said solemnly and respectfully. "Please, elder, guide me!"

Elder Li smiled and nodded; Yang Kai's eagerness to learn pleased him.

"The reason I called you here is to teach you in this area. Lower the defenses of your Sea of Consciousness," Elder Li said lightly.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious. He immediately held his breath and flung open the gates of his Sea of Consciousness.

Elder Li's face also grew serious. He slowly extended a middle finger, and a strange energy sparked at its tip, flickering with tiny glows.

That finger lightly touched Yang Kai's forehead. Yang Kai shivered as a pure force, bearing vast information, surged into his mind.

He did not hesitate and immediately began to probe it.

The information was everything Elder Li had researched over the years about Divine Sense Fire—how to use it in alchemy, how to employ Divine Sense Fire reasonably and effectively.

All manner of insights and experiences, each invaluable.

Yang Kai examined them as if hypnotized, and gradually formed his own understanding of how Divine Sense Fire could be applied to alchemy.

It was impossible to fully absorb such a vast trove of knowledge in a short time; after all, these were the conclusions of Elder Li's hundreds of years of experience, yet now he was sharing them with Yang Kai without reservation.

Time passed and the side chamber remained silent. Neither Elder Li nor Zhai Yao spoke to disturb him; all held their breath and waited quietly.
