## Chapter 862 — Living Up to the Trust

The leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan watched Yang Kai’s departing direction with anxious faces; long after he left, they still could not calm themselves.

“Lady Li, we should let the clan know this exhilarating news,” Hua Mo said in a low voice.

“Mm.” Li Rong nodded gently. “It’s time.”

Saying that, she looked at Wu Jie with bright eyes and a gentle smile. “Our lord said your name is Wu Jie, yes?”

“Yes.” Wu Jie’s expression was constrained and uneasy. Earlier he and Yang Kai had been pursued by a demon general and had been forced to flee into this Small Xuan Realm; now five Saint Realm experts of the demon race stood before him, and Wu Jie couldn’t help but feel as if he had escaped a tiger’s den only to enter a wolf’s lair.

Fortunately, these people bore him no ill will, and they seemed to have a close relationship with Yang Kai.

“If he is our lord’s friend, then he is no outsider. Please come with me—there are things outside we need to inquire about.” Li Rong inclined her head and led the way into the fortress.

“Please,” Han Fei said coolly.

Wu Jie forced a smile and had no choice but to follow behind Li Rong.

He also had many questions he wanted to ask these demon experts.

......

In the underground chamber of the fortress, Yang Kai sat cross-legged and did not immediately begin refining the Saint Pill.

Instead, he held his breath and calmed his mind until he reached a state of tranquility.

This chamber had been used by him when cultivating Demon God Transformation, so returning here felt familiar.

His current pill-refining skill had reached the limit of a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist—only one step away from Middle-Level.

That did not mean he couldn’t forge a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill.

With the aid of a spirit formation and the Wan Yao Ling Ye, producing a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill should not be difficult.

Emptying his body and mind, casting off all desires and thoughts, scenes from his past flickered through his mind like a revolving lantern—every one of them connected to the art of alchemy.

The insights gleaned from the True Alchemy Formula, the hardships and achievements he had encountered while learning alchemy—these scattered memories Yang Kai recalled deliberately, gradually weaving them together.

He felt like an outsider watching another version of himself steadily grow along the path of alchemy, from the lowest Common-Grade pills up through Earth-Grade, Heaven-Grade, Mystery-Grade, Spirit-Grade, and Saint-Grade.

That other self matured swiftly and stably, producing one after another pills brimming with overwhelming Spiritual Qi, each seeming like a newborn life pulsing with vitality.

Eventually he reached the point where he could readily refine lower-level Saint-Grade pills.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and a quiet, indescribable confidence spread through him—he was certain that, in his current condition, refining that Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill would succeed.

He laid out the Spirit-Grade and Saint-Grade herbs and elixirs he had spent years collecting, arranging them before him with methodical care.

He released his divine sense into the little pill furnace and inscribed a spirit formation within it to raise the refining success rate.

With one hand he pinched a herb; a flash of golden light, and True Yuan condensed in his palm like a tiny burning sun, scorching impurities and refining the medicinal fluid.

Before long, the medicinal fluid condensed—vivid and green like a tear, exuding potent Spiritual Qi.

True Yuan wrapped that drop and suspended it beside the furnace, and Yang Kai took another herb and repeated the process.

After a while, the spirit formation within the furnace was complete.

Herb after herb was refined; everything proceeded in orderly fashion.

Before Yang Kai, only the world of pill refinement remained—only the herbs at hand; he temporarily forgot the pill’s purpose, felt no pressure, and moved with natural, fluid motions.

The chamber filled with the scent of medicinal herbs.

......

In a palace within Mogu Castle, the five leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan wore grave expressions; after learning the full sequence of events from Wu Jie, they finally understood why Yang Kai had raced here so urgently to refine the Saint Pill to rescue them.

Time waits for no one—he had been forced into doing it.

“Xueli has probably already found the Coffin-Bearer; if my guess is right, she is now locked in battle with him,” Wu Jie said as he scanned the five demons’ faces.

“That demon general named Xueli—she has reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, correct?” Li Rong’s brows knitted into a single line as she asked.

“Correct; she’s one of the best of the world. The demon race’s four great demon generals all possess that realm’s strength!”

“Before Senior Coffin-Servant passed, he was only at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, and his body has long since decayed; against that demon general, he likely won’t hold out for long,” Han Fei growled, her face full of anger as if she wanted to rush out and help immediately.

“Senior Coffin-Servant may not match that woman, but if she still seeks to probe the Great Demon God’s secrets she won’t strike to kill… so for now we needn’t worry. We only need wait two or three days before we can act.” Li Rong said softly, then suddenly recalled something: “However, our lord said that long ago that woman accidentally gained some Demon God Golden Blood and refined it into her body—let’s hope she doesn’t use any Demon God techniques; if she does, that will be troublesome.”

“Demon God techniques?” Wu Jie’s eyes narrowed and his expression shifted as he hesitated to ask, “You don’t mean the legendary Great Demon God, do you?”

“Exactly the Great Demon God!” Hua Mo said solemnly.

Wu Jie’s mouth twitched and he dared not ask more. Matters relating to the Great Demon God were not something he could casually probe; the more one knew, the harder it was to extricate oneself.

As they spoke, a chaotic fluctuation of force suddenly came from outside accompanied by cracking sounds, and the whole Small Xuan Realm seemed to tremble.

Li Rong’s pretty face went cold. She rose from her chair in an instant and stepped outside, looking up at the sky.

The others hurried out as well.

“It has begun...” Li Rong murmured. “It should be that demon general battling Senior Coffin-Servant; the conflict is affecting our area.”

“She dares harm Senior Coffin-Servant—when I go out I’ll make her pay!” Han Fei snorted.

Wu Jie suddenly remembered that he and Yang Kai had entered here using the Blood Coffin carried by the Coffin-Bearer and worried aloud, “If Senior Coffin-Servant falls and his Blood Coffin is destroyed... what will happen here?”

Li Rong glanced at him and pursed her lips in a smile. “This Small Xuan Realm was created by the Great Demon God’s mighty technique and sealed within that Blood Coffin. If the Blood Coffin is destroyed, this place will shatter and we who live here will be cast into the endless void, never to find a way out.”

Wu Jie’s face drained of color as he murmured, “I hope Senior Coffin-Servant can hold out longer.”

The Ancient Demon Clan leaders present were worried but not panicked—none more anxious than the outsider Wu Jie.

The leaders expressed clear confidence in Senior Coffin-Servant and believed Xueli would not recklessly destroy the Blood Coffin.

Tht is if she still seeks to uncover the Great Demon God’s secrets.

The Small Xuan Realm’s disturbance sparked fear among the clan; Hua Mo, Xueji and Yinya went to calm the people and, by Li Rong’s orders, spread word that Yang Kai was refining a Saint Pill.

The Ancient Demon Clan erupted in excitement; everyone stared upward with expectation.

One day passed, then two...

As time went on, the Small Xuan Realm grew increasingly unstable; after two days, the tremors suddenly subsided.

Sensing this change, Li Rong and the others’ expressions fell.

They realized that such a development meant either Senior Coffin-Servant had repelled that demon general or had been defeated by her.

The latter was more likely—after all, Senior Coffin-Servant’s opponent was a top expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Senior Coffin-Servant had guarded this Small Xuan Realm for countless years; although no one of the clan had seen him or knew his appearance, everyone respected him from their hearts.

It was him who, every ten years, went out to search for those who could save the clan, and that effort had finally found Yang Kai, giving Li Rong and the others hope.

Now the clan’s escape was within reach, yet Senior Coffin-Servant faced a powerful enemy. Li Rong and the others were more anxious than anyone, eager to leave and see how he fared.

But without Yang Kai producing that Saint Pill they could not escape; no matter how anxious, they were powerless.

At that moment, the heaven-and-earth energy within the Small Xuan Realm became turbulent once more, converging from all directions toward one point.

Everyone’s expressions flickered with surprise and delight.

They sensed the gathering Spiritual Qi was centered on the underground chamber where Yang Kai had been refining pills.

Faintly, a fresh medicinal fragrance seemed to drift over.

Faces turned up, the mood taut and complex.

Moments later the energy stabilized, and then a figure sped over; in a blink, Yang Kai appeared before them.

“My lord...” Li Rong called shakily, her voice trembling.

Yang Kai grinned and spread his hands. “I have not failed you—the refinement succeeded.”

In his hand rested a soil-colored pill the size of a longan, emitting a hazy radiance.

Several pairs of eyes fixed on that Saint Pill, Hua Mo’s eyes glinting with tears.

“But how to use this still rests with you.” Yang Kai frowned and solemnly handed the Saint Pill to Li Rong.

There was only one pill, and the Ancient Demon Clan numbered in the thousands; Yang Kai truly did not know how to distribute the pill’s effects.

“Han Fei and I will handle that.” Li Rong gripped the Saint Pill and exchanged a glance with Han Fei, then leapt away toward the highest point of Mogu Castle.

“We’ll gather the clan as well,” Hua Mo said, and with Xueji and Yinya he quickly departed.

Yang Kai looked up and saw Li Rong and Han Fei arranging something atop the castle; subtle, intricate energy ripples emanated from there, obscure and profound.

At Hua Mo, Xueji and Yinya’s summons, the clan’s members were also assembling there.
