## Chapter 261 — Beauty, Your Situation Not Good

Having already experienced Wu Chengyi’s terrifying strength firsthand, Zi Mo knew just how dangerous he was, as expected from an elite disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect. Even when Chi Xue chased him on a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast for over a month, he remained unscathed. How could Zi Mo possibly be his opponent now?

With clenched teeth, Zi Mo softly said, “If I give you the method to control the Slave Beast, can you let me go?”

“I can give you a quick death!” Wu Chengyi's expression was cold.

Zi Mo's complexion changed as she coldly retorted, “I give you what you wanted, yet you still want to kill me? Do you have any humanity left?”

Wu Chengyi sneered, “Humanity? The strong are respected; why should I discuss humanity with you?”

As he spoke, his expression shifted, and a gleam flashed in his eyes. With a flick of his fingers, several sword energies shot out, striking the ground just a foot away from him.

Faintly, the sound of something being pierced could be heard, and a trickle of crimson blood oozed from the ground; it was from several Control Soul Insects that Zi Mo had secretly laid out.

“Bitch!” Wu Chengyi cursed angrily. Although he had been wary of the seemingly delicate woman, he had not expected to almost fall into her trap. If he had not been vigilant enough, those insects would have burrowed into his body.

“This is your own doing. I will capture you, then break your limbs, making you wish for death!” Wu Chengyi's face was filled with killing intent as he shook his long sword, enveloping himself in sword light and charging at Zi Mo with lightning speed.

“Bastard!”

Zi Mo gritted her teeth in frustration; facing a cold-blooded man like Wu Chengyi, she truly felt helpless.

In a hurry, she dodged the earth-shattering sword strike, and with a graceful motion of her delicate hand, several uniquely shaped spinning blades flew out.

Wu Chengyi's long sword flicked, creating several sword flowers that deflected the spinning blades, sending sparks flying in all directions.

Zi Mo's face turned pale as she gritted her teeth, barely managing to avoid a fatal blow, but the sword energy still grazed her shoulder.

With a cry of pain, a streak of red appeared on her shoulder.

Having completely fallen into a disadvantage, Zi Mo was unwilling to sit idly by. With her back to Wu Chengyi, she scattered all the remaining Control Soul Insects into the ground, hoping to use them to deal a heavy blow to Wu Chengyi.

However, Wu Chengyi had just narrowly escaped danger; how could he be careless now?

Sword light surged like a ribbon, directly shattering the ground within a radius of several dozen zhang. Amidst the rampant sword energy, all the Control Soul Insects were obliterated.

Control Soul Insects, when planted in a person's body, were indeed powerful; they feared nothing but heat. But before being planted in a person's body, they were just a few insects. Wu Chengyi's sword energy was more than enough to annihilate them.

Zi Mo's pretty face turned white. Without the Control Soul Insects as her hidden cards, she truly did not know how to contend with Wu Chengyi. Just as her heart was filled with anxiety, a sudden look of surprise flashed in her eyes as she discreetly glanced behind Wu Chengyi. A hint of excitement and joy spread across her beautiful face.

The subtle change in her expression did not escape Wu Chengyi's notice.

Realizing something was amiss, Wu Chengyi's expression turned cold. He decided not to waste any more time; raising his long sword, he prepared to unleash his final strike.

Before he could execute his sword move, a powerful aura locked onto him from behind. Wu Chengyi furrowed his brow and swung his sword back, creating a myriad of sword shadows that sealed off a vast area.

Amidst the flickering sword light, a fiery red fist emerged, sweeping through the air and shattering the countless sword shadows.

A figure landed.

Wu Chengyi floated back several dozen zhang before calmly turning to look at the newcomer. Upon recognizing the person's appearance, he couldn't help but exclaim, “It's you!”

“Hehe, didn’t expect this, did you?” Yang Kai said with a strange smile, his interest piqued as he scrutinized Wu Chengyi.

Previously, during his training in another realm, he had been intent on finding and eliminating Wu Chengyi. However, after encountering Chi Xue, he had been chased into the mist, missing his opportunity.

Yet now, unexpectedly, they met again here. Truly, it was like searching for something and finding it effortlessly!

Suppressing his surprise, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at Zi Mo beside him, his demeanor casual as he said, “Beauty, your situation is not good!”

“Hmm, if you had come a little later, you would never have seen me again!” Zi Mo shot him a glance, her heart secretly delighted.

After several months, encountering Yang Kai again left Zi Mo unsure of how to feel. She had thought she would never see him again in her life, no longer worrying about others tormenting her soul.

But now, their paths had crossed once more. However, Zi Mo was not worried about her soul being controlled; instead, she felt a sense of joy. Regardless, her life was preserved, and as for everything else, she would plan after surviving.

Yang Kai tilted his head, sizing her up, and said, “Aren't you an elite of the Senluo Palace? How did you end up like this?”

“What do you know?” Zi Mo gritted her teeth. “Be careful of this person; he is very powerful, and his True Essence is far purer and more robust than mine.”

“If he weren't powerful, he wouldn't be Wu Chengyi!” Yang Kai scoffed.

As for the True Essence being purer and more robust than Zi Mo's, that could be explained. Wu Chengyi must have consumed Liuyan Liquid, a treasure that refines Primordial Qi; it would be strange if his True Essence were not pure.

“Didn’t expect someone like you to survive; you’re quite lucky!” Wu Chengyi looked at Yang Kai with disdain, just as he had the first time they met, his expression cold and dismissive.

“If I were unlucky, I would have been killed by your Junior Brother long ago.” Yang Kai's gaze was as sharp as a blade.

“Since you know I want your life, you shouldn't have appeared before me! A person's luck cannot always be good.” Wu Chengyi's expression was calm, showing no signs of being affected by the death of Qi Jianxing.

“If you want to fight, then fight! Why do you men have so much nonsense?” Zi Mo, having suffered a lot from Wu Chengyi, found her confidence bolstered by Yang Kai's appearance and was eager to reclaim her dignity.

She knew well Yang Kai's strength; with his assistance, the two of them could easily overpower Wu Chengyi.

“Quite right!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Exactly as I intended!” Wu Chengyi snorted coldly, his sword intent gradually rising.

“Yang Kai, you assist from the side; I will deal with him!” Zi Mo commanded sternly.

“No, you assist!” Yang Kai replied succinctly. As soon as he finished speaking, he charged towards Wu Chengyi, and as he rushed, an unparalleled wave of energy erupted from his previously calm body.

“You…” Zi Mo's eyes widened in astonishment as she felt the overwhelming pressure emanating from Yang Kai.

He had broken through to the True Essence Realm? When they had parted four months ago, he was only at the Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, and he had just advanced to that stage. In just four months, he had reached the True Essence Realm. This speed of breakthrough… was astonishing.

However, after a moment's thought, Zi Mo felt relieved; after all, he was an extraordinary man, so it was not surprising that he could break through this critical barrier so quickly.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai collided with Wu Chengyi. Wu Chengyi unleashed his sword techniques, and the sword energy rampaged with killing intent. Yang Kai's fists struck like lightning. His figure danced amidst the countless sword shadows, radiating a scorching aura, burning like fire.

The energy of heaven and earth became chaotic, and the wind howled. Zi Mo instinctively squinted her eyes. She wanted to assist but had no idea how to intervene!

The two of them were fighting with all their might from the start, holding nothing back. All their killing intent and energy intertwined. At this moment, even if Zi Mo forcefully intervened, it would undoubtedly provoke a simultaneous counterattack from both.

Did she have the courage for that?

Yang Kai had asked her to assist, which seemed to be a concession, but now Zi Mo could only watch from the sidelines, not even having the qualification to intervene.

“Damn man!” Zi Mo smiled wryly, yet decisively floated backward like a piece of willow fluff, flying out a hundred zhang before finally stopping.

In the midst of the fierce battle, Wu Chengyi wore an expression of shock and disbelief. He had never expected that this existence he regarded as garbage could actually have the strength to fight him. As sword shadows rose, they were swept away by his violent fist winds. The opponent's moves were bold and powerful, while his sword techniques were agile and ethereal; for a moment, neither could gain the upper hand!

In just a short time, they had exchanged hundreds of blows, their True Essence freely flowing. Wu Chengyi became increasingly alarmed as he fought, while Yang Kai grew more ferocious, his expression filled with excitement, as if a lustful ghost had encountered a beautiful woman.

With a loud bang, the two were suddenly forced apart.

Wu Chengyi grunted, flying backward, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Kai was similarly injured; his abdomen had been cut by Wu Chengyi's long sword, blood flowing freely.

Both retreated over thirty zhang before slowly regaining their footing.

“Haha! That felt good!” Despite his injuries and bleeding, Yang Kai laughed heartily.

This was true combat, exhilarating and addictive, a battle between men that one could not easily withdraw from. Although he deeply despised Wu Chengyi and had grievances against him, Yang Kai had to admit that this man was indeed formidable.

After all, the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm was a significant boundary, and in terms of the purity and robustness of True Essence, he was not inferior to Yang Kai.

“You're quite strong!” Wu Chengyi gazed deeply at Yang Kai, pain flickering in his eyes, as if he could not believe that this kid from a second-rate sect could fight him to a standstill.

“Flattery!” Yang Kai's expression was indifferent.

“I admit, I underestimated you before! It seems my Junior Brother did not die due to an accident, but rather at your hands.” Wu Chengyi slowly rotated his long sword, his sword intent rising once more.

“You sent him to ambush me; you should have anticipated this.”

“As long as you admit it!” Wu Chengyi continued to rotate his long sword.

“Want revenge?” Yang Kai sneered.

“His death was due to his lack of skill; it’s not my fault! But today, if you dare oppose me, don’t think you can leave alive!” A sudden ferocity appeared on Wu Chengyi's face as he coldly declared, “The dignity of my Jiu Xing Sword Sect cannot be trampled! The dignity of Wu Chengyi cannot be trampled! Even the young masters of the Eight Great Families in Zhongdu can only look up to me; what are you?”

“Come over and die; I’ll give you a quick death!” Wu Chengyi seemed to have taken some stimulant, suddenly becoming agitated, pointing his long sword at Yang Kai and coldly shouting.
