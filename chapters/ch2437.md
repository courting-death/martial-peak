## Chapter 2437 — Netherworld Sect, Yu Ying

The Incarnation burst out laughing, "With a body like mine, how could I possibly move around on my own?"

Yang Kai snorted, "At least you have some self-awareness."

The Incarnation replied, "Aren’t I just keeping you company so you don’t get lonely?"

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, "How is this any different from talking to myself?"

Even so, Yang Kai quickly composed himself, and the faint trace of melancholy vanished.

"There’s something I’ve never told you," the Incarnation suddenly said, his tone turning serious.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked.

The Incarnation said, "I feel like my cultivation has reached a bottleneck."

Yang Kai replied, "On the path of cultivation, bottlenecks and shackles are common. It’s not your first day cultivating, you should know this..."

Before he finished speaking, Yang Kai suddenly realized something was wrong.

The Incarnation continued, "But the Heaven Devouring Battle Art is a heaven-defying technique. By rights, it shouldn’t have bottlenecks. You studied this technique; you should understand."

Yang Kai nodded. Back when he received the Heaven Devouring Battle Art from Wu Mengchuan, he had studied it thoroughly. At the time, he felt the technique was far too heaven-defying. Anything in the world with Spiritual Qi could be devoured, and there shouldn’t be any bottlenecks in cultivation, which was why he hadn’t dared to practice it himself.

But now, the Incarnation had encountered a bottleneck, which was clearly abnormal.

"I have a feeling this bottleneck can’t be broken through by cultivation or luck. Was the technique Wu Mengchuan taught you incomplete?"

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but grow suspicious.

If the Heaven Devouring Battle Art Wu Mengchuan taught him wasn’t complete, then what the Incarnation was experiencing made sense.

Yet Yang Kai could never figure out why Wu Mengchuan would teach him this technique. If it was to repay Yang Kai for saving his life, the price seemed far too great. This technique was said to be the number one in the Star Realm, and the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had relied on it to ascend to the throne of the strongest expert in the Star Realm. Even Emperor Realm experts coveted it.

Looking back now, the whole affair was riddled with mysteries.

"After this Shattered Star Sea, let’s go to Biyu Sect and ask Wu Mengchuan for answers," Yang Kai mused after a moment, having made up his mind.

He used to fear Wu Mengchuan, partly because of his impressive background—he was a direct descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and surely had hidden cards up his sleeve—and partly because Yang Kai’s strength was inferior.

But things were different now. Among cultivators of the same level, Yang Kai no longer needed to fear anyone. Even if Wu Mengchuan had broken through to the Emperor Realm over the years, Yang Kai was confident he could face him.

…

In the starry sky, Yang Kai drifted alone. It had been nearly a month since he parted ways with Hua Qingsi and the others, and his gains during this time were mediocre.

Relying on the Six-Pointed Star Seal, Yang Kai could sense fluctuations of Origin Power every few days, and every time he encountered it, he and the Incarnation would refine it completely.

The Incarnation also possessed a Stellar Origin. Its massive body was due to fusing with the Floating Continent. That continent had long since birthed its own Origin Power, which the Incarnation had absorbed as well.

He hadn’t gained much Origin Power, but he had run into more than a dozen troublemakers. Because of the special nature of the Star Seal, cultivators in the Shattered Star Sea would often fight as soon as they met.

Yang Kai naturally showed no mercy to these people and killed them all.

However, the Six-Pointed Star Seal showed no signs of upgrading, only becoming a bit brighter in color.

One day, Yang Kai sensed a ripple of Origin Qi, resonating with the Six-Pointed Star Seal on the back of his hand. He immediately changed direction and sped toward the source of the fluctuation.

Before he arrived, Yang Kai sensed two other, slightly different power fluctuations.

He was familiar with this kind of fluctuation—it was clearly the resonance between Star Seals. In other words, two people had already arrived at the source of the power.

Yang Kai hesitated briefly but didn’t change direction, accelerating forward. Soon, he landed atop a massive meteorite.

This meteorite was at least several thousand zhang across, lying motionless in the starry sky, its surface smooth and glossy.

This meteorite was clearly a fragment of some shattered Cultivation Star. Such things were everywhere in the Shattered Star Sea, too many to count.

What surprised Yang Kai was that the Origin Power he’d sensed was emanating from this meteorite, meaning there was a fragment of Stellar Origin inside—and it wasn’t even that thin.

That was odd. The broken Origins he’d found before were always on shattered Cultivation Stars. This was the first time he’d encountered a meteorite with Origin Power.

At this moment, there were already two people on the meteorite, a man and a woman, both at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The pair seemed to be fighting over the Origin Power, and when Yang Kai arrived, both were panting and unsteady, clearly at the end of their strength.

The man on the left wore clothes that looked familiar to Yang Kai, was about thirty, and had a fierce expression.

The woman on the right had a graceful figure and a sharp, thin face, giving off a harsh and mean impression. Her entire aura felt extremely unpleasant, cold and sinister.

This chill was different from the cold brought by Ice Heart Valley disciples’ ice techniques. It was a kind of instinctive repulsion, as if it didn’t belong to this world.

The two were fighting fiercely when Yang Kai suddenly appeared, startling them. They both leapt back, warily watching Yang Kai.

Their Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai, and upon sensing he was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, both their expressions grew grave. They were evenly matched, but against Yang Kai in their current state, they stood no chance.

Yang Kai glanced at them indifferently, his gaze lingering on the backs of their hands. He saw that both possessed Five-Pointed Star Seals—whether they’d upgraded by killing or had them from the start, he couldn’t tell.

But from what Yang Kai knew about Star Seals, naturally formed Five-Pointed Star Seals were rare; most were triangles or diamonds. For these two to have Five-Pointed Star Seals, they must have killed quite a few people in the Shattered Star Sea.

Not good people! Yang Kai snorted coldly to himself.

Seeing Yang Kai stand there silently, both felt immense pressure. The woman, unable to bear the silence, forced a smile and nodded at Yang Kai in greeting.

Before she could speak, the man interrupted her with a cupped fist, "Greetings, friend. I am Guan Qi, a disciple of Wenqing Sect in the Northern Territory. May I ask your name?"

"Wenqing Sect?" Yang Kai raised his brows in realization.

He’d been wondering why the man’s clothes looked familiar—it turned out he was a Wenqing Sect disciple.

Thinking of Wenqing Sect, Yang Kai remembered Feng Xi and Feng Xuan, an old and a young scoundrel. The old one bullied the weak, the young one relied on strength to oppress others. When Yang Kai first entered the Shattered Star Sea, he’d suffered greatly at Feng Xi’s hands, nearly losing his life to an Emperor Extinction Pill. Naturally, he had no fondness for Wenqing Sect.

Seeing Yang Kai’s reaction, Guan Qi raised his brows, "Are you from the Northern Territory as well, friend?"

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "Whether I’m from the Northern Territory or not, what’s it to you?"

He spoke bluntly, making it hard for Guan Qi to maintain his composure. Though he was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, lower than Yang Kai, he was an elite disciple of Wenqing Sect. Being able to enter the Shattered Star Sea proved his exceptional talent. Outside, he wouldn’t even bother with ordinary Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators. Just mentioning his name would have countless Third Stage cultivators groveling before him.

But now, having just fought a tough battle and with his strength reduced to less than half, and Yang Kai clearly not easy to deal with, he didn’t dare provoke trouble and could only swallow his anger.

Meanwhile, the woman relaxed upon seeing Yang Kai give Guan Qi no face.

She’d feared Yang Kai might know Guan Qi or have some connection to Wenqing Sect. If that were the case, she’d have to flee immediately.

But now, things were just as she’d hoped. She burst out laughing, her voice like silver bells, and said, "Wenqing Sect? What’s that supposed to be? Daring to flaunt it in the Shattered Star Sea—how shameless."

First Yang Kai had put Guan Qi in his place, and now the woman mocked him coldly, making Guan Qi’s face look even worse.

The woman ignored him, instead bowing to Yang Kai, her eyes charming and watery, and said softly, "Junior Sister Yu Ying of Netherworld Sect in the Eastern Territory greets Senior Brother!"

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, and he said in a low voice, "Netherworld Sect!"

Yu Ying was taken aback, not knowing why Yang Kai reacted so strongly. She asked cautiously, "Senior Brother, it seems you’ve heard of our Netherworld Sect?"

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming his excitement, and smiled with a nod, "Of course I’ve heard of it. The name Netherworld Sect is truly renowned—I’ve long heard of it. How could I not?"

Guan Qi, hearing Yang Kai’s words, was so angry his nose nearly twisted.

Earlier, when he’d introduced himself as a Wenqing Sect disciple, Yang Kai had replied, "What’s it to you?" But when the woman mentioned Netherworld Sect, he said it was famous. The contrast was too much.

In the whole Star Realm, both Netherworld Sect and Wenqing Sect were top sects, leaders in their respective territories, and their status should be equal.

But Yang Kai’s completely different reactions left Guan Qi feeling deeply insulted. Rage burned in his chest, and he could barely restrain himself from rushing forward to kill this shameless pair on the spot.
