## Chapter 1296 — Secret Cave

The one-armed Corpse Soldier hastily recounted everything he had gone through, speaking in careful detail; he did not omit even the particulars of his clash with Yang Kai.

After hearing this, the female Corpse Soldier's body trembled slightly, her voice full of doubt as she said, "You mean he can cleave out an inky, blade-like strike? And that attack showed no energy fluctuation at all, yet even your corpse couldn't withstand it?"

"That's right. After he struck, part of my arm was gone—where it went, I don't know." The one-armed Corpse Soldier nodded heavily, his emerald eyes fixed on the female Corpse Soldier as he pressed, "Do you know anything about this?"

A hint of hesitation crossed the female Corpse Soldier's face; after a long pause she answered, "From what you describe, the opponent's display was somewhat like spatial power."

"What?" The other Corpse Soldiers were shocked. "Spatial power? You aren't joking, are you?"

The female Corpse Soldier snorted coldly. "Have you forgotten where I came from?"

The one-armed Corpse Soldier was taken aback, then suddenly seemed to remember something and exclaimed, "So that's it!"

The female Corpse Soldier inclined her head slightly and said softly, "Among the successive elders of the Battle Sky Alliance, there has always been one who cultivates spatial power. I once had the fortune to see Elder Mo Xiaosheng, perform such a marvel, so I understand spatial power better than you. But..."

"But what?"

“It’s just that, if things are truly as Brother Nie says, then this intruder’s mastery over spatial power is far too profound. Even Elder Mo in those years couldn’t condense space into a blade and so easily sever a body. Yet this man is merely at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm — how could he possibly accomplish such a feat? So while what he displayed resembled the power of space, I dare not be completely certain.”

"Indeed. I've heard of Mo Xiaosheng's name many times before, but hundreds of years have passed and I don't even know if he's still alive. If this brat truly can forge space into a blade, then that's terrifying."

"What good is talking about that now? Have you all forgotten what we are? Miss Lan, I know you have some connection with Elder Mo, but if you appear before him in this state, do you truly think he would spare you?"

The female Corpse Soldier addressed as Miss Lan had the ghostly flames in her eyes flicker more violently at those words, as though her emotions had been stirred.

"By the way, Brother Nie, you didn't leave any traces when you returned, did you?" the Corpse Soldier who had spoken first asked warily.

"Of course not. Besides, even if that person did find this place, he couldn't break the restrictions here. This is a formation and ward left by the Guyang Sect long ago. If we hadn't learned the way in and out from their mouths, not even during their peak could one simply break the formation and enter. That pitiful Second Stage Saint King—how could he possess such ability?"

“There’s some truth to that.” The Corpse Soldier nodded, then, as if recalling something, suddenly sighed. “I truly don’t know whether I should thank those people from the Guyang Sect or hate them. If not for them, I wouldn’t have died — but without them, I’d have long since turned to dust. Ending up like this now… heh, what a taste it leaves behind!”

At these words the other Corpse Soldiers fell silent; clearly they shared the sentiment.

The cave's depths were quiet for a long while before the female Corpse Soldier spoke, "Enough—don't dwell on it. It's our turn to guard this place for ten years; to be safe, let's go out and have a look, lest the Lords wake and ask questions."

"Fine. Miss Lan and I will go see. Brother Nie, you should hurry and use the yin energy here to reattach the severed arm. Though a section is missing, it's better than nothing." Saying so, that Corpse Soldier rose and followed the female Corpse Soldier toward the exit.

At the same time, in another vast secret cave, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had sneaked in. Facing rows of empty wooden racks and boxes scattered on the ground, Yang Kai's face was as dark as still water; he almost burst out cursing.

He and Yang Yan had followed the faint medicinal scent here, and after a careful search, certain there were no signs of sleeping Corpse Soldiers, they had rushed in with great excitement.

Little did they expect to find this sight.

This place had clearly been the Guyang Sect's storage for Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine. Those rows of racks numbered at least a hundred; each rack had three tiers, each tier holding five or six boxes. Now the boxes lay abandoned and scattered on the ground as if no one cared.

Every box had been opened, and whatever they originally contained had vanished.

After such a long search to find this place, the prospect of a great haul lay before them—yet at the crucial moment they were met with this scene. One can imagine Yang Kai's mood.

No need to guess: those Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine had surely been gobbled down whole by the Corpse Soldiers that slept here.

Though such consumption might be a waste of divine materials, Corpse Soldiers cannot refine pills; they can only devour Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine to strengthen themselves. This is their path of cultivation, like demonic beasts.

But after a careful search Yang Kai still found traces of some fire and Yang attribute Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine among the opened boxes—these herbs are the deadliest poison to corpse bodies that favor yin and cold, so the Corpse Soldiers naturally would not swallow them.

Unfortunately every box had been opened; over so long the herbs' properties and Spiritual Qi have all dissipated, rendering them useless. This made Yang Kai gnash his teeth; he longed to rush into those caves and slaughter every Corpse Soldier to vent his fury.

After a gloomy inspection, Yang Kai and Yang Yan both sighed in frustration.

A great sect's reserve of Spiritual Medicine, ruined like this—anyone who saw it would be filled with heartache.

Fortunately this secret cave had deeper chambers beyond this spot, and the two did not hesitate to press further inward.

Not long after they left, the female Corpse Soldier and another companion glided into the place like phantoms; both sniffed the air lightly, exchanged a glance, and their eyes glittered.

“There’s the scent of living people!” the male Corpse Soldier said in a low voice.

The female Corpse Soldier gave a slight nod. “And there are two of them. It seems the people Brother Nie encountered really did intrude into this place.”

"Bad—inside is where ore and Secret Treasure are stored, and there's also that item which will be useful for the Lords' future plans." The male Corpse Soldier cast a look toward the direction Yang Kai and Yang Yan had vanished and his expression changed as he whispered.

A flash of murderous intent crossed the female Corpse Soldier's eyes as she said, "Follow them and see. If together we can deal with them, we won't alarm the Lords. Otherwise, with someone breaking in here, we will surely be punished."

On hearing this the male Corpse Soldier's eyes shifted in fear and he quickly nodded, "Alright!"

The two Corpse Soldiers then circulated their inner power, suppressed their auras, and stealthily followed.

Deeper inside the secret cave, Yang Kai and Yang Yan wandered through more racks; at a wave of their hands books—some thick, some thin—vanished from the shelves.

To their surprise, the place stored the Guyang Sect's cultivation manuals and secret texts.

Yang Kai had no time to read; he naturally collected them first.

But when his eyes fell upon a secret text titled the Corpse Refining Technique, he immediately understood why there were so many Corpse Soldiers here. In former days the Guyang Sect, not inferior to the Battle Sky Alliance or Leitai Sect, could well possess such a manual; certainly some disciples of Guyang practiced this art, which explains why, two thousand years later, so many Corpse Soldiers had appeared here.

The secret texts were numerous, but Yang Kai and Yang Yan gathered them up and soon had them all in their possession.

Having confirmed nothing was left behind, the two continued deeper still.

A short while later they entered another chamber and, facing the dazzling array of countless Secret Treasures, even Yang Kai—who was no stranger to wealth—was moved.

The vault below held at least a thousand Secret Treasures. Less than ten percent were swords or blade-type relics; the rest were discs, beads, all manner of jewelry, and rare banners and flags. Armors were likewise innumerable.

Under this chamber a massive formation was running, apparently drawing in Heavenly Spiritual Qi to nurture these treasures.

And it seemed to be working—for though two thousand years had passed, most of the treasures still shimmered faintly, clearly retaining their spirit; some showed no radiance but were perfectly preserved and could be used after a little repair.

The majority were Saint King-Grade treasures, and about twenty percent were Origin-Grade.

So many Secret Treasures left Yang Kai thoroughly delighted.

He exchanged a glance with Yang Yan and they set to work without ceremony.

In less than the time it takes for incense to burn, the place was emptied.

"There's another secret chamber." After collecting the treasures, Yang Kai peered down a further passage and his eyes shone with keen excitement.

Earlier they had passed the chambers that stored Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine, cultivation manuals, and Secret Treasures; now there was one more chamber, which, being placed in the rear, must hold something of great value.

With a touch of anticipation, Yang Kai and Yang Yan pressed on deeper.

The two Corpse Soldiers who had been trailing them only revealed themselves after the pair had gone, staring in that direction with sullen eyes.

"What shall we do? They've gone in there—it's a place even the Lords cannot enter!" the male Corpse Soldier asked.

"What else can we do?" the female Corpse Soldier sighed. "If the Lords cannot enter, neither can we; we can only wait here. But it is said that chamber houses the Guyang Sect's Ancestral Treasure—the Sun's True Essence—which has a strong restraining effect upon bodies like ours, otherwise even the Lords would not be unable to enter."

"Mm, I've heard of it too. They say it was refined from the core of a sun-star's nucleus. I don't know what kind of godlike method could have produced it or how it came into Guyang Sect's possession."
