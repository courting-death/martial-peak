## Chapter 364 — This is Just a Punishment for Injuring the Eagle

If there was still a hint of doubt regarding the authenticity of the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle before, it was completely dispelled the moment two blood servants from the Yang Family appeared.

It was indeed the unique Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family, and Yang Kai was truly a direct descendant of the Yang Family.

"Where is the young master?" The middle-aged man scanned the crowd with an eagle-like gaze. Seeing that the people from the Xiang and Nan Families showed no change in expression, he called out loudly.

As he spoke, the woman beside him surveyed the area with her beautiful eyes, trying to catch a glimpse of her young master among the crowd.

Swish, swish, swish...

Almost all eyes turned to Yang Kai.

In the next moment, the two blood servants also directed their gazes toward him. Upon getting a good look at Yang Kai's face and assessing his age and cultivation, their expressions turned skeptical and baffled.

As blood servants, they had indeed seen the direct descendants of the Yang Family, and though they had never interacted closely, they had crossed paths more than once.

Before coming here, they had anticipated that using the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle would help them easily locate their young master. If they recognized someone familiar, they could confirm their identity.

However, upon seeing Yang Kai, both felt a strange sense of unfamiliarity!

Had the young masters of the Yang Family ever been this young? Moreover, they felt they had never seen such features before.

No wonder they were suspicious. When Yang Kai left the Yang Family, he was only twelve or thirteen years old and was just an ordinary person who could not cultivate. Now, more than five years had passed, and Yang Kai had certainly changed significantly.

The woman was more observant; after a while, she suddenly exclaimed, "Young master?"

The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed as he stared intently at Yang Kai. His mind stirred with tumultuous emotions.

Young master! The youngest young master who was dispatched long ago, the one under Yang Siye. But... wasn't it said that the young master was born deficient and could not cultivate?

During their departure from the Yang Family, the blood servants had discussed how they would need to closely protect the young master, as he was likely still just an ordinary person.

The Yang Family had enemies everywhere; perhaps this time someone would take the opportunity to assassinate the scattered direct descendants.

Now, looking back, how could this person before them be merely an ordinary person? He was clearly a martial artist at the Sixth Stage of the True Essence Realm! While this level wasn’t the peak, it was certainly formidable.

The middle-aged man and the woman exchanged glances, and with a sudden movement, they appeared just ten feet away from Yang Kai. An invisible force surged forth, pushing everyone surrounding Yang Kai away by several dozen feet.

A glimpse of the Yang Family's arrogance was laid bare!

The Hu sisters stepped back repeatedly, their expressions filled with annoyance.

"They are all my friends; be gentle," Yang Kai said lightly, looking at the two.

The middle-aged man and woman maintained indifferent expressions, seemingly disregarding him entirely.

Unless Yang Kai's true identity was confirmed, the blood servants would not extend any courtesy to anyone.

"Are you truly the young master?" The middle-aged man surveyed Yang Kai with a frown, unsure.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Flicking his fingertip, he drew a small cut and raised his finger, letting several drops of blood fall.

The woman acted quickly, producing a jade pendant, respectfully cupping it in both hands to catch the drops of blood.

As the blood fell into the pendant, it vanished as if devoured. The once ordinary jade pendant suddenly emanated a burst of radiant light.

Only the direct bloodlines of the Yang Family could activate the mysterious glow within this pendant.

There was no room for doubt!

The middle-aged man and woman exchanged glances, quickly kneeling half-down. They spoke in unison, "Blood servant Tu Feng!"

"Blood servant Tang Yuxian... comes to respectfully welcome the young master back to the clan!"

"Rise!"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian stood, and as they looked at Yang Kai, their demeanor was now filled with respect and gravity, shedding any previous nonchalance.

If it were other young masters at the Sixth Stage of the True Essence Realm, they would still treat them with a degree of casualness.

But the young master was different.

Because Yang Siye had been injured and had not recovered, the young master had been born with deficiencies, and for more than a decade, he had been an ordinary person. Yet, he had now grown to such a level.

In just five years, cultivating to the Sixth Stage of the True Essence Realm!

Such speed left Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian feeling ashamed; they no longer looked down on him.

Moreover, the perilous position of the young master was glaring—this was the frontline against the Cangyun Evil Land. As a descendant of the Yang Family, he dared to venture here; such courage and resolution were clearly not traits of an ordinary person.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had thought they were taking on a mundane task, but they were taken aback by the young master’s brilliance.

Indeed, being a direct descendant of the Yang Family meant embracing madness—an extraordinary perspective was required.

After looking at Yang Kai for a while, Tu Feng retracted his gaze, lifting his eyelids as he solemnly asked, "Who is in command here?"

Xiang Chu felt a chill run down his spine and promptly stepped forward a few paces, awkwardly smiling as he cupped his fists, "Reporting to the senior, this area is managed by the Xiang Family!"

"Xiang Family..." Tu Feng frowned slightly, nodding. "The decisive battle ended two days ago; there should be no issues now, right? If there is nothing, we will take the young master away. If there are matters, just command us, and we will assist the young master."

"I would not dare!" Xiang Chu would have wished to send these people from the Yang Family far away at this moment; how could he say otherwise? He hurriedly replied, "There is nothing here, we were just about to leave. Please, senior, feel free!"

"En." Tu Feng threw him a knowing glance, expressing satisfaction. Just as he was about to lead Yang Kai away, his eyes suddenly narrowed, a wave of killing intent spreading out fiercely.

Tang Yuxian's expression also turned cold, as she looked down at the ground.

The members of the Xiang and Nan Families were left astounded, their souls stirring in terror.

"Heh heh..." Tu Feng suddenly chuckled darkly, the scars on his face becoming even more terrifying. In a chilling tone, he said, "I had wondered why the eagle was startled and kept circling in the sky; turns out it was this!"

The members of the Xiang and Nan Families were overwhelmed with shock.

Xiang Chu suddenly raised his head in fear as realization dawned—he finally comprehended why Yang Kai had plucked two feathers from the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle and thrown them to the ground.

This was clearly an attempt to frame them!

"Who injured my Yang Family's eagle?" Tang Yuxian's face turned icy, her beautiful eyes flashing with murderous intent as she scanned the people from the Nan and Xiang Families, demanding coldly, "Step forward if you're responsible!"

Tu Feng also laughed coldly, "The Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family is extraordinarily precious and rarely seen. Yet someone dares to make a move against it? How interesting!"

"Senior!" Cold sweat dripped from Xiang Chu's forehead, only realizing at this moment how insidious and malicious Yang Kai could be. He exclaimed, "We did not recognize the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle in time, and indeed we were abrupt, but we did not harm it."

"Did you not recognize it?" Tu Feng sneered, "What good are your eyes for?"

Tang Yuxian pressed on, "Harmed it? Then what about these two feathers?"

"This..." Xiang Chu was left speechless. 

He couldn't say it was the young master from the Yang Family who plucked them and threw them down. Never mind whether people would believe it; the fact that they attacked the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle was evident, and so many eyes were watching.

The Yang Family's reputation for arrogance was already well-known; how could they let such a slight go unpunished?

Seeing the expressions of the Xiang and Nan Families turn ashen with rage and despair, each looking as if they had lost a loved one, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower group felt nothing but satisfaction.

Indeed, what goes around comes around; karma was truly a cycle!

Moments ago, they conspired with Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard to set Yang Kai up; now the tables were entirely turned.

It seemed the unjust treatment and slander they had inflicted upon Yang Kai had bounced back upon them.

Xiang Chu wished to argue further when Elder Xu shook his head slowly at him.

Arguing in front of the Yang Family members was akin to playing an ancient instrument to a cow; it would yield no results.

With a face turning ashen, Elder Xu said, "We were in the wrong in this matter; let us settle it amicably."

"The rules of the martial world!" Tu Feng scoffed coldly.

The four Divine Roaming Realm experts turned pale.

After a brief moment, the few of them finally sighed deeply, aware that they had kicked a stone wall.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts behind Nan Sheng exchanged glances, their faces revealing a deep sadness. Slowly, they extended two fingers, gathering their Qi into blades.

The two masters from the Nan Family had a look of anguish in their eyes, their bodies trembling slightly, their expressions conflicted and hesitant...

Tu Feng's piercing gaze fixed on them, his True Essence surging freely. Tang Yuxian’s pretty face bore the coldness of someone ready to unleash a slaughter at the slightest dissatisfaction.

“Ah…” A deep sigh escaped the lips of the two. They closed their eyes, their faces marked with a resolution and suffering.

With the flash of True Essence blades, both of their arms were severed at the elbows, blood gushing forth.

Grim grunts escaped their lips; their faces turned pale as they hurriedly cultivated to stem the flow of blood. One of them trembled as he looked at Tu Feng, saying, "Is this enough?"

All disciples from second-rate sects were struck dumb with horror.

Though they had long heard of the Yang Family's might and arrogance, they never expected the Yang Family to wield such astonishing power. With just a single question from the blood servant, two masters had to cripple themselves!

These were two experts at the Seventh and Eighth Stages of the Divine Roaming Realm! Within their sects, they would surely hold elder guardian positions, or even be close to the sect Master.

Yet they were bullied in this manner, not daring to resist.

Only at this moment did the disciples from second-rate sects truly comprehend what the Yang Family represented, and what being the head of the Eight Great Families entailed! Such depth and momentum were beyond what their sects could rival.

Tu Feng coldly said, "Only two moved? I see four masters here."

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Xiang Family were instantly stunned.

Elder Fang from the Xiang Family and Elder Xu had not made a move against the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle, with Elder Xu even stopping the three from the Nan Family from attacking, yet this blood servant from the Yang Family clearly was not about to relent.

"We did not attack that eagle!" Elder Xu's forehead produced cold sweat as he hurriedly defended himself.

To self-disable an arm was no small injury. Losing an arm would at least reduce a master’s strength by twenty percent, perhaps even more, rendering them half-wrecked.

Tu Feng seemed to have not heard him, coldly fixing his gaze on him and Elder Fang, ominously stating, "A single arm, or your lives, choose."

Elder Fang and Elder Xu's faces changed drastically; they had never expected Tu Feng to be so unreasonable.

"I give you three breaths of time!" Tu Feng continued to push relentlessly.

Elder Xu and Elder Fang's expressions darkened, exchanging glances, both shaking their heads and bitterly smiling.

"Two elders, consider this to be my Xiang Chu's debt to you!" Xiang Chu took a deep breath, his heart filled with grief.

What could the two masters say? Their young master was right beside them. Although they knew the blood servants would not kill him for no reason, killing the two of them posed no issue.

"We concede!" Elder Xu and Elder Fang's expressions turned ashen. Having spoken, they did not utter additional words; like the previous two, they gathered their True Essence and formed blades of energy, each crippling an arm!

"Thus, is this acceptable?" Elder Xu asked, his face pale.

"Are there no others?" Tu Feng pressed unrelentingly, his eagle-like gaze sweeping over the crowd.

Feeling uncomfortable under the scrutiny, Nan Sheng instinctively shrank his neck.

Yang Kai grinned at him.

In that moment, Nan Sheng's face went pale.

He was the first to have acted against the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle; Elders Xu and Fang from the Xiang Family merely got caught up in matters.

"It seems there is still someone." Tu Feng had caught onto Nan Sheng's anxiousness and panic, realizing he was also involved. He barked, "Do I need to take action myself?"

The expressions of the experts from the Nan and Xiang Families shifted again.

While they had endured the blood servants' bullying, forcing them to self-disable an arm, they could say nothing and had no ability to resist. But now that Tu Feng had set his sights on Nan Sheng, the stakes were vastly more significant.

Nan Sheng was after all a young master from a first-rate family; to be rendered arm-less here was no trivial matter.

Thus, even though the four Divine Roaming Realm experts knew the blood servants were formidable, they looked at Tu Feng with indignation and vigilance, quietly gathering their True Essence.

If pushed further, a fierce battle was inevitable!

Yang Kai suddenly chuckled lightly, "Young Master Nan is of noble status; there is no need for him to lose an arm."

Tu Feng's gaze flickered. He said nothing, but Nan Sheng looked at Yang Kai with both surprise and gratitude, clearly not expecting that he would wish to spare him.

"Let him sever two fingers instead!" Yang Kai’s smile faded, turning stern.

The gratitude in Nan Sheng's eyes disappeared swiftly, replaced by unbridled resentment.

"Well then, since the young master has suggested so, you may self-disable two fingers," Tu Feng nodded approvingly, as if bestowing a tremendous honor upon Nan Sheng.

"Fine!" Nan Sheng was decisive; upon hearing this, he ceased all chatter. Drawing a dagger from his waist, the blade flashed, and two fingers fell to the ground without him batting an eyelash through the entire process.

"I have marked you!" Nan Sheng gritted his teeth, glaring coldly at Yang Kai, muttering softly.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Young Master Nan, this is merely a punishment for injuring the eagle. Have you forgotten that we still have scores to settle?" 

Nan Sheng’s complexion changed, and he abruptly fell silent.
