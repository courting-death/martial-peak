## Chapter 2081 — One Man Holds the Pass

The elder standing nearby was momentarily stunned, shock flashing across his face as he gazed at Yang Kai's retreating figure.

Although during the two days of jointly resisting the Demonic Qi he already knew Yang Kai was a newly risen Dao Origin Realm expert in Fenglin City, he had never imagined the man would be so formidable.

The secret art he had just unleashed carried unmistakable ripples of Spatial Force—did that mean the other party could actually command space itself?

A Dao Origin Realm practitioner of this caliber could no longer be taken lightly.

The elder had originally not regarded Yang Kai highly, thinking him merely a newly promoted young expert, but after Yang Kai displayed that secret art the elder had to reassess him.

Just then, a cry rose from below: "My lords, we've run into a small problem repairing the formation."

Hearing the call, the elder's brow creased as he quickly turned to look and demanded in a low voice, “What problem?”

“It’s like this, Senior Qin…” the Formation Master who spoke wore an embarrassed look and said in a grave tone, “if we want to mend this torn hole, there must be no overly powerful forces interfering!”

“What do you mean?” Elder Qin furrowed his brow; although his cultivation had reached the Dao Origin Realm, he had not studied formations deeply and naturally did not grasp the details.

“In other words… if you two continue fighting those monsters at the breach in the formation, we will never be able to repair it!” the Formation Master explained with an anxious face.

“Useless!” Elder Qin roared in anger upon hearing this. “If what you say is true, then this formation can’t be repaired at all?”

The Formation Master shrunk back when Elder Qin grew angry and weakly said, “It’s not that bad; as long as you two can shift the battlefield and not interfere with the repairs, it will do.”

“How do we shift it?” Elder Qin asked in a low voice.

The Formation Master, embarrassed, answered, “It might require the two of you to go outside the formation…”

Before he finished, Elder Qin thundered, “Nonsense! If that’s the case, what hope do we have of survival?”

Fenglin City had remained safe partly because the Demonic Qi’s assault the previous day had not been overwhelming, and partly because of the layered strength of the formation.

If they truly left the protection of the formation to fight those Demonic Qi and monsters, they would soon be eroded by the Demonic Qi and become demonic men, losing their minds.

“Senior Qin, calm yourself; it’s our lack of skill,” the Formation Master said, knowing the proposal was asking too much. Just as the fighters of Fenglin City were not especially strong, the Formation Masters were likewise not outstanding.

Indeed, to repair that rupture one could not have powerful forces interfering.

Yang Kai and Elder Qin were locked in ceaseless struggle with the demonic creatures and Demonic Qi there, leaving them utterly unable to carry out the repairs.

“Senior Qin, I will go!” Yang Kai suddenly spoke.

“You?” Elder Qin said, turning to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “If shifting the battlefield is necessary to repair the formation, then there is no other way.”

Elder Qin could not help but show concern and asked anxiously, “Young Brother, are you confident? You must understand, if you truly go beyond the protection of the formation you will be alone deep within the enemy ranks; that Demonic Qi is not easily resisted—what if…”

“Whether I’m confident or not, we’ll only know by trying,” Yang Kai replied calmly. “If we let things be, then when we are exhausted it will be when the city falls.”

Hearing Yang Kai, Elder Qin knew there was no better option; he bit his lip and said in a low voice, “If so, then I Qin will go with you, Young Brother. Hmph, as the old saying goes, if one does not enter the tiger’s den, how can one obtain the tiger cub? I want to see how that Demonic Qi will attempt to erode my mind!”

Yang Kai gave a wry chuckle. “Elder Qin, if you go as well, what if a few slip through? Who will take care of the people down there?”

Elder Qin was taken aback for a moment.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. “Let me go forward; Senior Qin should hold the rear.”

Elder Qin knew Yang Kai spoke truth and sighed, “Then Young Brother, you must be extremely careful. If you truly cannot hold… retreat back into the city immediately.”

Yang Kai nodded.

“If this succeeds, I Qin will report it to the City Lord and make sure your merit is recorded!” Elder Qin said in a deep voice.

Yang Kai made no reply; with a flicker of his figure he darted out from the breach.

Elder Qin immediately covered the gap and commanded in a deep voice, “Repair the formation as quickly as possible—if you cannot finish the repairs within a quarter of an hour I will throw you Formation Masters out into the open!”

The Formation Masters below, upon hearing this, frowned in anxiety but dared not argue; they threw themselves into repairing the formation with all their might.

Outside the city, the instant Yang Kai shot out he felt as if he had fallen into another world—there was no light, only boundless darkness. The black aura flowing around his body contained a terrifying corrosive power, and there seemed to be something else there as well.

The moment Yang Kai leapt out, the Demonic Qi and the monsters pounced on him like ravenous hounds that had found a bone.

For a time, the space in front of Elder Qin became an empty stretch; no Demonic Qi or monsters attempted to pass through the breach into the city.

Seeing this, Elder Qin felt both joy and worry.

The joy was that the Formation Masters could now safely repair the formation and complete the work as quickly as possible.

The worry was whether Yang Kai could hold out until then; if anything happened to him, not only would the mission fail, but the monsters would gain an additional Dao Origin Realm expert.

If that happened… Fenglin City would be in grave danger!

While Elder Qin waited anxiously, several streaks of light suddenly shot over from nearby.

Before long, the lights landed in front of Elder Qin, revealing several figures.

“Yu’er, what are you doing here?” Elder Qin’s face changed drastically upon seeing the frail woman, and he said sternly, “This place is dangerous—return at once.”

That frail woman was Qin Yu, who had once crossed paths with Yang Kai, and within Fenglin City the only Dao Origin Realm expert of the Qin surname was the Qin Family patriarch, Qin Chaoyang.

Qin Yu was unmoved and said, “We heard the patriarch’s situation was dire, so we hurried over to assist…”

As she spoke, Qin Yu glanced around and discovered the area was unusually calm—aside from the breach in the formation before the city wall, there was not a single trace of a monster.

The Demonic Qi and monsters outside, it seemed, were ignoring the breach and showed no inclination to take advantage; instead they churned around the periphery and were gathering toward a certain spot.

“Here…” Qin Yu said, bewildered, “how can this be?”

Qin Chaoyang sighed and said, “A Young Brother charged out to draw those Demonic Qi and monsters away; if not for that, this place would not be so peaceful.”

“Someone rushed out?” several Qin Family members exclaimed in alarm.

None had personally experienced the terror of Demonic Qi, and merely seeing it made their skin crawl; at a time like this, who would dare to charge out to seek death?

Those who had the courage to rush out must have thrown caution to the wind regarding their own lives.

Thinking this, the group felt a sudden respect for the unknown person and admired him inwardly.

“Since you’re here, Yu’er, help me see what’s happening over there!” Qin Chaoyang suddenly remembered and ordered Qin Yu.

“Yes!” Qin Yu inclined her head and then closed her eyes; when she opened them again her eyes had turned silver, with veins of light flowing within. A strange power shot from her gaze and pierced the void.

Qin Yu had long been plagued by a stubborn illness and her health was fragile; using such a Secret Art clearly put a heavy strain on her. After a short while, her delicate body trembled lightly, beads of sweat forming on her brow, and her already pale face drained of even more color.

“How is it?” Qin Chaoyang placed a hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and poured Origin Qi into her while softly asking.

“Eh…” Qin Yu fixed her gaze on the void and let out a small cry as if she had discovered something.

Soon a trace of joy flashed across her face and she exclaimed in surprise, "Is it him?"

After saying that, Qin Yu’s body shook and she slammed her eyes shut, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.

Qin Chaoyang’s expression turned grave; his fingers moved, pressing several vital points on Qin Yu while he took a Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring and popped it into her mouth.

He did not hurry to question her, instead waiting for Qin Yu to sit cross‑legged and catch her breath.

After a short while, Qin Yu opened her beautiful eyes and, invigorated, looked at Qin Chaoyang and asked, "Patriarch, is that person surnamed Yang?"

“You know this man?” Qin Chaoyang’s expression shifted slightly. Thinking back to what Qin Yu had just said, he asked in a thoughtful tone.

"It truly is him!" Qin Yu smiled faintly and said in a low voice, "Patriarch, do you recall that when I returned from outside, I had the clan look into a certain man?"

“I heard something of that,” Qin Chaoyang nodded and said with surprise, “Could the person you sought be him?”

“Yes!” Qin Yu nodded. “Patriarch, this man is no ordinary person; if possible, we should try to draw him into the Qin Family!”

“I already suspected he was unusual…” Qin Chaoyang’s lips twitched into a bitter smile. Who but an extraordinary person would dare charge out of the city alone? “But how did you know?”

Qin Yu said, “Because I watched him ascend to the Dao Origin Realm from afar. Patriarch, did you know that when he broke through the heavens showed terrifying omens—nothing like what an ordinary cultivator would see at ascension. And… at the critical moment of his rise, he still had enough strength left to grievously injure that Ghost‑Hand Shentu!”

“What?” Qin Chaoyang cried in astonishment. “Is that true?”
