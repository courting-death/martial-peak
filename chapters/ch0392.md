## Chapter 392 — Transformation Dragon Pool

The two brothers traveled together, filled with joy and a harmonious atmosphere, as if they were as close as siblings.

Before long, they arrived at the location of the Transformation Dragon Pool.

The outer layer was heavily guarded by countless martial artists, and secretly, many experts closely monitored the area with layers upon layers of Divine Sense.

Should any outsiders attempt to approach, they would be met with ruthless and immediate annihilation! There was no room for negotiation.

There was once a steward from a first-rate family who came to pay tribute to the Yang Family. After delivering the offerings, for some unknown reason, he lost his way and unwittingly wandered ten li outside the Transformation Dragon Pool. Before he had the chance to speak, he was killed on the spot by the guards of the Yang Family stationed there.

After the incident spread, the first-rate family not only did not dare to seek justice but instead sent twice as many gifts as an apology.

The Yang Family's treasure land had always been a highly secure location.

Even though it was within the city of Zhongdu, with the Transformation Dragon Pool at its center, the surrounding area remained in a pristine state. Upon arriving here, one might fear they had mistakenly entered a vast wilderness.

Fog curled around, obscuring visibility, covering a large area; lush green mountains and forests appeared faintly, and it seemed as though there were occasional shadowy figures flitting about within.

At the very depths stood the Transformation Dragon Pool, capable of washing away one’s essence and marrow!

When Yang Zhao and Yang Kai reached here, they hurriedly reduced their voices. Yang Zhao stepped forward and cupped his hands in greeting, "I am Yang Zhao, here at the command of the family to visit the Transformation Dragon Pool. May I ask which senior is overseeing this place?"

From within the mist, a strange voice floated over, "Old man Xiao Zhengqing here. So it is Young Master Zhao who has come, and there is another beside you. Who might that be?"

Before Yang Kai could respond, Yang Zhao promptly took over, smiling, "That would be my younger brother Kai!"

The voice in the mist fell silent for a moment, seemingly pondering who this Kai mentioned by Yang Zhao was. After some time, it said, "Since you have come, please enter, young masters."

As it spoke, the mist swirling before them seemed to be manipulated by two invisible hands, rolling aside to reveal a clear passageway.

At that moment, Yang Kai and Yang Zhao were astonished to find numerous experts from the Yang Family standing on either side of the revealed passage.

The closest of them was less than five zhang away.

These individuals had just been concealed by the mist. The two brothers had failed to notice anyone there and were unaware of the profound secrets hidden within that fog.

These Yang Family experts were evidently different from those outside; their auras were calm and steady, most of them at the True Yuan Realm, with many possessing robust and formidable cultivation. Occasionally, divine roamers were mixed in, all looking sternly at the two.

Yang Zhao and Yang Kai exchanged glances, their expressions turning serious as they straightened up and strode forward.

"Greetings to both young masters!"

"Please, esteemed young masters!"

As they walked, the martial artists respectfully nodded in greeting.

Yang Zhao wore a smile, moving with the grace of a dragon.

Yang Kai, however, remained silent, secretly extending his Divine Sense to sense the surroundings, feeling astonished within.

Although he was also a member of the Yang Family, and particularly the direct line, he understood very little of the immense power the Yang Family truly possessed.

However, upon probing, he abruptly discovered that the martial artists around him were undoubtedly stronger than the typical disciples from first or second-rate sects at the same realm, with significantly greater combat prowess.

Their vitality, physical strength, blood essence, and the quality of their True Yuan seemed to be much purer and more vigorous.

Yang Kai estimated that any two individuals here would be enough to defeat three enemies of the same realm outside.

Of course, this was merely a comparison among ordinary disciples.

Even so, it was quite astonishing.

Moreover, the fog around was rather strange; Delving into it with his Divine Sense felt like plunging into a stagnant pool, with no feedback whatsoever.

There had to be some kind of formation operating here.

After walking for what felt like a stick of incense's worth of time, the front suddenly became clear, the fog abruptly vanishing and revealing a scene that felt like coming to a glimmer of hope in a dark forest.

By the side of a massive water pool sat three elderly men, all with white hair and beards, currently gazing at them with bright eyes.

Upon seeing the two emerge from the mist, one of the elderly men in the center smiled lightly, "Yang Zhao?"

Yang Zhao’s expression tightened as he quickly cupped his fists, "Yes, it is I, greetings to the three seniors!"

To guard the Transformation Dragon Pool meant that regardless of whether these three were surnamed Yang, their status in the Yang Family would not be low, and they could likely be equal to clan elders.

This was why Yang Zhao was so solemn.

Xiao Zhengqing and the other two smiled slightly, seemingly pleased with Yang Zhao's demeanor, and their gaze turned to Yang Kai, questioning, "Is this the fourth from the last generation, Yang Yingfeng’s descendant?"

"Yes, I am Yang Kai, I greet the three seniors," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

He was internally astonished.

These three were all peak experts of the Divine Roaming Realm; in other words, none of them would be inferior to Ling Taixu, who had not yet ascended back then. The fact they were guarding the Transformation Dragon Pool showed how much the Yang Family valued this place.

With the three of them here and the mysterious formation combined with the countless experts concealed within, it was likely that only someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm could bypass this defense.

Upon learning of Yang Kai’s background, Xiao Zhengqing merely nodded, while the other two showed no intent to speak, seemingly more interested in Yang Zhao.

Their clear display of preference did not particularly surprise Yang Kai.

"Senior, why did the family arrange for us to come to the Transformation Dragon Pool this time?" Yang Zhao, seeing that Xiao Zhengqing favored him, could not help but feel curious and hastily asked his question.

Xiao Zhengqing smiled lightly, "Naturally, it’s so that you have better development opportunities. In the past few years outside, you have only ventured within first-rate forces, where resources cannot be compared to what we have in the Yang Family. The cultivation methods and martial skills, along with the pills absorbed, have led to many impurities in your bodies. Entering the Transformation Dragon Pool will help cleanse away those impurities!"

Yang Zhao's face brightened, and he replied respectfully, "I will not disappoint the family’s expectations!"

Xiao Zhengqing laughed heartily, "Good, indeed the son of the family head is different from others. Below is the Transformation Dragon Pool; you may enter at will."

Yang Kai could not help but furrow his brows slightly. Although he did not expect Xiao Zhengqing to think highly of him, hearing those words still left him somewhat displeased.

He had nothing much to say at this moment; he was powerless and positioned poorly. If he said anything harsh now, it would only make him seem ungrateful and overestimating himself.

To change their views, he knew only one way.

That was to place himself above the entire Yang Family; by then, everyone would have to obey and act according to his whims.

Yang Zhao nodded slightly, and both he and Yang Kai looked down, and a giant pool suddenly came into view.

They could only see its outline and could not make out the water within it because a thick layer of fog covered its surface.

But Yang Kai keenly sensed that this layer of fog was different from what they had just passed through.

The previous fog had only been used for deception, while the layer above the Transformation Dragon Pool was formed from the concentration of energies in the heavens and earth, appearing as if the water of the Transformation Dragon Pool itself was a crystallization of energy, emanating vapors to create a layer of fog above.

"The Transformation Dragon Pool is a place that can cleanse one's essence and marrow. This opportunity is rare, so you should cherish it," Xiao Zhengqing smiled.

Another person interjected, "The Transformation Dragon Pool is also a place to test one’s potential. The longer you stay inside, the more it signifies your outstanding qualifications. Yang Zhao, you must perform well. You are not like other young masters; you are the current family head's son, and many have high hopes for you."

Yang Zhao’s face revealed a hint of excitement, seemingly eager to prove himself, as he quickly cupped his fists, "Yes!"

"Go!" With a wave of Xiao Zhengqing's hand, an unseen force enveloped Yang Zhao and Yang Kai, gently sending them into the Transformation Dragon Pool.

The mist swirled as the two vanished into the water.

A piercing cold sensation washed over them; it felt as if the water of the Transformation Dragon Pool truly held some magical effect. Yang Kai distinctly felt energy surging into every acupuncture point and pore of his body, causing an overwhelming tingling sensation.

Yet, just as suddenly, that pain vanished. The energy drilled into his meridians, merging under the refinement of the True Yang Yuan Qi into the Proud Bone Golden Body.

Yang Kai’s face showed confusion; he felt that the Transformation Dragon Pool… seemed to be somewhat overrated.

It didn’t possess the miraculous effects heralded in rumors.

Turning to look at Yang Zhao, who was not far from him, Yang Kai's expression turned even stranger.

He noticed that his second brother appeared to be enduring immense pain, his face flushed and his True Yuan in a frenzy, drawing energy from the Transformation Dragon Pool into himself.

Soon, some impurities were expelled from his body, and the once clear water became tainted with contaminants.

Yang Kai quickly swam away, staring blankly.

From Yang Zhao's current state, it was evident the Transformation Dragon Pool had some efficacy, capable indeed of helping cleanse one’s essence and marrow. But why could he not feel it?

After thinking for a long while, Yang Kai suddenly realized, his expression revealing doubt.

If he guessed correctly, it must be due to the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

The Wan Yao Ling Ye could cleanse one’s essence and marrow and fundamentally improve a person’s qualifications if consumed long-term.

Since obtaining the Wan Yao Ling Ye, he had been diligent, taking a drop daily unless forced by some uncontrollable factor.

After such an extensive period, his impurities had likely been entirely expelled, and his qualifications had surely improved.

Now, entering the Transformation Dragon Pool, what effect would it have on him?

The efficacy of the Transformation Dragon Pool was surely not comparable to that of the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s expression fell into disappointment.

Influenced by his childhood notions, he had been quite hopeful for the effects of the Transformation Dragon Pool, but he hadn’t expected it to be utterly ineffective for him, leaving him somewhat dismayed.

As the Transformation Dragon Pool bore no effect on him, and since they had just entered yet it would be inappropriate to exit directly, Yang Kai felt quite bored, merely remaining by the side, running the True Yang Technique to absorb and refine the energy within the Transformation Dragon Pool.
