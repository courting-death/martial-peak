## Chapter 838 — Dragon Emperor's Might

A sweep of divine sense revealed no signs that any other Saint Realm experts had arrived; while everyone was baffled, the silver leaf wrapped in Yu Tingyi's clothing shot back into Dragon-Phoenix Palace and transformed into a river of stars that stretched out before the old man and the youth.

The river glittered and ran crystal-clear to the bottom, emanating unusual energy fluctuations and containing tremendous latent power.

Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi of Youhan Grotto-Heaven narrowed their eyes and examined the pair suspiciously, only to find that these two intruders were far from formidable in cultivation.

The older man was at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm and looked close to death, incapable of exerting much strength.

The younger one appeared spirited and full of vigor, but he was only at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm—actually weaker than the elder.

Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi hardly regarded such people as threats, but the galaxy-like energy stretched before them made them take notice.

After all, it had been that very secret treasure that had saved Yu Tingyi in her moment of peril, and Yan Zhi—who had struck at her—knew exactly how strange and potent that treasure could be.

At the very least it was a Saint-Grade, Middle-Level secret treasure!

That was a rank even Yan Zhi himself coveted; Youhan Grotto-Heaven did possess Saint-Grade treasures, but only two, and both were Lower-Level—one owned by him and one by Bai Jingchu—each forged at enormous cost and begged of others to produce.

To fashion those two treasures, Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi had nearly emptied out Youhan Grotto-Heaven; even now they had not yet recovered much Yuan Qi.

Who were this old man and young man? Their cultivations were mediocre, yet they could wield such overwhelming treasure—this was extremely odd.

While Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi exchanged doubts, Chen Zhou suddenly narrowed his eyes and called out in surprise, "Sun Yu?"

At a glance he recognized the young man as the disciple who had entered Dragon Valley two years ago, and the person beside him was clearly Ling Jian, the guardian who had stood watch at the Dragon Valley's mouth.

It would have been one thing for the master and disciple to have come out of Dragon Valley, but why had they rushed straight into the battlefield?

Chen Zhou grew frantic—already unsteady over Yu Tingyi's wounds—and seeing Sun Yu appear before a powerful enemy, his own moves faltered; Bai Jingchu, quick to seize the chance, instantly employed a clever technique to pin him down.

Yan Zhi's eyes flicked as he muttered, "I heard the one who went into Dragon Valley had the same name… kid, are you that person?"

"Old fossil, so what if it's me?" Sun Yu replied boldly, admitting it and even hurling an insult at Yan Zhi.

Yan Zhi did not take offense; instead his face lit up and he laughed, "Ha—what a stroke of luck. I worried those people would never find you, yet here you come on your own. Excellent, excellent."

Sun Yu sneered lightly and said, "You mean the five Transcendent Realm cultivators who went into Dragon Valley?"

"How do you know that?" Yan Zhi's eyes narrowed; a vague unease rose in him. Standing before a master like him, the youth's composure seemed excessive—beside the youth, the First Stage Transcendent old man trembled all over, clearly unable to bear Yan Zhi's pressure.

"Of course I know," Sun Yu chuckled. "Because they are dead… dead by my hand!"

"Dead by your hand?" Yan Zhi gaped, shaking his head and sneering, "You speak nonsense—do you imagine such words will convince me? Bragging without weighing your worth is childish!"

Five Transcendent Realm experts were not weak; how could they be slain by a Seventh Stage Divine Roaming youth? Even accounting for the strange treasure in their way, Yan Zhi refused to believe Sun Yu had such ability.

"Believe it or not, the next one will be you," Sun Yu snorted coldly.

"You brat…" Yan Zhi smirked, his laughter hoarse. "Don't rile me—it's not to your benefit. I won't kill you, but I can teach you a lesson. Be sensible and come here, or I'll make you regret it!"

Chen Zhou, caught up in battle with Bai Jingchu, heard the exchange and was so furious he spat blood, roaring, "Ling Jian, you old fool! How could you bring Sun Yu here?!"

He had fought with all his might and could only entangle Bai Jingchu; Yan Zhi was nearly unstoppable—what hope remained now that Sun Yu had appeared before him?

This was Dragon-Phoenix Palace's last hope; Ling Jian had truly misjudged the situation.

"Master need not worry!" Ling Jian stammered no reply, while Sun Yu called out loudly, "I came because I have complete confidence! If Youhan Grotto-Heaven dares violate Dragon-Phoenix Palace, they will pay in blood—I'll make them know we are not to be bullied!" His fierce gaze turned to Yan Zhi. "Old fossil, you are first!"

Sun Yu's youthful boldness, his faith in Yang Kai, made him shout loudly and with conviction; at once every fighter paused and turned to look.

The fighters from Youhan Grotto-Heaven burst into derisive laughter, laced with contempt and mockery, while those from Dragon-Phoenix Palace blushed with shame.

They all thought their youth had overstepped its bounds.

Yan Zhi grinned and stood with his hands clasped behind his back. "Kid, we'll see how you make me pay. I'll stand right here—both of you can come together and attack."

"Heh—those five Transcendent Realm cultivators said the same thing, and then… they died," Sun Yu said with a sinister chuckle.

No sooner had the words left his mouth than a clear, resonant dragon roar resounded, and a streak of astonishing golden light burst forth, illuminating the horizon.

All martial artists below the Saint Realm were blinded in an instant, and felt a terrifying pressure descend from the heavens, pressing so heavily that they dared not draw a breath for fear of being shattered.

Yan Zhi, who had been calm a moment before, saw his expression turn ashen.

Within the dazzling gold light he perceived a massive form lunging toward him; he did not hesitate, hurriedly condensing his defenses and deploying a Spirit-Grade, Middle-Level defensive secret treasure.

If he had not, he feared he would have been killed in an instant.

Boom...

The earth shook, a savage blast of energy swept outward, toppling trees as winds and clouds shifted.

Yan Zhi groaned and was flung backward like a kite, feeling as though he had been struck by an enormous force; the protection before him collapsed in a flash, and the Spirit-Grade treasure itself gave a crisp crack—when he looked down he saw its spirit had failed and it would require repair before it could be used again.

What was that thing that could shatter his Spirit-Grade defensive treasure with a single blow?

As the golden light subsided, Yan Zhi at last made out what had assaulted him.

His eyes narrowed and he froze in place, utterly stunned.

In midair a golden dragon dozens of zhang long peered down with eyes as large as copper gongs, its gaze full of contempt and disdain; under that scrutiny Yan Zhi felt an inexplicable shame.

The golden dragon's form was magnificent, its body cloaked in layers of gleaming golden scales, impenetrable and stately; its claws were razor-sharp, flashing cold light that left no doubt they could rend high-tier secret treasures with ease.

"A qi formation?" Yan Zhi furrowed his brow, but quickly dismissed the thought.

This dragon was too real—far too real to have been formed from True Yuan alone.

In other words, it was a true dragon.

The uncrowned sovereign among the yao, said to be capable of reaching the Ninth-Tier!

Yan Zhi had heard that among the yao were several Great Lords who reached the peak of the Eighth-Tier—some even contained true dragon blood and thus could advance to levels equivalent to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

For the yao, true dragon blood was the most exalted lineage.

Those Great Lords with such bloodlines could cultivate to a level comparable to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—but what stood before Yan Zhi now was an actual true dragon.

This was the fabled Ninth-Tier Demon Emperor, an existence that surpassed the top forces of this world.

Feeling the scalding energy radiating from the golden dragon, Yan Zhi's whole body grew icy.

Yan Zhi stood dumbfounded; Ling Jian, who had come with Sun Yu, also froze, blinking and rubbing his muddled eyes as if to make sure he was not hallucinating.

Even Sun Yu was inexplicably excited, brimming with exhilaration; his eyes shone with worship.

"The Dragon Emperor's might!" Chen Zhou could not help but whisper, staring at the golden dragon in disbelief—he could not have imagined he would one day witness such a sight, nor that Sun Yu could summon such power.

Two years ago this disciple had been anonymous, only at the Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm; though Chen Zhou knew he had received the Dragon Emperor's legacy, he had assumed it would take the Palace decades of careful nurturing to bring him to true strength.

Yet today Sun Yu had just emerged from seclusion and had already confronted a Saint Realm expert, causing the Dragon Emperor's might to manifest once more.

Chen Zhou laughed aloud, convinced that even if he died now, he would have died fulfilling his ancestors' expectations.

Bai Jingchu likewise lost all will to pursue Chen Zhou; he hung suspended in midair, staring at the golden dragon, profound dread surging within him.

Every combatant had paused their actions to witness this staggering scene.

A tidal wave of panic and unease spread outward; all of Youhan Grotto-Heaven's cultivators felt as if they had been plunged into an icehouse, chilled to the bone.
