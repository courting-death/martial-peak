## Chapter 1993 — The Old Swindler

Describing Mo Xiaoqi as a hedgehog was perfectly fitting; wherever she passed, the cultivators could not help but feel unbearable pain and hastily gave way.

For a time, the place where she and Yang Kai stood had formed a vacuum zone five zhang in radius, and not a single person dared come within so much as an inch.

"Eldest Brother Yang, I finally found you — there are so many people here," Mo Xiaoqi said, turning her head to look around like a country bumpkin who had wandered into a great city, everything about her full of wonder.

Yang Kai looked at her with a smile, voice soft: "Xiaoqi..."

"What's the matter?" Mo Xiaoqi asked, then turned; the next moment her face drained of color, a small hand flew to her mouth as she pointed at Yang Kai's shoulder and cried, "Ah, Eldest Brother Yang, your shoulder is spurting blood — who attacked you from behind? How hateful!"

"It's nothing, nothing..." Yang Kai said with an untroubled expression, as if he were used to it; he briefly exerted his power to staunch the flow of blood and added, "Just don't touch me casually next time, or else... I might lose too much blood and die."

Mo Xiaoqi froze for a moment, then blushed deeply; she lowered her head and fidgeted, both hands pinching at the hem of her clothes as if she could make something of it.

"Ha ha, Alchemist Yang—so you're here!"

At that moment, Kang Siran's hearty laugh came from the side; Yang Kai turned to see Shopkeeper Kang striding over.

Yang Kai slightly cupped his fists and said, "Shopkeeper Kang!"

"Seeing Alchemist Yang so full of confidence, I am at ease — it looks like you've prepared well this time," Shopkeeper Kang said.

"I only hope to come out in one piece," Yang Kai replied modestly.

"You are too humble, Alchemist Yang. Inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda the opportunities are countless; Alchemist Yang will surely return laden. Ah — this young lady is..."

"Oh, Xiaoqi is my friend," Yang Kai introduced Mo Xiaoqi to Kang Siran. Though simple-minded, Mo Xiaoqi was not overly familiar with strangers, so she only gave a slight nod and stood quietly beside Yang Kai.

"Alchemist Yang, the dignitary I sent to the Commerce Guild headquarters inquired about the situation — once inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda we will likely be separated. We will be unable to cooperate," Kang Siran said with some disappointment.

Yang Kai's heart stirred and he asked, "So the positions after entering are not fixed?"

He had entered various secret realms and miscellaneous spaces more than once, so he had considerable experience in this regard; Kang Siran's words made one possibility occur to him.

"Exactly so," Kang Siran said gravely. "The internal space of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is an ancient battlefield where the laws of heaven and earth are badly broken — there are many uncertain factors. Therefore, even warriors who enter together may appear in different locations. I once planned to enter with you, but now it seems that was wishful thinking."

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "If we cannot cooperate, others probably cannot either; that's fine — everyone will rely on their own skill."

"Alchemist Yang speaks rightly. I thought of that too, so I came specifically to warn you: inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda there are many naturally formed traps and seals. If Void King Realm warriors like us fall into them, death is very likely. The Star God Palace loses countless disciples there every year; do not be careless."

"Thanks for the warning, Shopkeeper Kang, I'll be careful," Yang Kai said with a slight nod.

The two stood in place and chatted casually for a while.

"By the way, Shopkeeper Kang, who are those people sitting up there?" Yang Kai indicated the high platform before the city lord's mansion with his eyes and asked.

Kang Siran gave an awkward chuckle and said, "Actually, this old man only recognizes three of them. From the left, the second is Lord Lou Chi, vice president of my Ziyuan Commerce Guild; the third is Lord Zeng Yuan, vice president of the Seven-Yao Commerce Guild. The one in the center is the Star God Palace's Silver Star Envoy Lord Xiao Yuyang. As for the remaining few… this old man only knows their origins, not their names."

Mo Xiaoqi piped up, "The first on the left is Tianwu Sacred Land's Chen Wenhao, the first on the right is Wuhua Hall's Feng Ming, and the second on the right is Qingyang Shrine's Gao Xueting."

Yang Kai and Kang Siran both stared at Mo Xiaoqi in astonishment.

"You know them all?" Yang Kai asked.

Mo Xiaoqi giggled, "I've seen many names and portraits of Emperor Realm experts, so I know a bit. Of these people, aside from Star Envoy Xiao Yuyang being at the Emperor Realm's Second Stage, the rest are all at the First Stage."

"Young lady, your knowledge is deep — I admire you!" Kang Siran said, cupping his fists in admiration.

Mo Xiaoqi hastily waved her hand, "It's nothing really."

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly; when Kang Siran introduced those Emperor Realm experts he had even added 'Lord' to show respect, yet Mo Xiaoqi had addressed those Emperor Realm figures simply by name — clearly the girl did not pay such strong heed to these powerful people.

At that moment, within the little Fenglin City there were as many as six Emperor Realm experts gathered — it seemed the top powers of the entire southern region were present; this was a once-in-an-era grand event.

No wonder even the city lord, Duan Yuanshan, had to stand to the side with a smiling face.

The hour had not yet come; though many cultivators waited anxiously, none dared show any sign of it, and few dared speak loudly on the square in front of the city lord's mansion — after all, six Emperor Realm experts sat above; who would dare to act wantonly here?

Yet there were, as always, some reckless fellows hawking their wares in such a place.

"Top-grade healing sacred medicine — the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill! Buy quickly! Flesh and bone returned to life, even the half-dead — so long as there's still a breath, take the Spiritual Pill and you'll be full of vigor. Only three pills in total, a family heirloom not meant for sale, only displayed out of necessity — first come, first served!"

A cry suddenly rang out among the crowd.

Every cultivator was momentarily stunned, then surged in a rush toward the source of the voice.

If one were to say which Spiritual Pills had sold best in Fenglin City over the past two days, it was clearly the various healing Spiritual Pills.

After all, many cultivators were about to enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda — who could guarantee they would not be injured inside? So the shops' stocks of healing Pills had already been swept clean, causing the prices of healing Pills in Fenglin City to generally rise threefold, yet demand still outstripped supply.

Whatever the price, what could compare to one's life? Perhaps a single Healing Pill could save a life at a crucial moment — cultivators naturally would not begrudge spending on themselves.

As early as last night, Fenglin City's healing Pills had been exhausted; not only the premium Healing Pills, even the most ordinary Pills had all been sold out.

So when someone now loudly proclaimed the sale of the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill, claiming it could truly restore flesh to bone and bring back the living dead, how could it not attract everyone's attention?

Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi exchanged a look and both felt a twinge of doubt: "That voice... sounds a little familiar."

"Come buy, come buy — the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill is refined from the legendary Immortal Source Liquid. You know the Immortal Source Liquid, right? It's the essence condensed from the Everlasting Tree, a drop every thousand years, ten thousand times more precious than Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk. Combined with many rare medicinal ingredients and personally refined by an Imperial-Grade alchemy master — passersby, don't miss this chance..."

The hawker's patter continued unabated.

Suddenly Yang Kai recalled whose voice it was.

Mo Xiaoqi had the same realization; she ground her teeth and said angrily, "It's that old con man."

She was already rushing out.

Relying on her hedgehog-like advantage in human form, Mo Xiaoqi forced a bloody path through the bustling crowd and charged straight up to the seller, scolding sharply, "You old con man — you're cheating people again! See if I don't teach you a lesson today."

The seller looked up, recognized Mo Xiaoqi, and his heart gave a jolt. Before she could strike, he pointed behind her, his eyes widening as if he had seen a goddess descend; light flashed from his pupils and he cried out, "Wow — the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda!"

Everyone rejoiced at the shout and turned to look.

But there was no Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda there — that spot was empty.

"Fooled again!" Mo Xiaoqi quickly realized and spun back around.

The old trickster's figure had already vanished without a trace.

"I'm so furious!" Mo Xiaoqi stamped her foot in anger.

A hundred zhang away, somewhere in the crowd, an unkempt old man with a goatee sighed softly to himself, "That was close — almost got caught. Why is my life so hard? That little girl is too much — hunting me down over a few thousand Source Crystals. Bitter, ah, bitter to death!"

After pitying himself for a moment, he tugged on the sleeve of a man beside him and whispered, "Young brother, I see you're also heading into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; do you need a Sacred Medicine to ensure your safety?"

“Oh? Old man, you have a Sacred Medicine for sale?” The man’s interest was immediately piqued.

The old man grinned, showing a mouth of yellow teeth, and secretively produced a jade bottle from his clothes, saying mysteriously, "The Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill — a Spiritual Pill that revives the living to vigor, passed down in the family. Take a look, young brother!"

Seeing Mo Xiaoqi return with a face full of anger, Yang Kai knew she had certainly come back empty-handed.

But Yang Kai felt it odd — when he had dealt with that old fellow in the black market earlier, he had not found anything special about him; he only noted the man's seedy look and assumed he was no good.

After Mo Xiaoqi rushed out, Yang Kai had kept his Divine Sense locked on the old man.

Yet in a single instant the old man had slipped free of his tracking and disappeared from his location.

The old fellow was not someone to be taken lightly after all!

This surprised Yang Kai greatly — his Divine Sense power far exceeded his current cultivation, approaching the Dao Origin Realm's level, yet the other had still managed to elude him; clearly that old man was no ordinary rogue.

Then again, ordinary people generally would not parade about swindling others and using tricks that were so easily seen through.
