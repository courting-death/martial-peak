## Chapter 2578 — The Wood Spirit Race

As Xiaoxiao continued forward, he soon led them into a wide, open clearing.

Seven or eight Stone Spirits had already gathered here, each standing behind a stone plate. Every stone plate was about the size of a millstone, clearly crafted by the Stone Spirit Race themselves to serve as tables.

Behind each stone table, there were also stone stools.

At the foremost stone table, the elderly Stone Spirit Elder had already taken his seat, smiling warmly as he looked in this direction.

As Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi followed Xiaoxiao along, the Stone Spirits standing on either side all saluted them, making Yang Kai feel quite embarrassed. He and Zhang Ruoxi could only return the greetings repeatedly. Each Stone Spirit had lived for countless years—far longer than ninety-nine percent of the people in the Star Realm. Naturally, Yang Kai dared not be disrespectful in their presence.

Below the Elder’s seat, there were two empty stone tables, obviously prepared for Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi.

When they drew near, the Elder raised his hand and said, “Please, honored guests, take your seats!”

Yang Kai offered a word of courtesy and stepped behind the stone table to the Elder’s right before taking his seat. Zhang Ruoxi glanced around, then silently settled herself at the other table.

Xiaoxiao, meanwhile, darted to the very back, squeezing in at a table with a Stone Spirit, acting quite mischievous. The Stone Spirit raised his hand and knocked him, producing a dull thud.

Instantly, Xiaoxiao became much more well-behaved.

“Guests have come from afar. My Stone Spirit Race is deeply honored. We have prepared a banquet for our esteemed guests, so please do not mind our humble arrangements,” the Elder laughed, his voice booming like thunder, shaking the ears.

Yang Kai stood and replied, “Elder, you are too courteous. It is my honor to be received by your noble tribe. How could I dare complain?”

The Elder smiled and nodded, gesturing for Yang Kai to sit. Then he spoke, “My Stone Spirit Race is naturally few in number. All those present are the last of our race. Each of you, please introduce yourselves to our guests, so they do not become confused.”

“Yes!” The Stone Spirits below responded, then each stood, saluted Yang Kai, and introduced themselves: “Shi Yi!”

“Shi Er!”

“Shi San!”

…

“Shi Ba!”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, his mouth twitching.

The Stone Spirits’ names were certainly simple—each named after a number. Including the Elder and Xiaoxiao, there were only ten tribe members in total, truly rare to an absurd degree.

The key was that their introductions didn’t help much. Yang Kai looked them over and still felt they were all cut from the same mold, unable to tell who was who.

Though he couldn’t distinguish them, proper etiquette was still required. Yang Kai returned each greeting, pretending to remember, though in truth he was completely lost.

When all eight Stone Spirits had finished introducing themselves, the Elder laughed and said, “My Stone Spirit Race is naturally limited to ten. If we exceed ten, calamity follows. Such is fate.”

Yang Kai asked in surprise, “Your race has never had more than ten members?”

The Elder nodded, “That’s right!”

Yang Kai suddenly understood. No wonder, back then, although he obtained two Stone Spirit embryos, only Xiaoxiao hatched. The other was forced to become his Incarnation, surviving only through that method.

He had thought it was bad luck, but now it seemed it wasn’t a problem with his nurturing—it was fate.

He wondered what reaction the Stone Spirits would have if he released his Incarnation.

The Elder continued, “Though our tribe is few in number, we have always kept to ourselves and avoided conflict with the world. It is only by clinging to this way of life that we have managed to survive until now. Please forgive us if our situation seems laughable to you, honored guests.”

Yang Kai hurriedly waved his hand.

“Enough idle talk, let the banquet begin.” The Elder laughed, raising his voice, “Our place is simple, and we have little to offer. We present some spirit fruits and spirit wine—please do not disdain them.”

“Not at all!” Yang Kai replied, though his face was full of doubt.

The Elder claimed to offer spirit fruits and wine, but Yang Kai saw nothing. All ten Stone Spirits, including Xiaoxiao, sat firmly in place, unmoving, their eyes full of anticipation as they gazed into the depths of the forest.

What was going on? Yang Kai was full of suspicion but could only wait and see.

The Elder suddenly clapped his hands, as if summoning something.

Instantly, the surrounding trees shone brightly, multicolored rays blossoming from the depths of the forest. The ribbons entwined among the treetops and branches suddenly came alive.

Amidst the hazy light, tiny figures flew through the air, each stepping on the floating ribbons, their bodies radiating strange glows, as if celestial beings had descended. The scene was breathtaking.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened. He saw tiny figures, each about the length of his arm, appearing mysteriously. These little beings seemed not to be made of flesh and blood; their bodies shimmered with light, each exquisitely carved, as if sculpted from jade.

The forest suddenly became lively, with over a hundred such little people pouring in from all directions. There were both males and females—the males handsome and refined, the females beautiful and elegant. They wore short skirts, their delicate arms and legs exposed, their skin as white as snow.

Each little person carried something in their hands, flying to the stone tables and placing their items in turn.

Soon, every stone table was adorned with stone cups, wine jars, and baskets of fragrant spirit fruits. The baskets were woven from vines, exquisitely crafted, each filled with different varieties of spirit fruits, all washed and ready to taste.

Yang Kai and Ruoxi had never seen such beings before, staring wide-eyed in amazement.

A female little person fluttered over to Yang Kai, set down the tiny blue basket looped over her arm, and looked up—only to find Yang Kai staring at her wide-eyed, utterly transfixed. Her cheeks instantly flushed a rosy red. Covering her face in embarrassment, she hurriedly retreated, her shyness so endearing that Yang Kai felt rather awkward, thinking he must have startled her.

Over at Zhang Ruoxi’s table, she reached out a finger to poke a female little person’s cheek, but the little one slapped her finger away, pouted, and walked off angrily.

Ruoxi stuck out her tongue, but her beautiful eyes remained fixed on the little people.

The tiny, beautiful beings naturally piqued her interest. She secretly wished she could take a few home to raise.

“Elder, who are these…” Yang Kai finally regained his composure and turned to the Stone Spirit Elder.

The Elder laughed and said, “These are the Wood Spirit Race. They live alongside my Stone Spirit Race and are our most steadfast allies!” He paused, then continued, “My Stone Spirit Race relies on them for many things, while the Wood Spirit Race is not skilled in combat and struggles to survive in this Ancient Land, needing our protection. So we help each other.”

Yang Kai nodded in understanding, “I see.”

These little people certainly didn’t seem suited for battle. Any demonic beast could probably wipe out a whole group. The ancient land was dangerous, so survival depended on strong protectors.

The Stone Spirit Race was undoubtedly their support.

This journey to the Ancient Land had truly broadened his horizons. Not only had he met many of Xiaoxiao’s kin, he had also encountered the wondrous Wood Spirit Race—beings whose very existence was unknown to most.

As they spoke, a female Wood Spirit who looked different from the others flew over. She wore more ornate clothing and possessed a nobler, purer aura. Her delicate face was shrouded in a layer of white light, appearing sacred and inviolable, with a unique laurel crown atop her head.

The Elder said, “This is the Wood Spirit Race’s Chief, Mu Na.”

Yang Kai hurriedly stood and said, “Yang Kai greets Senior Mu!”

Though this Wood Spirit Chief was only as tall as his arm and seemed quite petite, as a tribe leader, she must have lived for countless years. Addressing her as Senior was only proper.

Mu Na smiled gently, raising her hand, “Since you are a guest of the Stone Spirit Race, you are also a guest of my Wood Spirit Race. Treat this place as your home—no need for formalities.”

The Elder laughed, “It’s usually difficult to taste the Wood Spirit Race’s spirit fruits and wine. Today, thanks to our honored guests, we can feast to our hearts’ content.”

Mu Na pursed her lips and smiled, “Elder, don’t lie with your eyes open. When have the spirit fruits and wine we grow and brew ever been lacking for you?”

The Stone Spirits laughed dryly, clearly accustomed to getting food and drink from the Wood Spirit Race.

Yang Kai could tell that the relationship between the two tribes was not simply one of dependence and protection. It must be extremely close, otherwise the Elder and the Wood Spirit Chief wouldn’t speak so casually.

The Elder raised his hand, “With the arrival of our honored guests, the grand occasion is as promised—let us drink until we drop!”

The Stone Spirits below immediately howled like ghosts and wolves, pounding the stone tables, making it seem as if they were about to go to war. Yang Kai was startled, wondering how such a violent bunch could coexist peacefully with the Wood Spirit Race.

Even Xiaoxiao was getting carried away, excited beyond measure.

A dozen female Wood Spirits immediately flew out, coming to each table, huffing and puffing as they lifted wine jars to fill everyone’s stone cups.

The female Wood Spirit serving Yang Kai seemed to be the same one he had stared at earlier, who had flown away shyly. Watching her struggle with the wine jar, Yang Kai felt a bit guilty and quickly said, “Let me do it myself, no need to trouble you.”

Hearing this, the female Wood Spirit turned to look at him, her eyes instantly reddening, tears welling up—truly pitiful.

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, unsure what he had said wrong, and quickly looked to the Elder for help.

The Elder laughed, “The Wood Spirit Race is extremely reserved, but if someone becomes their guest, they will experience their hospitality. Serving wine to guests is their most basic etiquette. If a guest refuses, it means they feel the tribe hasn’t done well enough, and the whole tribe will shun them.”
