## Chapter 16 — Body Tempering, Fifth Stage

This realization filled Yang Kai with excitement. He had spent three years cultivating within Lingxiao Pavilion, only reaching Body Tempering – Third Stage. Yet ever since obtaining the Wordless Black Book, he had broken through to the Fourth Stage the very next day. Now, just two days later, he was on the verge of another breakthrough. Even Yang Kai himself found this pace of cultivation somewhat terrifying.

Practicing the Body Tempering Chapter consumed a tremendous amount of energy. Yang Kai rested for quite some time before gradually recovering. After finishing the last few rice balls, he set off once more on his quest for medicinal herbs.

Having searched all the places he remembered where herbs might grow yesterday, today was a matter of luck. Fortunately, these Common Grade herbs were not highly valued, so not everyone bothered to gather them, ensuring some harvest.

Throughout the entire day, Yang Kai found seven or eight more herbs, even two Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers. At last, he had collected all the herbs needed for his cultivation, though the quantity was somewhat meager.

Time passed swiftly, and as night fell, Yang Kai was still wandering through the forest. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to rest—he was simply too hungry.

He had hoped to hunt some game today but hadn’t even encountered a single rabbit. Only a few wild berries, no larger than fingernails, were found—sour and bitter, they made his teeth ache, and after eating them, his hunger only intensified.

If only he had made more rice balls to bring along! Regret weighed heavily on him. In this remote wilderness, with no village or shop nearby, where could he find food?

Just as his hunger became unbearable, Yang Kai suddenly noticed a flicker of firelight ahead in the forest. His spirit stirred, and he hurried toward it.

Anyone daring to light a fire in the wilds was either a fool with no experience or a seasoned expert without fear. This time, Yang Kai encountered the latter.

As he approached the campfire, a sharp voice rang out: “Who goes there?”

At the same moment, Yang Kai felt a tightening sensation on his skin, a chill running down his spine. Looking closely, he saw two figures by the fire—a tall, muscular man and a shorter one, both watching him with extreme vigilance.

The tall man held a bow, fully drawn, arrow pointed directly at him. Beside him stood a boy of about eleven or twelve years old. Though young, the boy’s eyes gleamed brightly, showing no fear but rather a keen eagerness. The boy also held a bow, though much smaller and likely less powerful.

Despite having two drawn bows aimed at him, Yang Kai felt no anger. When traveling, one must always be cautious; their actions were understandable.

“Don’t be alarmed. I’m just here to gather herbs,” Yang Kai quickly explained.

Hearing this, the two men scrutinized him more carefully. The burly man slowly lowered his bow and patted the boy, signaling him to relax. Then he smiled and said, “I thought the firelight might have attracted some fierce beast. What a false alarm.”

“Sorry, sorry,” Yang Kai replied with an embarrassed smile.

The burly man was straightforward and hospitable. He beckoned, “Come over. The night wind is cold, and life is hard enough out here.”

Yang Kai thanked him and stepped forward to sit by the fire. The man continued to appraise Yang Kai, noticing his lean frame and feeling a touch of sympathy.

Since they were sitting together, conversation naturally followed. Yang Kai learned that the two were father and son, living at the foot of the mountain and making a living by hunting. Though their life was not wealthy, it was enough to get by. The boy, though young, was already skilled in the hunting grounds, having accompanied his father many times into Black Wind Mountain. His experience in the wild far surpassed Yang Kai’s.

Yang Kai introduced himself in turn. Upon learning he was a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, the man was somewhat surprised, and the boy’s curiosity grew even more. His dark eyes kept flickering toward Yang Kai.

The man said, “My son wanted to learn martial arts too, but his talent wasn’t sufficient, so he was rejected. That’s why he admires martial artists like you so much.”

These words reminded Yang Kai of his own experiences over the past three years, stirring a deep sense of empathy. He reached out to pat the boy’s head.

As they spoke, Yang Kai’s stomach suddenly growled loudly. The boy was momentarily stunned, then smiled and took out some rations from his bag, offering them to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was touched but hesitated to accept. He glanced at the burly man, who smiled and said, “Eat it. You don’t look like you’ve had much today.”

Yang Kai no longer refused and quickly devoured the food.

After chatting a while longer, the three settled around the fire to rest. Yang Kai did not dare to sleep deeply, remaining lightly asleep and alert, ready to protect the hunter and his son should any danger arise. In this way, he repaid their kindness.

However, the night passed without incident.

At dawn, before the father and son awoke, Yang Kai quietly left, leaving behind two herbs as a token of gratitude for the meal.

These herbs, when crushed, had some healing properties. The hunters, living in the wilds year-round, would surely find them useful.

As the eastern sky filled with purple light, Yang Kai practiced the Body Tempering Chapter for half an hour. When he finished, a breath of purple qi entered his body, causing his meridians to tremble violently. A warm sensation spread throughout him, and his qi sense surged, swirling endlessly within his channels.

Body Tempering, Fifth Stage! The feeling he had yesterday was indeed correct—he was about to advance. After just half an hour of cultivation today, he had truly broken through in one leap.

Yang Kai was overjoyed, his anticipation for the Indomitable Golden Body Technique growing ever stronger.

Calculating the time, he had only possessed the Indomitable Golden Body for a few days but had already broken through twice. This cultivation speed was simply unparalleled. And this was with limited cultivation time; if he could train constantly, how fast would he advance?

Even Yang Kai found himself astonished. Yet, Body Tempering was only the foundational stage for martial artists, so naturally, progress was quicker. As he rose through the realms, the speed of advancement would likely slow.

After resting briefly, Yang Kai resumed his search for herbs.

That day, he gathered a considerable amount—more than a dozen herbs—and even caught a fat rabbit, relieving his hunger.

On the third day in the mountains, Yang Kai ventured deeper into Black Wind Mountain, nearly reaching the thirty-li outer limit. Beyond this point, he dared not proceed further. With his current strength, encountering a fierce beast or bird of prey would mean only one thing: flight. He might even become prey himself.

Though he did not go far, today’s harvest was much greater than the previous two days combined—over twenty herbs. Counting the earlier days, he had collected nearly forty herbs in total. Yet the two specific herbs he needed remained scarce.

Gathering forty Common Grade low-quality herbs in three days was not a small feat. Exchanging them for Contribution Points at the sect would yield a fair sum. However, this took up much of his cultivation time, making it somewhat counterproductive.
