## Chapter 176 — The Embarrassment of the Earth Demon

The fierce Primordial Qi surged forth with Yang Kai's punch, and as soon as he made contact, he swiftly retreated, evading the long tail of the giant snake that was sweeping toward him.

The giant snake turned around, ready to pounce. Suddenly, the spot where Yang Kai had struck it emitted three muffled thuds, and to the naked eye, a large chunk of flesh bulged outward. The scorching True Yang Yuan Qi erupted within the flesh, causing the area to burst open, blood gushing forth.

The giant snake writhed in pain, its body over ten zhang long resembling a whip being swung, stirring up a cloud of dust atop the mountain peak.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, realizing he had somewhat overestimated the strength of this giant snake.

When he first saw such a large creature, he thought it was at least a fifth or sixth rank demon beast, but to his surprise, a single strike had already wounded it.

It was not even at the fifth or sixth rank; at most, it could only be considered a fourth rank demon beast, equivalent to a Separation and Union Realm martial artist.

It had grown so large and had such an impressive appearance for nothing.

With this understanding, Yang Kai's feet shifted, and as the giant snake rolled, he struck again. The snake's rolling became even more frantic. However, it clearly did not intend to sit idly by; its long tail whipped around, creating a howling wind as it swept toward Yang Kai.

Without the aid of his footwork, this strike would have posed a significant threat to Yang Kai, but with his footwork, dodging such an attack was a simple matter.

The giant snake missed its target and hissed, expelling a cloud of blood-red mist from its mouth. If Yang Kai hadn't reacted quickly, he would have been enveloped by it.

Yang Kai's expression was cold. He was not afraid of this giant snake; it was merely the poisonous mist it spewed that was somewhat troublesome. However, it was only a minor inconvenience; by holding his breath and avoiding the mist, the giant snake could not harm him in the slightest.

While Yang Kai battled the giant snake outside, the Earth Demon, wrapped around the Soul-Breaking Spike, was also busy inside the snake's abdomen. Although the Earth Demon could not exert much strength at the moment, any creature's body was inherently fragile. No matter how dull the Soul-Breaking Spike was, it was still a weapon.

Soon, the giant snake's body was riddled with wounds. The intense pain rendered it unable to continue fighting Yang Kai, its long body curling and straightening as it rolled back and forth atop the mountain.

Yang Kai watched coldly, feeling no need to intervene further.

Though the giant snake was not particularly strong, its vitality was exceedingly robust. The Earth Demon tormented it for a full half-hour before it finally ceased its struggles and died on the ground.

The giant snake's abdomen twitched. The Earth Demon, wrapped around the Soul-Breaking Spike, emerged, floating in front of Yang Kai, and they exchanged indifferent glances. They were at a loss for words for a moment.

"Young Master... next time something like this happens, please inform this old servant in advance, so we can be mentally prepared," the Earth Demon said, feeling somewhat wronged. Suddenly being thrown into the mouth of a demon beast like that would have scared anyone with a timid disposition out of their wits.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded seriously.

The Earth Demon dared not speak further.

Yang Kai then asked, "Don't you find this demon beast a bit strange?"

"What's strange about it?" the Earth Demon asked cautiously.

"Its strength... is very low! At least, it's lower than I expected!"

The Earth Demon chuckled, "Young Master, this giant snake only became like this after swallowing the Blood Condensing Pearl, so it naturally has no real abilities. Moreover, have you discovered any traces of demon beasts in this area on your journey?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"That's right. This creature might have just been an ordinary little snake. After swallowing the Blood Condensing Pearl and miraculously surviving, it grew into a demon beast. You could say it is the only demon beast in this area."

"An ordinary little snake turned into such a large creature?" Yang Kai exclaimed, "Impressive."

After a moment of thought, he felt a bit excited and said, "If a small snake can swallow it, then I should be able to as well."

"Nothing is absolute in this world. If the Young Master is unsure, you can first try swallowing the inner core of this demon beast," the Earth Demon suggested.

"That sounds good." Yang Kai nodded.

He approached the giant snake, opened its body, and retrieved the inner core.

This inner core was also blood-red, but only the size of a pigeon egg. It still contained remnants of the energy from the Blood Condensing Pearl.

After instructing the Earth Demon to protect him, Yang Kai wiped the inner core on his clothes and directly stuffed it into his mouth.

As he activated the True Yang Technique, Yang Kai quickly felt a surge of energy spreading in his abdomen, rushing into his flesh, mixed with many evil auras.

This must be the aura of the fallen demon that had once been here.

In an instant, Yang Kai's flesh turned a brilliant red, vibrant as blood, and he appeared to be filled with a sinister energy.

Though he looked fearsome on the outside, there was actually not much danger within. Yang Kai merely felt a slight impact on his mind but quickly steadied himself. The True Yang Yuan Qi in his meridians was the natural nemesis of evil energy, so he had no reason to fear it.

Under the operation of the True Yang Technique, the evil energy was gradually refined, leaving only its essence behind.

The essence obtained this time was not of the Yang attribute, so it would not condense into Yang Liquid. However, strangely, it was not absorbed by the Proud Bone Golden Body but instead integrated into Yang Kai's flesh, invigorating every cell in his body and making every muscle ripple with energy.

It took Yang Kai an entire day to gradually refine the inner core. When he opened his eyes again, his gaze was like lightning, and he felt that he was somewhat different.

It was not a matter of increased strength or a leap in mental state, but rather a change in his body. Compared to before refining the inner core, he felt significantly stronger, with the energy and blood within him surging with a powerful force, as if he could break through the heavens without using Primordial Qi.

"Young Master, how do you feel?" the Earth Demon asked with concern.

"Not bad. Is the main effect of the Blood Condensing Pearl to improve the body?" Yang Kai inquired.

"Naturally. It is transformed from the essence of the little demon's flesh and blood. It may also enhance one's realm a bit, but the greatest benefit is to strengthen the physical constitution."

"Then why did you say it would greatly increase one's strength?" Yang Kai pressed.

The Earth Demon hesitated for a moment and replied, "Young Master, your understanding is somewhat one-sided. An increase in strength does not only refer to a rise in realm. The strength of the physical body, the purity of Primordial Qi, and the understanding of martial arts and techniques can all contribute to an increase in strength. For example, you are now much stronger in physical constitution compared to a few days ago, so your strength must have increased."

Yang Kai was taken aback, contemplating for a long while before saying, "Mm, you are right; my thinking was too narrow."

"Young Master is young and simply hasn't thought of this layer yet," the Earth Demon said, not daring to take credit.

Glancing at the three remaining Blood Condensing Pearls on the giant stone, Yang Kai did not hesitate any longer and reached out to touch one of them.

As soon as he made contact, the Blood Condensing Pearl seemed to possess a spirit of its own and directly burrowed into Yang Kai's body.

An even more violent energy erupted within him, causing Yang Kai to involuntarily grunt and quickly close his eyes to meditate.

For the next half month, Yang Kai did nothing but refine the energy from the three Blood Condensing Pearls. Not only that, but he also absorbed all the blood energy remaining in the giant stone.

His overall vitality was more than doubled compared to half a month ago. Both his speed and the power of his punches had significantly improved.

Moreover, he had also achieved a breakthrough in his cultivation, advancing to the Qi Movement Realm Third Stage.

Half a month later, urged by the impatient Earth Demon, Yang Kai finally reached out and moved the massive stone. Without using Primordial Qi, he relied solely on his brute strength to easily lift the stone, which weighed at least three thousand jin.

Underneath the stone was a cool cave, filled with a dense black mist, clearly the residual evil energy that had lingered in this area, and the source of the influence on the right half of the Yunxia Peninsula.

As soon as the black mist saw the light of day, it surged toward Yang Kai.

The Earth Demon chuckled, "Little thing, you dare to use tricks that this old man has already played? Truly unaware of the vastness of heaven and earth!"

The Earth Demon was referring to their first awkward encounter, when it had tried to seize Yang Kai's body but ended up being subdued instead.

As he spoke, the Earth Demon transformed into a mass of black mist and charged forward.

The two masses of black mist merged into one, and a fierce battle ensued within the cave. Yang Kai could not discern the outcome, but he thought to himself that since the Earth Demon was an old demon, it should have no problem.

After waiting for a while, Yang Kai asked, "Does this demon's soul still exist like yours, lingering in the world?"

The Earth Demon’s somewhat embarrassed voice came back, "Uh... Young Master, his soul has long since... shattered. Now, there is only a trace of residual thought left!"

Yang Kai frowned, "Oh... what’s wrong with you?"

"Cough, cough..." The Earth Demon suddenly felt embarrassed, "I ask the Young Master... to lend this old servant a hand. I am having some trouble... defeating him!"

Yang Kai's expression instantly became interesting, and he struggled to suppress a laugh, "Isn't this just a little demon? How can you not defeat it?"

Hearing the teasing in Yang Kai's tone, the Earth Demon nearly cried, "Yes, yes, yes, it is a little demon, but this old servant died earlier than it! I was sealed in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, and my soul is nearly shattered. Young Master, if you don't help, this old servant fears he will be swallowed by it."

Realizing the situation was quite serious, Yang Kai straightened his face and asked, "How can I help?"

"This ignorant little brat's residual thought wants to occupy your body. You just need to let it in a little, just like last time in the Inheritance Celestial Cave."

This was simple enough. Yang Kai directly reached out and probed into the cave.

In an instant, a chill rushed into his body through his arm. Yang Kai chuckled, feeling no worry.

Sure enough, under the operation of the True Yang Technique, this chill was refined and burned away. Faint cries of agony could be heard, and in the end, only a small amount of essence remained, which was absorbed into the Proud Bone Golden Body.

With Yang Kai's strong assistance, the Earth Demon finally turned the tide, and after an hour, it gained the upper hand.

"Enough, enough! Young Master, just watch from the side. Let this old servant show you how to swallow this little thing!" The Earth Demon, fearing that Yang Kai would absorb too much of the evil energy, quickly spoke up.

It was also muttering to itself, wondering how this Young Master could absorb so much energy. Wasn’t he cultivating a Yang attribute technique? Truly strange.

Hearing this, Yang Kai withdrew his hand from the cave and no longer paid attention to the Earth Demon. He took out a medicinal herb from his pouch and began to chew on it.

These herbs he had picked were all familiar to him and were non-toxic. It would be best to take them out and refine them into pills to maximize their efficacy.

However, Yang Kai was currently trapped, and there was no opportunity to refine the herbs into pills. Although directly consuming them was somewhat wasteful, he had no choice at the moment.

The battle between the Earth Demon and the black mist lasted an entire day until the two masses of black mist finally merged into one.

This battle significantly increased the Earth Demon's strength.

The Earth Demon’s voice rang out, "Thank you, Young Master. This old servant has not let you down."

Yang Kai couldn't help but cough lightly.

The Earth Demon felt embarrassed, "I will enter seclusion for a few days."

With that, it hurriedly burrowed into Yang Kai's body.
