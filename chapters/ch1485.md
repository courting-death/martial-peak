## Chapter 1485 — Fallen Emperor Mountains Anomaly

Qu Zheng and Fang Peng's conspiracy was something Yang Kai naturally knew nothing about; at this moment he was still speeding toward the direction of Yingyue Hall, and as usual when passing through a town he would wildly purchase any useful Spiritual Pills he found.

The Saint Crystals inside the Spatial Ring shrank at an astonishing rate, but in exchange a myriad of Spiritual Pills of varying grades increased.

The haul was enormous.

Three months later, Yang Kai stood suspended in midair, staring at a city not far away.

Tianyun City!

His gaze shifted; fifty li from Tianyun City lay a small, ravaged mountain range — Dragon Lair Mountain!

That had been Yang Kai's first stop after arriving at Dark Star, and it was there he made many friends, raised numerous enemies, and let himself slowly grow. Unfortunately, the distinctive little range run by Wu Yi and Yang Yan and others was destroyed in that great battle.

Times change; Yang Kai stared at the desolate Dragon Lair Mountain as if he could see his rapid growth over the past ten years.

After a while he slowly shook his head, reined in his mind, and headed straight for Tianyun City.

He had flown here from the Flowing Flame Sandland, which had taken a full three months, but he had not wasted that time; while he could not train, he could certainly contemplate and refine the gains he had brought back from the Imperial Garden.

Yang Kai had completely absorbed the latter half of the Demon Blood Threads secret technique; given enough time to cultivate, he could extend the Golden Blood Threads' transformative paths and increase their power in battle.

He would also take out the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy from time to time to read, always gaining something new.

These three months had been incomparably fulfilling for him.

At the towering, magnificent city lord's mansion Yang Kai strode up and was stopped by the martial artists guarding the exterior; the lead warrior sized him up, changed color, clasped his fists solemnly and said, “Tianyun City's Chen Qi pays respects to Sect Master Yang.”

“Oh? You recognize me.” Yang Kai smiled pleasantly at the speaker, somewhat surprised.

The man named Chen Qi scratched his head and respectfully replied, “When Sect Master Yang caused such a commotion in Tianyun City, I once saw you from afar, so…”

“I see.” Yang Kai nodded lightly. Since someone recognized him, things would be easier. He spoke: “Is Lord Fei in? I have some matters to discuss with him.”

With that he strode directly inward.

Chen Qi, however, blocked his way, showing an awkward expression. Embarrassed, he said, “Replying to Sect Master Yang, the city lord is not currently in the city.”

“Not in?” Yang Kai was taken aback. He had not expected his long trip to end in an empty reception and felt annoyed. After a moment he asked, “Then where is Elder Qian?”

“Elder Qian is not here either.” Chen Qi grew more awkward.

“Um… where did they go?” Yang Kai looked speechless — he had only recently returned from the Imperial Garden; why would these two leave without properly checking their gains?

“The elder and the city lord went together to the Fallen Emperor Mountains.” Chen Qi hurriedly answered.

“To the Fallen Emperor Mountains for what?” Yang Kai frowned.

Chen Qi asked in surprise, “Sect Master Yang, haven't you heard of the anomaly at the Fallen Emperor Mountains?”

“What anomaly?” Yang Kai instantly grew interested.

Half an hour later Yang Kai departed Tianyun City, summoned his Star Shuttle, and sped toward the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

From Chen Qi he finally learned some details.

Within the Fallen Emperor Mountains a great number of ancient martial artists' cave dwellings had appeared, and there were even rumors of a sect ruin! The news was explosive, and once it spread it immediately drew countless Dark Star martial artists to explore the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

Moreover, this was not false rumor — it was true.

Some had found defiant, heaven-defying techniques and secret arts within; some obtained vast treasures; others had discovered top-grade Secret Treasures.

It was said that even Void King-Grade Secret Treasures had surfaced.

Of course that claim might be exaggerated; Void King-Grade Secret Treasures were rare on any star because there were so few artificers capable of forging such treasures.

Yet undeniable was that the Fallen Emperor Mountains had become the focal point of Dark Star.

Yang Kai had been to the Fallen Emperor Mountains once before, when he and Fei Zhi Tu and the others had gone in to rescue Qian Tong. The range was called the Fallen Emperor Mountains because of rumors that the Starry Sky Emperor had fallen there.

The long-existing Imperial Might within the Fallen Emperor Mountains lent great credence to that tale.

The deeper one ventured, the stronger the Imperial Might became!

Before the Imperial Garden's birth, many Dark Star martial artists who reached the Origin Returning Realm would enter the Fallen Emperor Mountains to use the Imperial Might to temper their own Shi; the deeper they went, the stronger the Imperial Might grew.

No martial artist could enter deep into the Fallen Emperor Mountains because none could withstand the oppression of Imperial Might.

Yet after the Imperial Garden came into being, the Imperial Might that had long shrouded the range disappeared.

The reason lay with the Imperial Garden.

The Imperial Garden had originally been located countless zhang beneath the Fallen Emperor Mountains, which was why Imperial Might had enveloped the range; once the Imperial Garden manifested, however, its Imperial Might could no longer affect the mountain.

Where once no one could penetrate the Fallen Emperor Mountains, now nothing could stop martial artists from exploring it.

Initially only a few curious martial artists ventured in and discovered a hidden ancient cave dwelling, reaping great benefits; these men were crafty and kept the discovery to themselves.

Had they not slain one another over unequal shares, the news might never have leaked out.

Previously all attention on Dark Star had been fixed on the Imperial Garden, so changes and news from the Fallen Emperor Mountains had attracted little notice.

But once the world's attention shifted away from the Imperial Garden, the Fallen Emperor Mountains instantly became a hot prize.

Especially after news spread of the mountain being full of ancient cave dwellings and sect ruins, Dark Star nearly boiled over; countless martial artists rushed in droves to the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

This had happened only three or four months ago, just as Yang Kai left Lingxiao Sect; during his travels he only bought a lot of Spiritual Pills and immersed himself in study of the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy and the Demon Blood Threads secret technique, so he had not paid attention to outside rumors and it was natural he would be unaware.

Only now, arriving in Tianyun City, did he learn of it.

Yang Kai was naturally very interested in ancient martial artists' cave dwellings and sect ruins; since he had not heard before, it was fine, but now that he knew he did not mind visiting. He could also look for Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu and avoid wasting time waiting in Tianyun City.

After a brief inquiry Yang Kai set off straight for the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

Flying along, he found many martial artists headed the same way toward the Fallen Emperor Mountains — clearly the rumors were not baseless, otherwise so many would not have been drawn.

Yang Kai naturally remembered the location of the Fallen Emperor Mountains; it was not too far from Tianyun City.

Ten days later, a streak of radiance shot from outside the Fallen Emperor Mountains; when the light faded Yang Kai's figure appeared.

Looking down at the countless martial artists, Yang Kai frowned.

He had not expected the area outside the Fallen Emperor Mountains to be so lively.

A rough count showed that several tens of thousands of martial artists lingered at the perimeter, and their levels varied widely.

True Yuan Realm, Divine Roaming Realm, Transcendent Realm, Saint Realm…

There were even those below the True Yuan Realm, at the Separation and Union Realm.

What were they doing here? Yang Kai watched in astonishment; with such cultivation and such levels, rashly entering a dangerous place was tantamount to courting death.

But on reflection he relaxed.

Those who chose the path of cultivation were not afraid to take risks; he himself had passed through those very realms and knew well that places of greater danger often yielded greater gains and fostered faster growth.

If one of these martial artists were to strike it amazingly lucky and find an ancient cave dwelling, they might never again worry about cultivation resources.

Moreover, now that not a trace of Imperial Might remained in the Fallen Emperor Mountains, even ordinary people could enter without fearing for their safety.

The Fallen Emperor Mountains differed from other ranges; because Imperial Might had long held sway, there had been no living creatures inside, so martial artists entering did not need to fear vicious or powerful demonic beasts.

The only thing to worry about was fellow martial artists.

Killing for treasure was likely commonplace here, but so long as one did not venture too deep and acted within one's means, one might avoid perishing.

As these thoughts flickered through his mind, Yang Kai quickly understood why so many lower-strength martial artists had gathered here.

Furthermore, some were not planning to delve into the Fallen Emperor Mountains; they were simply taking the opportunity to do business. In the densely packed areas countless stalls were set up on the ground selling all manner of goods.

Some stalls did brisk business and had crowds bargaining with the stall owners, resembling a noisy market.

Yang Kai gave a soft, wry laugh.

Other people's affairs were none of his concern; his trip to the Fallen Emperor Mountains was merely by chance. What he needed now was to see if he could find Qian Tong or Fei Zhi Tu — if not, a casual exploration here would do.

If he found gains he would be pleased; if not, it would do no harm.

With that thought he smoothed his robe and descended.

He had barely retracted the Star Shuttle when several martial artists rushed up to him, each wearing ingratiating smiles and clasping their fists in salute from a distance.

Yang Kai's brow tightened; he did not know what they wanted, but he would not strike a smiling face, so he stood there and watched them approach, asking when they came close, “Do you need something?”

“Wu Chang of Tianjue Sect greets this friend,” said one of the martial artists, the shrewdest-looking among them, hastily stepping forward.

The others quickly introduced their affiliations.

Interestingly, all of these people were Saint King Realm martial artists.
