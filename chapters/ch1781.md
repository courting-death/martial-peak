## Chapter 1781 — Standoff

While Zi Long and Zi Donglai were speaking, Yang Kai had already determined the location of that spiritual medicine from the intensity of the surrounding medicinal fragrances.

After all, he had lingered in this Medicine Valley for some time and had gathered many herbs, and Yang Kai himself was an alchemist, so he possessed relevant experience.

Fortunately, the unknown spiritual medicine was the closest to him, and the area ahead was for some reason filled with numerous spatial rifts; thus, if Zi Long and Xu Wei tried to approach the herb their speed would inevitably be delayed by those rifts, while he would be less affected.

Thinking this, Yang Kai quickened his pace again.

Suddenly Yang Kai sniffed; surprise flickered across his face. "Not just one?"

At that moment he smelled a different medicinal scent mixed with the previous fragrance, producing a confusing blend that was hard to distinguish.

Yang Kai abruptly looked up and saw, a hundred zhang away on a small hillside, five pale purple flowers fluttering in the wind; each blossom was about the size of a palm, bore nine petals, and exuded an inexplicable charm.

Behind those flowers a vast spatial rift stretched across the sky, like an open beast's maw intent on devouring the five strange blossoms.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and the next moment he recognized them. "Wudao Flower!"

It was precisely the Wudao Flower that Ghost Ancestor had mentioned before.

Ghost Ancestor had once passed through Medicine Valley and collected a few Wudao Flowers on its outskirts. Aware of the valley's value but held back by caution, he had not ventured too deep. Even so, he had been greatly satisfied with his gains, for Wudao Flowers could help warriors comprehend the Martial Dao and advance their realms, a benefit especially marked for Void King Realm experts.

When training, holding a Wudao Flower petal in the mouth could produce astonishing effects.

The Wudao Flower's efficacy varied greatly with age. A newly born Wudao Flower took three hundred years to bloom; at first it bore only three petals, and every subsequent century it gained one more petal until reaching nine.

Nine was the utmost—the nine-petaled Wudao Flower had, at minimum, nine hundred years of medicinal age.

As the medicinal age grew beyond that, the number of petals would no longer increase. Instead the Wudao Flower's color would slowly change from pure white to crimson, then to blood red, and finally to purple.

Each stage of color change consumed vast stretches of time, far more arduous than the growth of petals.

The five Wudao Flowers before him were already a pale purple, which meant their medicinal age was over three thousand years.

Such items were terrifyingly potent for Void King Realm experts; if any Void King Realm expert gathered these five Wudao Flowers, in future cultivation he might no longer need other spiritual pills—simply holding a petal in his mouth at a critical moment could guarantee steady advancement of his realm.

The instant Yang Kai discovered the five Wudao Flowers, he realized their immense value.

Of the heaven-and-earth treasures he had previously collected, only those two Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruits could barely be compared to the value of the Wudao Flowers; the rest were not of the same caliber.

Yang Kai’s heart burned with excitement. With a shift of his steps, he was about to rush toward the Wudao Flower to seize it.

But no sooner had he moved than his whole body tensed and an inexplicable chill ran through him; at the same time he caught at the corner of his eye a purple light rushing in from the left like a sky-shattering sword.

That purple light contained an indescribable profound intent, its power terrifyingly great.

That was absolutely not an attack an Origin Returning Realm practitioner could produce; whoever had unleashed such a strike was certainly of the Void King Realm, and among Void Kings this person's strength was by no means low.

"Zi Long!"

Yang Kai immediately knew who had tried to ambush him.

He had heard from Xue Yue that the art Zi Long and Zi Donglai practiced was called the Purple Qi Long River Technique; this technique was renowned throughout the Star Domain, was Zi Long's family method, and it was entirely because of that technique that Zi Long had been able in his lifetime to break through to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

To cultivate that art one had to rise early each day and inhale the purple qi produced as the sun rose; cultivated to the extreme, the purple qi could become rivers and seas, easily annihilating a million li of land.

Normally a powerhouse like Zi Long would lean on his status; even if he had a blood feud with Yang Kai, he would not ambush such a junior. If Zi Long wanted to kill Yang Kai he would do it openly and crush him with absolute might.

He had the ability to do so.

But the present situation was different: Zi Long had undoubtedly spotted the five Wudao Flowers and knew their rarity and worth; they were the key to his breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm—how could Zi Long be so rigid as to ignore that?

Yang Kai was clearly the closest to the Wudao Flowers; next were Zi Long and Zi Donglai, while Xu Wei was still five hundred zhang away.

If he didn’t slow Yang Kai down and let him reach the Wudao Flower, he would be left with his hands tied, unable to act freely.

So the moment he spotted the Wudao Flowers and Yang Kai's figure, Zi Long did not hesitate and unleashed a strike; though it was a casual blow from a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, it was nonetheless terrifying and far beyond what an Origin Returning Realm practitioner could deflect.

After striking, Zi Long's speed surged; he did not glance at Yang Kai, his eyes fixed solely on the five pale purple flowers, burning with fervent light.

Whether Yang Kai lived or died was not something he needed to concern himself with.

He was merely an ant—why should he care?

On the other side Yang Kai cursed, snapped his fingers in rapid succession like a gale, and with a hissing sound sent forth over a hundred Golden Blood Threads; the threads entwined and wove themselves into a shield in an instant, blocking before him.

That was not all: Yang Kai's expression grew grave, and through the shield of Golden Blood Threads he circulated his Saint Yuan throughout his body and suddenly unleashed dozens of explosive punches forward.

Boom, boom, boom...

The Saint Yuan surged; violent force splashed into the void.

The shield's radiance dimmed for an instant and was shattered back into Golden Blood Threads, but the purple light's momentum was undiminished and it still rushed at Yang Kai.

The outgoing force of his punches met the purple light; they collided and merged.

Yang Kai emitted a muffled grunt and was involuntarily blown backward, flying through the air with his face slightly paling.

Although he had not suffered grievous injury, he had taken a small hit; fixing his gaze on Zi Long as he rapidly closed on the Wudao Flowers, astonishment showed on Yang Kai's face.

He had fought Second Stage of the Void King Realm opponents before—back then Luo Hai had been of that stage.

Yet Zi Long felt far more powerful than Luo Hai had.

This man was unquestionably at the peak of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; perhaps with some opportunity he could break through to the Third Stage.

The master of Purple Star lived up to his renown.

"Hm?" Zi Long also gave a note of surprise; while flying toward the Wudao Flowers he turned his head to glance at Yang Kai's position, his face registering astonishment.

He had not expected Yang Kai to have blocked his attack; though Yang Kai looked battered and it had only been his casual strike rather than full power, for an Origin Returning Realm practitioner to do that was enough to astonish.

"This kid... is strange!"

Zi Long knew that if that strike of his had landed on Zi Donglai instead, even with him trying to defend, the least it would have caused was a serious injury. Yet when he looked at Yang Kai, the latter’s face was only slightly pale, with no real harm done otherwise.

He was even better than his own son? Since when had such a young man appeared in the Star Domain? Which extraordinary old monster had trained him?

In an instant many thoughts raced through Zi Long's mind, and his expression toward Yang Kai grew considerably solemn.

At that moment a sound of exhalation suddenly came from deep within Medicine Valley.

"Father!" Zi Donglai, who followed behind Zi Long, changed expression and called out in a low, alarmed voice.

"The Seven Luminaries Divine Light is coming!"

From previous experience, the speed at which the Seven Luminaries Divine Light could cover Medicine Valley was terrifyingly fast; without finding a place to hide in time one would inevitably be engulfed.

Zi Donglai could not help but grow anxious.

At that time Zi Long was less than a hundred zhang from the Wudao Flowers—closer than Yang Kai—and the fruits of victory were within reach.

Yet even that small distance made his steps precarious; a flash of struggle and hesitation crossed his face, and in the end he did not dare to be greedy. Gritting his teeth, he grabbed Zi Donglai, moved to a nearby spatial rift, and concealed himself behind it.

Not far off, Xu Wei, who had been charging over, hurriedly stopped and likewise hid behind a spatial rift.

Yang Kai did the same.

Fortunately this area contained numerous spatial rifts; otherwise the three would have had to risk dashing to the Wudao Flowers and hiding beside the rift behind them.

For a time the three remained motionless, their distances to the Wudao Flowers nearly equal, still forming the previous triangular formation that surrounded the blossoms.

Silently, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light descended and spread across the entire Medicine Valley.

The entire world seemed to fall silent at that moment, with only faint breathing audible.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, cast a cold glance toward where Xu Wei and Zi Long hid, sat cross-legged, and tossed a healing spiritual pill into his mouth.

Although he had blocked Zi Long's attack moments before, his Saint Yuan had surged and he needed to steady it first.

Fortunately it was not a major problem; Yang Kai only circulated a few cycles and was out of danger—the rest would be handled as the pill's effects worked.

Zi Long's face remained sullen as he stared fervently at the five Wudao Flowers, motionless; standing behind him, Zi Donglai looked at Yang Kai with contemptuous disdain, a cold smile at his lips.

As for Xu Wei, he glanced about furtively, as if plotting something.
