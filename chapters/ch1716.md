## Chapter 1716 — What Exactly Is His Background?

These holes were all akin to spatial rifts, and they had always existed here; they had simply gone unnoticed by most — only the Star Emperor Token could stir them into manifestation.

The shapes of the holes also resembled the Star Emperor Token itself.

In the void there were nine holes in all, each linked to the others by subtle and profound connections; those nine token-shaped apertures joined end to end and formed an array that Yang Kai could not comprehend.

Nine was the utmost of numbers, and Yang Yan had once told Yang Kai that at her prime she had crafted a total of nine Star Emperor Tokens; if one could gather all nine, they would reveal a world-shocking secret.

Yang Yan had never spoken plainly about what that earth-shattering secret actually was.

Yet it was obvious it had something to do with the scene before him.

Yang Kai wore a pensive expression as he gradually connected what he had seen and heard in the past, but he still could not deduce Yang Yan’s intent.

Ghost Isle was without doubt connected to Yang Yan — there was no question of that — otherwise there would not be nine token-shaped void fissures here, nor would there be a number of holes equal to the total count of Star Emperor Tokens.

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, one Star Emperor Token flew into a hole, perfectly sealing that aperture without leaving the slightest seam, as if the void rift had been mended by the Star Emperor Token.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai flicked his wrist and four more Star Emperor Tokens appeared in his palm.

These four Star Emperor Tokens were things Yang Kai had obtained by chance over the decades since he entered the Star Domain.

One of them had been given by the Ghost Ancestor and was the only token that had sealed an Imperial Divine Art; however, during the fierce battle with Luo Hai on Chi Lan Star Yang Kai had unraveled that seal and, by harnessing the token’s might, had slain Luo Hai.

Though the seal was gone, the Star Emperor Token itself had been preserved.

The second token had been obtained when Yang Kai first entered the Flowing Flame Sandland to temper himself; he had acquired it atop the pavilion on the Sixth Layer.

The third had originally belonged to Ye Xijun, but it had eventually passed into Yang Kai’s hands.

The fourth had been taken from the altar on Star Emperor Mountain.

Counting the one he had just obtained today, Yang Kai had five Star Emperor Tokens in his possession.

Of the remaining four pieces, Yang Kai only knew that one was in the possession of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, while the whereabouts of the other three remained unknown.

After those four Star Emperor Tokens were taken out, they behaved just as the previous ones had. When they sought to slip from Yang Kai’s control, he made no outward move and let them fly.

Sure enough, the four tokens traced arcs through the air and then each embedded itself into the void, filling those apertures.

In the next instant all five Star Emperor Tokens simultaneously burst into light; an exceedingly wondrous power emanated from them, cascading outward and enveloping Yang Kai.

The long-dormant Saint Yuan force surged like a dam bursting, roaring through Yang Kai’s flesh and veins and radiating an astonishing might.

Feeling that long-missed power, Yang Kai took a deep breath and felt his spirits clear.

Now it made sense — it was precisely because Ming Yue had a Star Emperor Token that he, unlike others, could draw upon Saint Yuan power and catch Sha Hu unawares.

Just as Yang Kai felt now.

It remained unknown whether Ming Yue had originally possessed a Star Emperor Token or had discovered one here by chance.

Ming Yue was dead; such questions could no longer be pursued.

Yang Kai stood as stiff as a javelin, gazing into the void with deep, contemplative eyes.

His mind pierced the void and probed faraway places.

He faintly sensed that behind this stretch of void there hid a vaster world — a realm far more spectacular than the Star Domain in which he dwelt, populated by mightier warriors and governed by even more fearsome laws.

Yang Kai’s spirit roamed beyond, and for a long time he could not awaken.

He wanted to see what that world looked like, but however he strove he could not clearly perceive it; he only vaguely felt his soul traveling down a corridor, advancing and advancing as if endlessly.

Outside the mountain hollow, Sha Hu stood with his hands clasped behind his back, silently gazing forward.

He did not know what had befallen Yang Kai inside, but a month had already passed since Yang Kai had entered, and Ghost Isle was now completely under his control; all the warriors who had once targeted him had been slain, and the remainder had sworn fealty.

Sha Hu had once again become the Island Lord of Ghost Isle!

Pang Zhen, Qian Mo and Shang Ao arrived together.

Shang Ao had not died; he had merely been imprisoned by Ming Yue and subjected to certain torments. Even without taking the Huntian Pill, Shang Ao could display surprisingly strong combat prowess — one could only imagine how much he might grow if he ever took the Huntian Pill.

Ming Yue had naturally been unwilling to kill such a promising subordinate; his intent had been to imprison and temper him for a time and then find a way to subdue him, but in the end he had not waited long enough for that day to come.

After Ming Yue’s death, Qian Mo rescued Shang Ao.

As the three drew near, the Stone Puppet bearing the Heaven-Shaking Pillar at the entrance and the artifact spirit Liu Yan, now in a truly dazzling human form, looked over with alert gazes.

The three were immediately locked onto by the Divine Senses of the Stone Puppet and Liu Yan; their bodies stiffened, and they dared not move.

“Both of you, they mean no harm — there’s no need to be tense,” Sha Hu said quickly, forcing a strained smile as he cupped his fists.

The Stone Puppet’s eyes rolled but it did not relax; it still leaned forward as if poised to strike at any moment, whereas Liu Yan showed greater intelligence and merely cast a cold glance at Sha Hu before restraining her hostility.

Sha Hu felt embarrassed.

He had once been one of the top warriors of Wuyou Sea; after his misfortune and three hundred years on Ghost Isle, although he could not utilize Saint Yuan, the Huntian Pill had strengthened his body so that he believed he was at least as strong as in former days — yet even so he could not match Yang Kai’s two subordinates.

The stone man need not be mentioned; he was clearly a brute of tremendous strength — in the absence of Saint Yuan, ten Sha Hus together might still not be able to wrestle with it.

The dazzling woman was even more terrifying; within her flowed two feral forces of thunder and flame, her aura oppressive, and she pressed upon Sha Hu even more than the Stone Puppet did.

Facing this woman, Sha Hu felt as if he faced a Void King Realm master — though he himself did not truly know how powerful a Void King Realm was.

After calming the Stone Puppet and Liu Yan, Sha Hu turned to look at Pang Zhen and the others and asked, “What brings you?”

“Commanders Shang Ao and Qian Mo wish to personally thank Sect Master Yang,” Pang Zhen replied respectfully.

“As they should.” Sha Hu nodded. Looking at Qian Mo and Shang Ao he smiled wryly, “But I’m afraid it cannot be today. As you see, no one can pass through here; you must wait for Yang Kai to come out himself.”

“We will wait.” Shang Ao snorted coldly.

Having learned that his escape this time had been largely thanks to Yang Kai, Shang Ao wished to offer thanks face to face; as for Sha Hu, who had also contributed much, Shang Ao did not regard him at all.

The grudges and entanglements between Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace ran deep — they were not something that could be easily resolved overnight.

Sha Hu clearly understood this; he paid no mind to Shang Ao’s coldness and instead asked with some interest, “By the way, I have been occupied with Ghost Isle matters and did not have time to inquire properly. Pang Zhen, what exactly is Yang Kai’s background?”

Hearing this, Shang Ao and Qian Mo could not help but show interest.

The strong respected only those stronger than themselves; Qian Mo and Shang Ao were both leaders among the Sea Race, high in rank and power — their strength was immense, but when compared to Yang Kai they found themselves lacking.

Having dwelt in the deep sea for long, they knew little of inland affairs — even less than Pang Zhen — and so they were naturally curious about Yang Kai’s origins.

“Sect Master Yang… is the head of the Lingxiao Sect!” Pang Zhen thought for a moment and answered gravely.

“Lingxiao Sect?” Sha Hu was stunned. “How did I never hear of such a sect?”

Pang Zhen smiled bitterly. “Senior Uncle disappeared three hundred years ago, of course you could not have heard; the Lingxiao Sect was founded only fifteen years ago.”

“Fifteen years… its roots are not deep,” Sha Hu chuckled lightly. “But with someone like Yang Kai, given time, it could surely stand shoulder to shoulder with the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect.”

“Senior Uncle…” Pang Zhen looked rueful. “The Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance are things of the past.”

“They were wiped out?” Sha Hu’s face changed and he cried out in astonishment.

“Yes — they were annihilated by the Lingxiao Sect under Sect Master Yang!”

Sha Hu sucked in a cold breath; Qian Mo and Shang Ao exchanged a look and both bore expressions of shock.

Although Qian Mo and Shang Ao knew little of inland affairs, they had at least heard of the Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance — those were powers that had dominated the Dark Star’s inland for thousands to tens of thousands of years!

“Star Emperor Mountain was also destroyed by him!” Pang Zhen then revealed another astounding piece of news.

“What?” Sha Hu was utterly stunned now. “Even Star Emperor Mountain was wiped out by him?”

“It was not quite like that; most of Star Emperor Mountain’s experts had been absorbed by Sect Master Yang into the Lingxiao Sect. Now the Lingxiao Sect is the strongest sect on the Dark Star!”

“How does my Sea Hall compare?” Sha Hu asked urgently.

“It’s likely inferior,” Pang Zhen frankly replied. “But because we and the Lingxiao Sect belong to the deep sea and inland respectively, we had little contact. Moreover, Lingxiao Sect’s headquarters is set within the Flowing Flame Sandland — that place is impregnable; no one can breach it.”

Sha Hu was rendered speechless!

He knew of the Flowing Flame Sandland — it was one of the Dark Star’s forbidden zones; ordinarily no one could enter it. That the Lingxiao Sect had established its main headquarters inside — how had they accomplished that?

Not only Sha Hu was dumbstruck; Qian Mo and Shang Ao stared in disbelief, unable to accept it.

Understanding their shock, Pang Zhen wisely said no more; he could feel the impact these revelations had on Sha Hu and the two Sea Race leaders.

Which expert on Dark Star hadn’t been shaken upon hearing such news? When these reports reached the deep sea back then, even Sea Hall had been utterly astonished — several Hall Masters lost sleep and appetite, fearing that Yang Kai’s ambition might swell and that he would extend his claws toward the Wuyou Sea.

But the facts proved Yang Kai had no such intentions, and after several years the Hall Masters relaxed.

A while back on Xiaguang Island Yang Kai had proposed trading with Sea Hall and opening mutual exchange; those Hall Masters likely delayed consent because they could not fathom Yang Kai’s aims.
