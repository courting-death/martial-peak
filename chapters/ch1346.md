## Chapter 1346 — Ice Phoenix Anomaly

Even martial artists who had of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm were no match for this Heaven and Earth Spirit; how could a mere giant serpent puppet of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm stand against it? Once shrouded in the white mist, the puppet began to freeze at once, and by the time Lian Guang's face changed and he moved to recall it, he was already too late.

In the blink of an eye the giant serpent was frozen into an ice sculpture, and the link between it and Lian Guang that controlled it vanished utterly!

Immediately the giant eagle seized the frozen serpent with its talons, flew high into the air, and then flung it down.

A thunderous crash followed; when the serpent struck the ground it shattered into pieces, splintering into fragments!

Under normal circumstances, a puppet like that could not be destroyed simply by falling from a height — it had strength comparable to a Third Stage Saint King, rock-solid and extremely resilient, otherwise Lian Guang would not have used it in combat. Yet the white mist and biting cold spat out by the giant eagle effortlessly tore the puppet's body apart; after the fall it naturally scattered.

Lian Guang's face turned so sullen it seemed to frost over! He was only of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; he had poured vast effort and heart into forging a puppet on par with his own realm, and never expected it to fail from the outset, rendered useless before it could do anything.

The pain and hatred in Lian Guang's heart were plain to imagine.

But facing a Heaven and Earth Spirit, he was helpless; he stood with a darkened face. Even if he possessed many more puppets he wouldn't dare to send them out — against such a spirit every puppet would be destroyed.

After smashing the giant serpent, the giant eagle's blood-red eyes flashed with a trace of disdain and triumph, then with a beat of its wings it lunged toward the group.

Fei Zhi Tu shouted, "Stop it!"

With those words the Blue Jade Bowl was already unleashed, and Ning Xiangchen and the others likewise cast out their Secret Treasures; in an instant the sky bloomed with multicolored lights as secret arts and the might of Secret Treasures intertwined.

The eagle's cry resounded through the heavens as another white mist descended; whatever attacks or Secret Treasures there were, they all faded, blocked by the white mist and rapidly frozen — even the blue light belched from Fei Zhi Tu's Blue Jade Bowl showed signs of being frozen.

The giant eagle pressed its advantage and pounced. Its talons were like blades, tearing directly at the protection formed by the Fire Bird's Artifact Spirit.

With a crack the Artifact Spirit's protection split into countless fissures like a spiderweb and spread outward. Yang Kai's expression altered; with a thought he summoned countless searing jet-black flames that once again formed a circular defense under his command, enveloping everyone.

At the same time a sharp cry rang out. The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit returned to its true form, becoming a crimson monstrous bird some ten-odd zhang long, and surged at the giant eagle with savage momentum.

The Artifact Spirit seemed full of pent-up fury; though not a true Heaven and Earth Spirit, it could almost be counted as one. Earlier, while protecting Yang Kai and the others, it could not reveal its true form, but the giant eagle's repeated provocations naturally enraged it.

Taking Yang Kai's command, it erupted forth.

Yang Kai had no better choice: keeping the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit on defense was plainly unwise. The Artifact Spirit's might was somewhat inferior to the giant eagle, and with the freezing cold it would be passively battered and would sooner or later exhaust its strength.

Since that was so, it was better to let it fight — give the Artifact Spirit a chance to engage the giant eagle while they used the opportunity to rapidly leave the Ice Path.

Fortunately the Li Fire Shield functioned tremendously here, aided by Yang Kai's searing Demonic Flame. Even though everyone felt ill at ease, for the moment none were in mortal peril.

In the sky the giant eagle and the monstrous bird formed from the Artifact Spirit fought with no end; the Spiritual Qi within the Ice Path churned in disorder, and cries of eagle and bird rang without cease.

Seeing this, Fei Zhi Tu's face brightened and he waved a hand: "Move!"

As he spoke he hastened his footwork and took the lead. The others quickly urged their defensive Secret Treasures, driving Saint Yuan to resist the cold seeping through Yang Kai's Demonic Flame and the Li Fire Shield, and followed close behind Fei Zhi Tu.

Unlike the group's anxiety and unease, Yang Kai's expression became exceedingly strange.

The instant the cold invaded his body he felt something within stir, and that thing began to greedily absorb the surrounding chill.

Rather than discomfort, the cold seemed to nourish it; that thing became excited.

Yang Kai's mind shifted as he rushed forward, probing his own body.

A moment later his expression grew stranger still.

"So it's that!"

Yang Kai never expected that the movement at such a moment would come from the Ice Phoenix tattoo!

Strictly speaking, this was the Phoenix Empress's legacy. The Dual Cultivation Technique that he and Su Yan cultivated had two inheritances, both obtained from the Dragon-Phoenix Palace on the Tongxuan Continent. The Dragon Emperor inheritance was the one Yang Kai himself received and had fused with him; the Phoenix Empress's legacy had long been sealed in the Phoenix Nest, but before leaving the Tongxuan Continent Yang Kai once went to the Phoenix Nest and took the Phoenix Empress inheritance as well.

Since then Yang Kai had carried two tattoos: one a golden dragon pattern, the other an ice phoenix pattern.

He originally took the Phoenix Empress inheritance intending to hand it to Su Yan when he found her, but he never fulfilled that wish — even before meeting Qian Yue he couldn't find any trace of Su Yan.

The Ice Phoenix tattoo had been with Yang Kai for over ten years and had shown no movement since he acquired it, but now inside the Ice Path when the cold entered him the tattoo began to stir. As it devoured that chill it became increasingly beyond Yang Kai's control, seeming poised to break free from his body.

Yang Kai's mood turned complicated; he could not tell whether this was good or bad.

The reason the cold could agitate the ice-sealing tattoo was easy to explain — the Phoenix Empress legacy itself was ice-cold in nature — but Yang Kai could not command it, so he had no idea what would happen if it left his body.

If it never returned, Su Yan's Phoenix Empress inheritance would be gone.

While Yang Kai worried, his face suddenly altered.

Almost immediately the tattoo's stirring exceeded his suppression; he felt something surge from within, accompanied by a high, clear phoenix cry, and an ice-white phantom phoenix, its entire body crystalline and snow-white and roughly ten zhang long, suddenly manifested above everyone's heads.

In an instant a pressure that drained color from faces crashed down from above.

Fei Zhi Tu and the others' faces changed; they all halted, glanced at Yang Kai, and then looked up toward the sky.

At a glance Fei Zhi Tu cried out, "An Ancient Divine Spirit!"

The shock within him was indescribable — this expedition into the ancient ruins to rescue Qian Tong had originally been no great matter; in his plans and estimations it shouldn't have been too difficult.

But entering this Ice Path they first encountered the rumored Heaven and Earth Spirit, and then another Ancient Divine Spirit appeared from nothing! These were things ordinary people might never see in several lifetimes — legendary existences — yet today they emerged one after another.

Even Fei Zhi Tu, of steady temperament, had his eyes tremble and his spirit greatly shaken.

The others were no better; mouths agape, they stared at the awe-inspiring Ice Phoenix and were dumbstruck, long unable to speak, forgetting to press onward.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he anxiously watched the Ice Phoenix, but its body seemed insubstantial, faint and elusive; although its pressure was overwhelming, the energy fluctuations it emitted were not particularly strong.

"No — it's only a remnant soul!" Fei Zhi Tu also noticed this and his face visibly improved; if a full Ancient Divine Spirit had descended, it would not show such limited might. The only explanation was that it was merely a remnant soul.

Even so, it was the remnant soul of an Ancient Divine Spirit; given enough time it might recover. Even a ten-percent restoration would be enough to rival a Void King Realm existence!

The moment the Ice Phoenix appeared its phoenix eyes fixed on the giant eagle that was still locked in combat with the Artifact Spirit; a look of unusual delight flashed in its gaze as it cried out again.

The giant eagle, as if it had seen some nemesis, fell into a panic; scorched and singed by the Artifact Spirit that had been at a disadvantage, it suddenly managed to withstand an attack and, without looking back, charged into the depths of the Ice Path.

The Ice Phoenix spread its wings and became a streak of light, closely following.

In the blink of an eye both the Ice Phoenix and the giant eagle vanished.

The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, with its opponent gone, immediately flew back and resumed its protective form, enveloping everyone once more.

The cold that had been invading was instantly blocked.

Silence reigned throughout the Ice Path. Everyone stared at Yang Kai with strange expressions, and Yang Kai himself wore a sullen look as he stared at the direction the Ice Phoenix had disappeared, saying nothing; no one knew what he was thinking.

After a long while Fei Zhi Tu cleared his throat and tentatively asked, "Yang Kai, is that Ice Phoenix remnant soul yours?"

Although he had personally witnessed the flash of light around Yang Kai’s body and the Ice Phoenix’s appearance, even now he still found it hard to believe that Yang Kai could actually possess a remnant soul of an Ancient Divine Spirit?.

This kid not only had an Artifact Spirit that made people envious, but also harbored a remnant soul of an Ancient Divine Spirit...

What kind of outrageous luck was needed to obtain both?

"Yes." Yang Kai glanced at him. Though he doubted anyone here would covet the Ice Phoenix, he remained somewhat wary and asked lightly, "Lord Fei, do you know why the Ice Phoenix was chasing that Heaven and Earth Spirit?"

He still couldn't make sense of why the Ice Phoenix would appear at this moment. If it was merely that the cold here had stimulated it, that made no sense — Yang Kai had traveled far and wide to many frigid places, not just this Ice Path. The Profound Yin Moon Water and the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Terrace were equally cold, yet the Ice Phoenix had not appeared then.
