## Chapter 1930 — There Actually Is Someone

"Waiting for warriors from other Star Domains to enter the Star Realm?" Liu Qianyun and Feng De were stunned; neither had expected that Yin Lesheng would go so far as to employ the Huangquan Nether Veil to block the starlight and remain here for five years for this very reason.

They knew that the Huangquan Nether Veil was the Huangquan Sect's Ancestral Treasure, said to have been handed down from the Star Realm, its tier long since surpassing Void King-Grade.

Only a sect like the Huangquan Sect, which also had a lineage in the Star Realm, could possess such a heaven-defying treasure, and each time it was used the Huangquan Nether Veil would absorb ten million Yin-Souls.

Liu Qianyun suddenly recalled that five years ago Yin Lesheng had once gone to a cultivation star in the Great Wilderness Star Domain and slaughtered the living of more than a dozen cities; at the time they had thought him driven by evil and bereft of humanity, but now it seemed he had been preparing for the Huangquan Nether Veil.

"Can't make sense of it?" Yin Lesheng asked lightly, looking at the two of them.

Liu Qianyun shook her head and said, "Please, Senior Brother Yin, enlighten us."

Yin Lesheng said, "We are waiting for those Star Lords!"

At those words, Liu Qianyun and Feng De both showed expressions of sudden comprehension; Liu Qianyun said, "Could the rumors that the Huangquan Sect possesses a secret art to seize others' Stellar Origins be true?"

Yin Lesheng nodded, "Of course it's true."

"So, Senior Brother Yin, you intend to seize other people's Stellar Origins?"

"No!" Yin Lesheng's eyes flashed with cold light. "I already have a Stellar Origin; in the short term I cannot possess a second."

"Then, Senior Brother Yin, you..."

"I do indeed have one, but on this trip to the Huangquan Sect in the Star Realm we still lack a proper gift; if I can prepare this grand present, once I enter the Huangquan Sect in the Star Realm this one's prospects will be smooth sailing!"

Only then did Liu Qianyun and Feng De understand what he had been waiting five years for.

Although Yin Lesheng had nearly dominated the Great Wilderness Star Domain, he was after all only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; once inside the Star Realm such cultivation would count for little. The Huangquan Sect itself was fiercely competitive, and open and covert struggles among disciples were everyday occurrences.

This time Yin Lesheng was going to the Huangquan Sect in the Star Realm without backing; with no background he could only rely on himself.

Star Lord-level cultivators were his objective.

If he could bring the Huangquan Sect such a gift, how could he fail to win their attention?

For a moment, Liu Qianyun and Feng De could not help but admire Yin Lesheng's far-sightedness.

The Star Realm was something any Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator yearned for; to spend five years waiting here demonstrated how resolute Yin Lesheng's temperament was.

Only... if he could wait it out, that would be fine — but if he couldn't, the losses would far outweigh the gains.

After all, by staying here the Saint Yuan within Yin Lesheng, even if entirely converted into Origin Qi, could not make a breakthrough; it would only be a squandered waste of time.

"As long as this Lord can gain the Huangquan Sect's attention in the Star Realm, cultivation resources will never be lacking thereafter; the day this Lord attains Emperor Realm will also be within reach. You two come with me and you will not be shortchanged either."

Liu Qianyun and Feng De hurriedly expressed their thanks.

"Now that you know this Lord's plan, do not be noisy; rest and wait!" Yin Lesheng waved his hand.

"Yes." Liu Qianyun and Feng De nodded in unison.

After what had just occurred, neither of them harbored any thought of resistance; if Yin Lesheng wanted to kill them it would likely be with a mere wave of his hand. The gap between them was simply too great.

At that moment, a clear, tinkling sound rang out.

Yin Lesheng was startled and quickly took a bell from his waist; the bell looked insignificant, but at that moment it seemed to be disturbed by something and kept giving off soft chimes.

"Someone's coming!" Yin Lesheng's eyes flashed with killing intent, and he could not help but grin. "It was not in vain that this Lord waited five years here. I hope you do not disappoint me; otherwise... heh heh heh..."

His low chuckle was extremely grating, and both Liu Qianyun and Feng De's faces changed drastically as they silently mourned the fate of the person about to arrive.

No matter how powerful or how prestigious those people were in their own Star Domain, meeting Yin Lesheng here simply meant they were out of luck.

If Yin Lesheng happened to encounter a Star Lord, that would be fortunate—he would likely give them a brutal lesson.

But if he failed to meet one, Liu Qianyun and Feng De were sure those people would soon learn what it truly meant to be alive yet worse than dead — after all, the Huangquan Sect’s methods of torment were notorious enough to make the whole Great Wilderness Star Domain shudder.

A hundred li ahead, Yang Kai and the others proceeded without incident.

He did not know how others fared, but the Saint Yuan within him was rapidly transforming into another form — a power intimately connected to his own Origin — making him feel it operating with increasing ease and potency.

Yet the speed of that transformation was still somewhat slow; he estimated that at this rate it would take at least a year or two.

The party of six was quiet and motionless.

Suddenly, Yang Kai looked up toward the front, his brow knitting.

He vaguely sensed the aura of living beings ahead, but the environment here was special; even with the strength of his Divine Sense he could not probe far, so he was not entirely sure.

Thinking it over, Yang Kai moved his mind and activated a spatial secret art, overlaying spatial power onto his Divine Sense.

In an instant, his Divine Sense pierced the void and probed outward.

"Sure enough, there's someone!" Yang Kai's expression turned strange; this was something he had never expected — that someone else should be present within this Starlight Passage.

Could they also be cultivators from some Star Domain preparing to enter the Star Realm?

He could only make that conjecture.

At the same time he hurriedly transmitted by Divine Sense, telling everyone to halt their steps.

Elsewhere, the quietly waiting Yin Lesheng's eyes narrowed slightly, a trace of suspicion appearing on his face.

In that fleeting moment he had sensed a Divine Sense oddly drifting past his side, which struck him as incredible, for in this Starlight Passage Divine Sense could not probe far; even he could not see beyond a li, so he had to rely on that bell-like Secret Treasure to detect approaching living auras.

"A trick of the senses?" Yin Lesheng murmured, then split into a savage grin. "If it's not an illusion, then I've encountered a true expert — interesting, very interesting!"

He had waited here five years and had long since converted his Saint Yuan into Origin Qi; although he had not advanced to the Dao Origin Stage, his combat strength was already not comparable to that of the Void King Realm.

No matter who the newcomers were, since they were entering the Star Realm from a Star Domain their cultivation would certainly not exceed the Void King Realm.

Yin Lesheng did not consider them worth his attention.

The bell in his hand fell temporarily silent, which made Yin Lesheng even more certain that he had encountered a cultivator with an exceptionally strong Divine Sense; the other side had surely discovered the situation here.

As it turned out, Yang Kai halted the other five and told them about the situation over there.

"There's someone here? And three of them?" Chi Yue widened her beautiful eyes, unable to believe it.

"Yang Kai, you didn't sense wrong?" Ai Ou wore a puzzled expression.

"If Sect Master Yang says so, then it is surely not baseless," Wudao said, frowning. "It's just that we don't know what those three intend, or whether they bear hostility."

"Indeed, we are newcomers; avoid trouble where possible. Yang Kai, what's their situation over there — be specific."

Yang Kai pondered and then said, "From my perception, the three have stood in place as if waiting for something; their cultivation is, naturally, Third Stage of the Void King Realm, but one of them... gives me a dangerous feeling."

"If even you sense danger, it's not simple," Ai Ou frowned. "But since they are Third Stage of the Void King Realm, they are probably cultivators from another Star Domain, likely, like us, heading into the Star Realm. Could they be lost here?"

"Go and ask them and you'll know," the Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "They're three, we're six — twice their number; are we to be afraid?"

"That said, you must understand that once inside here, there are great disparities even among Third Stage Void King Realm cultivators; take Chairman Ai Ou for example — none of us would likely be his match now!"

"Indeed, indeed, the power resulting from Saint Yuan's transformation is extremely potent."

"But we cannot simply stand here, can we? You are all hegemon-level figures; when did we become so cautious?"

At that remark everyone shuddered, realizing that since entering the Starlight Passage and sensing its mysteries their mindset had gradually shifted even as they awaited the Star Realm.

They could no longer swagger as before, looking down on all with supreme arrogance.

"Then let's be cautious and act according to the situation. If they are truly lost, it's easy to handle; if they are hostile, then we can fight!" Yang Kai said calmly.

"Exactly so!" Wudao nodded in agreement.

"Then I'll take point!" Yang Kai smiled faintly and volunteered.

"I'll go — you get to the back!" Ai Ou snorted and stepped to the very front.

As an elder, what did it mean if they always had to rely on Yang Kai for protection?

Chi Yue smiled and said, "This time just behave and follow along."

"Uh... fine then." Yang Kai did not insist; after all, whether the others were friend or foe remained unclear, and clinging to such matters was pointless.

The six of them began to approach the direction where Yin Lesheng and his companions stood.

As they drew near, the bell in Yin Lesheng's hand rang ever more urgently and frequently.

A hundred li was nothing to them; within the time it took a stick of incense to burn, the two parties would meet.

Ai Ou rode at the head and halted about thirty zhang from Yin Lesheng and the others, focusing his gaze forward.

Starlight all around surged uncontrollably into his body, being absorbed and taken in.

Yin Lesheng's previously bland eyes erupted with intense radiance the moment he saw Ai Ou, and he could not help but clap his hands and laugh, "Good, good, good — it was not in vain that this Lord waited five years; at last a worthy arrival has come."
