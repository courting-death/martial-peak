## Chapter 394 — Whoever Pulls Me, I’ll Stab Them

It had been five or six years since he left the Yang Family. Back then, he had been nothing more than an ordinary man unable to cultivate. Now, upon his return, he stood at the Seventh Stage of the True Element Realm.

It felt as if a lifetime had passed.

Yang Kai’s heart ached with longing for his parents, yet the clan’s strict rules had always barred him from visiting. He thought back to what Dong Qinghan had told him — how his mother had once slipped out in secret to meet him, only to be discovered, and how Fourth Master Yang had taken the punishment in her place, enduring thirty heavy strokes. That memory had weighed on him ever since.

He could not help but wonder how his parents had fared in these passing years.

With his emotions in turmoil, he hurriedly left the forbidden area of the Transformation Dragon Pool. Just as he exited the misty area, he spotted two figures standing straight and still, gazing eagerly toward the forbidden ground.

They exchanged a surprised glance, all rendered speechless.

Yang Kai never expected his parents would be waiting here, especially since it hadn’t even been half a day since he returned to the family. If no one had sent word, they might not even know he was back.

Yang Yingfeng and Dong Suzhu also hadn’t anticipated that their son would appear before them so soon.

They were all still in shock.

Previously, Fourth Master Yang had mentioned that once Yang Kai entered the Transformation Dragon Pool, he wouldn’t emerge for at least one or two days. He had overestimated Yang Kai’s aptitude.

From Tu Feng, they learned about Yang Kai’s current cultivation level and knew he had overcome the innate deficiencies from years ago, but they weren’t certain about his aptitudes.

Estimating a stay of one or two days within the Transformation Dragon Pool, they thought his aptitudes must not be great, but that would be normal.

They never expected that in just half a day, Yang Kai would emerge from the Transformation Dragon Pool. This short time indicated something was indeed amiss with his aptitude.

The three exchanged glances, and then Yang Kai smiled. It was as though he hadn’t had the chance to smile so freely and joyfully in years.

Dong Suzhu’s lips trembled as tears streamed down her face. Wordlessly, she quickly stepped forward and embraced her son tightly.

However, the current Yang Kai was no longer the boy he once was; he had grown significantly taller over the years. Surprisingly, Dong Suzhu now looked half a head shorter than him. She could only stand on her tiptoes to wrap her arms around his neck, resting his head on her slender shoulder, one hand stroking his hair, while the other rested on his broad back.

She opened her mouth several times, but all that escaped was a choked sob, her voice quivering with emotion.

Tears fell on Yang Kai’s shoulder, bringing warmth, and inhaling the familiar scent that he loved since childhood brought an unprecedented tranquility to his heart, relaxing him in a way he had never experienced before.

A ship that had sailed for so long finally returned to the warm harbor.

Yang Kai’s nose tinged with acidity.

The iron-willed Fourth Master Yang, at this moment, also had red-rimmed eyes, quickly averting his gaze while fiercely blinking away tears.

“Mother, I’m back!” Yang Kai whispered softly.

Dong Suzhu managed to calm her overwhelming emotions and, while gently patting Yang Kai’s back, nodded repeatedly, “It’s good that you’re back, good that you’re back!”

She repeated this several times, her voice gradually losing its tremor. By the end, she couldn’t help but laugh through her tears, finally releasing Yang Kai, taking his shoulders to stand before him, examining him from head to toe, her beautiful eyes filled with joy.

He had grown taller and stronger. He was no longer the sickly child of yesteryears. The son now standing before her made her feel as though she could rely on him.

Thinking of this, Dong Suzhu began to tear up again.

The journey of growth is always accompanied by hardships. Yang Kai’s transformation could not be separated from the suffering he endured over these years.

Yang Kai was just about to signal to Fourth Master Yang to come over and comfort him when he noticed his father had turned his head away, gazing at the sky at a forty-five-degree angle, seemingly watching birds fly over, standing there with his hands behind his back.

The corners of his eyes were slightly moist!

Yang Kai could only helplessly speak up to comfort him, “Alright, don’t cry!”

“Yeah, it would be embarrassing if someone saw us.” Dong Suzhu nodded slightly, wiping her tears, her eyes swollen like peaches.

Only then did Yang Kai turn to smile at Yang Yingfeng.

Fourth Master Yang still maintained his posture, unaffected by the wind.

“Father…” Yang Kai called out softly.

It was unclear what Fourth Master Yang was thinking; he jolted slightly and turned his head, raising his fists in a respectful greeting toward Yang Kai. His mouth opened as he suddenly realized something was off.

He was seeing his son, not greeting a peer or elder. Why was he clasping his fists? Should he bow as well?

His old face instantly flushed red. Unobtrusively, he brushed his sleeve as if to remove nonexistent dust, then unsophisticatedly placed his hands behind him, nodding slightly as though to display his composure: “Hmm, you’ve returned?”

Yang Kai sniffed and felt this question was somewhat absurd. He could only nod, “Yes, I’m back.”

“Then… let’s go home!” Fourth Master Yang said, his spirit unsettled. He waved his hand and led the way, his ears also reddened.

Yang Kai and Dong Suzhu exchanged glances and followed behind Fourth Master Yang, both suppressing smiles.

Although Yang Yingfeng didn’t express much when he first saw Yang Kai, anyone could tell he was quite pleased, striding with a noticeably lighter step than usual.

At Fourth Master Yang’s residence.

The three of them hurriedly returned home in no time.

The residence was not large, but it wasn’t small either. After all, it belonged to a direct descendant of the previous generation. The servants and maids numbered a mere dozen or so, leaving the place with a refreshing tranquility compared to others.

Upon entering the residence, all the servants and maids respectfully greeted Yang Kai.

Yang Yingfeng hurriedly ordered them to prepare a feast to welcome his son home, while Dong Suzhu pulled Yang Kai directly to his old bedroom.

Pushing open the long-remembered door, Yang Kai walked inside slowly. Everything he saw was unchanged from his memories; the positioning and layout of the furnishings were identical, and all the tables and beds were dust-free, clearly cleaned daily.

Yang Yingfeng slipped in quietly and said in a low voice, “After you left, your mother often came back here. Looking at this place felt as if she could see you still at home.”

Dong Suzhu subtly pinched Yang Yingfeng. But Fourth Master Yang, his skin thick and unyielding, merely shot a suspicious glance at his wife.

“Don’t listen to your father’s nonsense. I just come to see it occasionally,” Dong Suzhu hastily added.

Yang Kai nodded faintly, understanding better than anyone else. This room was likely not just a spot for his mother to frequent; even his father must have often visited.

The entire space was filled with the longing of his parents.

One could only imagine Yang Yingfeng’s presence here, sighing deeply, or visualize Dong Suzhu sitting on the bed, weeping in sorrow.

Five or six years, more than a thousand days and nights…

Those who are not parents can never truly comprehend the suffering of these long days.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred, his breathing quickening, but he paused, unsure of what to say.

“I’ll have someone send food and wine here. We’ll eat together today,” Fourth Master Yang declared, sensing he had misspoken and hurriedly looking for an excuse to leave.

“I’ll help out. You rest for a moment, son.”

In no time, the servants brought in the food and wine, all dishes personally prepared by Dong Suzhu. Fourth Master Yang had even taken out fine wine he had treasured for years without consuming.

This was the first time in many years that the three of them sat together at the same table, enjoying a delightful meal.

Before long, Fourth Master Yang had drunk too much and was happily tipsy.

A little later, Dong Suzhu also became somewhat hazy from the drink. Only Yang Kai remained relatively sober.

“That’s enough for today. I’ll talk to you more tomorrow,” Yang Yingfeng said, despite having countless questions on his mind. He stood up unsteadily.

Dong Suzhu, resting her chin in her hands, gazed sleepily, “You can go back. I want to sleep with our son tonight. It’s been so long since we slept together.”

Yang Kai was taken aback.

But Fourth Master Yang had a calm demeanor and nodded at her words, turning to walk out the door.

“Father…” Yang Kai quickly called out.

“What is it?” Yang Yingfeng turned to ask.

“Don’t you think something is amiss?” Yang Kai said, dismayed.

Fourth Master Yang seriously considered for a moment, furrowing his brow and asking, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Kai covered his forehead, knowing his parents had probably drunk too much, still treating him as a child.

Anything he said now would likely not get through to them. Reluctantly, he could only call in a maid from outside, aiding Dong Suzhu back to rest.

As their footsteps faded, Dong Suzhu’s lingering voice floated back, “Stop it; I want to sleep with my son tonight! Whoever pulls me, I’ll stab them!”

He absolutely must never let his parents drink too much again! Yang Kai silently resolved.

The next day, dawn broke.

Yang Kai rose early, facing the morning sun as he practiced the Proud Bone Golden Body technique. His True Essence surged restlessly, as if he was on the verge of a breakthrough.

Having absorbed a large chunk of Yang Crystal Jade Bed at the Lü Family and taken Wan Yao Ling Ye daily to cleanse his meridians, it was normal for him to be preparing for a breakthrough.

He calmed his mind, neither sad nor happy, allowing nature to take its course.

Half an hour later, he finished his practice with sweat-soaked clothes.

After breakfast, a servant reported that Fourth Master Yang summoned him!

Yang Kai understood his parents surely had much to say to him, so he was not too surprised. After tidying up slightly, he hurried to the study.

As expected, not only was Yang Yingfeng waiting in the study, but Dong Suzhu also sat nearby, eagerly gazing at the entrance.

Upon Yang Kai’s arrival, Dong Suzhu quickly stood up, pulling him down to sit beside her.

Once seated, Fourth Master Yang cleared his throat and glanced at Dong Suzhu, “Do you want to ask first, or should I?”

“You can ask. The questions I have are trivial matters.”

Yang Yingfeng nodded, his expression becoming solemn. After contemplating for a moment, he spoke, “Your master must have told you about my relationship with the Lingxiao Pavilion?”

“Yes, he mentioned it.” Yang Kai nodded in assent.

“Then you should understand why I sent you to the Lingxiao Pavilion,” Yang Yingfeng said, taking a gentle breath. “I ask you, what is the current situation of the Lingxiao Pavilion?”

Yang Yingfeng only knew that the Lingxiao Pavilion had been burned down by the fury of the Qiu Family’s experts, with all its thousands of disciples dispersed, while the higher-ups within the sect were missing.
