## Chapter 2502 — Nothing Left to Say

"Right." Wu Kuang nodded. "This Star Chart must be something you obtained from that Star Domain."

"You can tell that too?" Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment.

Wu Kuang chuckled, "It's not that this Lord has particularly keen eyes, but only those Star Domains can give birth to such a Star Chart."

"Why is that?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked for guidance.

Although he was eager to drive Wu Kuang out of his Sea of Consciousness, it was rare to have someone to clear up his doubts, so he naturally seized the opportunity to ask clearly. He could always kick him out after getting his answers.

Wu Kuang pondered for a moment before speaking, "In this world, everything has its Origin. Plants have their Plant Origin, Divine Spirits have their Divine Spirit Origin, and even those brilliant stars have their Stellar Origin. Origin Power is the source of all strength, mysterious and boundless, with infinite might. The Great Might of Heaven and Earth is the Origin Power of Heaven and Earth themselves, a force that has existed since the moment the cosmos was born. If we martial cultivators can glimpse even a fraction of it, the benefits would be immeasurable.”

Yang Kai listened intently, his expression serious. Although the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was condemned by all, there was no denying his strength was universally acknowledged. To hear his teachings was an extremely rare opportunity.

Wu Kuang pointed a finger at the sky above the Sea of Consciousness and said lightly, "This Star Chart is also an Origin."

Yang Kai exclaimed, "This is also an Origin?"

Wu Kuang smiled slightly, "Naturally. And it's not just any Origin—It's a Star Domain Origin!"

"Star Domain Origin?" Yang Kai's eyes widened.

Wu Kuang said, "You can think of it as the Origin Power of an entire Star Domain. With your current abilities, you probably can't refine it. If you could, you'd discover its endless wonders. However... you likely won't get that chance."

"Star Domain Origin!" Yang Kai repeated in a low voice, then asked sincerely, "If I manage to refine it, will it grant me benefits in cultivation, just like a Stellar Origin does for martial artists?"

Wu Kuang snorted, "That's just a small part of its function. If a martial artist possesses a complete Stellar Origin, their cultivation speed will far surpass others, because Origin Power helps them comprehend many things—like laws and profound intent. Those with a complete Origin start far ahead of others. But the effect of a Star Domain Origin is dozens or even hundreds of times greater than any complete Stellar Origin."

Yang Kai couldn't help but suck in a cold breath.

He possessed a complete Stellar Origin and had benefited greatly, but now Wu Kuang was saying that a Star Domain Origin was dozens or even hundreds of times more powerful. Naturally, he was deeply shocked.

"Moreover, if you can refine this Star Domain Origin, it's equivalent to being acknowledged by the entire Star Domain. You could become its master, with everything within the Star Domain under your control—its existence or destruction at your whim!"

Yang Kai mused, "Isn't that just like being a Star Lord?"

Back when he was the Star Lord of Dark Star, he could control everything on Dark Star with a single thought, ignoring spatial barriers and traveling anywhere on the star at will.

According to Wu Kuang, if one became the master of a Star Domain, they would enjoy all these conveniences as well.

Yang Kai’s thoughts began to stir. The Star Chart within his Sea of Consciousness was that of the Hengluo Star Domain. If he could fully refine it, wouldn’t that mean he could become the master of the entire Hengluo Star Domain, holding its fate in the palm of his hand?

"You could say that, only the effect is magnified many times over." Wu Kuang nodded, then changed the subject: "But refining a Star Domain Origin is not so simple. Back in the day, this Lord destroyed countless Star Domains and even found a few Star Domain Origins, but never succeeded in refining one."

"Why is that?" Yang Kai asked in shock.

Wu Kuang grinned, "Because the Star Domain Origins refused to accept this Lord. In a fit of rage, I devoured them all."

The corner of Yang Kai's mouth twitched.

Wu Kuang said, "If a Star Domain Origin exists, no matter how badly damaged the Star Domain is, it will eventually recover. But if the Star Domain Origin is destroyed, then that Star Domain is truly finished. It's like a person's Divine Soul—once it is scattered, there is no hope of rebirth!"

"Outrageous!" Yang Kai spat in disgust.

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, "Anyone who dares defy this Lord, whether human or otherwise, never comes to a good end!" As he spoke, he glared at Yang Kai, exuding immense pressure, as if warning him.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice and was about to ask more secrets when his expression suddenly changed.

Wu Kuang said blandly, "Enough idle talk. This Lord is only chatting because I'm in a good mood. Now, obediently offer up your body, and this Lord may spare your life."

Yang Kai laughed loudly, "If you want my body, come and take it yourself."

Wu Kuang slowly shook his head, "I thought you were a talent worth nurturing and wanted to spare your life. But since you're so stubborn, there's no need to keep you."

As he spoke, he waved his hand. In an instant, an arrow-like attack formed and shot toward Yang Kai like lightning.

Yang Kai's expression changed. Alarmed, his entire Sea of Consciousness churned. The seawater below surged up, forming layers of sturdy defenses in front of him.

Wu Kuang snorted, "This Lord is the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Even after being weakened for tens of thousands of years, my strength is not something a Junior like you can resist. If you don't want to suffer, stop wasting your efforts!"

As if to prove his words, the attack swept in, and all the defenses along its path shattered instantly.

Yang Kai felt a tearing pain in his Divine Soul. As he retreated rapidly, he continuously used his Divine Sense to resist.

Boom, boom, boom...

After a long struggle, Yang Kai circled his Sea of Consciousness several times before finally managing to dissolve the arrow-like attack. He looked exhausted, his Spirit Body dim and clearly badly injured.

Fighting within his own Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai knew that no matter who ultimately won or lost, he himself would suffer the consequences. Every bit of destruction here was tied directly to him—whatever was damaged in this place would be his loss to bear.

"You blocked one strike from this Lord. Can you block a second, a third?" Wu Kuang looked at Yang Kai with disdain. As he raised his hand, another terrifying attack seemed ready to strike.

Yang Kai's face showed little panic. He looked at Wu Kuang mockingly and said, "Compared to an old monster like you who's lived for tens of thousands of years, I am indeed a bit green. But while I may not be your match, others might not be so helpless against you!"

"Others?" Wu Kuang frowned in confusion, wondering who Yang Kai meant. Suddenly, a figure appeared behind him and struck him with a fierce palm.

Wu Kuang never expected someone to ambush him here. Caught off guard, he took the blow head-on.

With a loud bang, Wu Kuang grunted, his Spirit Body's light flickering wildly as he hurriedly fled.

After regaining his footing, Wu Kuang looked back in pain. Seeing who had ambushed him, he gritted his teeth and growled, "Old thing, didn't you self-destruct? Why aren't you dead?"

The one who had appeared so strangely behind Wu Kuang and ambushed him was none other than the Mortal Great Emperor!

No one knew what kind of exchange he’d had with Yang Kai, but somehow, Yang Kai had quietly allowed his Spirit Body to enter as well.

In the Sea of Consciousness of a newly advanced Emperor Realm martial artist, the Spirit Bodies of two Great Emperors had gathered. Such a thing was unheard of throughout history.

Duan Hongchen snorted coldly. “The moment you so much as twitch, I know exactly what scheme you’re brewing. Before I self-destructed, you detonated the Primordial Gale for one reason only—to disrupt my sight and perception so you could pull off that cicada-shedding trick. Your skeletal body was already destroyed; if you wanted to go on living, possession was your only path. And in this place, there was only one person you could possibly possess. If I still couldn’t guess you were hiding here, then I’d truly be a fool.”

"Bastard!" Wu Kuang roared, his face twisted, no longer calm.

With his abilities, possessing Yang Kai would have been easy. But now that Duan Hongchen's Spirit Body had entered, his plans were ruined. If he wanted to possess Yang Kai and regain a body, he would have to get past Duan Hongchen first.

This old fellow looked ready to die together rather than let Wu Kuang succeed, making Wu Kuang truly apprehensive.

"Wu Kuang, today you die whether you want to or not!" Duan Hongchen stared coldly ahead, his expression resolute. Earlier, he had even tried to self-destruct to kill Wu Kuang, so his words now carried real weight.

"After tens of thousands of years of acquaintance, you still can't tolerate this Lord!" Wu Kuang shouted angrily.

Duan Hongchen's eyes were utterly emotionless as he said, "It's not that I can't tolerate you—it's that you can't tolerate yourself. Since ancient times, those who do evil always meet their end. If you had chosen the right path back then, would things have come to this?"

"Spare me the lectures!" Wu Kuang roared, furious. "I've seen the ways of the world more clearly than you. The winner is king, the loser is nothing. Hongchen, don't make things difficult for me today. If you let me go, I swear never to trouble you again, and I'll never touch anything related to you."

Duan Hongchen said blandly, "Is that begging for mercy?"

Wu Kuang's expression turned fierce as he gritted his teeth, "Don't underestimate this Lord. I'm just giving you a choice."

Duan Hongchen sighed, "It seems we really have nothing left to say. What a sad thing this is."

At this point, the two Great Emperors fell silent, simply staring at each other, sparks flying between their gazes.

The seawater below seemed disturbed, bubbling and churning.

Yang Kai said with a grim face, "You two, if you have something to discuss, can you do it outside?"

This was his Sea of Consciousness, and with these two looking ready to fight at any moment, Yang Kai was truly anxious. A battle between Great Emperors—how could his Sea of Consciousness withstand it? If they really fought here, he would be doomed. Yet the two of them were far more formidable than he was, and he was powerless to drive them out.
