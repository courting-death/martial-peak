## Chapter 1312 — An Old Acquaintance in a Strange Land

“I said the price is fine, as long as we're satisfied.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, and with a casual toss a Spatial Ring flew straight toward the young woman.

She took it, swept her Divine Sense inside, and when she saw the number of Saint Crystals contained within her expression shifted slightly; the next moment she broke into a bright smile, the earlier anger instantly cast to the winds. Her eyes flickered as she said, “This gentleman is truly generous. Since that is so, I dare not disappoint you two.”

Saying so, she flipped her hand and the Spatial Ring disappeared as if tucked away; from her look it was clear she was pleased with Yang Kai's offered price. Then with a wave of her fair hand, streams of silver light suddenly shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned but did not mount much defense; he opened his palm and caught the silver lights. Looking closely, he discovered they were a number of objects as thin as cicada wings, wholly silver and mirror-like.

On each of those mirrors a beautiful figure appeared, each with different expressions—some sulking, some pleased, some sitting, some standing—vivid as if a real person had been sealed within; their glances stirred one's heart.

Yet Yang Kai soon noticed something peculiar: the figures on the silver mirrors only performed a few simple actions, repeating them over and over.

“These girls are the signature attractions of Hehuan House. Each one possesses cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, and each is a flawless body. If the gentleman had not produced so many Saint Crystals at once, I could not have decided this matter; I believe they can satisfy the two gentlemen's requirements. If you are still not satisfied, then I can only express my deep regret.”

“First Stage of the Saint King Realm!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression indifferent and unreadable, as he examined the silver mirrors one by one.

There were not many silver mirrors, only seven or eight, but they should be a very special Secret Treasure capable of recording several scenes so that a viewer would feel as if seeing it with his own eyes; thus even though the beauties on the silver mirrors only made a few simple motions, those motions still perfectly showcased their bearing.

If Yang Kai had come purely for pleasure, each of these beauties would have met his tastes. But ever since learning that Shen Fanlei’s visit here had actually been prompted by an offhand reminder from Wang Yuhan, Yang Kai knew something about this trip was amiss.

By now, how could he not see that Wang Yuhan bore ill intent? His methods were supremely clever, and his schemes linked together so tightly there was no obvious flaw.

Yang Kai was deliberately stalling here and making things difficult mainly to see what Wang Yuhan intended to do.

He had no real intention of indulging here, so he checked the silver mirrors briskly—after glancing at one he slowly shook his head and tossed the mirror to Shen Fanlei, who watched with eager eyes nearby.

After inspecting three or four, Yang Kai still appeared unmoved, which made the young woman a bit impatient, but seeing that he had paid so many Saint Crystals up front she did not explode as before and instead waited quietly.

When Yang Kai examined the fifth silver mirror he had only glanced casually, but in the next instant his face changed; a horrifying brilliance bloomed in his eyes and his aura trembled as he fixed his gaze on the beautiful figure reflected inside the mirror.

The young woman had been watching Yang Kai's expression and could tell he had changed; she laughed lightly, “Has the gentleman found the beauty he fancies?”

Yang Kai raised his lids, a most complex light passing through his eyes that made the woman start, but it quickly faded and his demeanor returned to normal. He grinned and said, “Indeed, I've taken a liking to one. This woman suits my requirements—please forgive my boldness, madam.”

Saying that, Yang Kai tossed the silver mirror back.

The young woman received it, examined the figure within, and murmured, “It's her. Hm, the gentleman has good taste.”

“What is this girl's name?” Yang Kai asked casually.

The madam giggled softly, covering her mouth as she said, “Please don’t take offense, Young Master. It’s not that I cannot tell you, but Hehuan House has its rules — none of the girls who entertain guests here reveal their real names. However, you may call her Yue’er!”

“Yue'er!” Yang Kai's eyes flashed with an odd light; he nodded and then asked, “What attribute does she primarily cultivate?”

The woman frowned and hesitated, “Is the gentleman asking a bit too much?”

“Madam, please do not take offense. I came to use dual cultivation to break through a bottleneck, so naturally I wish to know her cultivation attribute. If it conflicts with mine, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?”

“Hmm, you are cautious—that is understandable.” The woman smiled; whether she truly believed him she did not say. “Since that is so, telling you is not impossible. Yue'er originally practiced ice-attribute techniques, but that will not conflict with dual cultivation, because the Dual Cultivation Technique she now practices does not rely on ice-attribute power. So whatever attribute you cultivate, it will not conflict with hers. Had I foreseen such concerns, I would have informed you in advance.”

“I see!” Yang Kai drew a deep breath, as if he had made up his mind, and nodded, “Very well, she'll do.”

“Good.” The woman clapped her hands, and a maidlike girl entered. The woman instructed her, “Take this gentleman to the Ice-Snow Pavilion!”

The maid answered and led the way.

Yang Kai looked at Shen Fanlei and grinned, “Brother Shen Fanlei, do as you please.”

“Ah… very well!” Shen Fanlei nodded repeatedly.

At once Yang Kai followed the maid out, walking several hundred zhang. Only after their figures melted into the night did Yang Kai's face suddenly grow grave; his body trembled slightly as he struggled to contain the turmoil of his heart.

He had never expected to encounter such a person in a place like this, and that person was even from the Tongxuan Continent!

How could he not be shocked?

At first he had not been able to be certain—after all, the world is vast and many resemble each other—but when he learned the woman's name was Yue'er, that she cultivated ice-attribute techniques, and considering her First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation, Yang Kai immediately confirmed that this Yue'er was the person he knew.

Since he set foot in the Star Domain more than a decade ago he had never met someone familiar there, and now the first person he encountered not only had some connection to him but had fallen into this kind of pleasure establishment.

Most importantly, she should have been with Su Yan! If Yue'er was here, where was Su Yan? Yang Kai's emotions roiled; a string of thoughts crossed his mind, and he relied on his strong mental cultivation to suppress his feelings, speaking a few words with the maid in hopes of learning more about the woman called Yue'er.

Whether Hehuan House's rules were particularly strict or the maid's station too low, the maid truly knew nothing. No matter how Yang Kai questioned her he could not extract any useful intelligence, and the maid felt mortified and kept apologizing.

Seeing this, Yang Kai could only sigh and decide to wait until he met Yue'er to make further inquiries.

Before long they arrived at a pavilion, exquisitely constructed from an unknown material that gave off a faint chill.

There the maid bowed and said, “Sir, please enter. Yue'er usually sits in this building to meditate and cultivate. Since today is her outing day, she must have been informed and is likely waiting quietly for you.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai waved the maid away and strode into the pavilion.

The first floor was empty, but Yang Kai's Divine Sense had already locked onto someone on the second floor. Detecting the aura was indeed that of the person he recognized, Yang Kai hastened upward without hesitation.

The sound of his steps came like drumbeats, putting the woman on the second floor on edge; danger flickered in her eyes, but she seemed to recall something, her face darkening into a bitter smile as she sat by a round table, expressionless, waiting.

A moment later Yang Kai reached the second floor and pushed open the door, entering a room of pure white. Everything inside—draperies and bedding alike—was spotless white, and the faint chill made one feel as if stepping into an icebound wilderness.

Yang Kai swept his gaze and saw the woman sitting there; she looked subtly uneasy, her head bowed and not rising to greet him. A few strands of hair lay across her chest, making her appear unbearably desolate and alone, stirring pity.

Yang Kai walked straight to her; the woman trembled slightly as if startled, pain showing on her face, yet she remained seated without moving.

Only when Yang Kai stood beside her did she seem to accept her fate; she sighed, rose, and performed a greeting, “I pay my respects to the honored guest—when would the honored guest like to begin?”

She had clearly been informed and kept her head lowered the whole time, never once looking at Yang Kai, as if afraid of something and with no hint of playfulness—she went straight to the point.

Yang Kai did not speak, merely watching her, which made Yue'er even more uneasy; under his gaze she felt wholly exposed, her delicate body beginning to tremble.

After a long while the honored guest still made no move; Yue'er frowned and was about to speak when a sigh came from the other side and then a vaguely familiar voice sounded at her ear: “Elder Qian Yue, long time no see!”
