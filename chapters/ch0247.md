## Chapter 247 — Presenting One's Shortcomings

Thinking of this, Yao He said to Yao Xi, “Xi'er, you should use the Blood Bead first.”

Yao Xi's face was filled with emotion and tenderness as she slightly nodded. She then raised her delicate face towards the Great Han's martial artist and commanded, “Gather the Blood Beads for me!”

Seventeen or eighteen people exchanged glances, but no one was willing to stand up.

During this time, they had suffered considerable humiliation under Yao He and Yao Xi, wishing they could crush them to ashes. Why would they be willing to help them?

However, with such orders given, dragging it out was not an option. If they angered them, it would only lead to more torment and disaster.

Ye Han from Wan Hua Palace stood up angrily, her small tiger teeth glinting as she gritted her teeth and said, “I’ll go!”

Yang Kai's eyes flickered, and he reached out to pull her back, “Let me go; you should rest.”

Bi Xiuming, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes upon hearing this and chuckled, “What? Just tamed and already eager to show loyalty? You’re rushing to do this kind of work?”

“Indeed. Under someone else's roof, one must bow their head!” Yang Kai chuckled and stood up.

Bi Xiuming and his junior brother scoffed, their faces filled with disdain, causing many to show displeasure.

After walking around the places where the Demonic Beasts had died, Yang Kai collected thirty or forty Blood Beads and then strode over to the three in Senluo Palace.

Yao Xi looked at Yang Kai with a cold expression, her face somewhat vigilant.

After all, Yang Kai was brought by Zi Mo, and Yao Xi had to be cautious.

“Throw the Blood Beads over!” Yao Xi coldly ordered as Yang Kai approached within about three zhang.

Yang Kai nodded and used a bit of skill, continuously tossing over more than thirty Blood Beads, all of which Yao Xi caught without missing a single one.

Zi Mo watched coldly and spoke only after Yao Xi finished collecting the Blood Beads, “Now you have what you wanted, right? If you have no other matters, I will take my leave.”

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances and both chuckled lightly, “Where does Senior Sister want to go?”

Zi Mo's expression changed, and she said in a deep voice, “Where I go is none of your business!”

Yao Xi giggled, “Senior Sister's temper is still so fierce. We are also considering for Senior Sister. In this perilous foreign land, without Demonic Beasts guarding you, if you run into any mishap, how can we explain it to Master?”

Zi Mo looked at them in disbelief, “You all want to control me too?”

Yao He said, “What does Senior Sister mean? We are all family and should take care of each other.”

Yao Xi nodded, “Yes, for Senior Sister's safety, Junior Sister thinks it’s better for you to stay.”

A cold smile appeared at the corner of Zi Mo's mouth, her expression sorrowful. On the way here, Yang Kai had already told her that Yao He and Yao Xi were very likely to go to extremes. They would take drastic measures.

Since they dared to touch your Demonic Beasts, they would dare to touch your people! Yang Kai had told her this.

Zi Mo still held a glimmer of hope, but now it seemed that Yang Kai was absolutely right.

In such a place, killing Zi Mo would leave no trace as long as the aftermath was handled well. As for the Great Han's martial artists, they all had to be silenced. Why would Yao He and Yao Xi be afraid?

First, they would eliminate her Demonic Beasts, then target her. Everything was just as Yang Kai had deduced. One could say he had foresight or that he understood the treachery of human hearts.

Zi Mo fell silent, her gaze gradually turning cold.

Yao Xi suddenly frowned and turned to Yang Kai, scolding, “What are you doing standing there? Hurry up and roll back!”

After saying this, she looked disdainfully at Zi Mo, “Senior Sister, is this how you teach your subordinates? There’s not a shred of upbringing.”

Zi Mo did not respond, but Yang Kai awkwardly smiled, cautiously cupping his fists towards her. He glanced at Zi Mo, his expression turning resentful, and said, “You two, can you let this wretch remove the Control Soul Insect from my body? I am willing to abandon darkness for light and pledge loyalty to you two.”

Upon hearing this, Zi Mo abruptly turned her head to look at Yang Kai, gritting her teeth, “What did you just call me?”

“Wretch! What’s wrong with that?” Yang Kai seemed to have found a backing, straightening his back and confronting her.

“Ha ha…” Zi Mo laughed in anger, “Daring to call me that, it seems you’ve forgotten who is in charge here.”

This was something Yang Kai had said to her before, and now it was being thrown back at him.

“Is the lesson I gave you before not enough?” Zi Mo's killing intent surged as she scolded, and Yang Kai immediately fell to the ground in great pain, clutching his stomach and rolling around, shouting to Yao He and Yao Xi, “Help! I truly wish to pledge loyalty to you two, willing to give my all!”

This sudden turn of events naturally drew the attention of the Great Han martial artists.

Hearing Yang Kai's shameless words, anyone who had a bit of friendship with him couldn't help but show a pained expression, especially the four young women from Wan Hua Palace. Han Xiao Qi frowned, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to be so spineless.

On the contrary, Bi Xiuming and his junior brother were momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter, “What did he say? He wants to pledge loyalty to those two? Hahaha… this is just too funny. He really is going to show loyalty after taking that job; I said he was so diligent, and it turns out to be true!”

As they spoke, they spat on the ground with disdain in their eyes.

What a disgrace, a complete disgrace! Although this group of Great Han martial artists was also under control, no one had ever begged for mercy like Yang Kai did.

Yang Kai was still crying out in agony, seemingly unaware of how embarrassing he was, “Help! For the sake of my willingness to submit, please save me!”

Yao He and Yao Xi clearly did not expect to witness such a good show.

Zi Mo was their target, and Yang Kai was a martial artist brought by Zi Mo, yet now, the two were turning against her.

Wonderful, wonderful!

Not to save Yang Kai's life, but to strike at Zi Mo's arrogance, Yao He and Yao Xi felt they could no longer watch. If this spineless Great Han martial artist continued, he would become useless.

“Senior Sister, stop!” Yao Xi said with a proud expression, barely suppressing her laughter.

Zi Mo looked up, her eyes icy, “What? You want to interfere with my disciplining of my subordinate?”

Yao He replied, “If it were anyone else, we naturally wouldn’t care, but Senior Sister, you heard him. He wants to pledge loyalty to us, so now he is one of us. Senior Sister wouldn’t be unreasonable, would she?”

The two exchanged glances, and Zi Mo panted for a moment before gritting her teeth, “Fine, since Junior Brother and Junior Sister want it, then as Senior Sister, I will naturally fulfill it!”

Yao He smiled, as if he had won a great victory, his face filled with pride.

Yang Kai, who was rolling on the ground, finally stopped his cries and struggles. His clothes were soaked with sweat as he staggered to his feet, cupping his fists towards Yao He and Yao Xi, gratefully saying, “Thank you both. I have suffered greatly under this wretch these days.”

Yao He looked at him meaningfully and nodded, “Indeed, Senior Sister has a bad temper, but you made the right choice. Following us, we won’t let you suffer!”

“Thank you both, thank you both!” Yang Kai became even more obsequious.

On the Great Han martial artist's side, Bi Xiuming sneered, “A wall-sitting grass, leaning both ways. Doesn’t he know that no matter who he falls into the hands of, it ultimately leads to death?”

Yang Kai straightened his back again, grinning at Zi Mo, and spoke without reservation, “Wretch, get that insect out of me, or else you’ll be in for it!”

What a display of bravado!

Using the tiger's skin as a banner, that was exactly what it meant.

Yao He and Yao Xi became even prouder.

They no longer needed to confront Zi Mo directly; Yang Kai's betrayal alone was enough to make her lose face.

“Good, good!” Zi Mo was heartbroken, clearly furious, “Since you want it, then as you wish! But… do you think there will be any good outcome falling into their hands? Sooner or later, it’s still death. I hope you won’t regret it then!”

Yang Kai turned his nose to the sky, extremely arrogant, “What do I care about your meddling? I’m happy to do so; go ahead and bite me!”

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances, feeling that this Great Han martial artist was truly a foolish idiot. However, if he weren’t like this, he wouldn’t be foolish enough to confront Zi Mo directly.

The Yao siblings felt proud, while the group of Great Han martial artists wished they could bury their heads in the ground. Although their friendship with Yang Kai was not deep, they felt embarrassed at this moment. They were all from Great Han, yet they were causing such a scene in front of Tianlang and the others. What a disgrace!

Yet the person involved showed no awareness of this at all.

Only Leng Shan lightly coughed, covering her mouth, a hint of suppressed laughter flashing in her eyes.

She truly admired the acting of Zi Mo and the two.

As for Yang Kai's previous schemes, she was even more in awe. The current situation was almost identical to his predictions.

Leng Shan knew that as long as they passed this hurdle, the main event would arrive. She quietly approached Han Xiao Qi from Wan Hua Palace and whispered something in her ear.

Han Xiao Qi's eyes lit up with surprise as she looked at Leng Shan, who nodded seriously.

“I understand.” Han Xiao Qi took a deep breath, a faint smile appearing at the corner of her mouth, and began to relay what she had heard to her three junior sisters.

“Hurry up! What are you dawdling for?” Yang Kai urged, as if he could not wait to submit to Yao He and Yao Xi.

Zi Mo gave him a deep look before stepping forward and placing a hand on Yang Kai's abdomen.

Yang Kai blinked and said to Yao He, “Will she take the opportunity to kill me?”

Yao He sneered, “How could Senior Sister be that kind of person?”

“That's good, that's good.” Yang Kai couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. Moments later, his expression changed as he expelled a Control Soul Insect.

Before Zi Mo could collect the insect, he rushed forward and began to stomp on it violently, cursing in the most vulgar and vicious manner, spitting everywhere.

Yao He and Yao Xi listened with their brows twitching, while Zi Mo's face turned ashen, her body trembling with rage as she glared at Yang Kai with a surging killing intent.

“Enough!” Yao He could hardly tolerate Yang Kai's foolishness any longer and quickly shouted, “The Control Soul Insect has a unique constitution; you can’t crush it.”

“Oh, making a fool of myself, making a fool of myself!”

Everyone felt dizzy. Should they say he had self-awareness or what?
