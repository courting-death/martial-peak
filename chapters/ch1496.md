## Chapter 1496 — Pure Spirit Qi

After several days, Yang Kai did gain some harvests—Secret Treasures, Pills, cultivation arts and secret techniques, and the like.

However, compared with the journey to the Imperial Garden, such gains were worlds apart and did not give Yang Kai any sense of astonishment.

Better than nothing, that was all.

On this day, he delved into one of the palaces and, astonishingly, did not emerge for several days. Those from Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect who had been monitoring Yang Kai’s movements were completely baffled, unable to understand what had happened to him.

Within that palace, in an underground secret chamber, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged, circulating his cultivation, greedily drawing in the nearby Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth.

In this chamber, the Spiritual Qi had actually become so dense it was visible to the naked eye, turning into strands of pure white silk that coiled around Yang Kai. With his breaths, those white strands seemed to be attracted, surging into his body and vanishing.

As time flowed, the white threads within the chamber grew fewer and fewer.

Pure Spirit Qi!

Yang Kai had not expected to obtain such a harvest.

It is said that there exists in this world a special kind of Spiritual Qi that requires no circulation or conversion and can be directly absorbed by a cultivator, thereby enhancing one’s cultivation realm and personal strength.

This is Pure Spirit Qi. Its effect upon any cultivator is beyond description, better than even the finest Earth Vein by countless times.

Yet it is extremely rare and seldom appears; even when it does, it quickly melts back into heaven and earth, becoming part of ordinary Spiritual Qi. Only by using special methods to confine it can it be preserved for long.

The ruins of this ancient Sect were situated upon an excellent Earth Vein, and from time to time one or two wisps of Pure Spirit Qi would be born. This underground chamber was arranged with many profound arrays; though Yang Kai could not understand them, he knew they existed precisely to confine such Pure Spirit Qi.

The accumulation of a year or two might not be obvious, and even a hundred or a thousand years would still be thin.

But the accumulation of tens of thousands of years would make one’s eyes go wide.

When Yang Kai opened the door of this chamber, he almost thought he had misseen—within the secret room the dense Pure Spirit Qi had condensed into substance, ready to be seized with a casual hand.

This unexpected discovery made his heart soar with joy. After understanding that this was the Pure Spirit Qi of rumor, how could he hesitate? He immediately sealed the chamber and began to sit in meditation and absorb it.

Generally speaking, a chamber that confines Pure Spirit Qi would be opened at least once every several hundred years. It was not meant for cultivators to simply strengthen themselves, for though Pure Spirit Qi is rare, it is exceedingly scarce; using it solely to bolster strength would be far too wasteful.

Its existence is meant for use when a cultivator reaches a bottleneck and seeks a breakthrough.

Good steel should be used on the blade’s edge.

When a cultivator breaks through a realm, the denser the surrounding Spiritual Qi, the smaller the obstacles encountered. Pure Spirit Qi is the finest catalyst, allowing any cultivator to reduce risk at the moment of breakthrough.

Yet now this precious existence was being absorbed by Yang Kai without restraint to steadily swell his strength. Calling it wasteful would not be an exaggeration—so much Pure Spirit Qi would be enough for hundreds of cultivators to break through.

And he spent only three days to absorb as much as seventy percent of it.

His Saint Yuan became ever more majestic and condensed, and his realm climbed bit by bit, very quickly reaching the pinnacle of the First Stage!

By now, Yang Kai faintly sensed a restraint, like a thin membrane hindering the rise of his strength. This was the bottleneck.

If it were another cultivator, he would certainly first temper his state of mind and comprehend the Martial Dao, expending a great deal of time before breaking through this bottleneck.

But Yang Kai was different. He had absorbed the soul essences of many cultivators whose realms surpassed his own, and his comprehension of the Martial Dao already far outstripped his current level. Only the tempering of his mind was still somewhat lacking.

Still, if he wished, he might not lack the chance to break through here and now, reaching the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

But Yang Kai was not so eager for quick success.

Haste makes waste. He had broken through to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm not long ago. Although, by relying on the Imperial Might exuded within the Imperial Garden, he had condensed his own Shi to completion, breaking through again so soon in succession would very likely plant hidden dangers.

So after pondering for a while, he no longer absorbed the remaining Pure Spirit Qi. Yet to leave it at that would be far too wasteful. After a brief hesitation, Yang Kai took out a Transmission Compass and poured in his Divine Sense, wishing to contact Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

Letting those two come absorb the remaining Pure Spirit Qi would be best.

To Yang Kai’s disappointment, however, Qian Tong gave no response at all!

That was indeed odd. Though the ruins of this ancient Sect covered no small area, they certainly were not beyond the Transmission Compass’s range. Could it be that Qian Tong encountered some trouble and could not respond?

It was possible. Since this was a Sect’s ruins, there must be places isolated from the world. Perhaps Qian Tong had stepped into some restriction.

Unable to reach Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, and unwilling to abandon the remaining Pure Spirit Qi before him, Yang Kai scratched his head for a time, at a loss for an idea.

But a moment later, his eyes lit up as though he had thought of something. With a stir of his mind, a flame‑red light flew out from his body; wings unfurled, and it became the shape of a strange bird.

Artifact Spirit Fire Bird!

Though it had no physical form, it was a being with intelligence. It should have no problem absorbing Pure Spirit Qi—after all, it could even refine Sun’s True Fire.

Sure enough, after the Fire Bird flew out, it let out a joyous cry, then opened its great beak. Its belly swelled and fell; with the pull of its suction, the Pure Spirit Qi within the chamber was swallowed like water by a whale.

Those white thread‑like Pure Spirit Qi diminished at a speed visible to the eye.

...

Outside the palace, more than twenty Origin Returning Realm experts of Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had surrounded this place so tightly that not even water could pass through.

This place was secluded and extremely remote, a perfect spot to make a move without fear of being seen by outsiders and leaving others room to gossip.

Although employing such a luxurious lineup against a cultivator of the First Stage did feel like using an ox‑cleaver to kill a chicken, since the other side understood some Spatial Force, Qu Zheng and Fang Peng did not dare be careless.

Only one problem lay before everyone, leaving them at their wits’ end.

Yang Kai simply would not come out!

Even when they probed within with Divine Sense, they could not perceive his aura; yet, according to a report from a Battle Sky Alliance expert, he had personally seen Yang Kai enter.

“Brother Qu, could that brat have already left?” Fang Peng asked somewhat impatiently.

“Brother Fang, are you perhaps questioning that my people are incompetent?” Qu Zheng had also waited himself into irritation and only wished to rush in and drag Yang Kai out at once; hearing this, he naturally did not keep a good temper.

“That is not what I mean. It is just that you know that brat understands some Spatial Force. Perhaps he discovered the surveillance and left quietly,” Fang Peng said with a frown.

“Brother Fang worries too much. Though Deacon Jia is only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he has unique means in concealing qi. If he wishes to hide his tracks and watch someone, not to mention that brat—even this Alliance Master may not detect him. Since Deacon Jia says he is inside, then he must be inside.”

“I will guarantee it with my head—that brat absolutely did not notice me, and he is certainly still within the hall!” Five zhang away, an old man with a goatee said in a deep voice, his face full of confidence.

“Mm, in that case, we shall wait a bit longer. But with so many of us here, if that brat senses something, he might not have the guts to come out,” Fang Peng curled his lip.

“This matter is not up to him,” Qu Zheng said with a series of cold sneers.

Just as they were speaking, a sudden surge of life aura appeared within the palace. Everyone’s eyes lit up at once, and when their Divine Senses swept over, they found that the fluctuation of that life aura unmistakably belonged to Yang Kai.

Very soon, Yang Kai’s figure appeared at the palace entrance. His brows knit slightly as if somewhat surprised, but he showed no intention of stopping and instead walked over step by step from that side.

“He’s out!” Fang Peng shouted in a low voice.

“Good that he is out!” Qu Zheng coldly smiled, his gaze as sharp as a blade, cold light shooting in all directions. “Saves this Alliance Master the trouble of going in personally to seize him.”

Yang Kai strode forward with hands clasped behind his back. The surprise on his face had already faded, leaving an incomparable calm. Not only was there no sign of panic, there was not even an intent to avoid them. He walked straight up to the group, swept his gaze around, and grinned. “Quite a crowd.”

“Yang Kai!” Qu Changfeng snapped his folding fan shut and called out with a smile, “You made this Young Master wait!”

“Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect...” Yang Kai nodded slightly, his face full of mirth. “Very good, very good. So many people waiting here—is it to kill me?”

“To kill you, we’d hardly need so many people! Yang Kai, stop flattering yourself — you’re not worthy of that much attention,” Qu Changfeng laughed loudly.

“Oh? Then why gather so many here?”

“Merely to prevent you from running.”

“So that’s how it is!” An expression of realization surfaced on Yang Kai’s face. “I was wondering why that Elder Liang was so easy to talk to—turns out you were waiting for me here. This truly is a fine place to kill and silence. May I ask why? Though there are grudges between me and your two forces, it has not reached this point, has it?”

“Do you think this Young Master would tell you?” Qu Changfeng sneered in disdain.

“No need to say it; I can guess. The warship, hm?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

To make both the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect send so many people just to deal with him — it could only be because of profit. And the only thing tied to the interests of both sides… was that Void King-Grade warship.

That is not merely a warship; it bears the hope of all experts on Dark Star to advance to the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai frowned, secretly blaming himself for having underestimated the lure of that warship. He had not thought carefully about how much upheaval the birth of a Void King‑Grade warship would bring to Dark Star, but upon witnessing the present scene, he finally understood.

“Good that you know,” Qu Changfeng did not deny it. Although this time Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had acted jointly under the orders of Star Emperor Mountain, in the final analysis it was still because of that warship.
