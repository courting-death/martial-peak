## Chapter 2482 — Mo Xiaoqi

“Take a look at this. I snatched it from Wu Mengchuan before. Right before he died, he seemed intent on destroying it, so there must be some secret to it.” Before entering the Xuan Realm Pearl, the Incarnation suddenly tossed something to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it and examined it carefully, discovering that it was just a jade slip. However, at a glance, it was clear that this jade slip was quite old, seemingly passed down from a distant era.

Moreover, many restrictions had been placed on the jade slip. Yang Kai tried to break them, but couldn’t even find a way in.

The method used for the restrictions was extremely ancient and complex. After studying it for a while, Yang Kai couldn’t make any progress at all.

The Incarnation said he snatched it from Wu Mengchuan, and Wu Mengchuan even tried to destroy the jade slip before dying. It seemed this jade slip had quite the background, likely hiding some secret, and Wu Mengchuan clearly didn’t want Yang Kai to uncover it.

Just what kind of secret could make Wu Mengchuan risk everything to destroy it before dying, unwilling to let anyone else know?

Wu Mengchuan was a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, and the Shattered Star Sea was the very place where the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor perished. The more Yang Kai thought about it, the more he felt this jade slip was related to the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Yang Kai carefully put away the jade slip, treating it with utmost caution. Only then did he leap away from the shattered star, leaving it behind.

After Wu Mengchuan’s death, Yang Kai naturally claimed both his Seven-Pointed Star Seal and his Spatial Ring. However, there was little of value inside the ring. The only priceless treasure was the Blood Spirit Bottle inherited from the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, but unfortunately, it was destroyed by the Mountain and River Bell.

Even after devouring Wu Mengchuan’s Seven-Pointed Star Seal, Yang Kai’s Star Seal still showed no signs of advancing.

It’s said that if one can upgrade their Star Seal to the highest level, the Nine-Pointed Star Seal, they can find the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s legacy.

Yang Kai figured this was just a rumor. Not to mention how many people one would have to kill to upgrade the Star Seal to the highest level, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s legacy isn’t something just anyone can obtain. Yang Kai had already experienced the power and terror of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. Even if someone did obtain it here, it might not be a blessing.

So from beginning to end, Yang Kai never cared much about this matter, and he doubted anyone could upgrade their Star Seal to the highest level anyway.

A day later, Yang Kai returned to the Origin Sea.

Last time, because he ran into Wu Mengchuan, Yang Kai had hurried off to ask about the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, so he left the Origin Sea. But now that the Incarnation had broken through his bottleneck, he naturally had to return.

There was still so much Origin Power in the Origin Sea that he hadn’t absorbed or refined, and he hadn’t even seen the legendary complete Origin yet. How could he just miss out like this?

But when Yang Kai finally returned to the Origin Sea, he realized that time had changed everything—nothing was as it had been before.

Looking out, the area of the Origin Sea had shrunk greatly, and the number of cultivators here had increased dramatically. He had no idea what had happened in the Origin Sea during the month he was gone.

Above the Origin Sea, countless groups of all sizes clashed. Warriors gathered from everywhere, and people were constantly being killed, falling from the sky and disappearing into the Origin Sea below.

Compared to before, the fighting here was clearly much more intense.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown. So many people had come to the Origin Sea. Clearly, someone had spread the news, drawing countless cultivators here.

This also proved that the Origin Sea was indeed a good place.

But with more people, there was naturally more conflict. In such chaos, being able to calmly absorb and refine Origin Power became all the more precious.

As Yang Kai flew along, he found the situation was even worse than he had seen at first glance.

Not only were there more fights between cultivators, but the entire Origin Sea was now emitting a strange aura. Yang Kai could clearly sense the Origin Sea slowly flowing in a certain direction, and this movement was even greater than the commotion he had caused before.

Could someone else possess a treasure similar to the Xuan Realm Pearl? Otherwise, how could such an anomaly occur in the Origin Sea?

His heart was full of suspicion.

But he didn’t plan to linger outside. He intended to go deep inside like last time to see what was happening. The Origin Power deeper in was denser and purer—absorbing and refining it for a day there was worth a month outside.

Suddenly, Yang Kai sensed something and looked in a certain direction.

Over there, a pair of bright eyes happened to be looking his way as well.

As their gazes met, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, and he immediately changed direction and sped over.

Because the person looking his way was actually Liu Yan!

After entering the Shattered Star Sea for a year, Yang Kai had parted ways with Liu Yan and the others. Sister Hua had also gone off to seek her own opportunities, leaving him alone and sometimes feeling a bit lonely.

He hadn’t expected to run into them again here in the Origin Sea.

Though it was a coincidence, it was also inevitable.

At this moment, nearly seventy or eighty percent of the surviving cultivators in the Shattered Star Sea had gathered in the Origin Sea. Liu Yan and the others must have heard the news and come here as well.

The little girl from the Zhang Family was also standing beside Liu Yan, looking graceful and in good spirits.

As Yang Kai flew over, Liu Yan quietly nudged Zhang Ruoxi and whispered something to her. The next moment, Zhang Ruoxi turned to look at Yang Kai, her eyes lighting up.

When Yang Kai arrived, she immediately called out in a crisp voice, “Sir!”

Perhaps it was because she was seeing Yang Kai again, but Zhang Ruoxi’s cheeks flushed a rosy red, her eyes sparkling with joy. She looked truly delighted.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and was about to speak when he suddenly widened his eyes and looked Zhang Ruoxi up and down.

The little girl felt embarrassed under Yang Kai’s gaze.

“Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!” Yang Kai gasped, hardly able to believe his eyes.

In less than two years, Zhang Ruoxi had advanced from the First Stage to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and in the Shattered Star Sea where Spiritual Qi was so thin! Even Yang Kai had to admit her cultivation speed put him to shame.

Although Yang Kai had long known that Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline was special and likely hid an astonishing secret, and that as long as she had resources her cultivation would progress at a shocking pace, he was still amazed at how much she had changed in just a few years.

As for Liu Yan, her strength didn’t seem to have increased much—she was still at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—but her aura was undoubtedly more solid and refined.

During this time away from Yang Kai’s care, the two of them seemed to have done quite well.

“Sister Liu Yan gave me all her cultivation resources, so I was able to advance to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!” Zhang Ruoxi explained softly. “It’s all thanks to Sister Liu Yan!”

Liu Yan smiled gently and said nothing.

Yang Kai nodded. “But you needed the talent to make it happen.”

Without talent, no amount of resources could bring such achievements in so short a time.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but look forward to what kind of accomplishments this little girl from the Zhang Family might achieve in the future.

“Master, have you seen Sister Hua lately?” Liu Yan suddenly asked.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I haven’t.”

Zhang Ruoxi said worriedly, “I wonder how Sister Hua has been doing.”

The three girls had often kept each other company inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, so their bond was deep. Now, meeting Yang Kai again but missing Hua Qingsi, it was only natural to worry about her safety.

In the less than two years since leaving Yang Kai, Liu Yan and Zhang Ruoxi had seen much ugliness in the world. Many times, they had relied on Liu Yan’s White Tiger puppet to escape danger. Especially Zhang Ruoxi—her innocence had been worn away, and she now showed a hint of maturity.

“You don’t need to worry too much about Sister Hua.” Although Yang Kai was concerned, he could only comfort them. “She’s different from you two—she’s a veteran, and she’s also a disciple of the Star God Palace. Plus, she has that Five-Colored Spear. Most people aren’t her match.”

“But now, so many people in the Shattered Star Sea have advanced to the Emperor Realm,” Zhang Ruoxi said softly.

“There are Emperors, but not many. Sister Hua won’t be that unlucky. Besides, those who can advance to the Emperor Realm are all elite disciples from the major sects—they won’t go around bullying others for no reason.” After comforting them for a while, Yang Kai changed the subject. “Why are you standing here? It’s dangerous up here. Go find a place below to absorb and refine Origin Power!”

“Xiaoqi is here!” Liu Yan said.

“Who?”

Liu Yan pointed in a certain direction.

Yang Kai followed her gaze and couldn’t help but widen his eyes, exclaiming, “Mo Xiaoqi!”

The woman over there, locked in a fierce struggle, was none other than Mo Xiaoqi! The butterfly-shaped birthmark on her face was just as obvious as when Yang Kai first met her.

Back when Yang Kai first arrived in Fenglin City, he had only made two friends—one was Kang Siran, the shopkeeper of the Spiritual Pill Shop, and the other was this mischievous little girl, Mo Xiaoqi.

Unfortunately, later on, Kang Siran advanced to the Dao Origin Realm and was transferred away by the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, while Mo Xiaoqi suddenly disappeared one day, leaving behind a baffling message: Aunt Feng came to catch me, so I’m leaving first!

Yang Kai had met this so-called Aunt Feng.

With the terrifying cultivation of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, a single palm from her shattered Yang Kai’s flying Secret Treasure without harming him in the slightest.

The wooden boat he now used was a gift from Aunt Feng as compensation.

That was also the first time Yang Kai had witnessed the power of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Facing such an expert, he had felt utterly powerless. Fortunately, Aunt Feng bore him no ill will—otherwise, he wouldn’t be alive today.

Back then, Yang Kai didn’t really understand Mo Xiaoqi’s background, only that she was definitely someone important. But after years of struggling in the Star Realm and learning about the various powers, he had gradually guessed her true identity.

Spirit Beast Island of the Eastern Territory—Mo Xiaoqi was none other than the daughter of the Beast Great Emperor!

In the Eastern Territory, there are two legendary islands. One is Spirit Beast Island, the hidden home of the Beast Great Emperor, one of the Ten Great Emperors. Though not a sect, it is famous throughout the Star Realm—everyone knows its name.

The second is the fabled Dragon Isle! It’s said that many dragons live there, but ordinary people have no idea where it is, or even if it truly exists.

Yet the name Dragon Isle is just as renowned as any other.
