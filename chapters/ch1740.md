## Chapter 1740 — Traveling Together

"If it was an ambush, then why didn't Brother Yang wait for a better moment? For example, when old dog Li killed me and his mind was relaxed—if Brother Yang struck at that instant, it would certainly have been easier," Gu Jianxin asked.

“Taking more effort doesn’t mean I couldn’t kill him,” Yang Kai smiled confidently. “You’re wondering why I chose to save you, aren’t you, Young Alliance Master?”

Gu Jianxin nodded.

"A man who would risk his life for the woman he loves — it's a pity to let him die like this," Yang Kai replied.

Earlier, Gu Jianxin had stepped forward to block a blow from Li Minghai to protect the Right Sword Servant; Yang Kai had seen it happen. That had truly been stepping into danger — one wrong move and both he and the Right Sword Servant would have gone to the Yellow Springs together.

Yang Kai had once fought desperately for Su Yan too, even clashing head-on with an expert like Luo Hai, so Gu Jianxin's actions resonated with him.

A man who would throw himself into death for the woman he loved certainly was not a crafty, vicious sort.

Gu Jianxin was taken aback for a moment.

The Left and Right Sword Servants blushed prettily; they looked at Gu Jianxin with the fondness of lovers, their beautiful eyes filled with sweetness.

Gu Jianxin let out a hearty laugh, the wariness in his eyes finally fading away. With boundless vigor, he said, “It seems Brother Yang is also a man of true temperament. For this Gu to make your acquaintance here—it is truly a blessing of three lifetimes!”

Yang Kai rubbed his nose. "There is another reason… I know someone in your Sword Alliance."

"Oh? Brother Yang knows someone in our Sword Alliance?" Gu Jianxin asked delightedly.

Setting aside that Yang Kai had saved his life and thus held a debt of gratitude, Gu Jianxin already liked Yang Kai as a person and wished to cultivate a friendship. Hearing that Yang Kai knew someone in the Sword Alliance, he was naturally very pleased.

"Who do you know, Brother Yang?"

"They're here," Yang Kai said, indicating to one side.

Gu Jianxin turned his head and found, to his surprise, the three disciples of Yue Xi who had shone in the previous battle.

"So it's them!" Gu Jianxin exclaimed.

He had assumed the person Yang Kai knew would be one of his own side's top experts, not such an unremarkable trio of master and disciples.

In a moment Yue Xi and her two disciples, He Zao and He Miao, flew over and bowed to Gu Jianxin. They inquired after his condition, and upon learning the Alliance Master was not badly hurt, they finally exhaled in relief.

"Eldest Brother Yang." He Zao and He Miao had had more contact with Yang Kai. They owed their survival this time to Yang Kai's help and felt no distance; they coquettishly greeted him at once.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, then beckoned; a red light shot from He Zao's body into his palm, and he absorbed it.

"Thank you, Yang Kai. If not for you this trip, we would likely have perished — the three of us are deeply grateful!" Yue Xi said sincerely.

Yang Kai said nothing, calmly accepting their thanks.

"Brother Yang knowing Lady Yue and her disciples — what a fate indeed," Gu Jianxin laughed. "If Brother Yang will not refuse, why not rest a while on my warship? Allow me to properly host you."

Yang Kai pondered and did not answer immediately.

He had stayed here intending to ambush Li Minghai; now that he had eliminated that fellow there was nothing pressing to do.

Seeing him silent, Gu Jianxin did not press him. He Zao and He Miao, however, looked at Yang Kai beseechingly, clearly hoping he would stay.

"Where is the Young Alliance Master's destination on this trip?" Yang Kai asked at last.

"Just call me Brother Gu; 'Young Alliance Master' sounds distant," Gu Jianxin smiled. "To be honest, I am heading to Qingmu Star this trip."

"Qingmu Star?"

"Yes, it is a cultivation star under our Sword Alliance. The journey from here is only one month."

"I see…" Yang Kai thought for a moment and then nodded. "Very well, since Brother Gu invites me, I will trouble you."

When Yang Kai agreed, Gu Jianxin's eyes lit up; evidently very pleased, he approached and took Yang Kai's arm, pulling him toward the direction of the warship as if they were long familiar.

Of the three warships, two had been ruined by Li Minghai and his fellows — one had exploded, another been crippled. Only Gu Jianxin's largest warship remained capable of sailing; though somewhat damaged, it required only repairs.

On the ship, Gu Jianxin arranged for Yang Kai to stay while he himself went to recover. His clash with Li Minghai had been fierce; though not fatal, it had caused significant injury that could not be healed by merely taking a Spiritual Pill; he needed to sit in meditation and recuperate.

Yang Kai understood and had no objection.

After a day's repairs and inspections, the warship sailed again.

Gu Jianxin had Yang Kai put in an exceedingly luxurious cabin — a vast room with thick fur rugs on the floor and a hundred Luminous Pearls inlaid around, bathing the chamber in soft, warm light.

An incense burner gave off a gentle fragrance, helping to calm the spirit.

Yang Kai had his own reasons for accepting Gu Jianxin's invitation.

The space arrays he had set along the way were left on dead stars as relay stations; it was time to connect them to a true cultivation star, or the cultivators coming out of the Dark Star would have no clear destination.

Qingmu Star, Yang Kai had observed on the star chart, was a respectable cultivation star.

If Ye Xijun and the others came here via the space arrays, they could use Qingmu Star's Spiritual Qi and Heaven-and-Earth laws to try to break through to the Void King Realm.

Another point was that the Ethereal Crystals in Yang Kai's possession were nearly exhausted.

Although Ye Xijun and the others had scavenged almost all the Ethereal Crystal stores on the Dark Star before leaving, establishing a Great Space Array consumed an enormous share.

He had only enough Ethereal Crystal left to form one more Space Array!

He needed to find a way to replenish them.

Since Qingmu Star belonged to the Sword Alliance and he now had a connection with its Young Alliance Master Gu Jianxin, he could use that relationship to purchase some Ethereal Crystals for backup.

Before that, he could take time to return to that mining star to see whether Qian Tong and Ye Xijun had discovered an Ethereal Crystal vein; if they had, it would save him much trouble.

While in the cabin, Yang Kai counted up his gains.

There were not many; in this conflict he had only killed three people. As for Zhang Fu's and Liu Dong's spatial rings, their contents were unremarkable to Yang Kai — they could be left as holdings for Lingxiao Sect.

Li Minghai's spatial ring, however, contained substantial wealth.

In particular, the Void King-Grade secret treasure, the Soul-Breaking Spear, had fallen into Yang Kai's hands.

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure — even across the entire Star Domain, such an item was priceless and unattainable! However, Yang Kai didn’t feel much interest in this treasure. Among the people he knew, there didn’t seem to be anyone suitable to use it.

For now, it would have to be set aside.

While he was tallying things, someone knocked on the door; Yang Kai paused and called, "Come in."

The door opened and two graceful figures entered.

"Eldest Brother Yang!" He Miao chirped, setting down the delicate food and fine wine she and He Zao had brought on a nearby table.

Yang Kai glanced; the offerings were exquisite but hardly of significance. For someone of his caliber, rare delicacies and fine wines were only to satisfy the palate and did not add strength unless they were special strength-enhancing foods.

"We didn't disturb you, did we?" He Zao, more mature, saw Yang Kai seemed occupied and asked, concern in her voice.

"No," Yang Kai smiled faintly and motioned, "Sit."

"No need," He Zao waved a hand. "We are here to serve you; we'll stand. If you have any orders, tell us."

"Did Gu Jianxin send you?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." He Zao lowered her eyes demurely while He Miao looked around with wide curiosity.

Clearly it was her first time in such a noble cabin.

"Then sit; that's my order," Yang Kai chuckled.

He Zao hesitated but then bowed her head slightly and sat with her sister, though her posture remained formal; she shot a fierce glance at the restless He Miao.

He Miao stuck out her pretty tongue and finally settled down.

"It seems every time we meet, you two are in dire straits," Yang Kai joked.

The first time he encountered the two sisters in the Star Domain, they had been hunted down by cultivators from Purple Star.
Now, upon meeting them again, they had fallen into Li Minghai’s ambush instead — though the circumstances differed, their plight was strikingly similar.

Hearing Yang Kai’s teasing, He Zao’s face flushed red, while He Miao muttered, “That’s what we should be saying to you.”

“He Miao!” He Zao immediately glared at her younger sister. He Miao pouted in protest, “What? I was just talking — Brother Yang wouldn’t mind anyway.”

He Zao looked apologetic to Yang Kai. "My little sister has been spoiled; Eldest Brother Yang, please don't mind her."

"It's fine — don't be so tense," Yang Kai waved a hand. When they had first met, their strengths had been comparable; their master had even been stronger, so they had mingled as peers. Now the gap had widened; He Zao found it hard to adapt.

After all, their master had only reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, whereas Yang Kai had suddenly become a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert and had even become brothers-in-name with the Young Alliance Master.

Seeing her awkwardness, Yang Kai changed the subject and casually asked how things had been for them these years.

There was nothing to hide; He Zao readily recounted their story.

After leaving the Floating Continent they had gone their separate ways. Yue Xi had taken the two sisters back to the Sword Alliance. Because that operation had suffered heavy losses — one warship destroyed and many Sword Alliance cultivators killed — Yue Xi, as the leader, had nearly faced disaster. It was only because a high-ranking Sword Alliance member spoke up on their behalf that punishment was avoided.

For that reason Yue Xi and her disciples began to follow Gu Jianxin, for it was one of Gu Jianxin's supporters who had spoken for them.
