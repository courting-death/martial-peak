## Chapter 1742 — Yue Xi's Request

According to the Alliance's rules, in cases like Yue Xi's the severe punishment was immediate execution to serve as a warning, while the lesser penalty was to strip one's cultivation and expel them from the Sword Alliance. He Zao and He Miao would inevitably be reduced to the fate of menial servants and maids.

At the final moment, it was a high-ranking Sword Alliance member named Qin Wuhui who spoke on their behalf, preserving their lives and standing.

Qin Wuhui was an expert who had long followed Gu Jianxin; thus Yue Xi and her two disciples were indirectly connected to Gu Jianxin.

Qin Wuhui was, in many ways, a decent man. Although he had spoken well for Yue Xi and the others, he had not used it to pressure or coerce them; over the years he had shown them care, leaving the three of them deeply grateful.

However, Qin Wuhui had an unworthy son named Qin Qiyang. Relying on his father’s influence and prestige, this fellow lorded over others on the Sword Alliance’s main star. Though he couldn’t be called utterly depraved, he was certainly far from a decent person.

Qin Wuhui spent his days serving at Gu Jianxin's side and neglected to properly discipline his son, effectively letting him run free.

On the Sword Alliance’s main star, there was no shortage of people with power and influence. One day, Qin Qiyang provoked an opponent he couldn’t handle and fell into a trap. In a contest of strength and courage, he suffered a crushing defeat — though he didn’t die, his Divine Soul was gravely wounded, leaving him nearly a simpleton.

Despite his son's failures, he was still Qin Wuhui's flesh and blood, and Qin Qiyang's becoming a fool pained him deeply. Yet that very change made the boy settle down; he no longer engaged in the lawless bullying and extortion he had before.

Years passed in a blink, and Qin Wuhui began to arrange a marriage for his son so that his line might continue.

But who would accept a Qin Qiyang who was like a fool? Coupled with the vile conduct he had shown when sane, no woman was willing to agree to such a match.

Qin Wuhui's status was not low; ordinary women simply did not meet his standards.

Helpless, Qin Wuhui set his sights on the sisters He Zao and He Miao. In his view, if either of them married Qin Qiyang and bore him an heir, one of his worries would be resolved.

He had prepared generous compensation for that purpose.

He did not directly consult Yue Xi about the matter; instead he reported it to Gu Jianxin.

In a certain sense, that course of action was despicable. Qin Wuhui had considered it for a long time before swallowing his pride and doing it.

Over the years Qin Wuhui had loyally followed Gu Jianxin, earning meritorious service through toil. All he wanted now was a grandson to carry on his bloodline. How could Gu Jianxin refuse? He summoned Yue Xi and told her to inform He Zao and He Miao to discuss it between themselves and have either marry Qin Qiyang.

With Gu Jianxin's involvement there was almost no room for maneuver.

For over a year Yue Xi had been delaying, and Qin Wuhui, knowing his own action lacked propriety, had not pressed her.

But endless delay was not a solution; sooner or later He Zao or He Miao would be forced to comply.

Yang Kai's appearance gave Yue Xi hope. She could not ask Gu Jianxin to retract his decree, and Qin Wuhui had shown them kindness—she could not handle the matter herself. Yang Kai was different; he was not of the Sword Alliance, and Gu Jianxin had taken a liking to him. Perhaps a single word from him could avert the sisters' grim fate.

It was for that reason Yue Xi secretly visited Yang Kai and begged him to intervene.

After hearing her, Yang Kai lightly nodded. "So that's how it is!"

He had a sense now of what He Zao had been on the verge of saying before she left; it was likely this, though she had been too shy to speak it aloud.

"Young Master Yang, could you show mercy and save the two girls? They were born to wretched circumstances, with no father and no mother; I raised them from childhood as if they were my own, and I cannot bear to see either of them thrown into the flames!" Yue Xi pleaded, tears welling. "Lord Qin has shown kindness to this master and my disciples. If I could repay him, even if it meant facing mountains of blades and seas of fire, I would not flinch—but this concerns the futures of the two girls, and I truly cannot agree."

“Mhm, this matter can’t really be blamed on you,” Yang Kai’s tone softened noticeably. When he first heard her request, he had somewhat misunderstood her, but after listening to Yue Xi’s explanation, he finally realized that this was something entirely beyond her control.

With Gu Jianxin pressing the matter, how could she possibly resist?

For Gu Jianxin, satisfying Qin Wuhui's wish was naturally a priority; after all he was not very familiar with He Zao and He Miao, and Qin Wuhui had prepared abundant compensation.

As a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, the compensation he could offer would be exceedingly generous. For an ordinary woman, marrying into the Qin family would be like a phoenix soaring to glory.

One could say Gu Jianxin had been somewhat lacking in consideration on this matter, but given his position, his decision was understandable.

It would not be proper for him to meddle rashly, Yang Kai thought, frowning inwardly.

"Young Master Yang..." Yue Xi could not help herself as Yang Kai tapped the table and fell silent. "If you could get the Alliance Master to cancel this marriage, I would lay down my life and repay you."

"No need to put it so gravely," Yang Kai waved a hand. "But if I do step in, where would you and yours go afterward?"

Yue Xi froze, momentarily stunned, as if she had not anticipated that consequence.

“Let’s put it this way — that Qin Wuhui once did you a favor. If I really ruin this matter, then you three master and disciples will be branded as ungrateful, and how will you be able to remain in the Sword Alliance after that?”

Not everyone knew the truth; those who did not would see only the surface. What Yang Kai described was a very real possibility.

Those unrelated cultivators would surely think Yue Xi and her three disciples repaid kindness with ingratitude...

“This…” Yue Xi shivered at the thought of being pointed at and gossiped about by the Sword Alliance cultivators in the future. Suddenly, as if struck by an idea, she gritted her teeth and said, “If Young Master Yang does not find it beneath him, you might as well directly ask the Young Alliance Master for the two girls. They only have Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation; the Alliance Master would likely not refuse you. From then on, whether you make them servants or concubines— it would all be up to you.”

"That is out of the question," Yang Kai exclaimed, taken aback.

Yue Xi pressed her lips into a smile. "I can see the two girls have some fondness for you; they would likely not refuse you. After all, Young Master Yang is, like the Young Alliance Master, a dragon among men."

“You really are quite the master…” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched slightly.

"So, Young Master Yang..." Yue Xi looked at him anxiously. Until he gave a definite answer, she could not rest.

"This is a troublesome matter to meddle in," Yang Kai frowned.

Yue Xi's heart sank.

"Hm, tell me about Qin Qiyang's exact situation. And Qin Wuhui—what sort of man is he, and what is his status beside Gu Jianxin?"

...

Half an hour later Yue Xi left Yang Kai's chamber. The worry that had carved her brow over the past year seemed to have vanished; her steps were noticeably lighter. Clearly she had received a satisfactory answer.

The next two days passed without incident, and the warship sailed through the void toward the direction of Qingmu Star.

Yang Kai spent time cultivating in his chamber and took the opportunity to refine a batch of spiritual pills.

Two days later a faint knocking came from outside the door.

After receiving Yang Kai's reply, the door opened and the sisters He Zao and He Miao entered together.

"Eldest Brother Yang, the Young Alliance Master has laid out a banquet and invites you to attend," He Zao said.

"Very well," Yang Kai nodded and rose. "Lead the way."

He Zao and He Miao immediately walked ahead.

They walked along a corridor within the warship and soon arrived at a magnificent hall where warriors were seated in two rows, each place set with food and fine wine.

Gu Jianxin occupied the seat of honor, his complexion ruddy, and Sword Servants stood at his sides.

It was clear the recent period of recuperation had restored Gu Jianxin to his former vigor.

When he saw Yang Kai, Gu Jianxin rose at once with a smiling face, and the other cultivators also stood and cupped their fists in salute.

Many among them perhaps only knew of Yang Kai’s name — they knew that a few days ago, it was thanks to him that they escaped disaster and slew Li Minghai, yet had never actually seen him in person. But since even Gu Jianxin was showing such enthusiasm, none of them dared display the slightest neglect.

Yang Kai returned their courtesy with a calm smile, cupping his fists and exchanging polite words as he went. His easy manner won much favor among the Origin Returning Realm experts present; they judged him a powerful young man who was not arrogant, and it was no wonder the Young Alliance Master regarded him with special favor.

"Brother Yang, over here!" Gu Jianxin called.

He Zao and He Miao guided Yang Kai to the table beside Gu Jianxin and then stepped back to stand obediently.

Once Yang Kai was seated, Gu Jianxin laughed heartily. "Brother Yang, I have been lax in recuperation these days; I hope you will not take offense."

"Brother Gu was grievously injured; tending one's wounds is naturally the priority," Yang Kai replied with a slight nod.

"Brother Yang, this feast is to thank you for saving me from peril. Had you not acted, Lingyue and Anxing would likely have fallen into old dog Li's hands. From now on, Brother Yang, you are my friend and benefactor!"

Strange light flashed in the eyes of many Origin Returning Realm experts below.

Gu Jianxin was indeed a magnanimous man, but he did not lightly use the word 'friend.'

Now that he had said it, it meant he genuinely wished to befriend Yang Kai.

What was more, he had followed the word 'friend' with the weighty term 'benefactor,' and the Origin Returning Realm experts present sensed the unusual significance.

"This cup I drink to Brother Yang!" Gu Jianxin raised his full cup and drained it at a single gulp.

He Zao immediately stepped forward to refill Yang Kai's cup, then retreated, dutifully fulfilling her role as a maid.

Yang Kai lifted his cup and smiled, "Brother Gu is generous; I will not refuse."

He raised the cup to his lips and drained it as well.

"Good, today we shall not leave until we are drunk!" Gu Jianxin roared with laughter.

Pipes and strings played in harmony as youthful maidens stepped in with nimble dances, singing as they entered, and servants carried in sumptuous dishes to place upon the tables.

In an instant the entire hall became lively beyond measure.
