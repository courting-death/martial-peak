## Chapter 1237 — Fifth Layer

To the cold, indifferent man's disappointment, no matter how he scrutinized, he couldn't detect any sign that Yang Kai had concealed his cultivation realm; it seemed the other really was nothing more than a First Stage of the Saint King Realm martial artist.

He had no intention of probing further; he himself hailed from the Star Emperor Sect and was an unparalleled talent—he believed that even if Yang Kai truly concealed his realm, he wouldn't fear him. Moreover, perhaps the other had cultivated some secret art or donned a Secret Treasure that made his realm appear at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm.

He simply refused to believe Yang Kai was truly at such a level.

“Friend, don't misunderstand!” Yang Kai frowned. “I only heard some commotion over here, so I came to take a look.”

He offered a brief explanation; it wasn't that he feared the man, only that the other clearly wasn't to be trifled with, and Yang Kai didn't want to fight in this cursed place over a small misunderstanding.

To his surprise, the man merely nodded slightly, the wariness on his face easing considerably; he showed no intention of attacking, even sheathing his Silver Jiao Spear.

Without asking much more, the cold man suddenly said, “How should I call you?”

Yang Kai hesitated a moment, then gave his name.

“Leng Qing!” the other also gave his name.

Yang Kai unconsciously frowned; he didn't believe the man had come to befriend him for no reason—this person had always been taciturn in front of Fang Tianzhong and Qu Changfeng, clearly proud and haughty, a prodigy who regarded no one; yet here he had introduced himself, prompting Yang Kai's vigilance.

He glanced thoughtfully at the dim, jade-like pavilions hidden within the Guardian Mountain Array; Yang Kai's brow furrowed even more tightly.

As he feared, the man called Leng Qing spoke, “Interested in joining forces to break open this Guardian Mountain Array?”

“Sorry, not interested!” Yang Kai shook his head without thinking.

Leng Qing was startled—he hadn't expected anyone to refuse him, especially in this situation; did the other have no interest in the sect ruins inside?

Rotating his Divine Sense, Leng Qing asked coldly, “Do you think our skills can't break this array?”

“Correct. I don't see any hope, so I don't want to waste my energy.” Yang Kai nodded calmly. He had watched this fellow attempting to break the array earlier and knew just how subtle and sturdy the Guardian Mountain Array was; the outermost defensive barrier was only the first layer. Even with all of Leng Qing's techniques, it couldn't be budged. Yang Kai didn't think that with his addition they could shatter it.

Of course, if one were liberal with Golden Blood consumption—directly using a dozen or two drops to forcefully erupt all the energy contained within—such a thing might be possible.

But even if the outer barrier were broken, then what?

Yang Kai didn’t even need to think hard to know that the interior must be filled with countless layers of restrictions and peril — surely with even more formidable traps waiting for whoever dared to enter. He didn’t have that much confidence, nor did he have the time to waste here.

A Guardian Mountain Array protecting the ruins of a major sect from tens of thousands of years ago was best avoided.

So he refused Leng Qing's proposal without ceremony; he didn't even have the inclination to try.

“Why do you presume I can't break it?” To Yang Kai's surprise, the eternally cool man's expression suddenly hardened upon hearing Yang Kai's frank admission, as if offended to be belittled; a dangerous aura slowly spread from him.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and said coolly, “If you think you can break it, then by all means show your methods—I take my leave.”

Saying that, he turned and left, vanishing into the forest in a few bounds.

Leng Qing stared fixedly at Yang Kai’s disappearing back, his expression flickering uncertainly. He couldn’t understand why this cultivator named Yang Kai had remained so calm and unhurried before him—without the slightest trace of fear. In fact… in that brief instant just now, Yang Kai had even given him a faint sense of danger. Though that feeling lasted only a moment, it was enough to put Leng Qing on alert.

Such a sensation only arose in the presence of someone exceedingly powerful—could it be that Yang Kai possessed the ability to harm him?

Shaking his head, Leng Qing dropped the thought and planned to ask those old bastards back on Star Emperor Mountain whether there were any other unparalleled masters in the world capable of raising such strange disciples.

After thirty li of running, violent rumbling came from behind him once more; evidently Leng Qing had resumed assaulting the Guardian Mountain Array.

If others were willing to do such a thankless and exhausting task, that was none of Yang Kai’s concern — so long as he didn’t have to do it himself.

Earlier Yang Kai had warned Daiyuan not to cross paths with this Leng Qing; it seemed the two were unlikely to meet—if Leng Qing simply hammered away at the array until his time was used up it wouldn't be surprising, and Daiyuan, who sought a certain Spiritual Herb, wouldn't foolishly barge into Leng Qing's presence.

Because of the array's obstruction Yang Kai had to take a long detour; from time to time he still caught blurred glimpses of buildings among the peaks.

Ten days later Yang Kai could still sense the Guardian Mountain Array's presence, his heart filled with greater shock.

The array's coverage spanned at least several thousand li, and within that space lay the ruins of that tens-of-thousands-of-years-old sect—one could imagine how magnificent the sect had once been and how many disciples it must have contained.

Yet what was stranger was that such a vast sect now stood empty.

The road had been silent; Yang Kai had not gained so much as a scrap, but on the tenth day he finally left the Guardian Mountain Array's range.

On the horizon a faint, red, blazing light appeared.

At sight of that gleam Yang Kai's spirit leapt and he couldn't help grinning.

His guess had been correct—deeper within the Fourth Layer there truly was a Fifth Layer!

And that Fifth Layer was the Heat-Flame Zone.

He couldn't tell what had happened to this Flowing Flame Sandland; counting the not-yet-reached Heat-Flame Zone, Yang Kai had already traversed two similar regions. Thinking it over, from above the Flowing Flame Sandland it must appear layered, each level distinct, as though someone had thrown three scorching fire rings onto the earth, partitioning the land.

At that thought Yang Kai's heart jolted.

If so, then there should certainly be a Sixth Layer beyond.

He paused, then let out a dry laugh—he hadn't even reached the Fifth Layer yet; whether he'd make it through was unknown, so he shouldn't think about the Sixth Layer for now.

If possible he would like to investigate further, but time was likely tight.

The deeper into the Flowing Flame Sandland he went, the less room there was to move. Two days after spotting the red light, he arrived at the edge of the Fifth Layer.

Before even stepping inside he felt the scorching heat assault his mind and body; the force within was incomparable to the Third Layer.

Though pleased, Yang Kai's expression also turned grave; he urged his Saint Yuan to form a protective barrier on his body before stepping cautiously forward.

With that single step he seemed to enter another world: everything was flaming red, violent heat assaulted from all sides, and the dense, potent fire Spiritual Qi had condensed into a substance—little serpents of spirit clung and wound around him.

In an instant Yang Kai felt pain everywhere as though he were about to burst into flames; even the Saint Yuan flowing in his body seemed on the verge of boiling.

Yang Kai's face changed; he hurriedly forced his Saint Yuan out and Demonic Flame poured from his body.

But even the Demonic Flame could not resist the heat; the serpentine fire Spiritual Qi and the Demonic Flame made Yang Kai's body the battlefield, fiercely contending—one side invading, the other resisting.

Saint Yuan in his body gushed forth like a breached dam; Yang Kai solemnly took out two Upper-Level Saint Crystals, clutching one in each hand and desperately drawing their energy.

At this rate, if he didn't replenish, his Saint Yuan would be exhausted, and once exhausted he'd have to break open his Golden Blood, turning it into Saint Yuan.

He had already used several drops of Golden Blood on this Flowing Flame Sandland excursion; after witnessing its tremendous power he was loath to waste it—he conserved it when possible.

Step by step he pushed inward, having to increase Saint Yuan output the deeper he went; the Saint Crystals in his hands were replaced one after another. In merely half a day he'd consumed over ten thousand Saint Crystals, siphoning their energy until they were reduced to powder.

Only his robust constitution could support plundering Saint Crystal energy so wantonly; any other warrior with frail flesh or brittle meridians would have exploded to death.

The recovery pills he had prepared earlier finally came to use.

Yang Kai even used the Wan Yao Ling Ye he hadn't touched for a long time.

Though the consumption was terrifying to the extreme, Yang Kai wasn’t the least bit flustered. Even if all his Golden Blood were exhausted, he could still draw upon the power of the Divine Tree. However, since the Divine Tree was currently in deep slumber—seemingly on the verge of evolution—Yang Kai had no wish to disturb it unless absolutely necessary.

After a day Yang Kai had to stop.

Although advancing further—the hotter the environment—the more helpful it would be to refining the Profound Yin Moon Water, he had nearly reached his limit; going on would endanger his life.

Yang Kai frowned and was considering finding a nearby spot to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water when a roar sounded in his ear and the ground trembled violently.

Yang Kai's face darkened; standing motionless, he disregarded the drain and released Divine Sense to probe the area.
