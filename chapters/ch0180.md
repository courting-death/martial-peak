## Chapter 180 — Yu Aoqing

Upon hearing Yu Xiuping's inquiry, Yu Aoqing's face revealed a hint of impatience and disgust as she gritted her teeth and said, “He can’t wait to stick to me.”

“Ha ha, you don’t like him?” Yu Xiuping chuckled lightly.

“What do you think?” Yu Aoqing retorted with annoyance.

“Bear with it. This time, we will have to rely on him. Although Miao Huacheng presented the map, he hasn’t shared much of his research over the years with us; he has passed everything to Miao Lin. Therefore, to find the Hidden Island, Miao Lin is indispensable,” Yu Xiuping gently comforted her.

Yu Aoqing pouted, lightly shaking Yu Xiuping's arm. “Father, you know what kind of person he is. This morning, he even tried to get handsy with me. If it weren’t for your repeated warnings, I would have thrown him into the sea long ago.”

Yu Xiuping's expression turned cold. “He tried to get handsy with you?”

“Yes!” Yu Aoqing felt wronged. Before this incident, she had never even heard of Miao Lin. Yet because of this matter, she had to swallow her pride and appease Miao Lin, which was a torment for the proud and haughty Yu Aoqing.

“I’m sorry to make you suffer.” Yu Xiuping's expression was also grim. Yu Aoqing was his daughter, and he naturally cherished her. He hoped she would marry a true dragon among men and live a happy life. Miao Lin had no connections, no talent, and no strength. In the past, he wouldn’t have even been worthy to carry his daughter’s shoes, but now, to extract information from Miao Lin, he could only let his daughter sacrifice her dignity.

“Don’t worry, once we find the Hidden Island, I will definitely seek justice for you!” Yu Xiuping reassured her.

“I really hope we arrive soon.” Yu Aoqing gritted her teeth. “Once we get there, I’ll throw him into the sea!”

“As long as you’re happy!” Yu Xiuping smiled faintly, seemingly unconcerned, as if his daughter was merely talking about tossing away livestock.

Miao Huacheng from Haicheng probably never expected things to develop to this extent. He offered the sea chart with the intention of securing a good future for his son, hoping that Yunxia Sect would pay attention to Miao Lin.

The higher-ups of Yunxia Sect agreed to Miao Huacheng's request and intended to cultivate Miao Lin with care. However, Miao Lin, overestimating himself, thought he had gained some ability and set his sights on Yu Aoqing.

This was simply playing with fire.

While they were speaking, Yu Xiuping suddenly said, “That kid is chasing after us. If you really don’t want to see him, just avoid him, but remember, don’t lose your temper with him.”

“I know.” Yu Aoqing took a deep breath, her chest rising and falling.

Yu Xiuping quickly left, and shortly after, a young man in his twenties arrived on the deck, his face filled with anticipation as he looked around. When he spotted Yu Aoqing by the ship's railing, his expression brightened, and he hurriedly ran over.

Is this Miao Lin?

Yang Kai memorized his appearance without revealing any expression.

The young lady from the Jiang family had taken her own life because she didn’t want to be humiliated by him.

Miao Lin was indeed quite handsome, except for his somewhat sallow complexion and unsteady gait; otherwise, he appeared quite decent. Rather than a martial artist, he seemed more like a debauched young master indulging in wine and pleasure.

After all, the Miao family had some influence in Haicheng, enough to support his extravagant lifestyle.

He approached Yu Aoqing, his eyes filled with undisguised admiration. With a gentle tone, he said, “Sister Qing, it’s windy on the deck; be careful not to catch a chill.”

Although Yu Aoqing felt utterly disgusted, she had to force a stiff smile. “It’s fine. The air over the sea is fresh; it can blow away one’s troubles.”

Yu Aoqing's words were subtle, but Miao Lin seemed to completely misunderstand, smiling gently as he said, “So Sister Qing is feeling down? If there’s anything unhappy, feel free to tell your junior brother; I’m willing to share your burdens.”

A hidden fury crossed Yu Aoqing's beautiful face, yet she still smiled and shook her head, maintaining her poised beauty.

Yang Kai was on the side sweeping the deck, listening to their insincere exchange, feeling a strong urge to throw Miao Lin into the sea.

Yu Aoqing had hinted several times, yet he still appeared oblivious, or perhaps he understood but shamelessly persisted, making it impossible for anyone to have a good impression of him.

The two continued talking for a long while. Just as Miao Lin was in high spirits, boasting about the Miao family's prestige in Haicheng, a sudden loud crash came from beneath the ship, followed by the entire vessel shaking violently.

Both Miao Lin and Yu Aoqing, standing by the ship's railing, lost their balance and nearly fell into the sea. However, being martial artists, their reflexes were extraordinary, and they quickly steadied themselves.

It was unclear what Miao Lin was thinking; perhaps he wanted to show off in a moment of crisis to win Yu Aoqing's favor, or maybe he sought to take advantage of the situation. After steadying himself, he suddenly exclaimed, “Sister, be careful!” 

As he shouted, he reached out to wrap his arm around Yu Aoqing's waist.

This proud woman, who found it disgusting to even speak to him, would never allow him to embrace her. In a hurry, she twisted away, evading Miao Lin's outstretched hand.

At that moment, the ship shook violently again.

Yu Aoqing, caught in the act of turning, lost her footing and was flung out sideways, letting out a brief cry of surprise.

To her dismay, she was flying toward Yang Kai's position.

Yang Kai, dressed in dirty clothes and holding a filthy broom, was stunned at the sight, unsure of how to react.

He had merely been eavesdropping on their conversation, trying to gather some information, never expecting such a dramatic scene to unfold.

As Yu Aoqing was about to crash into him, in a moment of tension, Yang Kai pretended to slip, falling backward and sliding forward a considerable distance. Almost simultaneously, Yu Aoqing flew over him and landed heavily on the deck, splashing dirty water all over her.

The beauty, admired by countless men, instantly turned into a drenched chicken, her clothes and hair soaked, the stench of the dirty water making her nearly retch.

Yang Kai also lay on the ground, howling in despair, reacting as any ordinary person would.

When a beauty flies toward you, a normal man should catch her steadily, even if it meant getting hurt himself; he must not let her fall.

However, Yu Aoqing was not a saint, and Miao Lin was no good man. Yang Kai was certain that if he had caught Yu Aoqing, he would have faced the wrath of both this man and woman!

Yu Aoqing would be furious for being touched by an ordinary person, especially a lowly servant, while Miao Lin would be jealous and harbor murderous intent. He would certainly not see the light of day again!

Thus, avoiding her was the wisest choice.

The ship continued to sway, and Miao Lin hurriedly rushed to Yu Aoqing's side, finally seizing the opportunity to approach her, helping her up and exclaiming, “Sister, are you alright?”

“Get away!” Yu Aoqing could no longer endure it. If it weren’t for this disgusting man trying to embrace her, she would never have been flung out, drenched in dirty water, losing face and smelling foul.

At that moment, a murderous intent arose within Yu Aoqing.

With her shout, Miao Lin was taken aback, hastily retreating two steps.

Just then, many martial artists surged up from below deck, with Yu Xiuping among them. He rushed onto the deck and looked down at the sea, his expression changing. “It’s a demon beast! All disciples prepare for battle!”

Raising his eyes, he caught sight of the filthy Yu Aoqing and was momentarily stunned. “Qing'er, are you injured?”

Yu Aoqing gritted her teeth, casting a resentful glare at Miao Lin before slowly shaking her head.

“Go back and rest. You don’t need to worry about this.” Yu Xiuping said sternly.

“Understood.”

“I’ll escort you back!” Miao Lin immediately wanted to follow.

“No need!” Yu Aoqing almost shouted each word, her beautiful yet disheveled figure quickly disappearing from the deck.

On the ship, the ordinary workers were also hastily retreating. The martial artists of Yunxia Sect could not care less about their lives at this moment; staying on deck would surely lead to disaster.

Suddenly, a towering wave surged up beside the ship, crashing against it and causing the vessel to shake violently.

Yang Kai hurriedly got up, following the ordinary people into the cabin.

Everyone huddled together, trembling, many murmuring prayers that the ship would not sink. If it did, aside from the two Supreme Elders in the Divine Roaming Realm, the rest would likely perish in the sea.

Yang Kai listened for a moment, gradually relaxing his tense mood.

He realized that the two Supreme Elders of Yunxia Sect had not intervened, which meant the attacking demon beasts were not of high rank, and Yu Xiuping and the others could handle it.

However, the number of demon beasts was quite substantial, with sounds of collisions coming from all directions.

The battle continued for a full hour before gradually subsiding. The attacking demon beasts were either killed or repelled, and the noisy commotion finally calmed down.

Yunxia Sect's victory prompted cheers from the ordinary people, as if they too had won a battle.

Yang Kai watched this unfold, feeling a wave of sorrow.

Before long, disciples from Yunxia Sect called the ordinary people back onto the deck to clean up. When everyone saw the scene, they were all shocked.

The deck was covered in blood, and there were some strange-looking large fish, all dead, their mouths agape, revealing rows of sharp teeth.

No one from Yunxia Sect had died; only a few with lower cultivation had sustained injuries, but nothing serious.

Yang Kai joined the others in cleaning the blood off the deck and dealing with the slain sea demon beasts, sweating profusely and covered in a foul stench.

Perhaps they had already entered the depths of the sea. After the first attack from the demon beasts, they were visited by demon beasts every few days, and as time passed, the strength of these demon beasts increased.

To deal with these demon beasts, many sick ordinary people were ruthlessly thrown overboard to attract the attention of the beasts.

Yu Xiuping's expression grew graver by the day, and Miao Lin was frequently summoned to the deck. The two studied a turtle shell about the size of a millstone, discussing the route ahead.
