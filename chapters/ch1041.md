## Chapter 1041 — Take a Look Outside

Outside the palace, Shen Tu wore an apologetic expression as he said, “Brother Yang, this is as far as I can see you off. My position is far too sensitive; if I personally escorted you away I would certainly draw unwanted attention. Take care along the way.”

“Xue Tong will accompany you and explain everything on the road, and see to your safety.” Jia Long waved to the side. The yao warrior who had previously accompanied Yang Kai to buy a Star Shuttle and the ores stepped forward and grinned at Yang Kai. “Young Master.”

“Much obliged.” Yang Kai knew Shen Tu’s kindness, so he did not refuse.

“Brother Yang, farewell for now!” Shen Tu cupped his fist solemnly.

Yang Kai returned the salute. Under Xue Tong’s lead, the two of them soared forward on the Star Shuttle.

The warships stationed on Shuiyue Star were principally used to transport supplies. The major powers within the Star Domain issued all manner of orders to the Hengluo Commerce Guild through their branch offices on Shuiyue Star to procure cultivation materials. Once the guild had prepared the goods, they would load them onto warships and deliver them to each power’s main star at the appointed time.

Along the way, Xue Tong explained that the ship they were to board this time was bound for a star called Emerald Star, the main world of a force called the Blazing Flame. That power was neither weak nor grand, ranking roughly in the middle of the Star Domain, and it controlled two cultivation stars—Emerald Star being one of them.

The voyage would take roughly half a year, passing by other powers’ cultivation stars en route.

“Young Master, you may choose at which cultivation star you wish to disembark, or you may simply stay aboard and travel on to Emerald Star,” Xue Tong explained.

“Understood. I’ll see for myself when the time comes.” Yang Kai nodded.

Following Xue Tong cautiously, they transferred through a previously used Space Array and arrived at another city, entering a district heavily guarded by martial artists.

It was a vast plaza, stretching beyond sight. All across it docked warship after warship, and countless fighters bustled about in orderly fashion, hauling supplies.

The crates issued strong energy fluctuations—many contained exceedingly high-grade goods.

Xue Tong led Yang Kai through the crowd. Yang Kai glanced around, inwardly stunned by the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s wealth.

Even these dozens of warships alone represented prodigious capital, not to mention the goods loaded within them and the countless fighters at work.

The true scale of a major power was indeed vast!

They had not gone far before several Saint King-Grade fighters blocked their path, the murderous intent about them plain to see. Warily they eyed Xue Tong and Yang Kai. One of them raised a hand and barked, “Halt!”

Xue Tong stopped without a trace of panic. He produced a token from his Spatial Ring and handed it over.

The fighter inspected it carefully, nodded slightly, and signaled for Xue Tong and Yang Kai to proceed.

“Shen Tu has taken care of everything. We’ll be leaving with someone he knows,” Xue Tong murmured.

They threaded among the warships. Before long Xue Tong’s eyes brightened as he pointed ahead.

Over there, a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level battleship rested quietly, its hatch wide open as numerous cultivators carried supplies inside. Outside the ship stood a burly man with his hands clasped behind his back; his hawk-like eyes gleamed with a sharp light, and even without anger on his face, his very presence commanded awe.

All who carried supplies instinctively kept their distance from him, clearly afraid.

As Xue Tong and Yang Kai approached, his gaze fixed on them in an instant. Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown; a prickling pain spread through him as if needles were stabbing his skin.

“Lord Xin Rui!” Xue Tong stepped forward and cupped his fist respectfully.

“Is this him?” The burly man called Xin Rui swept his gaze up and down Yang Kai, snorting. “Shen Tu asked me to take him away?”

“Yes!” Xue Tong replied.

“He isn’t from the guild?” Xin Rui asked, looking him over.

Xue Tong shook his head. “He is a friend of Shen Tu.”

Xin Rui’s eyes flickered with curiosity. “Shen Tu actually has friends? That’s rare. You can take him aboard, but remember—on my ship you must not cause trouble. Follow the rules, or I’ll throw him out into the Starry Void and let him fend for himself.”

“Rest assured. The Young Master’s friend won’t cause trouble.” Xue Tong smiled, unconcerned by the threat.

Xin Rui snorted. “If he hadn’t caused trouble, why would Shen Tu be so eager to arrange his departure? He doesn’t look the obedient sort!”

He cast Yang Kai a meaningful look, as if catching a glimpse of something, but asked nothing further. He merely grunted, “Come aboard.”

“Thank you!” Xue Tong smiled and beckoned Yang Kai, leading him into the warship.

Inside the hull, many fighters bustled to and fro; everyone was exceedingly busy.

Xue Tong paid them no mind. He and Yang Kai wandered down the corridor and found two adjacent rooms to stay in.

“Young Master, if you’re not satisfied with this room I can get you another,” Xue Tong asked.

Yang Kai stood by the window and looked out through the transparent pane at the scenery, shaking his head. “No need. The view is wide—when I’m bored I can look out. It’s fine.”

“As long as you’re satisfied.”

“What’s Xin Rui’s relationship with Shen Tu? Why would he do Shen Tu a favor?” Yang Kai asked.

Xue Tong thought for a moment. “By relation, Lord Xin Rui is probably Shen Tu’s maternal uncle…”

“His uncle?” Yang Kai exclaimed.

“Yes.” Xue Tong smiled. “Xin Rui’s younger sister is Shen Tu’s mother. The guild president knew her sister many years ago, but for various reasons they could not be together.”

“Never mind, don’t explain—surely it’s just more bad blood.” Yang Kai waved a hand.

Xue Tong forced a wry smile. “Indeed, messy family affairs. If Young Master has no other instructions, I’ll rest for now. In an hour this warship should set sail.”

“Go on.”

Xue Tong immediately took his leave.

Yang Kai stood by the window, watching the throng below with a turmoil of feelings. Once more a hollow loneliness rose within him.

The Starry Void was immense, seemingly without end, and here he was a stranger—no kin, no familiar affairs—everywhere a sense of unfamiliarity.

Everything here seemed so far removed from him. Alone in this place, his thoughts turned, reflexively, to the warmth of Little Senior Sister, to Su Yan’s tenderness, even to the bewitching Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo and to Qiu Yimeng.

Familiar faces flashed across his mind, and that rare, steadfast heart of his suddenly softened.

Were they still happy and well now? Had they encountered any trouble? Were any of them thinking of him…

Thought after thought raced through Yang Kai’s mind, leaving a sour ache.

Yet when a figure appeared in his sight all those longings and sorrow scattered. His eyelids tightened and his expression darkened.

Across the vast plaza, three people were walking this way. The lead was an exceptionally handsome young man with fair skin that would make any woman jealous. His black hair flowed to his shoulders, lending him a rakish elegance, and his face wore a warm, genial smile like spring sunlight.

Wherever he passed, the female fighters hauling supplies halted and gazed at him with infatuation.

He was actually heading toward this warship!

Xue Yue!

Yang Kai hastily left the window and dashed from his room, closing the door behind him.

Xue Tong seemed to be sitting in meditation on his bed. Startled by Yang Kai’s sudden arrival, he asked, “Young Master, do you have other instructions?”

Yang Kai stared at him intently and lowered his voice. “Tell me straight—did Shen Tu sell me out?”

A deeper confusion clouded Xue Tong’s face. He frowned. “Young Master, what do you mean by that?”

“Look outside for yourself!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Xue Tong rose and peered out the window. His eyes likewise narrowed as he exclaimed, “Young Master Xue Yue? How could he be here?”

“You ask me—who am I supposed to ask?” Yang Kai sneered. “Did Shen Tu notify him or something?”

Xue Tong’s expression grew grave. “Young Master, if you think that, you’re underestimating Shen Tu. He truly regards you as a friend; he wouldn’t betray you. Besides, Xue Yue should have left Shuiyue Star yesterday. It’s precisely because of that that Shen Tu arranged for you to depart today.”

“He left yesterday?” Yang Kai frowned, eyes fixed on Xue Tong for any change in demeanor.

“Yes. Xue Yue had a mission and should have departed yesterday.” Xue Tong nodded heavily. “Moreover, someone saw him board another warship and leave Shuiyue Star!”

“Then why is he here now? And why did he happen to come to this warship?” Yang Kai whispered harshly.

Xue Tong smiled bitterly. “I don’t know either… But Young Master, Shen Tu absolutely did not sell you out. He would never do such a thing.”

Yang Kai stared at him for a long moment before snapping, “Fine, I’ll trust you! Now can we go down?”

“That would be too reckless; we might run into him.” Xue Tong waved his hand. “If Xue Yue intends to board this warship, you’d best remain here and make sure he doesn’t discover you. Hopefully he’s only come to speak with Lord Xin Rui…”

“That hope is probably in vain.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly and listened. Xue Tong’s and his rooms were not far above the hatch, so even without exerting power he could hear some of the conversation below. From Xue Yue’s exchange with Xin Rui he could tell Xue Yue had indeed come to this ship and would be taking passage on it just like he was.

Yang Kai’s mood instantly sank to its lowest.
