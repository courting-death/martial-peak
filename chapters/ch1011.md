## Chapter 1011 — Space Array

On the level ground halfway up the mountain, everyone was visibly excited, their eyes gleaming with sharp light.

"What is a Dark Star?" Yang Kai turned his head and asked.

"It generally refers to stars that have not been discovered and not yet developed!" Shen Tu's eyes shone as he explained quickly, "Right now the entire Hengluo Star Domain is carved up by several great forces, but there are still places no one has ever gone, and no one dares go. There may exist some special stars—those are all Dark Stars. Every Dark Star means an undeveloped territory that might hold astonishing wealth and resources. Over the years, all the great forces have devoted themselves to finding and developing Dark Stars, hoping to discover stars unlike the rest. Strictly speaking, the stars within the Chaos Abyss can barely be counted as Dark Stars as well."

Yang Kai nodded to show he understood.

"But from what this Senior said, it seems we're still inside the Chaos Abyss?"

"Probably." Yang Kai had already confirmed this through the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness, so he wasn't surprised.

"Haven't you noticed that the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth here surpasses even that of the Chaos Abyss?" the old man continued. "That's because the energy within the Chaos Abyss gathers here through unknown channels, and this place is a cage—Spiritual Qi can enter but cannot leave. Over countless years, it formed what you see now. Were it not so, this old man would prefer to live here; this is a Sacred Land for cultivation."

"Senior, you say this is a cage? Are you also trapped here?" Lü Guichen's face changed.

He and Yue Xi had, some days ago, driven their Star Shuttle high into the sky, but no matter how far they flew, they still could not see sun, moon, or stars, could not see the scenery one should see in a Star Domain. They could only shuttle above this Floating Continent.

They knew they were trapped—trapped by the seven-colored sky that wrapped the Floating Continent on all sides. They had thought it was a trick by the old man, a restriction he laid, a barrier he set.

But now it seemed that was not the case at all.

Lü Guichen's words seemed to prod the old man's sore spot. His expression twisted, a cold, baleful aura spread from his body, and he snarled, "That's right. This old man is indeed trapped here! And it's been almost two thousand years!"

"Two thousand years!" Gasps sounded. Everyone stared at the old man, dumbfounded.

"When I was trapped, I was just a minor figure who had only just reached the Saint King Realm, but now... hehe..." He chuckled, arrogant and unrestrained, as if he held no one in his eyes.

Everyone understood what he meant, and they swallowed involuntarily.

The mysterious old man before them was definitely someone who could be set shoulder to shoulder with the various Star Lords!

"May I ask how we should address Senior?" Yue Xi called out in a delicate yet respectful voice. Before such an expert, she no longer dared show the slightest impudence and lowered her posture as much as she could.

The old man frowned and fell into thought, as if he had not reported his name to anyone for a very long time and could not recall it for a moment. Only after a while did he say, "There's no need to mention my name. You wouldn't know it anyway."

He clearly had no desire to reveal his name.

Everyone thought it over and felt that was reasonable. When he was trapped here two thousand years ago, he had only just reached the Saint King Realm and was indeed obscure—no one would have known him.

"Then how should we address Senior?" Lü Guichen asked. Although he and Yue Xi were enemies, the two of them were actually cooperating quite well in speaking with this old man.

"Ghost Ancestor! From now on, you may address this old man as the Ghost Ancestor!"

"Ghost Ancestor..." Everyone was at a loss for words.

"Senior Ghost Ancestor, you've been trapped here for two thousand years—could you not find a way out?" Lü Guichen mustered his courage to ask. If even this old fellow who called himself the Ghost Ancestor could not find a way to escape, then they had even less hope.

This place was a cage that could imprison even a Void King Realm expert.

The Ghost Ancestor shook his head. "This space is very strange. It has always hidden within the Chaos Abyss, covered by that chaotic domain field. Normally it cannot be discovered, nor can it be investigated. Only under special circumstances will this place open for an instant."

"Special circumstances?" Lü Guichen asked in doubt.

"Exactly the situation that occurred when you entered last time. I don't need to remind you."

Everyone recalled the riot of the domain field in the Chaos Abyss and the black hole that had swallowed their warship. They all felt lingering fear.

"But that instant is far too brief. This old man couldn't take the opportunity to dart out..." The Ghost Ancestor sighed. Clearly, when everyone had arrived on this continent last time, he had also sensed the opening of the black hole, but it was too late to leave, leaving him full of regret.

"In the two thousand years this old man has stayed here, some people have unintentionally barged in from time to time. Strictly speaking, you are the third batch, and the most numerous. The previous two batches were only three to five people apiece."

"Where are they?" Yue Xi asked. As soon as the words left her mouth she knew she had asked the wrong question, and her pretty face turned pale.

There was no need to think about what their fates had been.

Either they could not endure the loneliness and met a quiet end, or they were killed by this Ghost Ancestor!

He did not look like someone easy to get along with.

That might well be the outcome for the nearly hundred people here.

The Ghost Ancestor went on, "In the first thousand years of being trapped here, this old man devoted himself to cultivating and improving his strength. In the latter thousand years, I have been searching for a way to leave. Diligence pays off—in the end, this old man finally thought of a method!"

He spoke in a low shout, his expression exhilarated, seemingly quite proud of the method he had conceived.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi's eyes lit up at once, nervous excitement rising in secret.

If the Ghost Ancestor had a way to leave this place, they might be able to persuade him to bring them along. His words let them see new hope.

"Senior Ghost Ancestor, if it's convenient, could you also let this junior..." Lü Guichen hurried to speak, afraid Yue Xi would seize the initiative.

"I know what you want to say." The Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "Mm, that is exactly this old man's intention."

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi, who had been full of eager anticipation, were stunned in an instant, and a bad feeling sprouted in their hearts.

If the Ghost Ancestor had refused outright, they would have been disappointed but would not have thought too much of it. But his unhesitating agreement made it seem rather incredible.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi both secretly felt that the Ghost Ancestor was plotting something.

They felt uneasy, swallowed back what they were about to say, and quietly waited for the Ghost Ancestor to continue.

"However, this old man's method is only a notion conceived in his head and has not been practically verified. As for how effective it will be, and whether it can let us leave this place, I dare not guarantee it. So I need you to help. If it succeeds, this old man will of course take you away together. If it fails, do not blame heaven or anyone else. What do you think?"

The Ghost Ancestor asked with a smiling squint.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi looked at each other across the distance. The former gave an awkward laugh. "We'll follow Senior's instructions!"

An arm could not twist the thigh—he clearly knew the current situation left him no room to refuse the Ghost Ancestor's proposal, so he agreed readily.

"My Sword Alliance has no objections. We'll act according to Senior's wishes." Bitterness welled in Yue Xi's heart; her words were far from heartfelt.

"Good, good, excellent. You're all very obedient—this old man is very pleased. Then there's no time to delay; let's begin!" The Ghost Ancestor grinned, revealing a mouthful of chilling fangs. As he spoke, his hands suddenly formed arcane seals and he sent several streams of energy into the grand formation on the flat ground.

The Saint Crystals arranged on the formation seemed to be activated by something. One after another, one piece after another lit up. From those Saint Crystals, waves of hair-raising energy spread out like the sea, each wave higher than the last, layer upon layer, and in just a short while they gathered to a terrifying degree.

The dense Spiritual Qi between heaven and earth resonated with it from afar, and in an instant the atmosphere of the entire world changed.

The scenery within everyone's sight became twisted and bizarre, as if this space might collapse at any moment.

The faces of the cultivators all changed drastically. Terror flooded their eyes; no one knew what the Ghost Ancestor was doing.

Yang Kai fixed a deep stare on the great door standing on the flat ground, his expression aghast. From there he sensed a trace of something unusual.

It was the aura of spatial turbulence. The distortion of the space framed by that door was more intense than anywhere else. Yang Kai had no doubt that if this continued, the space there would truly collapse.

His concern quickly came true. The energy of the grand formation converged together toward the great door that had been refined from the warship fragments. The Ghost Ancestor's gaze, in that moment, became fanatical to the extreme; he stared without blinking at the door's changes, his expression feverish.

Crack…

A light shattering sound rang out. The space framed by that door suddenly, most bizarrely, produced a fissure. The fissure rapidly spread outward, growing as dense as a spiderweb.

The sound of shattering drew all eyes. Everyone who saw this scene felt a chill run all over their bodies.

Crack, crack, crack…

That patch of space was like a mirror being smashed, bursting apart inch by inch.

Space collapsed at that moment!

Within the door, at the same time, there appeared a pitch-black black hole that exuded an intense pulling force—boundless, icy, and dark. No one knew where this black hole connected to.

"Void Passage!" Yang Kai shouted in a low voice.

He had seen countless Void Passages on the Tongxuan Continent, but had never personally witnessed the birth of a Void Passage—until now.

"Space Array!" The Sword Alliance's beauty, Yue Xi, suddenly screamed, her beautiful eyes trembling violently.

"Senior, you actually understand Space Arrays?" Lü Guichen's expression changed as well.

That massive formation, covered with Saint Crystals—though somewhat crude—was indeed a kind of Space Array, one of the legendary Space Arrays!

The Ghost Ancestor nodded. "I know a little—I'm hardly proficient. This is merely the result of a thousand years of painstaking research. Mm, it seems this old man's comprehension of the Space Laws is somewhat lacking. Even after spending a thousand years, I still can't understand the mysteries of space. It's truly vexing."
