## Chapter 1373 — B-13

The experts from the major powers on Dark Star both loved and hated Old Dark-Faced Yan Pei; they loved that when he presided over an auction the goods were always superb, and they hated that the old miser’s prices were absurdly high—no matter how great the power, even they felt squeezed by his exactions.

Two Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm masters stood here, a clear sign of how much Jubao Tower valued this auction.

When Yang Kai arrived, both Fei Zhi Tu and Yan Pei actually showed smiling expressions. The girl leading the way, Qing'er, was startled, her pretty face showing surprise; she had not expected this young man she was hosting to be of such unusual standing—so unusual that even the Great Elder had for once revealed a smile—and she was inwardly delighted.

For her, the higher Yang Kai’s status, the more rewards she might receive; if luck favored her and she caught Yang Kai’s eye, she would no longer worry about cultivation resources. After all, those attending with gilt invitations certainly weren’t short of Saint Crystal.

"Greetings, Elders!" Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, but he had to step forward and bow.

That was the drawback of having a lower seniority—no matter where you went, you always had to bow your head to others.

"Haha, no need for so much ceremony." Fei Zhi Tu smiled faintly, waved his hand, and an invisible force lifted Yang Kai up; his manner was kindly. Ever since seeing that remnant soul of the Ice Phoenix manifest in the Imperial Garden last time, Fei Zhi Tu no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest.

Even if it was only a remnant soul, it was the legendary Ancient Divine Spirit that had long since vanished from the world. As long as Yang Kai lived, with his rising strength the power the Ancient Divine Spirit’s remnant could unleash would only grow. Under the suppressing laws of Dark Star Yang Kai might lack the chance to ascend to the Void King Realm, but at the Origin Returning Realm level, aided by the Ice Phoenix’s remnant, he would be an absolutely invincible existence.

If they didn’t curry favor with him while he was still weak, once he grew powerful it wouldn’t be so easy to ingratiate themselves.

"I heard you stirred up another bit of trouble recently?" Fei Zhi Tu chuckled, his meaning clear.

"I don’t know what you mean, Elder?" Yang Kai asked in puzzlement.

"Don’t play dumb. You killed someone from Haixin Sect, didn’t you?" Fei Zhi Tu shot him a glare.

"So it's about Haixin Sect—indeed, I killed the person. What, did you hear some rumor?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"No such thing." Fei Zhi Tu slowly shook his head. "Although Haixin Sect is far off in Wuyou Sea and a second-tier sect, they shouldn’t be lightly insulted. Have you considered the consequences of acting so wantonly?"

Yang Kai chuckled: "If people bully me, do you expect me to just endure it, Elder?"

Seeing the sharpness in his demeanor, Fei Zhi Tu couldn’t help but laugh: "If you could endure it, you wouldn’t be you."

The last time he had stirred up trouble in Tianyun City, he’d managed to hold his own against seven or eight Origin Returning Realm masters, even killing one of the Xie Family’s experts. Fei Zhi Tu had long known that Yang Kai was not someone who played by the rules, so he only gave a mild reminder: “I heard that the people from Haixin Sect are currently staying with the Xie Family. The two sides seem to be on quite good terms.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and cupped his fist: "Thanks for the reminder, Elder."

"Also, it seems a force called Liu Yun Valley has also taken residence with the Xie Family. Be careful."

"Liu Yun Valley?" Yang Kai’s brow furrowed and his expression changed slightly.

“What? Don’t tell me you’ve made enemies with this Liu Yun Valley too?” Fei Zhi Tu asked in astonishment.

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh.

Seeing his tacit acceptance, Fei Zhi Tu was speechless and waved his hand: "Enough, enough. Young people have vigor—go cause your trouble. Just don’t make a scene in my Tianyun City. That Liu Yun Valley isn’t much of a force anyway."

"I’ll remember that." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Fei Zhi Tu thought Liu Yun Valley was an insignificant little power, but Yang Kai felt a vague apprehension because Liu Yun Valley had a certain Lu Ye in it! Yang Kai didn’t know exactly how he had incurred Lu Ye’s wrath; that man had once tried to kill him in the Flowing Flame Sandland. In their clash Yang Kai had managed to sever an arm, but Lu Ye still escaped.

At that time Yang Kai sensed Lu Ye was unusual; even an elite like Wei Guchang might not be his match.

Facing Lu Ye, Yang Kai had a similar sense as when he faced Leng Qing from Star Emperor Mountain—both posed tremendous threats in ways Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong did not.

That a mere Liu Yun Valley could produce such a disciple meant Yang Kai couldn’t afford to look down on it. He had collected information on Liu Yun Valley, and upon Fei Zhi Tu’s mention the man sprang to mind immediately.

Several years had passed and Lu Ye’s cultivation might have advanced greatly; should they meet again, the result would be uncertain. Yet Yang Kai was not afraid—he himself had grown much stronger since then and had many more combat methods.

As Yang Kai finished speaking with Fei Zhi Tu, Yan Pei could hardly contain himself and quickly interjected, “Young friend Yang’s presence at our humble tower’s auction truly brings glory to our establishment.”

"Haha, Elder, you flatter me. It is my honor to attend this auction." Yang Kai replied modestly.

Yan Pei lowered his voice kindly: "Would you be willing to consign more items for auction? Although the auction lot is set, if you entrust items to us I can open a convenient door for you—this would be no trouble for me."

"You jest, Elder. My master’s years of hoarded treasures were all put up at the last auction; there’s truly nothing left to offer." Yang Kai lied offhandedly. After all, his boast about a master in Dragon Lair Mountain couldn’t be verified, so fabricating such a tale posed no burden.

“I see…” Yan Pei showed a trace of disappointment, then suddenly lowered his voice and said, “What if this old man cuts another fifty percent off the commission fee for you?”

"Truly nothing!" Yang Kai answered with a painful expression.

“Hehe, then it seems this old man was being a bit too forceful. Very well—since you’ve come all this way, young friend, no need to linger outside. Go on in and rest for a while; the auction will begin in exactly one hour.” Yan Pei no longer pressed the matter and generously waved them through.

Yang Kai excused himself and, together with Yang Yan, followed the girl Qing'er into Jubao Tower.

As before, the main hall was already full of warriors attending the auction; even the few empty seats were scarce. At the center stood a round dais where the Jubao Tower presided over the sale. Embedded in the surrounding walls were strange stones emitting beams of light that illuminated every detail of the elevated platform.

"Please wait a moment, Elders." Qing'er entered and said softly, then went to speak with the Jubao Tower attendants nearby.

After a moment she returned smiling and respectfully handed Yang Kai a wooden token: "This is the sealing talisman for your private room; please keep it safe, Elders."

Yang Kai took it and glanced at it, seeing 'B-13' carved on the wooden board.

Having attended such an auction before, Yang Kai was familiar with the routine and knew his room number was B-13.

Coincidentally, last time his room had been C-13; today it was B-13—though the number hadn’t changed, the grade had clearly risen one level.

The last time had been thanks to Qian Tong’s influence, but this time, it was entirely different—no borrowed prestige, only the reputation of Dragon Lair Mountain itself.

Thinking this, Yang Kai's mouth curved slightly; he pocketed the token and signaled the girl to lead the way.

A moment later in the B-13 room, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had already taken their seats while Qing'er attended them, serving tea. Besides her, there was no one else in the room.

Pointing at the spirit fruits on the table, the girl said: "These are sparrow spirit fruits specially gathered for this auction by our Tower—they taste sweet and contain some refined Saint Yuan. Please help yourselves."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, took one and popped it into his mouth, nodding in satisfaction.

Seeing his favorable expression, the girl mustered courage and asked: "The auction won’t start for an hour. If you two Elders don’t mind, we could call someone to dance and relieve some boredom."

"Oh? Your Jubao Tower’s hospitality is so thorough?" Yang Yan asked in surprise.

The girl smiled: "Not every guest has this privilege—only rooms at B grade and above."

Yang Yan appraised her with a glance and laughed playfully: "No need to call anyone—your waist is supple and your steps light; you must be well versed in this. Why don’t you dance for us?"

“This junior?” The girl’s face flushed slightly as she timidly glanced at Yang Kai. Her cultivation wasn’t high, but she could tell that among the two honored guests, Yang Kai was the one in charge—naturally, she needed his approval first.

"Don’t mess around!" Yang Kai glared at Yang Yan and said to the girl: "She’s teasing—you needn’t take it seriously."

“Yes,” the young girl replied softly, a flicker of mixed relief and disappointment flashing through her eyes.

Relief because her guests seemed agreeable—though the woman liked to tease, she was not ill-natured; the man appeared upright. Disappointment because she’d lost her chance to perform.

Yang Kai, reading her expressions, could somewhat guess her thoughts and said: "We have no other requests. Do your duties well; after the auction you will not be without reward."

The girl brightened and said: "Thank you, Elder."

Having gauged the two guests’ temperaments, she served precisely: unless Yang Kai or Yang Yan spoke, she never took the initiative and simply stood respectfully aside.

During that time Wei Guchang and Xuan'er came once and chatted with Yang Kai for a long while.

It was no surprise they could find them—just a brief inquiry with Yan Pei told them where Yang Kai was.

After the two left, the auction seemed about to begin.
