## Chapter 1349 — The Three Divine Waters

Unexpectedly, despite everyone proceeding with extreme caution, they encountered no danger; after spending roughly half an hour they finally located the source of the fragrance.

It turned out to be where an artificial rockery stood. The rockery rose more than ten zhang; its stones were jagged and it was unclear what material had been piled to form it — it looked as if it were one solid piece.

Yang Kai squinted at the rockery, his expression stirring. He discovered the material of the rockery was also a rare forging material; taken out it would certainly allow the crafting of several Secret Treasures of considerable power! Unfortunately, the rockery was too large — even if a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert came, they likely could not carry it away, which left people sighing in regret.

Beneath the rockery lay a pool no larger than three chi across. At present the pool contained water about half a finger deep, and that water was not clear to the bottom but instead presented a milky-white color.

The fragrance everyone had smelled was emanating from this pool.

Directly above the pool there were traces showing liquid had flowed over it; from this it seemed the pool’s water clearly flowed in from some unknown place. This spot had been untouched for countless years yet still accumulated this small amount of water — it must have accumulated extremely slowly.

“This is…” the old crone stared at the half-finger-deep pool, her face growing solemn and constantly shifting between excitement, joy, astonishment, and hesitation.

“Could this be Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk?” Cai He exclaimed.

“Really Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk?” Du Sisi also leapt with joy. Although they had never seen Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk, they had heard of its great name; Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk was exceedingly rare and possessed many incredible effects.

It was said that when used for pill refinement it could produce life-saving restorative medicines — a treasure any martial artist would value above all.

At first Yang Kai had also thought this was Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk; after all, the look and form of the pool water were extremely similar to the rumors, almost identical. But on closer inspection something felt off, for the rumors said Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk’s color was milky-white with a faint gold tinge, whereas this pool of water was purely milky-white.

If not Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk, then what was it? Although Yang Kai was a pill refiner and had read many classics on medicinal materials and prescriptions, he did not presume to be able to identify every precious medicine in the world.

He involuntarily turned his gaze toward the old crone, hoping she could recognize it.

The old crone’s expression kept changing. After thinking for some time she softly drew a breath and said, “Whether it is Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk — one taste will tell!”

Saying this, she directly extended a finger, dipped it into the pool, and put it into her mouth.

The next moment her eyes suddenly widened; an unfathomable force of Qi and blood burst forth from her aged body, and her gaunt features flushed red as if weeping blood.

Visibly, the wrinkles on her face began to diminish, and her stooped waist slowly straightened.

In the space of no more than a dozen breaths, the old crone’s demeanor returned to normal, yet she was markedly different from before. It was as if she had suddenly grown considerably younger; though still an old crone, she was far improved.

The three Saint King Realm experts stared, their eyes wide with astonishment.

The old crone could hardly believe her own change; she hastily took a mirror from her Spatial Ring and held it before her to inspect. She touched her cheek, and after seeing the change in her appearance, tears glimmered in her old eyes as her body trembled violently.

Yang Kai and the other two remained silent and did not interrupt; they stood to one side waiting for her temper to calm, hoping she would provide an explanation.

After a while the old crone laughed softly and nodded, “So that’s how it is!”

“Senior, what exactly is this miraculous substance that produces such effects?” Cai He asked anxiously.

“What sort of medicine…” the old crone glanced at him, “this is no mere medicine. This is a treasure long extinct and harder to obtain than ten thousand pieces of gold!”

As she spoke, Yang Kai’s brow tightened and his Saint Yuan secretly stirred, ready to act at a moment’s notice. Men die for wealth, birds perish for food; although the old crone had shown kindness along the way, if the object before them was too precious there was no guarantee she would not resort to killing to seize it.

There were only four people here, and she was the strongest among them; judging by her earlier reaction, such a pool of water could be enough to push her to take desperate measures.

Yang Kai even saw a flicker of a strange light in her eyes — she had clearly entertained that thought — yet for some reason in the end she did not act. After Cai He pressed her for an answer, she slowly said, “Have any of you heard of the legend of the Three Divine Waters within the Star Domain?”

“The Three Divine Waters?” Cai He and Du Sisi exchanged puzzled looks.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly.

“It seems Young friend Yang has heard of them,” the old crone observed, smiling at Yang Kai.

“I’ve heard of them in passing, but I don’t know exactly what the Three Divine Waters are,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

He had indeed heard of the Three Divine Waters — it was spoken of back when he was in the Flowing Flame Sandland, and the Soul Cleansing Divine Water was one of them! The Soul Cleansing Divine Water could cleanse a martial artist’s spirit and greatly enhance their Divine Sense cultivation.

Yet the conditions for that Divine Water’s birth were exceedingly arduous: first there needed to be things like a spirit spring or spirit eye, then a Void King Realm expert had to die nearby; the dying expert’s Divine Sense cultivation would combine with that spirit spring or spirit eye and, after countless years of transformation, there might be a chance to form Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

At that time in the Flowing Flame Sandland Yang Kai had reaped many benefits from the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, ultimately causing the Warm Spirit Lotus to evolve into seven colors and even giving rise to the Blooming Lotus secret art.

He had planned to ask Yang Yan about the Three Divine Waters later, but forgot to do so.

Now, hearing the old crone mention the Three Divine Waters, Yang Kai naturally paid close attention.

“Could this be one of the Three Divine Waters?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Indeed! If this old woman’s judgment is not mistaken, this is the Life Jade Nectar — one of the Three Divine Waters!” the old crone shouted in a low voice.

“Life Jade Nectar!” The three Saint King Realm experts were all moved. Though they did not know exactly how precious the Life Jade Nectar was, since it was counted among the Star Domain’s Three Divine Waters and they had seen the old crone’s transformation with their own eyes, the three understood that this was an object of immeasurable value.

“Heh heh.” The old crone chuckled softly. “We’ve indeed had great luck to find Life Jade Nectar here — this is a rare opportunity that might not appear even once in hundreds of thousands of years!”

“Senior, what exactly can this Life Jade Nectar do?” Cai He asked, his face flushed with excitement.

“Its uses are countless. Chiefly it strengthens a martial artist’s Qi and blood, and it can even extend a martial artist’s lifespan. I only tasted a little just now and felt myself younger by several years. If one could refine more of this Life Jade Nectar, restoring youth would hardly be an idle hope — it may surpass that Ten-thousand-Year Stone Milk by many grades,” the old crone said, her expression becoming wildly excited.

Because of her limited innate aptitude she had long hovered stuck at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm for many years. Seeing her life nearing its end, she felt her cultivation would most likely stagnate there.

Who would have expected this time to discover such a heaven-defying treasure as Life Jade Nectar.

With it she could not only regain a youthful appearance but greatly extend her lifespan, giving her ample time to break through her bottleneck — perhaps even a genuine chance to stand at the very summit of Dark Star.

After that explanation, how could Yang Kai and the others not realize how precious the Life Jade Nectar was?

On Dark Star a martial artist’s cultivation could at most reach the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and lifespans were likewise capped at the peak of that stage. Many brilliant talents died in frustration, unable to transcend their shackles; if one could obtain Life Jade Nectar to increase lifespan, one’s hopes could be fulfilled.

If news of such a thing leaked out, it would almost certainly trigger a frenzied scramble among all the experts on Dark Star.

With that thought, the four fell silent.

The old crone looked at the three juniors and said, “I hope you can keep what happens here completely secret. Even after you return to your clans it’s best not to let unrelated people know.”

“We understand!” Cai He and Du Sisi replied in unison.

Yang Kai also nodded; he knew full well how significant this matter was and naturally did not want to attract trouble.

“By the way, Senior, earlier you mentioned the Three Divine Waters — what are the other two?” Cai He asked humbly, unwilling to miss such a learning opportunity. Although each of the Three Divine Waters was extremely difficult to obtain, having found one might mean chances to acquire the others.

The old crone said, “The other two are equally priceless, treasures that appear once in a hundred thousand years. One of them is the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, which I heard surfaced once a few years ago.”

“It appeared?” Cai He and Du Sisi cried out.

“Mm, it appeared within the Flowing Flame Sandland. If you never entered that place, it’s no wonder you wouldn’t know of it. What a pity—Origin Returning Realm cultivators cannot set foot in the Flowing Flame Sandland, otherwise this old woman might have had a chance to obtain some as well.”

“And the last one?” Du Sisi asked.

“The last one,” the old crone said slowly, a look of yearning flashing across her face, “hehe, is the Immortal Source Liquid! The Soul Cleansing Divine Water can help cultivators purify their souls and strengthen their Divine Sense cultivation, while the Life Jade Nectar can extend one’s lifespan and enhance one’s qi and blood. As for the Immortal Source Liquid, it can fortify a cultivator’s physical body—it is the finest treasure for tempering the flesh. If one’s fortune were truly heaven-defying and they could refine the legendary Immortal Tree into their body, they could achieve an undying, indestructible physique!”

“Immortal Tree?” Yang Kai’s expression moved. Hearing that the Immortal Source Liquid could temper the body, he was greatly tempted. Although he possessed a body-tempering method born of the Undying Five Elements Sword which, when cultivated to its peak, could achieve an undying body, he had never actually practiced it, so its effects were uncertain; moreover, he still lacked two of the five-element materials, and gathering them was no simple task. The fact the Immortal Tree supposedly had such effects naturally captured his interest.

He still did not know the precise relationship between the Immortal Tree and the Immortal Source Liquid, but since the old crone brought it up there must be some reason.
