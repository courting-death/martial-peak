## Chapter 723 — Are You Also Looking for Them?

The group before him wore unfriendly faces, and Yang Kai naturally returned no courtesy; his mood was far from pleasant in this moment, and if anyone provoked him it would be a good chance to vent.

"Heard you brat have been asking about an old codger and a young lass?" the middle-aged burly man sneered at Yang Kai, his eyes slanting as he spoke.

"You saw them?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Is it an old lecher and a veiled young girl?" the man confirmed.

"That's them!" Yang Kai cried out with delight, the sight of these people suddenly warming to him.

"Then we've seen them." The burly man nodded slightly. "What are you looking for them for? What is your relation to them?"

"That's none of your concern." Yang Kai shook his head. "Just tell me if they left any clues. I'll pay you a reward."

"A reward?" The burly man laughed in a strange way. "What kind of reward?"

"Crystal Stones or Spirit-Grade Pills — any valuable leads, I'll pay for them."

At that the burly man's eyes showed a flicker of surprise. Looking at Yang Kai's rustic attire, he had not expected the young man to possess any wealth.

"You're cocky, kid." The burly man nodded. "We did see that old man and the girl, but we didn't speak with them. We don't have many specifics."

"Then don't waste my time." Yang Kai's mood shifted again, his face growing cold.

The burly man chuckled, "Just because we don't know doesn't mean others don't. If you really want to inquire, come with us."

Yang Kai's eyes flickered; he suddenly smiled. "Fine, lead me to someone who knows."

The burly man inclined his head and led the way. Yang Kai hurried to keep up, while the burly man's companions trailed behind, subtly sealing off Yang Kai's retreat.

Yang Kai could tell these people were ill-intentioned, but they had unquestionably seen Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang; otherwise their descriptions would not have been so vivid.

What had that old man done to earn such enmity? Why did these people seem to hold such hatred toward him?

Even having noticed this, Yang Kai was skilled and bold; he felt no fear, following along with a composed air while covertly sizing up the situation.

He had been in Shuilan City a month and therefore knew there were no Saint Realm experts here, so he felt secure and unafraid.

After walking a long time with the burly man, they suddenly arrived before a large mansion.

Entering the residence, the burly man guided Yang Kai through the courtyard; before long they reached a garden.

In that garden a grim-faced youth sat in a chair. At his knees were two scantily clad women, half-kneeling like pets, nestling against him.

The two women were of low strength, roughly True Yuan Realm cultivators. Each wore a collar around her pale neck, the other end of which was a rope held in the youth's hand.

One woman's round hips were pert and proud; she was half-kneeling, striking a provocative pose like a little dog, begging and flattering with every instinct. The other had buried her head at the youth's crotch, moving deftly, her mouth seemingly filled with something as she made muffled sounds.

Both wore almost nothing, thin gauze merely covering their bodies; the wonder of their chests and the fragrant place between their legs were faintly visible.

Upon arriving, the burly man and his companions could not help but breathe faster, licking their lips as their gazes turned lecherous.

The youth seated in the chair wore an expression of lascivious lust.

Yang Kai's expression darkened.

Though he had long heard of the decadent tastes some rich Young Masters indulged in — in Zhongdu there were those who favored such perversions — seeing it with his own eyes was different.

This was the first time he had witnessed it in person.

"Young Master, the man has been brought." The burly man, after a brief inspection, seemed to sense the impropriety and hurriedly spoke.

The youth grunted without much interest, still wearing that lecherous look.

Suddenly the youth's face contorted; he grabbed the woman whose head was buried in his crotch by her hair and slapped her hard several times, angrily shouting, "Wench, how many times have I told you — don't use your teeth!"

The slaps landed heavily; the woman's cheek swelled instantly, yet she dared not utter a word of complaint and immediately crawled to the youth's feet, her slight body trembling.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; his aura grew dangerous.

The youth straightened his clothes, then leisurely looked over and snorted, "You're the one searching for that old man and the little girl?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded. "Do you have any leads on them?"

"No, I'm searching for them as well!" the youth sneered. "If you've any information, will you share it?"

"You're searching for them too?" Yang Kai's brow knit. "What do you want with them?"

"Questioning your loyalties should be my concern." The youth's face darkened. "But since you asked, I might as well tell you."

His expression turned savage as he gripped his chair, his True Yuan bursting: "I'm hunting them to kill them! The reason I've fallen into this plight is entirely because of that old man! Kid, now you tell me what your relation is. You'd better think carefully — if you are their friend or kin, I will make you suffer every torture of man before I slowly kill you!"

"That old man crippled you?" Yang Kai asked, astonished.

What sort of person was Meng Wuya? Without special cause he would not so severely strike a junior.

The only explanation was that this youth had provoked Meng Wuya.

Yang Kai immediately thought of Xia Ningshang. Shopkeeper Meng treasured her as a precious gem; if this youth had designs on her, he might well have enraged Meng Wuya.

From the youth's behavior it was clear he was a womanizing Young Master. Although Little Senior Sister had yet to reveal her face, anyone could see she must be ethereally beautiful; her innocent, ingenuous temperament would naturally draw others to her.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai's face grew grim.

"My Cheng Family treated that old man like a guest, and he crippled our Young Master — unforgivable," the burly man who had brought Yang Kai said coldly. "Kid, what is your relation to that damned old man? If you dare lie, I'll make you pay."

"Why did he do that to your Young Master? Tell me." Yang Kai turned to him, his gaze sharp as a blade.

The burly man seemed not to notice the edge in Yang Kai's gaze and snorted, "Simply because my Young Master fell for that girl. He slipped something into her food."

"Drugged her?" Yang Kai lightly nodded. "I can believe your Young Master capable of such a thing."

Xia Ningshang is the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body; using drugs against her is laughable. Though Yang Kai was certain Little Senior Sister would be safe, his anger nonetheless surged.

"If that old man maimed him, that was leniency — had it been me I wouldn't have spared him." Yang Kai gave a cold, sinister laugh.

"What did you say?" The burly man's countenance chilled as he demanded harshly.

The youth gazed at Yang Kai with interest. "If it were you, what would you do?"

"Kill!"

His answer stunned everyone into silence, then they burst out laughing in derision.

"You've got some nerve, saying such a thing in my Cheng Family — don't you know the meaning of death? In Shuilan City, my Cheng Family is..." The burly man mocked, but his words were abruptly cut off.

A faint metallic scent of blood wafted through the air. The burly man's eyes bulged and his face flushed. He felt his meridians and blood violently swell, and no matter how he strove, he could not suppress it.

Boom...

Flesh and blood flew everywhere. No one knew what had happened; the burly man suddenly left no corpse, only a pool of dark crimson on the ground.

Those standing nearby were splattered with bits of flesh.

The garden became a hellish scene that stunned everyone into immobility. The youth in the chair gaped, unable to believe what he was seeing.

"One last time I ask: do you know where that old man and the little girl went? If you know, speak up now — I'll give you an intact corpse." Yang Kai swept his gaze over them, a cold cruelty in his eyes.

"Kill him!" The youth's face went ashen as he finally recovered his wits and roared.

The remaining cultivators snapped out of their daze and moved to attack.

Wind rose and thunder rolled. Yang Kai stood unmoving, but his True Yuan surged forth.

Though his Wind-and-Thunder Wings did not manifest, the wind and thunder powers he harbored met within the garden and fused into a domain of slaughter.

The Divine Roaming Realm cultivators caught within had no chance to resist; they were cleaved into countless fragments, their deaths grotesque and merciless.

The youth in the chair froze — he had never expected to have provoked such a walking calamity.

Because Yang Kai appeared so young, he had been brought here thoughtlessly; none realized the strength he truly possessed.

"Transcendent Realm? Impossible!" the youth's eyes widened in horror.

To kill so many Divine Roaming Realm cultivators with barely any movement — only a Transcendent Realm power could do so, but could there be such a young Transcendent in the world?

Watching Yang Kai approach with a cold face, step by step, the youth screamed from the depths of his fear, "Don't come near! I don't know where those two went, don't come near!"

"Then you're as good as dead." Yang Kai sneered. After confirming the youth had not lied, he crushed the youth's skull with a single punch.

The garden filled with an overpowering stench of blood, yet Yang Kai's expression remained calm. This so-called battle was scarcely a battle for him; those who dared provoke him had sought their own deaths.

The two scantily clad women were unharmed but terribly frightened; they stared at Yang Kai with vacant eyes, their small bodies trembling, unable to move.

Yang Kai looked at them once, his gaze softening. He had no intention of troubling these two women.

Suddenly Yang Kai's face turned cold and he looked sharply in one direction.
