## Chapter 2596 — At the End of the Road

After receiving Fan Wu's response, Yang Kai gave a slight nod. Just as he was about to beckon Ruoxi over, Shi Huo suddenly said coldly, "You can take the others, but this little girl must stay." He pointed at Zhang Ruoxi, his tone brooking no argument.

Yang Kai's expression changed, and he glared at him, shouting sternly, "On what grounds?"

Shi Huo tossed the Myriad Beasts Seal in his hand and looked down from above, saying, "On the grounds of this. She dared to seal a million beast souls of my Ancient Land. For this alone, she must give the yao of the Ancient Land an explanation!"

As soon as he said this, he gained the approval of most of the Yao Kings present.

No one wanted their soul to be collected into a Secret Treasure and used against enemies after death. Zhang Ruoxi's Myriad Beasts Seal had truly incurred the wrath of the crowd.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou frowned. Although they knew Shi Huo was just stirring up trouble, his words were not without reason. From the standpoint of the yao of the Ancient Land, they could not refute him.

It seemed... today's matter could not be resolved so easily. Shi Huo would not rest until Yang Kai was dead.

Yang Kai had long known Shi Huo to be vengeful, but he hadn't expected him to be so petty. Just because Yang Kai had once suppressed him with the Mountain and River Bell, he kept harping on about it.

Having failed to kill Yang Kai with a sneak attack, even Shi Huo couldn't bring himself to try a second time. But the appearance of the Myriad Beasts Seal gave him another chance to make trouble.

"What kind of explanation do you want?" Yang Kai's eyes turned cold. He had just endured humiliation and refrained from retaliating against Shi Huo's bullying, which was already a difficult decision. Otherwise, with his temper, he would have fought Shi Huo to the death, even if it meant dying here.

But Ruoxi was here, the Stone Spirit Race was here, and the Third Disciple was here...

If he fell out with Shi Huo, the worst outcome would be that everyone would die!

He could only swallow his humiliation and bury it deep in his heart...

He never expected that Shi Huo would still refuse to let things go!

Shi Huo snorted, "Those who desecrate the yao of the Ancient Land—die!"

"Die!"

"We can't let her go!"

"Kill her!"

The many Yao Kings also began shouting, each one filled with righteous indignation, as if Zhang Ruoxi had committed some heinous crime.

Yang Kai's face was still streaked with drying blood. His cold gaze swept over the Yao Kings and finally settled on Fan Wu.

Fan Wu said indifferently, "This girl was not part of the previous agreement. Since she has violated a taboo... let her remain in the Ancient Land."

Although he despised Shi Huo's despicable behavior, Fan Wu was, after all, a Saint Venerable of the Ancient Land and did not wish to chill the hearts of the Yao Kings.

"Heh..." Yang Kai suddenly let out a deranged laugh, looking mockingly at the Yao Kings. He said coldly, "Very well. Dozens of Emperor Realm experts. Four Great Saint Venerables. Now you insist on killing a girl in her twenties. The yao of the Ancient Land... I have truly witnessed your ways today."

These words were harsh to hear. Many yao immediately flew into a rage and shouted, "What did you say, boy!"

Fan Wu and the others also looked displeased. But, as Yang Kai said, so many powerful experts all wanted to kill a girl in her early twenties. If word got out, it would sound disgraceful.

"Sir, don't mind me. Please, I beg you, don't mind me!" Ruoxi fell to her knees, suddenly crying out, her eyes full of urgency. "You must go!"

Realizing something had gone wrong, she was filled with regret, feeling that she had dragged Yang Kai into this. If she hadn't used the Myriad Beasts Seal earlier, perhaps none of this would have happened.

Yang Kai turned to look at her and slowly shook his head.

Ruoxi began to sob again, wailing, "Sir, it has been the greatest blessing of my life to receive your guidance. Being able to follow you all these years has made me very happy. I only regret never being able to help you, always dragging you down! In the future, when I'm no longer by your side, you must take care of yourself!"

Yang Kai's expression changed drastically, and he cried out, "Ruoxi, what are you doing!"

Ruoxi did not answer. Instead, she turned to look at Shi Huo, then at the Yao Kings, and finally fixed her gaze on Fan Wu. Her tear-filled eyes suddenly turned icy cold, and she said in a chilling, resolute voice, "Since I have violated the Ancient Land's taboo, I will repay it with my life. I hope this will appease the anger in your hearts. If, after my death, you still trouble my Sir, then even if I become a vengeful ghost, I will never let you go. Day and night, I will haunt you, demanding your lives at every moment!"

As soon as she finished speaking, all the Yao Kings' expressions changed, and even Fan Wu and the other Saint Venerables were moved.

They could see that Zhang Ruoxi was determined to use her life to protect Yang Kai. For such a gentle and obedient girl to say such fierce words showed just how resolute her will was and how deep her hatred ran.

To make such a vow before death—if it could not be fulfilled, she would truly become a vengeful ghost, haunting them endlessly.

A chill suddenly rose in the hearts of the Yao Kings.

Ruoxi turned her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. Her beautiful eyes were once again filled with tenderness and deep longing as she gazed foolishly at Yang Kai, sobbing, "Sir, in the next life, I will serve you again!"

As she finished speaking, she raised her hand high, Origin Qi surging in her palm, and struck fiercely toward her own crown.

If this palm landed, Ruoxi would surely die.

"Damn it!" Yang Kai's eyes nearly split with rage. His figure flickered and vanished from where he stood.

"Where do you think you're going?" Shi Huo sneered, stepping forward. His fist, wreathed in black flames, smashed into the void.

Boom—

Yang Kai's figure reappeared, as if shaken out of the void by someone. The sound of bones breaking rang out, his Qi and blood churned, and blood gushed from his mouth. The intense pain made him roar uncontrollably, but before he could land, he suddenly vanished again in midair.

Shi Huo snorted coldly, "Spatial techniques may be mysterious and unpredictable, but before this Lord, they leave traces all the same!"

As he spoke, he kicked out. Yang Kai's figure appeared again, crashing heavily to the ground and rolling repeatedly.

"Shi Huo!" Yang Kai roared, forcibly stopping his rolling body. He leapt up, eyes blood-red, a violent, indescribable aura suddenly erupting from him.

He only wanted to save Ruoxi, but even such a simple wish could not be fulfilled. Twice he tried to teleport, and both times Shi Huo ruthlessly blocked him.

As soon as he finished speaking, Shi Huo suddenly descended from the sky, punching Yang Kai to the ground. Then, a large foot stomped down, pinning Yang Kai to the ground like an ant.

Pfft—

A mouthful of golden blood sprayed out, falling like rain.

Yang Kai struggled to turn his head, looking desperately toward Ruoxi.

After being blocked by Shi Huo again and again, he had missed the best chance to save her. Now, Ruoxi was probably...

His body was in excruciating pain, as if it had fallen apart, but compared to the pain in his heart, this was nothing. The pain in his heart was like thousands of blades twisting, making it almost impossible to breathe...

A gentle, shy girl, always obedient and well-behaved, always following his every word...

From the Zhang Family in Fenglin City, she had followed him into this treacherous world. She hadn't even had the chance to experience its wonders, and now she was about to perish here!

He hated—hated his own weakness!

He regretted—regretted always keeping that girl by his side, letting her face so many dangers.

She should have stayed in the Zhang Family, found a good marriage, lived peacefully at home, and enjoyed a safe life.

A warm tear slid down from the corner of his eye, blurring his vision. Through the haze, Yang Kai could still see Zhang Ruoxi kneeling in place, facing his direction. Her raised hand hovered just above her crown, ready to strike. But at her wrist, another hand had reached out and firmly grasped her, stopping her desperate act.

"Hahahaha!" Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then couldn't help but burst out laughing. His laughter was unrestrained, as if he was truly happy.

This joyful laughter was in stark contrast to his current desperate situation.

Shi Huo's face darkened, and he pressed down harder with his foot.

"Pfft!" Yang Kai's laughter stopped abruptly as he spat out another mouthful of golden blood. Still, he gritted his teeth and shouted, "Senior Luan Feng, I owe you a favor!"

The one who had grabbed Zhang Ruoxi's hand, stopping her from ending her life, was none other than Luan Feng, who had been standing behind her all along.

With Luan Feng's strength, if she didn't allow it, Zhang Ruoxi would not be able to kill herself, no matter how determined she was.

Luan Feng said with a complicated expression, "You should worry about yourself first."

He was about to die, yet still spoke of owing favors. What use was a favor now? Besides, even if Yang Kai survived, that favor would probably be worthless.

Luan Feng was simply moved by Zhang Ruoxi and didn't want to see a tragedy happen.

After all, she was a woman. Even as a Divine Spirit, she still had a sentimental side.

"Let me go!" Zhang Ruoxi stubbornly raised her head, glaring at Luan Feng. Facing such a powerful being that even Third Stage Emperor Realm experts would avoid, she was still furious, biting her lip until it bled and struggling as she shouted, "You wicked woman, let me go!"

Luan Feng spoke softly, her tone distant, "Even if you die, your Sir will not survive. Why throw your life away for nothing?"

She could see that Shi Huo had never intended to let Yang Kai go. His vengeful nature was truly deadly.

Ruoxi was stunned, then suddenly pleaded, "Senior, please, save my Sir! I'll agree to anything, just save him!"

Of everyone present, only the remaining three Saint Venerables could stop Shi Huo. Ruoxi had realized this and so she begged.

Luan Feng looked down at her and said indifferently, "Aren't I a wicked woman?"

Upon hearing this, Ruoxi immediately raised her other hand and slapped herself hard across the face. As she hit herself, she said, "It was this junior who spoke out of turn just now. Please, Senior, be magnanimous and don't hold it against me. I only beg you to save my Sir..."

The sound of the slaps was loud and clear. Ruoxi showed no mercy to herself. After a few slaps, half her face was swollen and her mouth was full of blood, but she seemed not to feel the pain. Each slap was harder than the last, making the Yao Kings' eyelids twitch and the Stone Spirit Race growl in frustration, powerless to help.
