## Chapter 429 — Shadow Dance Kill, the Ghost in the Darkness

Xiang Chu instantly saw through Yang Zhao's insincerity. Although he was reprimanding Nan Sheng, it was clear he also deeply agreed with his point of view; he simply had to say those words out of respect and appearances.

At a moment like this, only someone adding fuel to the fire could make the outside world believe others were helping him resolve his doubts. Later, when spoken of, no one could accuse him of disregarding brotherly feelings.

That was why Xiang Chu dared to continue provoking.

He was a man with honeyed words but a dagger in his heart! As such a person himself, Xiang Chu naturally could see through Yang Zhao's thoughts.

Sure enough, Yang Zhao appeared to contemplate reluctantly for a while, then slowly nodded and said, “Yes, Brother Xiang is right. Second Brother has already been more than benevolent to the Ninth. Since Ninth Brother refuses to give face to Second Brother, I have nothing more to say.”

Turning his head, he smiled warmly at Yang Shen and said, “Ninth Brother is not showing up. Sixth Brother, you go get the command flag yourself.”

Yang Shen had been smiling in anticipation of a good show, but hearing this, he froze for a moment.

Then, with sudden realization, he understood he had unwittingly fallen into the trap set by Second Brother and instantly regretted it bitterly.

Earlier, Yang Zhao had negotiated with him: they each wanted something—one a person, the other the command flag.

Now that Yang Kai was not appearing, the only prize left was the command flag, so naturally Yang Shen had to send someone to seize it.

Sensing Yang Zhao’s intention, the smile on Yang Shen’s face gradually faded into solemnity.

Yang Zhao continued with a smile, “You go and get it. Second Brother assures you no tricks.”

To say such words in front of so many people showed Yang Zhao’s sincerity.

Yang Shen frowned, considered for a moment, then nodded. “Thanks for your kindness, Second Brother.”

His gaze swept over the group of people he brought, then he pointed to a Divine Roaming Realm warrior at the Fourth Stage, saying, “Go into the central hall and bring the command flag out.”

This man was support from Yang Shen’s mother’s family, a member of a first-rate force. His strength was neither weak nor outstanding.

When Yang Shen pointed at him, a bitter expression crossed the man’s face as he glanced at Qu Gaoyi standing at the front of the central hall.

The renowned Blood Servants Hall's formidable name struck terror across the world.

“What’s there to fear?” Yang Shen snapped, “The two Blood Servants by Ninth Brother’s side are still severely wounded, their foundations shaken, unable to use even a third of their normal strength. Moreover, they’re constrained by the Yang family’s clan rules and cannot strike first. As long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t touch you.”

“If I take the command flag, they won’t interfere?” The Divine Roaming Realm Fourth Stage martial artist’s eyes lit up; if that were true, he would have no worries.

“That’s impossible,” Yang Zhao shook his head. “They only react defensively. If you try to snatch the command flag, they will naturally try to stop you. But if you are fast enough to grab it and flee, I believe in their current state, they won’t be able to catch you.”

“Then I’ll go quickly!” Yang Shen said impatiently.

The Divine Roaming Realm Fourth Stage warrior showed helplessness on his face. Gritting his teeth, he stepped out of the crowd, cautiously watching Qu Gaoyi and stretching his Divine Sense to its limit, hoping to locate Ying Jiu’s hiding place.

But no matter how hard he tried, it was impossible to detect where Ying Jiu was concealed. This Blood Servants Hall elder seemed not even to be here.

Huo Xingchen still calmly waved his folding fan, while Qiu Yimeng’s charming face carried a serene smile, her beautiful eyes staring intently at the newcomer, clearly filled with a malicious delight.

Under her gaze, the newcomer grew even more nervous.

Walking slowly, this person gathered all his strength, cautiously circumventing Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng, while keeping a close eye on Qu Gaoyi standing at the central hall’s forefront, his face full of tension.

“Hmph!” Qu Gaoyi suddenly snorted softly, causing the man to shudder violently, nearly releasing a concealed technique.

If that move had been unleashed, Qu Gaoyi could have counterattacked instantly.

“Hahaha!” Seeing this, Huo Xingchen laughed heartily toward the sky, while Qiu Yimeng pursed her lips, unable to hold back her laughter.

Such disgraceful behavior by the subordinate greatly embarrassed Yang Shen.

The man’s face flushed with shame and anger; furious at himself, he briskly walked into the central hall like it was an empty realm, encountering no opposition.

Rustling sounds came from inside, and soon he burst out, face beaming with joy, holding the command flag.

“Sixth Uncle, I…” 

Before he could finish, a shadow seemed to flash through the darkness, and everything suddenly fell silent.

The man, clutching the command flag, stood at the central hall’s doorway, half stepping out—but that step would forever remain unfulfilled.

Yang Zhao and Yang Shen’s faces changed drastically, as did those of the martial artists behind them.

“Dead!” a Blood Servant beside Yang Zhao said in a low voice, eyes wandering in the air. “It was Ying Jiu’s Shadow Dance Kill!”

“So fast!” Yang Zhao’s voice trembled with terror. He whispered, “Did you see where Ying Jiu was hiding?”

“No clear sight.” The Blood Servant slowly shook his head. “Ying Jiu’s assassination and concealment skills are unmatched in the Blood Servants Hall. Even the two main and deputy hall masters find it difficult to locate him. I couldn’t find him.”

Pausing, he continued shaking his head. “What puzzles me is this: wasn’t Ying Jiu supposed to be severely wounded? How could he still unleash such a strike?”

“He’s healed already?” Yang Shen exclaimed, alarmed. Losing a comrade made him feel extremely grim.

“Impossible,” another Blood Servant beside Yang Shen interjected, shaking his head. “Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu are both severely injured. We saw them just today, and they still had weak Qi and blood. There’s no way they recovered in just one day.”

“Then it must be the Blood Fury Technique!” Yang Zhao confidently guessed.

The two Blood Servants who had spoken earlier nodded silently, a trace of sadness showing on their faces.

If Ying Jiu truly unleashed the Blood Fury Technique again, it would probably be the last burst of his life. After tonight, the world would have no Ying Jiu.

Between Blood Servants, the bond ran deep — deeper than between blood brothers. Though unspoken, one would sacrifice one's life to save the other.

“How long can he maintain the Blood Fury Technique in this state?” Yang Zhao asked.

Despite reluctance, the Blood Servant beside him lowered his voice and answered, “About half an hour. His remaining vitality will be exhausted by then.”

“Then we wait! Wait half an hour before acting!” Yang Zhao made his decision.

The manor fell into a brief calm. Only Huo Xingchen resumed sitting in the Grand Tutor’s chair, drinking and humming an unknown tune, unhurried and leisurely, which infuriated many watching.

Time dripped agonizingly slow, and the wait felt torturous.

After half an hour, Yang Zhao nodded. “Time’s about up.”

Yang Shen’s spirit lifted, a determined expression emerging. “Brother Qiu, this time with two of your Qiu family’s men going up, I refuse to believe we can’t snatch the command flag back.”

Qiu Ziru smiled. “You have only to command, Sixth Uncle.”

He gave a signal to two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage warriors of the Qiu family, who stepped forward simultaneously.

Before they could move, Qiu Yimeng suddenly said solemnly, “Brother, if I were you, I wouldn’t gamble with the lives of these two. This decision is too reckless.”

Qiu Ziru frowned and sneered, “Sister, don’t try to be mysterious. Yang Kai is doomed tonight. You’re usually spot on with your predictions, but this time I think you’ll be disappointed. With so many of us here, what can you possibly oppose us with?”

“Obstinacy!” Qiu Yimeng shook her head in deep disappointment, saying no more.

After the siblings finished talking, Yang Shen waved a hand: “Everyone, go up! Half tie up Qu Gaoyi, the other half get me that command flag!”

With a rustling sound, over a dozen figures sped forth. Half were Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, the strongest at the Eighth Stage. The rest were not weak either.

Led by the Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage warrior, four or five others encircled Qu Gaoyi, who had stood impassive without moving.

Although they knew he was severely injured, these martial artists from a first-rate force did not dare to initiate an attack against a Blood Servant.

Qu Gaoyi stood like an ancient mountain, unmoved, his expression cold as he glanced at them.

The rest dashed toward the central hall, rushing at the man who had died earlier, aiming to seize the command flag he bore.

All faces brimmed with excitement, as if victory was already within reach.

By now, Ying Jiu should have no strength left to attack. That meant whoever grabbed this command flag would claim victory, and taking it would be a great merit in Yang Shen’s eyes, surely rewarded handsomely.

Seven or eight people reached for the command flag simultaneously.

At that moment,

A faint ghostly light erupted in the darkness, and a slender figure dashed out, wielding two daggers shimmering with dark light. In the midst of the crowd’s excitement, chilling rays flared from the blades.

This slender figure blurred and suddenly split into a dozen shadowy forms, each cold and grim, each swift and deadly.

Shadow Dance Kill!

Cries and screams filled the air, blood splattered.

How could the excited warriors trying to snatch the command flag withstand the assassination of a Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage Blood Servant? In moments, three of them fell to the ground.

The others, sensing danger, rapidly retreated but still could not avoid injuries.

In an instant, the dust settled.

Ying Jiu stood alone at the central hall’s doorway, daggers in hand, like a ghost in the darkness. He retrieved the command flag from the dead man, tossed it, then hung it back inside the hall.

His figure blurred rapidly, vanishing into the air without a trace.

“No Blood Fury Technique!” Yang Zhao’s eyes sharpened as he shouted in alarm.

The Blood Fury Technique leaves a distinctive sign—red radiance emanates from the user’s Qi and blood—but Ying Jiu showed no such sign at all.

“Second Brother!” Yang Shen gritted his teeth, furious. He had blindly trusted Yang Zhao’s judgment, leading to severe losses among his men, filling him with rage.

Yang Zhao coldly glanced at him, frowning. “It was Second Brother’s judgment that was mistaken.”

“Then what about my losses... sigh.” Yang Shen knew it was unrealistic to ask Yang Zhao for compensation, only cursing himself for not being more discerning and trusting others so easily.
