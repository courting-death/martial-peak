## Chapter 2390 — The Peculiar Stone Slab

Seeing Shen Fei fall silent, Yang Kai sneered inwardly and said nothing more.

This man wanted to cooperate with him, but whether it was a trick or not, his sincerity was questionable. Otherwise, how could Yang Kai have dismissed him with just a few words? Clearly, this kind of person only wanted to use others and was completely unreliable.

Besides, even if the two of them really did cooperate and obtained that tool, who would control it in the end?

However, there was one thing Shen Fei hadn’t gotten wrong: the location of the exit was in Sangde’s hands. If Sangde took the tool, then whether or not he would take the rest of them out would be entirely up to him.

What Shen Fei could think of, Yang Kai could naturally think of as well. Snake Lady and Man Kuai weren’t fools either; they must have considered it too. That’s why they stuck so closely to Sangde, to prevent him from burning bridges after crossing the river.

Still, Yang Kai felt that following Sangde right now was pointless. Sangde had spent five years gathering five people here; it couldn’t be just to break a single Shimmering Water Ten-Color Grand Array. There must be more places where he needed their strength, so even if Sangde wanted to leave them behind, the time for that hadn’t come yet.

Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of anything. With his current strength and the help he had at hand, Sangde couldn’t stir up any waves. Once they found the tool, if Sangde was sensible, he could work with him to leave this Jixu Secret Realm. If not, then he’d have to use force. With his current means, Sangde wouldn’t be able to resist.

From deep within the island, strange noises occasionally echoed out, seemingly caused by Sangde as he worked to break the array.

From this, it was clear that Sangde was not only a formidable artifact refiner, but also highly skilled in the Dao of Arrays—he truly carried the style and talent of his late master.

An hour later, Snake Lady and Man Kuai returned, covered in dust and looking utterly disheveled. Their expressions were extremely displeased.

Hearing the commotion, Shen Fei opened his eyes and looked at them in surprise. “Where’s the master?”

He thought Sangde had already abandoned them.

Snake Lady didn’t answer, but Man Kuai said awkwardly, “He’s still breaking the array.”

“Then why did you two…” Shen Fei didn’t finish his question before realizing the reason. Snake Lady and Man Kuai had followed Sangde but were of no help and instead suffered from the array, so they retreated.

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but gloat a little, secretly glad he’d had the foresight to stay here. Otherwise, he’d be just as miserable as those two.

After returning, Snake Lady and Man Kuai each found a spot to sit cross-legged and recover.

In a flash, several days passed.

During these days, no one moved. Only from deep within the island did strange noises occasionally sound, marking Sangde’s progress in breaking the array. After a few days of rest, everyone had more or less recovered, spirits high and itching for action.

At one point, Man Kuai suddenly frowned and said in confusion, “Everyone, hasn’t it been quiet for a long time?”

These past days, Sangde would make some noise every so often while breaking the array. But now, after more than half a day, it was completely quiet, making everyone uneasy.

“Could the master have…” Shen Fei’s face changed slightly, thinking of a very bad possibility.

Hearing this, everyone’s expressions grew grave. If Sangde had really been killed by the remaining array here, things would be a mess.

Just then, Snake Lady suddenly took out a communication bead and said in surprise, “The master is calling us over. All the arrays along the way have been broken.”

Everyone perked up at her words, stood up together, and headed deeper into the island.

Along the way, they occasionally saw traces of power eruptions—clearly Sangde’s handiwork while breaking the arrays. Judging from the marks and lingering energy fluctuations, Sangde was indeed a top Dao Origin Realm expert, not to be underestimated.

After walking for a full hour, they finally saw Sangde. At this moment, he was sitting cross-legged beneath a stone wall. It was clear that breaking the arrays over the past few days had taken a toll on him, leaving him looking haggard and tired. But before they arrived, he had obviously taken some Spiritual Pills and was quickly recovering.

Seeing him meditating, Yang Kai and the others didn’t disturb him. Instead, they looked around, and soon everyone’s gaze was drawn to a stone slab on the wall.

The stone slab was smooth and flat—clearly a door, blocking their way to whatever lay beyond the wall.

Sangde was meditating here, obviously because he was blocked by it.

Everyone was curious why this was so, since the stone slab didn’t seem to have any traces of an array. Though the material was a bit odd, it shouldn’t be a problem for Sangde, should it?

All of them were experienced martial artists. Though puzzled, no one dared to touch the slab rashly. They just waited quietly for Sangde to wake up.

No one knew what kind of Spiritual Pill Sangde had taken, but after just an hour, the old man’s face was rosy, as if he’d fully recovered.

He slowly opened his eyes and stood up.

“Master!” Shen Fei called out hurriedly. “What do we do now?”

Sangde looked at the stone slab with a serious face and said, “This is a Dragon-Suppressing Stone made from Exotic Heavenly Gold, weighing a hundred thousand jin. We’ll have to rely on brute strength to move it if we want to get inside. Behind it is that old man’s cave, and the thing we’re after is inside.”

“Exotic Heavenly Gold!”

The other four only heard these four words. Their eyes lit up, staring at the seemingly ordinary stone slab with burning gazes.

Yang Kai was also greatly astonished. Although he had sensed earlier that this stone slab was anything but ordinary, he hadn’t expected it to be such a priceless treasure. Exotic Heavenly Gold was an Imperial-Grade artifact material, the best choice for forging an Imperial Treasure. It was a treasure countless Emperor Realm experts longed for but could never find—yet here, on this remote overseas island, there was such a massive piece!

And it was being used just to seal a cave!

Sangde’s master really was extravagant. If this Exotic Heavenly Gold were sold, it would fetch a sky-high price and have countless Emperor Realm experts fighting over it.

Seeing everyone’s reaction, Sangde frowned and barked, “Man Kuai, this is up to you.”

Man Kuai understood and nodded. “Don’t worry, Master. I can’t say much for anything else, but I do have some strength.”

Sangde made it clear: the slab made from Exotic Heavenly Gold couldn’t be attacked, only moved by brute force. Of the five present, Man Kuai was definitely the best choice.

Perhaps Sangde had chosen Man Kuai precisely for his strength.

Man Kuai stepped forward, his expression solemn. As he channeled his power—no one knew what secret technique he used—his already burly frame suddenly grew even larger, muscles bulging with explosive strength. Snake Lady’s beautiful eyes sparkled with a strange light, her heart fluttering.

With a deep shout, Man Kuai slowly pushed forward with his huge hands. The moment his fan-sized palms touched the slab, a dull boom rang out, like two mountains colliding. It was incredibly shocking, as if the whole island trembled.

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock at Man Kuai’s astonishing strength.

Even Yang Kai was stunned. He was confident in his own strength, but compared to Man Kuai, he seemed to fall short. In pure strength, he might not be a match.

Truly, the world is full of extraordinary people, each excelling in their own domain.

“Good, good, Man Kuai, you didn’t let this old man down!” Sangde was overjoyed. His always-calm face finally broke into a smile. “Once we’re past this, the rest will be easy.”

Judging by his words, this was the hardest part.

No wonder—a hundred-thousand-jin object, moved only by brute force. There really weren’t many in the world who could do it. Yang Kai figured that on the whole Tongtian Island, there probably wasn’t a second person who fit the bill. Sangde had likely spent five years mainly searching for someone like Man Kuai.

“Master, have you been here before?” Yang Kai asked, suddenly curious.

If he hadn’t, how would he know what was behind, or be so familiar with the place? He’d broken through the arrays without any trouble.

“It was a long time ago!” Sangde replied casually, not wanting to explain further.

Squeeeak… An ear-piercing scraping sound rang out.

The slab made from Exotic Heavenly Gold slowly moved under Man Kuai’s immense strength, gradually revealing a small crack in the stone wall.

Seeing this, Man Kuai let out a loud roar and pushed even harder.

The crack grew wider and wider. Sangde stared with wide eyes, looking extremely tense.

Suddenly, Man Kuai frowned and said in alarm, “Master, something seems off!”

“What’s wrong? What’s off?” Sangde asked urgently, frowning.

Man Kuai hesitated, his brow furrowing as he said, “This stone slab… it feels like there’s some kind of suction coming from it. Master, are you sure it’s safe to just push it open like this?”

Sangde snorted, “What could go wrong? Hurry up and push it open!”

Though Man Kuai felt uneasy, he was bold and skilled. He put in even more strength, widening the crack until a person could pass through.

Seeing this, Sangde shouted, “In!”

The next moment, he darted through the crack and disappeared in a flash.

Yang Kai and the others, already prepared, followed one after another.

As soon as they rushed inside, they heard Man Kuai suddenly scream in terror, as if he’d encountered something terrifying. He shouted, “Master, save me!”

“What’s wrong!” Snake Lady quickly turned back, her face pale.

Just a moment ago, when she rushed in, Man Kuai had been fine, pushing the slab. How had things changed in the blink of an eye?
