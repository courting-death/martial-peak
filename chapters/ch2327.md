## Chapter 2327 — Emperor Heaven Valley

The so-called Emperor Heaven Valley was nothing like its name and was of no use to Yang Kai.

Ye Qinghan could not possibly deceive him; Yang Kai was confident. Ever since he had met Ye Qinghan, she had always treated him with caution and utmost respect, so how could she possibly lie to him about something like this?

The only explanation was that Emperor Heaven Valley did indeed once contain Emperor Intent, but for some unknown reason, it had vanished without a trace.

Tens of thousands of years had passed, seas had changed into mulberry fields, and anything could have happened.

Yang Kai stood in place, frustrated for a while, but when he recalled how many Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines he had gathered, he realized it was not a fruitless trip after all. In fact, he had gained quite a lot, so he no longer dwelled on it.

The valley was filled with a strange fragrance, clearly indicating the presence of many Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines.

Since he had already come to this place, Yang Kai did not intend to let it go. He immediately began searching the valley.

Before long, Yang Kai reaped a great harvest.

After picking a crimson fruit from a waist-high tree, Yang Kai was just about to toss it into his Spatial Ring when he suddenly sensed something unusual. His Divine Sense swept over the fruit, carefully probing it for any hidden secrets.

After a moment, he could not help but let out a soft exclamation.

He recognized this fruit—it was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level Vermilion Bird Fruit, the main ingredient for refining the Vein-Cleansing Pill. Consuming it could help a cultivator cleanse their meridians, making their cultivation even purer.

If that were all, it would be nothing special. The key was that Yang Kai sensed a clear power of law within this Vermilion Bird Fruit.

A Dao Origin-Grade Spirit Fruit, no matter how high its grade, should not be able to nurture the power of law. This shocked him greatly.

After carefully sensing for a while, Yang Kai discovered that the power of law within the Vermilion Bird Fruit had already taken shape, faintly carrying the feeling of Emperor Intent.

Yang Kai’s brows suddenly rose, his eyes lit up, and he exclaimed in a low voice, “Could it be...?”

As if struck by a thought, he hurriedly took out the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines he had previously collected from his Spatial Ring and examined them carefully.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai’s face showed a look of realization—he finally understood what was going on.

Emperor Heaven Valley did indeed contain dense Emperor Intent long ago, allowing cultivators to comprehend and cultivate within it, laying the foundation for advancing to the Emperor Realm.

But over the tens of thousands of years, the Emperor Intent had been completely absorbed by the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines growing here. Now, all that Emperor Intent had fused with the herbs and medicines, becoming inseparable!

Nearly all the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines Yang Kai had collected in this valley, just like the Vermilion Bird Fruit, contained Emperor Intent!

In contrast, the medicinal ingredients he had gathered before coming here did not have this characteristic. The difference was clear at a glance.

Realizing this, Yang Kai could not help but become excited.

Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines imbued with Emperor Intent—such things were unheard of, let alone seen. If they were refined into Spiritual Pills, those pills would surely retain Emperor Intent as well. When cultivators consumed them, they would be able to clearly comprehend the power of law within.

This method was far more effective than comprehending Emperor Intent within Emperor Heaven Valley itself. Comprehending it in the valley was merely external, but consuming a Spiritual Pill containing Emperor Intent allowed one to comprehend it from within, involving every bit of flesh and every inch of meridian. It was obvious that this would allow cultivators to understand it even more clearly.

Only a special place like Emperor Heaven Valley could give birth to such extraordinary Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines.

Yang Kai could imagine that once pills refined from these herbs entered the Star Realm, those cultivators at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm would fight desperately for them. The medicinal effects of the pills themselves would be secondary; for those stuck at the peak of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, unable to advance, the Emperor Intent and Power of Law contained within were the true treasures.

Overjoyed, he secretly felt that the greatest gain from this trip might be the herbs in Emperor Heaven Valley. Without any further hesitation, he immediately began a thorough search.

He decided not to let a single Spiritual Herb slip by. Any that were mature had to be collected.

The valley was not large, but after tens of thousands of years without anyone disturbing it, and nourished by rich Spiritual Qi, it had produced quite a few Spiritual Medicines. Yang Kai searched every inch, and after a full day of busy work, he finally finished searching the entire valley.

All the Spiritual Medicines were collected into his pouch.

To distinguish them from those he had gathered earlier, Yang Kai specially set these Spiritual Medicines aside, planning to refine them into pills as soon as this trip was over.

With Emperor Intent contained within, and the Spiritual Medicines already collected, if he did not refine them quickly, Yang Kai worried that the Emperor Intent would gradually dissipate.

Sister Hua would surely be very interested in those Spiritual Pills. With their help, her progress toward the Emperor Realm would certainly speed up greatly.

A day later, Yang Kai stood before a cave, his expression grave.

While searching for Spiritual Medicines in Emperor Heaven Valley earlier, he had discovered this cave, but had not had time to explore it. Only after collecting all the herbs did he have the leisure to investigate.

The cave seemed naturally formed, but Yang Kai keenly noticed traces of artificial modification. The person who altered it had great skill, and with the passage of time, it was not easy to spot.

Yang Kai could not tell whether it was disciples of the Thousand Leaves Sect from tens of thousands of years ago who had altered this cave for cultivation, or if it was something else entirely. Regardless, as soon as he stepped inside, he sensed a faint aura of danger lingering within.

He instinctively felt that something extraordinary was hidden inside.

However, along the way, he had not encountered even a single demonic beast, so he was not too worried. This secret realm was not large, and since it had been a place for Thousand Leaves Sect disciples to cultivate tens of thousands of years ago, there should not be any fatal threats.

So, after only a brief hesitation, he walked into the cave.

The cave was dimly lit. There had once been strange stones embedded in the walls for illumination, but after so many years, they had lost their effect. The air, however, was not turbid and was even quite dry.

Yang Kai had not walked far when his nostrils twitched. He caught a strange smell wafting from ahead. The odor was unpleasant, even a bit putrid, like the stench of dead fish.

This made him frown.

By rights, with such rich Spiritual Qi in this secret realm, all living things should thrive. There should not be such a foul smell.

Just as this thought arose, Yang Kai suddenly felt something was wrong. In that instant, his vision blurred, his steps became unsteady, and he staggered involuntarily.

“Poison?” Yang Kai was shocked. He quickly circulated his Origin Qi to protect himself and hurriedly took a fruit from his Spatial Ring, stuffing it into his mouth and swallowing it whole.

That fruit was an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herb, worth a fortune, and had also been harvested from this secret realm. But at this moment, Yang Kai could not afford to worry about such things. The cave before him piqued his curiosity, and if he wanted to explore its depths, he could only swallow the spirit fruit first to ward off the poison.

With the fruit in his belly and his Origin Qi circulating, Yang Kai felt much better and continued forward.

The deeper he went, the stronger the stench became. Not only that, but the toxicity in the air seemed to intensify as well. Yang Kai felt he would not be able to hold out much longer. He had no idea what kind of poison this was, but even he struggled to resist it. If the poison gas alone was so potent, touching the source would surely mean instant death.

So he secretly decided that if he found nothing after a while, he would immediately withdraw.

But just as this thought surfaced, he saw a faint light ahead, which made his spirits rise and his pace quicken.

Soon after, he entered a much larger cave.

Inside, a brilliant, glowing stone was embedded high on the cave wall. Even after so many years, it still shone brightly, illuminating everything within.

Yang Kai’s gaze swept around and quickly fixed on a certain spot. He could not help but gasp.

He saw a shriveled corpse sitting upright over there. The corpse had clearly been dead for countless years, with not a trace of vitality left. Even the flesh had withered away, leaving only skin and bones. The eye sockets were sunken, the hair disheveled and lusterless, like withered grass.

However, the clothes on the corpse looked somewhat familiar.

After looking for a while, Yang Kai immediately recalled that Ye Hen’s attire seemed quite similar.

This made his brows rise; he suddenly understood the identity of the dead man before him.

This fellow was clearly the last Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect to enter the secret realm all those years ago. It was he who brought countless Thousand Leaves Sect techniques and secret arts into this place, causing the sect’s inheritance to be severed. It must also have been him who deliberately destroyed the Formation Foundation platform within the secret realm, closing the entrance.

The decline of the Thousand Leaves Sect—this man was undoubtedly the chief culprit!

Yang Kai did not know why he had done all this, but the man was already dead. There was no point in pursuing it now. Besides, Yang Kai was not a member of the Thousand Leaves Sect and had no need to concern himself with these matters.

His purpose in entering this secret realm was only to repair the Formation Foundation platform. Discovering the corpse of the Thousand Leaves Sect’s Sect Master from tens of thousands of years ago was just an accident.

Thinking this, Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, “I have inadvertently intruded upon Senior’s place of passing. I mean no offense—please do not take it amiss.”

He muttered a few words in a ritual manner before stepping forward.

This Thousand Leaves Sect senior, who knew what he had been doing before his death? Yang Kai found a huge formation pattern beneath the corpse, extremely mysterious, and beside the corpse were piles of minerals and all sorts of bizarre artifact refining materials.

The quality of these materials was extremely high—at least Dao Origin-Grade, with some even being Imperial-Grade.

If an artificer were here, they would surely be overjoyed.

Yang Kai, however, was not particularly moved. No matter how precious these materials were, he would just give them to his Incarnation to refine and devour. For him, it was only a matter of quantity.

Without hesitation, he stepped forward and quickly gathered up all the scattered materials, tossing them into the Small Xuan Realm for his Incarnation to handle.

Next, Yang Kai’s attention was drawn to the Spatial Ring on the corpse’s finger.

The deceased had definitely been an Emperor Realm expert before his death, most likely at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, and was the Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect. How could there not be treasures in that Spatial Ring? If Yang Kai’s guess was correct, all the lost techniques and secret arts of the Thousand Leaves Sect were surely inside that ring.
