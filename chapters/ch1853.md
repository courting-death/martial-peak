## Chapter 1853 — Eighth Elder

An elder and a young man both watched Yang Kai's departing back, remaining silent for a long time; the elder's expression was grave, while the young man seemed oddly interested in Yang Kai, a faint smile hanging at the corner of his mouth.

Only after Yang Kai's silhouette vanished from view did the young man smile faintly. "Interesting."

"Rude brat!" the elder snorted coldly.

The young man looked at the elder in surprise. "Elder Ji, why say that?"

Ji Jun snorted. "That brat must have discovered that I and the Second Young Master were hiding here, and he likely knows Qu Zheng's sudden change of attitude had something to do with us. Yet he didn't offer thanks and instead left on his own—what else is that but rude?"

The young man was slightly startled. "This man could even find where Elder Ji was hiding?"

Ji Jun nodded. "Second Young Master might not have seen clearly. Before he left, that man glanced our way; it was obvious he had discovered us long ago."

The young man raised his brow. "Elder Ji is an expert at the peak of the First Stage; his Divine Sense is far stronger than ordinary Second Stage practitioners. If this man could discover Elder Ji, does that not mean the man truly possesses Second Stage cultivation?"

Ji Jun frowned, pondered a moment, then said, "I didn't probe too obviously, so I can't determine precisely what cultivation he has. Although Lu Tianfeng had direct contact with him, Lu Tianfeng said he couldn't discern the other's foundation... From this it seems that even if the man is inferior to me, he isn't far behind. Whether he is truly Second Stage still needs verification."

The young man grinned broadly. "Good, good! No wonder he dares be so arrogant—those with real ability should be like that. I like a person who looks the part."

"Second Young Master..." Ji Jun hesitated as he looked at the young man. "Do you intend to recruit him?"

The young man nodded. "Indeed. Purple Star City has been turbulent lately; the faction led by the Great Elder has been acting aggressively and has already meddled in places they shouldn't. If I don't act, Purple Star will change its name."

Ji Jun's expression shifted slightly and he snorted. "The Great Elder and his party are seeking their own deaths; when the Lord returns he will definitely hold them accountable. But Second Young Master, why are you in such a hurry after all these years lying low? Although the Lord and the Eldest Young Master have been missing for nearly two years, before the Lord left he said he and the Eldest Young Master had gone to handle urgent matters and would soon return. If the Lord comes back and finds you... you must remember, with his abilities there are very few in the Star Domain who can threaten him, and even fewer who could kill him. He will return one day."

A faint worry flickered through the young man's eyes but vanished quickly; he chuckled softly. "Elder Ji is right, but it's not personal impatience—time does not wait for me. Besides, I act for the Purple family, not for private gain; even if my father returns he won't blame me much."

"Let's hope so," Ji Jun said with worry, nodding; seeing the young man was resolute, he stopped persuading him.

The young man fixed his gaze on the direction Yang Kai had left and asked, "Elder Ji, with your eye, do you think I can recruit him?"

"Everyone has a price; it depends whether the Second Young Master can pay it. Cater to his tastes and you can get things done."

“Elder Ji is right,” the young man said with a faint smile. “In that case, we’ll need to find out what exactly he likes first. Tsk, tsk… the Third Venerable of Purple Star, huh? That kind of power is not to be underestimated. At such a crucial moment, I absolutely can’t let him slip through my fingers!”

As he spoke he clenched his fist as if trying to squeeze the whole world, his purple hair flying about...

Yang Kai had barely returned to the Commerce Guild with Hua Youmeng when he frowned and glanced inward.

He discovered a Void King Realm expert sitting in a rear courtyard chamber—someone he did not know and whose aura was utterly unfamiliar, unlike Lu Tianfeng's.

Gao Hong rushed out of the guild in a hurry, her face full of anxiety.

"Sister Hong, what's wrong?" Hua Youmeng asked suspiciously.

Gao Hong cast a glance at Yang Kai and whispered, "Eighth Elder is waiting in the back hall... for this honored guest!"

"Eighth Elder?" Hua Youmeng's head spun and she nearly lost her balance; her pretty eyes looked at Yang Kai with complicated unease.

Since Yang Kai had appeared at the Commerce Guild, big names who were once only heard of and not seen had been arriving one after another; Hua Youmeng felt as if she were dreaming.

The small Commerce Guild had become like an invisible vortex, swallowing these great figures one by one.

What worried Hua Youmeng was that any one of those great figures could crush the guild with a mere finger. And the visitor now was the Eighth Elder, none other than the uncle of Jiang Chao—could the Eighth Elder's arrival be related to the earlier incident?

Hua Youmeng panicked and could only look at Yang Kai pleadingly. "Honored guest."

Yang Kai frowned. "I'll go see."

He had expected that producing the Command Token would bring countless troubles, but he hadn't imagined they would arrive this quickly.

He had never met Purple Star's Eighth Elder before, but the man was undoubtedly a Void King Realm expert; Yang Kai didn't know what the man wanted. It seemed unlikely to be about Jiang Chao—the timing was too tight for the Eighth Elder to have acted so quickly.

Thus, it appeared the Eighth Elder had come for another reason.

In the back hall a pale-faced, beardless elder waited with a sullen look; impatience hung about him. This was Purple Star's Eighth Elder, Jiang Changfeng, and beneath him stood Xia Jingwu, Yao Qing, Haitang and others, their faces wearing forced smiles and barely daring to breathe.

When had they ever seen such a grand figure before? Though they had been mingling in Purple Star City for many years, the people they usually dealt with were merely Origin Returning and Saint King Realm cultivators. As for those lofty Void King Realm experts—they had never laid eyes on a single one.

Even when Lu Tianfeng had come last night, they had not had such close contact.

But today someone of even higher status than Lu Tianfeng had come! The Eighth Elder's aura seemed sour; the pressure he unconsciously emitted set Xia Jingwu and the others' Qi and blood surging, which they had to suppress bitterly or they would have coughed up blood.

"Is this called tea?" Jiang Changfeng snapped in impatience, picked up a cup at random, took a sip, and immediately flew into rage, smashing the cup to the floor. "How dare you! I, this Elder, personally arrive and am served this inferior tea? Do you not regard me at all!"

Xia Jingwu trembled and was forced to kneel by the other's momentum, stammering, "Eighth Elder, please calm your anger. This Qishan Cloud-Mist Tea is the Commerce Guild's best."

"This is your best tea? It tastes like trash!" Jiang Changfeng snorted unhappily.

Xia Jingwu smiled bitterly, thinking of the visitor's status and how their little Commerce Guild's daily tea could never compare to what the Elder usually drank.

For the Commerce Guild these Qishan Cloud-Mist leaves were a treasure beyond price, yet before the Eighth Elder they were dismissed as garbage.

Haitang and Yao Qing looked at the spilled tea with pity in their eyes; it was something they themselves seldom drank and reserved for important guests.

"Honored guest, please calm your anger. Perhaps this tea does not suit your taste; I can go out and fetch something better," Xia Jingwu said carefully.

"Hmph, no need." Jiang Changfeng's face darkened. "I did not come here for tea. Where is the one I came to find? Why has he still not appeared?"

Xia Jingwu looked toward the door but saw no trace of anyone and began to sweat. "Eighth Elder, that honored guest left early with our chairman; I don't know where he went."

"Won't you go look for him?" Jiang Changfeng, with a violent temper, waved his hand and sent a gust of force toward Xia Jingwu and the others, shouting, "I give you one incense stick's time—if you don't find him..."

Before Jiang Changfeng could finish, a calm voice sounded outside the door, and a person suddenly appeared, stepping between Jiang Changfeng and Xia Jingwu; with a slight raise of his hand he swept away the incoming gust.

"Honored guest!" Xia Jingwu and the others looked at Yang Kai's back and rejoiced. "You're finally back."

Yao Qing and Haitang also looked at Yang Kai with grateful expressions; though they were not close to him, his earlier aid had inspired their gratitude.

Though he was also Void King Realm, compared to these Eight Elders Yang Kai seemed immeasurably grand.

Yang Kai frowned as he glanced at Xia Jingwu and the others, a flicker of anger flashing across his face. He reached out and pulled each of them up one by one, saying, “You all should leave for now.”

"Yes!" Xia Jingwu and the others obeyed him unquestioningly and rushed out; once in the rear yard they panted heavily, pale-faced.

Inside the room Yang Kai turned and coldly regarded Jiang Changfeng, sneering, "You sure carry a lot of swagger!"

Jiang Changfeng frowned and examined Yang Kai; his Divine Sense drifted back and forth as if trying to probe Yang Kai's cultivation, but in the next moment he found he could not see through the other's foundation.

As he tried to withdraw his Divine Sense his expression changed in alarm—at that instant the man's body seemed to become a whirlpool that dragged at his Divine Sense and pulled it in.

Jiang Changfeng was terrified and forced his Divine Sense to break free.

The whirlpool that had trapped his Divine Sense then vanished mysteriously.

Jiang Changfeng failed to pull back in time; his Sea of Consciousness churned violently, like wind and clouds rising.

A muffled groan came from him; he staggered backward a few steps, his face slightly pale—he had clearly suffered some hidden injury.

A cold smile curled at Yang Kai's mouth as he looked at him mockingly.

That smile made Jiang Changfeng feel utterly ashamed; he knew he had struck a hard wall and, forcing down his anger, snapped, "Friend, what do you mean by this?"

"And what do you think I mean?" Yang Kai snorted.
