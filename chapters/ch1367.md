## Chapter 1367 — Self-Inflicted Humiliation

That voice was furious to the extreme, even carrying a strange shock that pressed straight into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai snorted coldly; his Divine Sense power erupted and dispelled the shock.

Hearing that sound, the warrior surnamed Hai entwined in golden threads was overjoyed and shouted, "Senior Uncle, save me!"

At that cry, Yang Kai immediately understood the arrival must be an Origin Returning Realm warrior from Haixin Sect. After all, Tianyun City lay only dozens of li from Dragon Lair Mountain; since a message had been sent, reinforcements would not take long to arrive.

Yet Yang Kai remained serene and unafraid; he had in fact been waiting for this Origin Returning Realm warrior, and the other's prompt arrival fell perfectly into his plan.

Fixing his gaze on the newcomer's direction, he revealed a strange smile. Divine Sense power burst from his Sea of Consciousness, forming an invisible blade that tore forth toward that spot.

The other had attempted a Divine Sense strike to ambush him; Yang Kai naturally returned the favor.

The rushing rainbow light suddenly faltered, followed by a low exclamation of alarm. The light then trembled as if unstable, about to plummet.

Though the newcomer was a First Stage Origin Returning Realm expert, he suffered a minor setback under Yang Kai's Divine Sense assault. His expression grew suspicious; after steadying his posture he no longer bore his previous arrogance, instead cautiously approaching Dragon Lair Mountain.

He had earlier received a message from his disciple saying a fine place to rest had been found and that the owner was reasonable and willing to receive them respectfully. He had assumed it was some small family and came in high spirits—only to run into this.

In the blink of an eye, this Haixin Sect Origin Returning Realm warrior arrived before Dragon Lair Mountain and revealed himself.

Yang Kai glanced at him and found the man imposing in appearance: not very tall, but broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, a mop of red hair tangled like a bird's nest. A flat nose and sunken eyes, a face of coarse flesh that looked fierce and imposing.

Sweeping his eyes over the situation ahead, the newcomer's eyelids tightened and his anger rose to the utmost.

Though outsiders shouldn't oppress the local, his Haixin Sect was a respectable force—only it was far away. Seeing his disciple in such trouble, he bellowed in a low voice, "You brat, did you hit him?"

As he spoke he stared directly at Yang Kai; a shard of cold light flashed in his eyes and an invisible pressure pressed toward him.

Although he had taken a small loss earlier, after probing Yang Kai's true cultivation he was not afraid. He instinctively assumed the earlier method must have relied on a secret treasure. With Origin Returning Realm cultivation, to deal with someone of the Saint King Realm one naturally must seize the advantage by force.

"So what if I did?" Yang Kai grinned at him, utterly unconcerned by the pressure and wearing an air of casual indifference.

“Why did you strike him?” the red-haired cultivator demanded sharply.

"Why?" Yang Kai smiled faintly and glanced at the bruised man surnamed Hai. "Why don't you ask your own disciple?"

The red-haired cultivator frowned, casting a vicious glare at his disciple. In a deep voice, he said, “Speak—what exactly happened? If you were the ones at fault, don’t blame this old man for standing aside. But if someone dared to bully you by relying on power and influence… hmph, though my Haixin Sect has long dwelled within the Wuyou Sea, we are no soft persimmons for just anyone to squeeze.”

These words carried a subtle implication, and upon hearing them, the disciple surnamed Hai’s eyes lit up. At once, he put on an expression of utter misery, crying and sniffling pitifully as he wailed, “Senior Uncle, please judge fairly! We came here under your orders to find a suitable place to settle. After much searching, we finally discovered this fine spot and merely wished to discuss it with the local master, offering some Crystal Stones in exchange for a few quarters to reside in. Who would have thought this man to be so unreasonable—without a word, he struck first! Your disciple is ashamed, lacking in skill, and was captured after a few exchanges. Yet instead of letting the matter rest, he humiliated me and even forced me to speak words against my will! Your disciple is mortified beyond endurance—please, Senior Uncle, uphold justice!”

Yang Kai stared at the man surnamed Hai in astonishment, noting he showed no shame as he spoke with such conviction, acting as if grievously wronged.

Anger burned in his heart, but his face remained expressionless; he let out a cold, mirthless chuckle.

Hearing this, the red-haired elder's eyes flashed even colder. He growled, "Tell him that you are disciples of Haixin Sect!"

"I told him, but it was useless—he didn't regard our Haixin Sect at all," the Hai-surnamed man replied mournfully, embellishing the story, assuming that with a senior present they'd be untouchable.

"Fine, fine!" The red-haired elder drew a deep breath, abruptly turned to Yang Kai and thundered, "Boy, have you anything to say?"

"Nothing to say." Yang Kai shook his head slowly, his expression odd. "Your Haixin Sect's martial skills don't look like much, but your talent for turning black into white is first-rate—truly impressive!"

"How dare you insult my Haixin Sect!" the red-haired elder exploded, nearly lunging forward. He understood the forces around Tianyun City must have ties to Yingyue Hall, and with Yingyue Hall currently pressured and unable to act, disciplining this brat seemed feasible—Yingyue Hall would not intervene.

Then he could force the other to yield Dragon Lair Mountain without it being outright bullying; Yingyue Hall would have no grounds to object.

“You brought humiliation upon yourself—who else can you blame?” Yang Kai snorted coldly, fixing the man surnamed Hai with an icy stare. “Do you think I wouldn’t dare kill you?”

"Ah?" Hai discerned the killing intent in Yang Kai's eyes and his face changed.

"You dare!" The red-haired elder likewise sensed danger and roared, releasing his own momentum to envelop Yang Kai, aiming to restrain him and rescue his disciple.

Yang Kai glanced at him with contempt. With a slight flick of his fingers the golden threads shimmered and a faint hissing sound issued forth. They moved like the wind, utterly unaffected by the elder's force.

The Demon Blood Sect's secret technique could indeed break through opposing force, and the Golden Blood Yang Kai used for cultivation was incomparably stronger than the qi-and-blood power employed by those high-ups of the Demon Blood Sect—how could the red-haired elder's force stop it?

The golden threads sliced through Hai's body, shuttling back and forth a dozen times. When Yang Kai withdrew them, Hai still stood stunned, seemingly not yet understanding what had happened.

But the next moment his face changed as he looked down at his body and saw slender streams of blood spreading, then swelling into a savage surge that spurted like a fountain.

With a splattering sound like a mirror shattering, the warrior surnamed Hai collapsed, reduced to a ruin of flesh.

The stench of blood filled the air; the horrifying scene drained the faces of the other Haixin Sect disciples, and some timider women went pale and turned away to retch.

The red-haired elder's eyes flew wide in disbelief; he had not expected this brat to be so ruthless, to strike a killing blow without hesitation!

At first Yang Kai had no intention of taking a life—only to teach a lesson, to kill a chicken and scare the monkeys so outsiders would think twice about coveting Dragon Lair Mountain. But this Hai's lies and the elder's attitude stirred his killing intent.

He therefore saw no need to argue further; a mere Wuyou Sea faction he truly held in no regard.

After the warrior surnamed Hai's grisly death, the red-haired elder was furious. His hair bristled as his momentum soared; teeth clenched, he said each word between his teeth, "Boy, I will make you pay blood for blood!"

The one who had died was among Haixin Sect's most elite disciples—a loss that was by no means small. This time, he had been ordered to remain near Tianyun City to observe the movements of the Imperial Garden, and he had specifically brought that disciple along to temper and hone him. Who could have thought that before the training even began, the boy would die a miserable death here? Once he returned, even he himself might not escape punishment.

The Hai-surnamed warrior was the direct kin of a Great Elder within the sect!

"Dare be wanton on my Dragon Lair Mountain and no one will leave alive!" Yang Kai's expression hardened; killing one or killing many made no difference to him—indeed, the greater the slaughter the stronger the deterrent, preventing those who failed to know their place from repeatedly trying to seize Dragon Lair Mountain.

"Oh? What a lively scene here!" Just as Yang Kai and the red-haired elder were poised to go all out, a distant, startled voice rang out. In short order two streaks of light rushed over, and two powerful Divine Senses of the Origin Returning Realm spread to cover the area.

Sensing the newcomers' strength, the red-haired elder's expression tightened and he glanced over.

Yang Kai, however, raised a brow and showed a look of surprise mixed with comprehension.

"Senior Brother, Senior Brother Yang seems about to get into a fight," the first voice remarked. Immediately after came a gentle female voice.

"Mm, Senior Brother sees it, though I wonder which clueless fool dared provoke Dragon Lair Mountain—interesting indeed." The earlier male voice sounded a touch gleeful. The red-haired elder heard this and felt his heart lurch, wondering whether Dragon Lair Mountain could be provoked.

"Isn't this just a small force subordinate to Yingyue Hall?" The red-haired elder frowned, not a fool, and at once restrained his killing intent, his expression turning grave as he considered the matter.

In a moment the two streaks of light had drawn near; with their brilliance dimmed, the pair's true appearances were revealed.

One stood tall and imposing, an extraordinary presence with gleaming eyes; under his stare the red-haired elder felt uneasy, as if pricked by needles. The other was slender and graceful, gentle in expression, leaning close to the man like a bird clinging—intimately connected, clearly more than ordinary acquaintances.

When the woman touched down she scanned the surroundings with curious eyes.

Seeing Daiyuan standing behind Yang Kai, the woman cried with delight, "Sister Daiyuan, you're here too!"

"Xuan'er!" Daiyuan smiled and pressed her lips.
