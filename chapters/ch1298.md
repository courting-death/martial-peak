## Chapter 1298 — Sun's True Essence

The instant the three defensive Secret Treasures Yang Yan had custom-made for herself were shattered, Yang Yan could not help but cry out in alarm.

At that moment, a large hand came to rest on her shoulder and hauled her backward, while Yang Kai stepped forward to shield her. His expression was graver than ever. With a sweep of both hands, two coal-dark fireballs surged toward the advancing fire dragon.

The Demonic Flame, bound to its wielder’s will, turned into a chill, yin force — but the moment it clashed with the fire dragon, it was instantly erased, as if burned away.

Yang Kai's face changed. As he retreated, a faint birdlike trill issued from within his body. In the next instant, the Artifact Spirit swayed and darted forth. With a beat of its wings it became a crimson Fire Bird some dozen zhang long. It opened its beak and spewed a jet of red light, but it still could not halt the dragon's advance—on contact it was pounded to pieces by the dragon's assault and did no good.

The fire dragon seemed like a brutish ruffian; no matter how Yang Kai tried to fend it off, it could effortlessly tear through those defenses.

A humanlike expression flickered in the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit's eyes—fear—then suddenly a feral light rose within them. Its body whirled, shrinking greatly, and with a flash of its wings it turned into a streak of flame and plunged into the dragon's body.

Dragon roars and the Artifact Spirit's cries interwove, filling the secret cave with tumult.

When the Artifact Spirit rammed its whole body into the dragon it finally checked the beast's momentum, but only for a moment. The Artifact Spirit gave a mournful cry, burst from the dragon's flesh, and in a blink of an eye flashed away—vanishing into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai's complexion changed drastically.

He had long since refined and absorbed that Void King-Grade forging furnace and its Artifact Spirit, so of course he could sense the Artifact Spirit's present condition. That a Void King-Grade Artifact Spirit—born of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool's millennia of burning—would appear grievously wounded in its Yuan Qi startled him to the core.

The fire-type Spiritual Qi the Artifact Spirit contained had been concentrated and pure to the utmost; what, then, had that fire dragon been spawned from to inflict such an injury in a same-attribute duel?

Though the Artifact Spirit was injured, the fire dragon had been greatly weakened as well—its color dulled and its size markedly reduced. Yet it still reeled and charged toward Yang Kai as if possessed, determined to burn him and Yang Yan to cinders.

Yang Kai's expression, however, turned calm. A subtle spatial force rippled from within him. He thrust out both hands and clenched hard in the void, as if fastening two invisible gates. With a grit of his teeth, he ripped them apart.

A bottomless, all-consuming rift in space silently opened, widening as Yang Kai tore with both hands. In the span of a single breath the spatial rent grew much larger.

The fire dragon plunged headlong into the freshly formed rift.

The void trembled and space warped; the torn seam became dangerously unstable, as if it might collapse at any moment. Yang Kai issued a low shout and poured his comprehension of spatial power through his body, forcibly stabilizing the crack so it would not immediately shred apart.

After three breaths the dragon disappeared with a toss of head and tail into the rift. At the same time the seam split like glass, running with countless fractures before shattering.

Yang Kai stood where he was, gasping heavily. Yang Yan, whom he had dragged behind him, wore a face full of lingering fright.

But after surviving that ordeal, Yang Yan seemed to recall something. She stared at the odd stone, her beautiful eyes trembling violently, a hand covering her lips as she murmured, "Sun's True Essence?"

Yang Kai's face twitched, as if he had just heard something incredible; a burst of keen light flared in his eyes.

Strangely, after the fire dragon was swallowed by the spatial rift, the thing Yang Yan called the Sun's True Essence once more became plain and unremarkable—utterly ordinary. Yang Kai could not sense any scorching power emanating from it; it looked like any roadside rock, ignored wherever it lay.

There was no time to contemplate this. Yang Kai and Yang Yan had crept into this place on tiptoe; though two Corpse Soldiers had been trailing them, those two had shown no sign of attacking earlier.

But now that such a commotion had erupted, it likely roused many more sleeping Corpse Soldiers.

Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense. His face darkened as he confirmed his suspicions: many of the Corpse Soldiers that had been slumbering deep in the branching caverns had indeed awakened. Waves of Corpse Qi, some strong and some weak, were rapidly converging on their position.

At the same time, a suppressed, heavy roar came from the deeper underground—a cry like some ferocious beast, laced with thick murderous Violent Aura. When Yang Kai heard it, his mind wavered and a trace of savagery in his heart was almost tugged free; the whites of his eyes showed faint bloodshot threads.

The Corpse Soldiers rushing toward them seemed to take the roar as command. Each uttered a low howl from deep throats in response, their excitement spiking; their pace quickened as if drugged.

In an instant the entire underground rang with wails and snarls that chilled the scalp.

The two Corpse Soldiers who had been shadowing Yang Kai and Yang Yan now stepped into view at the secret cave's entrance. They bared their teeth and glared; the pair's fanged mouths glinted with a cold, eerie light.

Yang Yan's heart sank and her face drained of blood.

Yet those two Corpse Soldiers did not seem intent on attacking straight away. While staring at Yang Kai and Yang Yan, their gaze furtively flicked to the Sun's True Essence; their eyes brimmed with apprehension.

The once-plain Sun's True Essence suddenly pulsed with a stroke of terrifying, extreme fire-type Spiritual Qi the moment those two Corpse Soldiers revealed themselves. It did not pour forth, however—apparently it would not unleash unless the Corpse Soldiers approached.

Yang Kai rejoiced at sight of this. Hastily he reached out to seize the Sun's True Essence. A vast surge of Saint Yuan flowed from him and wrapped the sun-stone. Just as he was about to place it into his Spatial Ring, Yang Yan shouted hurriedly, "Don't!"

Yang Kai froze and knew at once something was amiss. A flicker of flame flashed across the Sun's True Essence and burned away the Divine Sense and Saint Yuan that had attached to Yang Kai. He staggered back two steps and stared at the stone in alarm.

He could not possibly stuff the Sun's True Essence into his Spatial Ring.

The two Corpse Soldiers at the entrance curled their lips into ugly grins. The female one taunted, "You dare trespass a Corpse Den and covet the Sun's True Essence? Wait till our Lords arrive—let's see what you'll do then."

The male Corpse Soldier mocked, “Looks like those two are about to become our new companions. Miss Lan, you might want to mind your tone — we could all be sharing the same chamber soon.”

The female scoffed coldly, "Why be polite? It will take at least a hundred years for them to open their awareness and fully turn into Corpse Soldiers. Who knows if they can even successfully convert? If they fail they'll just become food for you and me."

The male fell into a brief consideration, then nodded, "True. In that case there's no need to be courteous to them."

The pair bickered there, back and forth, while Yang Kai ignored them entirely. If they would not come in, there was no point wasting time eliminating them. The earlier commotion had already alerted the other Corpse Soldiers, and from their words it sounded as if a Corpse General-level presence was coming. The priority now was to find a way to take the Sun's True Essence and leave.

He glanced at Yang Yan and saw she too looked bewildered. His heart sank.

Yang Yan, naturally, knew ways to transport the Sun's True Essence, but those methods consumed great time and energy; relying on a Spatial Ring to carry it was plainly unrealistic. While she pondered, the low roar they had heard grew closer, and a terrifying pressure descended from above, engulfing the secret cave.

"Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!" Yang Kai's face shifted as he felt the oppressive might bearing down.

The situation differed greatly from what he and Yang Yan had estimated. They had thought that even if there were corpse generals here, their cultivation was no more than two thousand years—meaning at most Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm or lower.

But now a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm Corpse General had appeared, and seemed to be at its peak—only one step from becoming a Corpse King. How could Yang Kai not be shaken?

He realized the existence of this corpse pit likely accelerated that general's cultivation.

Yang Kai judged that no matter what tricks he employed, he could not hope to defeat such an expert, and he still had to protect Yang Yan.

Could they only retreat? Yang Kai stared at the Sun's True Essence, unwilling to accept defeat.

This was one of the most valuable treasures he had encountered—more valuable to him even than the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, second only to the Warm Spirit Lotus.

He had much Profound Yin Moon Water; if he could obtain the Sun's True Essence and harness its internal fire to assist in refining the Profound Yin Moon Water, the benefits would be incalculable.

The last time he refined Profound Yin Moon Water in the Earth-Lung Fire Pool he discovered doing so not only bolstered his bodily strength but also increased the power of his Demonic Flame and even raised his cultivation.

He could only pin his hopes on Yang Yan. If even she could not conceive a plan, he would have to temporarily withdraw.

He believed that even if the corpse generals were formidable, they would still be helpless against seizing this Sun's True Essence—otherwise it would not have lain unclaimed for so many years.
