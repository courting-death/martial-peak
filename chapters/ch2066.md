## Chapter 2066 — I Didn't Kill Him?

Under Zhang Ruoxi's terrified gaze, the white-robed man from the Jiang Family slowly revealed his figure.

At this moment, however, the First Stage Void King Realm cultivator wore a savage expression.

Anyone repeatedly outmaneuvered and nearly unable to catch someone despite a vast difference in strength would hardly be in a good mood.

He glanced up at the dead end ahead, and a low, weird chuckle escaped his lips; his mood suddenly brightened, the urgency draining away. Unhurriedly, step by step, he closed in on Zhang Ruoxi, saying, “Wretched wench, run then—let's see where you think you can go!”

Zhang Ruoxi pressed her body tight against the cave wall, her lovely eyes brimming with terror as she watched that figure inch closer, shaking her head again and again while her delicate body trembled.

Her fragile appearance did not earn her any pity; instead it stirred an even darker side of the white-robed man's heart, and his expression abruptly turned feverish—he even licked the corner of his mouth like a predator anticipating a feast.

The white-robed man fixed Zhang Ruoxi with a hawk-like stare, his gaze roaming over her petite yet ripening figure. A vulgar light flickered in his eyes, and a cold, obscene chuckle spilled from his lips.

“Don't… don't come near!” Zhang Ruoxi shook her head hard, curling herself into a ball and begging bitterly.

The white-robed man was unmoved; the short distance of just a dozen or so zhang was quickly closed.

When he was close enough, the white-robed man reached out and grabbed at Zhang Ruoxi.

At that moment, the softness and pleading in Zhang Ruoxi's eyes vanished in an instant. In their place surged determination and resolve; Saint Yuan surged, and she suddenly had a dagger-like blade in her hand. Power poured into it, and with an uplifted arm she thrust straight for the white-robed man's chest.

If their strengths had been equal, Zhang Ruoxi's strike would likely have had better than a fifty percent chance of succeeding.

But the gap between their cultivation levels was simply too great. Even though Zhang Ruoxi's timing had been flawless to the finest instant, the moment the Saint Yuan in her body surged out, the white-robed man had already activated his Domain Field.

The might of the Domain Field was something a girl of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm could not withstand.

Thus the dagger only managed to reach three cun from the white-robed man’s chest before an unseen force froze it in place; no matter how Zhang Ruoxi exerted herself, it would not move farther.

Zhang Ruoxi truly despaired then; she looked up at the face looming so close.

That face, which should have been at least passably handsome, now contorted into a demonic grin reminiscent of the Nine Nether Hells—twisted, mocking, and vicious.

Immediately, the white-robed man grabbed Zhang Ruoxi by the hair and slammed her head hard against the cave wall.

There was a dull thud…

Zhang Ruoxi felt her head reel; her skull ached unbearably and stars danced before her eyes.

“Wretched wench, you have some nerve, daring to ambush me!” the white-robed man sneered. “Fine—originally I intended to give you a quick death, but since you’re like this, don't blame this Lord for being ruthless.”

As he spoke, he reached out again, pinched Zhang Ruoxi's neck and lifted her up, slowly tightening his grip.

Zhang Ruoxi made choking sounds, her feet kicking wildly as she struggled, but she could not break free; her breathing grew labored, her long lashes fluttering as color drained from her vision.

Through the blur, Zhang Ruoxi thought she saw a figure racing toward them from far away, and by the dim light of the mine tunnel she realized it was the man she had longed for—Sir Yang!

His face was stricken with anxiety, but for some reason his features were twisted, horrifically distorted as if with fury.

Great-grandmother had once said that before death strange illusions could appear; perhaps this too was one of those hallucinations?

Thinking this, her strength ebbed rapidly and Zhang Ruoxi slowly closed her beautiful eyes.

But at that moment a shaft of dazzling golden light shot over from that direction, instantly dispersing the tunnel's gloom.

The next instant, accompanied by a muffled grunt, the hand clamped around her throat suddenly loosened; freed from its hold, her body fell to the ground.

Before she hit the ground, Zhang Ruoxi somehow found a burst of strength, gripped the dagger, crouched down and hurled herself forward.

To her astonishment, the dagger slid perfectly into the white-robed man's chest; when she pulled it free, warm blood sprayed across her face, the sticky heat making her shudder.

She was dazed for a moment, but forced herself to stifle her fear and raised the dagger again, stabbing wildly at the white-robed man.

Thuk, thuk, thuk…

Each plunge drove the blade almost to the hilt; the blood gushing from the wounds soon drenched her, turning her into a blood-soaked figure.

Only when the white-robed man stared with bulging eyes and collapsed in disbelief did Zhang Ruoxi come fully awake, staring at the corpse on the ground, unable to comprehend what had happened for a long while.

She could not understand how such a powerful man could have been killed by her frantic stabbing…

“Ruoxi…” a low voice called from not far away.

Zhang Ruoxi shuddered and lifted her gaze, only to see Yang Kai standing just three zhang away, a guilty look on his face as he watched her in silence.

“Sir?” Zhang Ruoxi nearly could not believe her eyes and cried out in a high, surprised voice.

Afraid the figure before her might be an illusion, she hastily wiped her eyes—forgetting that both her hands were covered in blood; the smear turned her vision red and made the sight all the more terrifying.

Now she seemed to come back to herself, staring at her bloodstained hands; with a start she threw the dagger away, her body trembling violently.

Seeing this, Yang Kai flashed to Zhang Ruoxi’s side, gently taking her wrist and calling softly, “Ruoxi, are you alright?”

Zhang Ruoxi slowly lifted her head; her once-clear eyes were now stained with blood. When she confirmed the man before her truly was Yang Kai and not some dying hallucination, beads of tears poured from her eyes like broken pearls.

Her feelings of grievance erupted; her shoulders heaved as she sobbed, “Si…r, Ruoxi ki…killed… someone… I killed… someone… Sir, save me!”

Yang Kai watched her quietly, his brow drawing into a slight frown.

He could plainly see that Zhang Ruoxi's mind had suffered a terrible shock.

That shock did not stem merely from being chased by the white-robed man or from the near-death escape, but from the fact that someone had died by her hand!

Even though that man was vile to begin with—he had even tried to take her life—when he was truly stabbed full of holes by her own hand, Zhang Ruoxi still could not bear it.

Thinking it over, Yang Kai understood.

Zhang Ruoxi was only sixteen or seventeen, still in the bloom of youth, raised and pampered in the Zhang Family; although she cultivated, she had likely never faced life-and-death combat, let alone killed someone with her own hands.

To a girl like her, any human life was supremely precious.

Now, however, a living soul had died beneath her dagger, and for a time she simply could not bring herself to accept it.

Yang Kai recalled his own first kill and how it had left him shaken; that fear and unease lingered for a long time until, after killing many more, it faded into nothing.

But Zhang Ruoxi was different—the white-robed man was likely the first person to die by her hand!

Thinking this, Yang Kai sighed, drew Zhang Ruoxi into his arms, and gently patted her shoulder, speaking softly to soothe her: “He wasn’t killed by you—he died by my hand. By the time you thrust the dagger, his breath had already ceased.”

Zhang Ruoxi's trembling body steadied somewhat at his words; she lifted her head and asked timidly, “Really?”

“Really,” Yang Kai said, and as he spoke he made a motion; a thread of Golden Blood Threads suddenly shot up from the corpse and wound around his fingertips. “This is what I used to kill him.”

“I didn’t kill him?” Zhang Ruoxi stared blankly at the Golden Blood Threads. The terror in her beautiful eyes slowly ebbed, and a look of relief—like a great weight lifting—softened her features.

“It wasn’t you who killed him. Sleep well—when you wake, everything will be fine.” As Yang Kai spoke softly, he lightly stirred his Origin Qi, guiding it into Zhang Ruoxi’s body to soothe the turmoil of her Qi and blood.

Perhaps from the easing of her burden, or from exhaustion, Zhang Ruoxi really did slump into Yang Kai's arms and closed her beautiful eyes, her breath settling into a gentle rhythm.

Once she had truly fallen asleep, Yang Kai exhaled softly and lifted her into his arms.

Swish, swish, swish…

A sound of something slicing through the air came from not far off. Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and sent out Divine Sense; upon detecting the newcomer was Mo Xiaoqi, he waited where he was.

Soon, Mo Xiaoqi appeared a short distance away from Yang Kai.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat chittered and leapt onto Mo Xiaoqi's shoulder.

Mo Xiaoqi glanced at Yang Kai, then at the gore-covered corpse on the ground, and at Zhang Ruoxi cradled in Yang Kai's arms, and asked, “Is this Ruoxi?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Is she all right?”

"She'll be fine—arriving in time made all the difference. She’s just exhausted and has fallen asleep."

“Good.” Mo Xiaoqi patted her chest and let out a breath of relief, though anger soon flamed in her eyes as she ground her teeth: “The Jiang Family are truly despicable. Brother Yang, I’ve already found out what's been happening here—they dared to abduct and force those scattered cultivators to secretly mine resources for them. They’re scum!”

“I've heard a thing or two about this,” Yang Kai said, cold light flashing in his eyes and his expression turning grim as a low, cruel smile formed on his lips: “The Jiang Family dares to silence witnesses… very well. Let them wait.”
