## Chapter 221 — A Dangerous Situation (Part Four)

In this realm, there was no place that was absolutely safe. Yang Kai could only conceal his figure as much as possible, suppress his aura, and cover up the traces he left behind to avoid exposing his whereabouts.

Hiding in a hollow of a withered tree, he kept an eye on his surroundings while absorbing and refining the energy from the blood beads.

In the past few days, he had collected about twenty blood beads, more than half of which were formed from the remains of third-tier Demonic Beasts, with a few from fourth-tier Demonic Beasts. Additionally, there were the blood beads obtained from killing three warriors of the Golden Light Palace just moments ago.

Based on their size, it was easy to distinguish the grade of the blood beads.

The blood beads from fourth-tier Demonic Beasts were about the size of peas, while those from third-tier Demonic Beasts were half that size. In contrast, the blood beads from the three Separation and Union Realm warriors were as large as a thumb.

Taking out a blood bead from a third-tier Demonic Beast, Yang Kai held it in the palm of his hand and silently operated the True Yang Technique.

As his Primordial Qi stirred, Yang Kai clearly felt a pure and flawless energy surge into his body from his palm, flowing into his meridians without stopping in his Dantian, directly absorbed by his Proud Bone Golden Body.

Before he could complete a full cycle of the True Yang Technique, the blood bead vanished, entirely transformed into his own power.

Yang Kai was astonished. Although he had heard Ling Taixu mention that the blood beads obtained in this place could be easily refined and absorbed without any concerns, he never expected it would be this effortless.

The energy within the blood bead contained not a single useless element; it was as pure as a pearl or dew, requiring no refining—just absorption was sufficient.

No wonder Ling Taixu had praised the blood beads that appeared in this place so highly. If one possessed a large number of blood beads, their strength would surely soar like a meteor. Except for needing personal comprehension during major breakthroughs, minor realm advancements would be completely unobstructed.

Any warrior who had absorbed the energy from blood beads would likely find it irresistible. To become stronger and to advance, they would not let any living creature pass by, whether human or Demonic Beast. In the eyes of the strong in this place, everyone was merely a blood bead.

Such a rare opportunity to absorb energy without worry was hard to come by. Apart from this unique place that could give birth to blood beads, there was no other location in the world.

Taking a deep breath and calming his mind, Yang Kai took out all the blood beads and held them in his palm, operating the True Yang Technique once more.

A massive surge of pure energy flowed from his palm. In an instant, it filled his meridians to the brim. This energy continuously emerged from the blood beads in his hand, surged into his body, and was absorbed by his Proud Bone Golden Body at an almost indescribable speed.

The blood beads in his palm decreased one by one, rapidly transforming into Yang Kai's capital.

He could clearly feel himself growing stronger bit by bit. Moreover, his Separation and Union Realm third layer was nearing saturation.

When only two blood beads remained in his palm, an invisible aura suddenly expanded outward from Yang Kai, causing the energy in the surrounding world to become chaotic.

Advancing without obstruction, he had already reached the fourth layer of the Separation and Union Realm without any hindrance.

However, Yang Kai did not feel any joy; his expression darkened. Cursing inwardly, he did not stop and continued to frantically absorb the energy from the remaining blood beads.

Moments later, the two blood beads disappeared. The realm he had just advanced to quickly stabilized.

In a hurry, he got up and, without a moment's hesitation, swiftly left his previous hiding spot.

Although he had anticipated that there would be some commotion during his advancement, Yang Kai did not expect the disturbance to be so pronounced in this tranquil alien land.

If someone had been nearby just now, they would have definitely noticed. Staying any longer would only lead to being targeted.

After running for more than ten miles, Yang Kai did not dare to stop. Instead, a faint sense of unease surged within him. He felt as if someone was watching him, yet when he scanned his surroundings, he could find no trace.

This feeling was not unfounded. Yang Kai speculated that either the person watching him was very powerful, making it impossible for him to detect their presence, or someone was tracking him from behind and had not yet caught up.

The latter possibility seemed more likely! After all, if a true expert were watching him, there was no reason for them to remain hidden and waste time.

What terrible luck!

But there was nothing he could do about it. Yang Kai felt that he could not remain stagnant here forever. With only the strength of the third layer of the Separation and Union Realm, although he had not felt any immediate danger, if he encountered a true expert, he would surely be unable to escape. Every advancement would inevitably create some disturbance, an unavoidable drawback.

After running several dozen more miles, the feeling of being watched became increasingly pronounced, sending a chill down his spine.

Suddenly, his steps halted, and Yang Kai's face turned ashen.

He sensed a wave of Primordial Qi fluctuations coming from behind a large tree ahead, and the other party had no intention of hiding, openly waiting for him to walk into their trap.

He had been outmaneuvered! The speed of this person was astonishing!

The visitor was not friendly. Yang Kai had no idea which sect's disciple he had encountered, nor did he know the strength of his opponent, so he naturally did not dare to act recklessly.

"Hehehe..." A sinister, cold laugh echoed as a figure slowly emerged from behind the tree.

Upon a closer look, Yang Kai felt an urge to spit blood.

This person was actually a disciple of the Ghost King Valley!

Three individuals from the Ghost King Valley had come this time, all of whom were experts in the True Essence Realm. One of them, named Jin Hao, had repeatedly threatened Yang Kai, determined to kill him. The other was a woman, and the one before him was the third disciple of the Ghost King Valley!

What a stroke of bad luck! How could he run into a disciple of this sect?

If it were anyone else, there might be some room for negotiation, but since it was someone from the Ghost King Valley, there was no hope for resolution. Gui Li had specifically instructed them to kill Yang Kai.

Yang Kai naturally wanted to eliminate them as well, but the timing was terribly unfavorable. He had only just entered a few days ago, and his realm had only just advanced by one layer. How could he possibly defeat such enemies?

One of them alone was enough to take him down, let alone three.

A dangerous situation!

"Haha, look who it is!" The Ghost King Valley disciple, Yu Chengkun, was also greatly surprised, his eerie gaze sizing up Yang Kai with delight and arrogance. "So it's the little brat from Lingxiao Pavilion. What a stroke of luck to find you here without any effort."

He clearly did not expect that the person he had cornered would be Yang Kai, a true twist of fate.

Yang Kai's face darkened as he glared at him, no longer daring to stay. With a flicker of his figure, he attempted to escape from the side.

His self-created footwork was indeed an excellent choice for escaping. With a burst of Primordial Qi, he could cover several hundred zhang in a single leap, and his speed was incredibly fast. Warriors of the same level could not catch up to him.

However, just as Yang Kai leaped twice, a cacophony of ghostly wails and howls erupted, followed by a pale, large hand descending towards him.

"Hahaha... Little brat from Lingxiao Pavilion, we truly are fated!" Amidst the laughter, Jin Hao's figure revealed itself, his hand resembling a ghostly claw, harboring a chilling killing intent.

Yang Kai's expression darkened. He raised his hand and unleashed a Flame Yang Explosion.

As fists and claws collided, Jin Hao snorted coldly, channeling his True Essence, his fingers sharp as blades.

With three muffled thuds, Yang Kai was sent flying backward, his face paling mid-air as he struggled to suppress the rolling blood in his chest, stumbling to the ground.

Jin Hao was likely at the fourth layer of the True Essence Realm, making him the strongest among the three disciples of the Ghost King Valley. Yang Kai was simply no match for such an opponent. He suffered a significant loss after just one exchange.

As he landed, Yang Kai had no time to catch his breath when a chilling wind swept in from behind. He hurriedly dashed forward, but a ripping sound came from his back as his clothes were torn apart, nearly leaving him exposed.

"Quick reflexes!" Jin Hao did not attack again but instead crossed his arms, leisurely observing Yang Kai with a mocking gaze.

Glancing back, Yang Kai noticed that the female disciple from the Ghost King Valley had also appeared, the one who had just ambushed him from behind.

The three of them formed a tight encirclement around Yang Kai.

These three were not like the three disciples from the Golden Light Palace. Yang Kai could easily kill those three, but he did not dare to underestimate these three.

"Kid, how do you want to die?" Jin Hao looked at Yang Kai with a smug expression. Previously, during the journey to Ghostly Underworld Mountain, he had suffered a great loss at Yang Kai's hands, nearly losing his life to the attack of the Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python, thus he held a deep grudge against him.

Now that this kid was surrounded by his senior brother and sister, he could not escape even if he had wings. He was in no hurry to take Yang Kai's life; sometimes, torturing and humiliating an enemy was far more satisfying than simply killing them.

Yu Chengkun laughed, "Senior Brother, how about we chop off his limbs and let him bleed to death?"

Jin Hao slowly shook his head, "No, that's too merciful. I say we refine him into a ghost slave, ensuring he can never be reborn, reduced to a slave of our Ghost King Valley!"

Yu Chengkun frowned, "But this kid's strength is too low; turning him into a ghost slave wouldn't be very useful."

Hearing the two deliberately intimidate Yang Kai, the female disciple of the Ghost King Valley grew impatient and said, "Just kill him. What’s the point of wasting time? Killing him will at least yield a blood bead."

Jin Hao and Yu Chengkun quickly smiled in agreement, "Since Junior Sister says to kill him, then let’s kill him."

With that, Jin Hao stepped toward Yang Kai, his face filled with ruthlessness and coldness. "Kid, dying quickly is also a kind of blessing. Don’t forget to thank me when you reach the Ghostly Underworld!"

Yang Kai sneered, "You can talk big after you kill me!"

As he spoke, his figure flashed, charging directly at the female disciple of the Ghost King Valley.

He had observed for a long time and knew that among the three, this woman had the lowest strength. Perhaps it was due to her vanity or her high status that Jin Hao and Yu Chengkun treated her with respect. Therefore, she was definitely a breakthrough point.

If Yang Kai wanted to break through, the best method was to use the Wings of Yang Flame. Although True Essence Realm warriors could fly, they were certainly not as swift and convenient as the Wings of Yang Flame. However, this place was fraught with danger, and if he truly used the Wings of Yang Flame to soar into the air, his conspicuous wings would only attract attention. Thus, unless absolutely necessary, Yang Kai did not want to use the Wings of Yang Flame.
