## Chapter 1761 — Tail-Crested Snake

Luo Lan's movements were careful and swift; since she could not determine what kind of peril that place concealed, she dared not stay there long.

As Luo Lan wrapped the corpse of that Void King Realm expert and retreated, Ni Guang reached out toward that cockscomb-like spiritual flower.

At that moment, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

Behind Ni Guang, a patch of the once-flat ground suddenly bulged upward. In the next instant, a flat, triangular snake head thrust out from the raised earth and, aiming straight for Ni Guang’s neck, struck like lightning.

The whole process was so rapid there had been no warning; the instant the head that had burst from the ground lunged at Ni Guang, Xue Yue went pale and cried, "Uncle Ni, be careful."

No sooner had she finished speaking than the snake head clamped down on Ni Guang's neck.

Xue Yue's face changed drastically at once.

Seeing that, she knew all too well how that Void King Realm had died before: clearly, when his attention had been drawn to that cockscomb-like flower, the snake hidden behind had seized the chance to launch a fatal sneak attack.

She did not know whether Ni Guang could handle it; from what she saw now, he had taken the blow.

But Ni Guang was Ni Guang—besides his deep cultivation, he would not have come unprepared knowing this place was dangerous; he had already been on guard while trying to gather the flower, especially protecting the back of his neck, so this sneak strike was destined to fail.

A crisp "ding" rang out; a halo-like ring of energy suddenly shimmered at Ni Guang's nape, and under that strike he seemed struck by a tremendous force, hurtling forward.

He gave a low shout, twisted his body in midair, lashed a palm toward his rear, and with the other hand still reached for the flower.

A counter strike from a Second Stage of the Void King Realm was not to be underestimated. The fierce force sent the attacking snake head snapping back, unable to continue its assault.

But the moment Ni Guang grasped the flower, his complexion shifted sharply as he exclaimed, "This is..."

He felt an unfamiliar texture from the blossom; it was by no means like gathering a spiritual herb, but like clutching something cold and slick—as if he had seized a living thing.

He let go without hesitation.

At that instant, the fragrant flower abruptly changed: it shot up from the ground, the entire blossom emitting a greenish glow as it lunged into Ni Guang's palm.

In moments the ground exploded with flying sand and stone, and from within came Ni Guang's low snorts and the hissing sounds of a snake.

After a short while, Ni Guang leapt clear of the fighting circle and hovered in the air, his expression extremely grave.

Yang Kai and the others looked on with astonishment.

When the dust settled they finally understood what the trap had been.

At the spot where the cockscomb-shaped spirit flower had been, there was now no sign of any blossom—only a yellow-brown demonic serpent about three zhang long and as thick as an infant’s arm, coiled upright with its body, flicking its tongue in and out without cease.

The demonic snake gave off no discernible aura; unless one saw it with the naked eye, one would not notice it—it seemed almost not alive. At its tail a cockscomb-like fleshy tumor had grown.

The flower everyone had seen was the illusion caused by its body hidden underground with its tail left on the surface.

Anyone who tried to lay hands on the spiritual flower would inevitably be attacked by it.

"Tail-Crested Snake?" Ni Guang's eyes brightened as he called out the beast's name.

He knew of it because of his broad learning and high standing in the Hengluo Commerce Guild, which had given him access to many ancient records; otherwise it would have been impossible to recognize such a bizarre beast that had only existed long ago.

Luo Lan frowned and regarded Ni Guang with some admiration. "I have not heard of it," she said. "This Lost Realm contains so many things already gone from the world."

The black shape they had encountered earlier in the subterranean fissure—no one had known what it was; they only felt it was somewhat like a Yin-Soul yet entirely different. The Tail-Crested Snake now appearing was something the other three had never even heard of.

The Lost Realm unfolded before them like an uncanny world they had never encountered.

Ni Guang gave a short laugh. "Don't worry. Although the Tail-Crested Snake is dangerous, its strength is not great; its prowess lies in hiding and ambush. Now that its sneak attack has failed, it will be this old man's prey."

Saying so, he charged straight at the Tail-Crested Snake.

He did not employ any formidable secret technique, merely closed to its side and with claw-like hands began to tussle with the snake.

Yang Kai watched quietly and estimated the beast at about Ninth-Tier. Such a level could not stir much against Ni Guang. Despite its ancient bloodline, within about ten breaths the snake that had sprung up to bite him was grabbed, and Ni Guang, like cracking a long whip, gave it a violent shake while pouring Saint Yuan fiercely into its body.

A series of crisp cracking sounds came from the snake's long body, and then it went limp and lay down, dead.

Ni Guang reached in and hooked a finger into its belly, plucking out an oval, jade-green gall the size of a longan, swallowed it down, smacking his lips and laughing happily.

What strange divine effect the Tail-Crested Snake's gall possessed was unknown, but Ni Guang looked pleased, so it likely benefited him.

Having finished, he casually tossed the corpse aside and said dryly, "This sort of demonic beast has no Inner Core; the most valuable thing on it is the snake gall. In ancient times warriors who took it long-term were said to be immune to toxin. Pity there is only one... better than nothing."

He then stepped back to the corpse Luo Lan had retrieved, looked down and sighed, "Ah, it really is Tong Lei!"

He was evidently referring to the name of the corpse before them.

"Senior Ni knows him?" Luo Lan asked.

Ni Guang nodded slightly. "I met him once; years ago he made a deal with me. That was long ago—never expected he'd end up dead by the jaws of a Ninth-Tier demon beast. In a place like this one must not be careless."

Under ordinary circumstances a Void King Realm expert would not die to a Ninth-Tier demonic beast; a Ninth-Tier was only comparable to an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, and once a Void King Realm set off its Domain, a Ninth-Tier could not even approach. Yet in this Lost Realm, a Ninth-Tier could not be taken lightly.

"Xue Yue, take the ring off," Ni Guang said calmly.

Xue Yue complied, bent and removed the Spatial Ring from Tong Lei, then put it away without checking what was inside.

Yang Kai and Luo Lan said nothing.

Yang Kai was weak and had not helped, so he had no right to claim spoils; as for Luo Lan, Ni Guang had already warned her—though she had accompanied him he could not guarantee she would gain anything, so she could not blame his actions now.

"Let's go. From now on be cautious; do not approach anything that seems strange," Ni Guang warned, then prepared to depart.

"Wait a moment, you three," Yang Kai suddenly seemed to remember, and at the same time shot out a strand of Golden Blood Threads from his hand toward the corpse of the Tail-Crested Snake.

The three halted and watched oddly, not knowing what Yang Kai intended.

The Golden Blood Threads instantly sank into the snake's carcass. From within came writhing sounds, and the body seemed to be drained; its flesh and blood withered until only a skin remained.

After a moment the Golden Blood Threads, glowing gold and red, retracted back into Yang Kai's hand.

Ni Guang regarded the threads in Yang Kai's palm with interest and asked suspiciously, "Boy, is that a secret art... or a secret treasure?"

He felt a strange fluctuation from the Golden Blood Threads. They appeared like a Secret Treasure yet emitted an unusually rich pulse of qi and blood, and seemed like a living thing—extremely uncanny.

"Somewhere between a secret art and a secret treasure," Yang Kai smiled and offered a casual explanation.

The Golden Blood Threads were condensed from his own golden blood. Strictly speaking it was a secret art, but it possessed the properties of a Secret Treasure and could be repeatedly retracted for use, making it hard to categorize.

“How strange.” Ni Guang slowly shook his head. In all his years, he had never seen such a bizarre secret art. Yet the world was vast and full of wonders, so he didn’t bother to dwell on it. After all, though that strand of golden blood thread seemed quite formidable, it posed no real threat to him. After a moment’s thought, he asked again, “Since this thing can devour the blood and flesh essence of the Tail-Crested Serpent, could it undergo some kind of change?”

"It can," Yang Kai grinned, and with a movement of Divine Sense the thread coiling in his hand twisted and reshaped itself into the form of a Tail-Crested Snake.

The Tail-Crested Snake fashioned from the Golden Blood Threads was identical to the one they had seen before, the only difference being its color: the living snake had been earth-yellow, but Yang Kai's was streaked with gold and red.

"It can imitate form?" Ni Guang's eyes lit. "Do you mean your art is now essentially a Tail-Crested Snake?"

"More or less," Yang Kai nodded, then sheathed the Golden Blood Threads.

What he had done belonged to the Golden Blood Threads' path of transformation—the domain of the Blood Beast!

The Golden Blood Threads could devour a demonic beast's essence and take on its former appearance and capabilities. That was the Blood Beast, a supremely powerful secret art.

The originator of the Golden Blood Threads technique had been a genius, but neither he nor the later practitioners of the Demon Blood Sect managed to develop the art widely, for they could not refine many threads within their bodies. Even the sect's beautiful matriarch expended every effort, even resorting to the Yang-Gathering to Replenish Yin Technique, and after a lifetime of toil could only refine two Demon Blood Threads.
