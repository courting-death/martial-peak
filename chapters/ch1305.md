## Chapter 1305 — Handling

On the way, Shen Shitao finally remembered to inquire about Yang Kai’s background. After probing indirectly for a while, she learned that Yang Kai was not a disciple of Yingyue Hall, nor of any great family — instead, he lived on a small mountain called Dragon Lair Mountain, giving off the impression of someone ruling his own little domain.

In short, Yang Kai was a lone cultivator with no sect, no backing, and no patron—one of the many who rely solely on their own efforts. In any place there are countless such practitioners. They suffer in their cultivation: without a famed master to guide them they often go astray, without good training environments or resources their progress is slow, and if they are bullied there is no one to stand up for them. As a rule, these wanderers have little future. Though numerous, very few truly ascend, and those who do are invariably poached by major sects and clans.

For someone like Yang Kai to have reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm already was no small feat.

So when this came to light, Shen Shitao grew greatly impressed by Yang Kai, while Wang Yuhan wore a look of disdain; in his view Yang Kai's life would likely end here—perhaps he might reach the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, but could never set foot into the Origin Returning Realm.

Not only was Shen Shitao unusually admiring of Yang Kai, even her brother Shen Fanlei showed strong interest. The youth was likable: straightforward, full of vigor and spirit, still the same despite his injuries. He peppered Yang Kai with eager questions about what had happened in Flowing Flame Sandland. Yang Kai mentioned a few trivial finds, and Shen Fanlei listened with relish, asking timely, pointed questions.

After traveling together, the atmosphere surprisingly relaxed; among the four in the party, aside from Wang Yuhan—who irked Yang Kai somewhat—the other three were easy to get along with.

Half a day later, the six of them finally left Zangxiong Valley. Up to that moment, Yang Kai had not detected any sign of those strange beings from the Corpse Den pursuing them, which made him breathe a sigh of relief — it seemed this matter had, for now, come to an end.

Another day on, they came upon a small mountain range, within which rose several peaks. Though the Spiritual Qi was not especially dense, it was by no means thin. Seeing this, Yang Kai paused and, bowing slightly to Shen Shitao and the others, said, "Friends, I don't know where you intend to go next, but let us part ways here for the moment. My companion and I have matters to attend to and must stay here for a few days."

"Stay a few days?" Shen Shitao's eyes lit up. "Perfect—we wanted to rest a bit as well. You saw how Fanlei and Senior Brother Wang haven't properly recuperated since their injuries. Why not all take a break here?"

"You mean you will rest here as well?" Yang Kai's brow twitched.

"What, does Brother Yang not welcome us?" Shen Shitao complained playfully.

"Not at all. This range isn't mine—it's unclaimed land. Anyone may use it."

"That's good." Shen Shitao smiled. "Since Brother Yang came from Tianyun City, you'll be returning there eventually, won't you?"

"Yes, of course."

"Hee hee, this place isn't close to Tianyun City. If you rely on your Star Shuttle, it'll still take at least two or three months. If something delays you on the way, it could take even longer."

Yang Kai regarded her thoughtfully. "Does Miss Shen have any good method to shorten that time?"

"What method would I have but to use a Space Array?" Shen Shitao explained. "There is a Space Array in Black Crow City, five days from here, that leads straight to Tianyun City. Brother Yang might not know of it."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai turned to Yang Yan, only to find her looking bewildered—she clearly didn't know about it either.

"Do you think I'd lie?" Shen Shitao smiled. "Black Crow City is an unclaimed city, not under any major power. The Space Array there isn't inspected as strictly as those owned by big forces, but it's not open to everyone. However, Fanlei seems to know a senior who watches over that Space Array; with his word it should be fine for Brother Yang to use it—though it requires a fair number of Saint Crystals as payment."

"Saint Crystals are no problem. If it gets us there, that's enough." Yang Kai brightened and glanced toward Shen Fanlei.

Shen Fanlei grinned. "Don't worry, Brother Yang. I once helped that senior who guards the Space Array with a small favor. He'll make an exception. Besides, Brother Yang isn't someone unknown; that'll help."

"Very well, I'll owe you for that, Brother Shen." Yang Kai thanked him, then looked at the cluster of peaks below. "Let's stay here a few days and finish our tasks before heading to Black Crow City together."

Shen Shitao and the others had no objections and promptly flew toward the mountain range.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying had not been wounded in the battle with the Silver Night Thunder Beast, but their Saint Yuan had been heavily depleted and they had had little chance to recuperate. Shen Fanlei and Wang Yuhan needed to heal their injuries quickly. The four chose one of the peaks, flew to it, and soon vanished from sight.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan flew to a more remote peak.

After a short while they arrived. Yang Kai immediately stirred his Saint Yuan and opened a temporary dwelling inside the mountain.

With Yang Kai's current realm this was trivial: in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea a crude stone abode took form.

Once inside, Yang Kai's face turned solemn. Yang Yan sensed something amiss and followed him in silence.

They walked to the innermost chamber before Yang Kai suddenly sat cross-legged.

"Has Xiaoxiao run into trouble?" Yang Yan asked anxiously.

After the Stone Puppet devoured that Sun's True Essence, Yang Kai had stored it away. Yang Yan did not know the puppet's current state, but Yang Kai's decision to remain here surely had to do with it.

"It's not a fatal problem, but if things continue like this the Stone Puppet won't hold up," Yang Kai sighed.

"I suspected as much. Even if you didn't say it I would have kept you here a few days to first deal with Xiaoxiao and the Sun's True Essence." Yang Yan said, then took from her Spatial Ring some items she had refined and began arranging things in the stone chamber.

The Sun's True Essence was a matter of consequence; she did not dare be careless. Before bringing the Stone Puppet out they had to set up safeguards, lest any leakage of its aura draw trouble.

With her mastery of formations, erecting aura-isolating seals was effortless. Within half a day the stone abode was enveloped in layer after layer of invisible seals—so thorough that even an expert from the Origin Returning Realm could not peer inside.

Only then did Yang Kai wave his hand and release the Stone Puppet from the Black Book Space.

The moment the puppet appeared the temperature within the stone abode climbed sharply. The puppet itself glowed an infernal crimson, its body radiating heat strong enough to blur sight, and parts of its form showed signs of melting.

Pain contorted the puppet's face; its eyes were blazing red.

The Sun's True Essence's savage heat was beyond what it could withstand. That the Stone Puppet had lasted this long was entirely due to its extraordinary nature.

Seeing this, Yang Kai acted without hesitation. He produced the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform and its biting chill spread, instantly neutralizing the chamber's heat and restoring normalcy.

Yang Kai poured another stream of Saint Yuan into the Stone Puppet. As if obeying some command, it wavered to its feet, opened its mouth, and expelled the Sun's True Essence, which fell squarely onto the ice platform and lay there unmoving.

Only then did Yang Kai relax. He beckoned the puppet over and examined it carefully.

To Yang Kai's relief, though the puppet bore some injuries they were not grave. With rest it should recover—this eased his mind and increased his appreciation for the puppet's potential.

He sent a Divine Sense to it, instructing it to refine the rare ores in its belly to mend itself, and then stored the Stone Puppet away again.

In the Corpse Den the puppet had swallowed the equivalent of seven or eight small mountains' worth of Saint Crystals and rare ores. Whether the Saint Crystals affected it was uncertain, but the rare ores would aid its growth. Yang Kai would not be stingy; once the puppet absorbed the ores' essence it ought to be fine.

Securing a single Sun's True Essence was worth more than any number of ores.

With the puppet's affairs settled, Yang Kai turned to Yang Yan. "How shall we handle this? If the Stone Puppet cannot hold the Sun's True Essence for long, we cannot bring it back to Dragon Lair Mountain."

"Forge a special container." Yang Yan seemed prepared. She answered calmly.

"What material will you need?"

"Something of the ice family. This Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform is the best material. Don't worry—I have a method, though forging it will be troublesome and will take at least ten days."

"Ten days... that's acceptable—the others won't heal overnight anyway." Yang Kai smiled faintly and stood. He handed the four Spatial Rings he had collected from the Corpse Den to Yang Yan; their storage should be sufficient for her to forge the special container.

Not wishing to disturb her further, Yang Kai stepped outside and sat cross-legged in the outer chamber.

After pondering, he summoned his Void King-Grade tempering furnace and probed its interior with his Divine Sense, surprised and pleased by what he found.

Earlier, when retrieving the Sun's True Essence, Yang Kai had briefly used the Artifact Spirit, but it had proven somewhat incapable against the Solar True Fire and had been injured.
