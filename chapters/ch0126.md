## Chapter 126 — Lan Chudie

Yang Kai landed in what appeared to be a rocky outcrop, surrounded by stone pillars of varying thickness and height, some towering dozens of zhang high while others stood merely at a person's height. The ground was littered with rubble and sand.

Sensing the surroundings, Yang Kai's expression brightened. He discovered that the energy of heaven and earth here was indeed extraordinarily rich, incomparable to the outside world.

If he could meditate and cultivate in this place, the efficiency would undoubtedly be three to four times greater than outside.

However, this was merely an Inheritance Celestial Cave, and no one would choose to cultivate here when there were unknown treasures to be found.

Su Mu was not with him! There were no other people around, indicating that everyone must have dispersed upon entering.

Just as he was concentrating on his surroundings, a figure suddenly appeared about ten zhang away. This person, much like Yang Kai when he entered, materialized in mid-air several zhang high before landing gracefully.

After steadying herself, she glanced around and quickly spotted Yang Kai not far away.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise, “It’s you!”

“Ah, what a coincidence!” The woman responded with delight, hurrying over to Yang Kai.

This woman was a disciple he had encountered earlier at the Black Wind Trading Market, where she had sold him seeds.

As fellow sect members, their meeting here was indeed a stroke of fate.

“Are you the only one here?” she asked.

“Yeah, I just arrived,” Yang Kai nodded.

“With so many people entering together, I wonder where they’ve all ended up. Should we wait here a bit longer to see if anyone else lands nearby? Then we can act together?” she suggested.

“Sounds good!” Yang Kai agreed without objection. This place was fraught with danger, and having an extra person would provide more strength. Although this would mean sharing the spoils, it was crucial to prioritize survival in such a strange location. They could always act alone later if the situation permitted.

After reaching an agreement, the two stood in place and waited.

Before long, three more people landed nearby. Among them, only one was a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion; the other two were from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower.

The five gathered together. In this unique place, the distinctions between sects were not as pronounced, and they interacted quite harmoniously.

After waiting a moment longer, no one else appeared.

The woman spoke again, “How about we explore while keeping an eye out for any other stragglers? What do you all think?”

Her tone and demeanor exuded confidence, giving her an air of striking beauty.

Everyone nodded in agreement.

“Before we proceed, we should familiarize ourselves with each other’s strengths. This way, if we encounter danger, we can act more effectively. I’ll go first; my name is Lan Chudie, a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, with a cultivation level of Qi Movement Realm, Seventh Stage. What about you all?” 

With that, she cast her beautiful eyes over the four of them.

The Lingxiao Pavilion disciple quickly chimed in, “I’ve heard of your esteemed name, Senior Sister. Seeing you today, I realize you are even more beautiful than I imagined.”

This flattery was too obvious, and Yang Kai and the other two couldn’t help but scoff inwardly. It was clear this fellow had a crush on Lan Chudie, which explained his eagerness to interject.

It was no wonder; Lan Chudie was stunningly beautiful with an alluring figure, especially her pair of jade-like peaks, which seemed otherworldly and were quite eye-catching. Anyone who could possess her would surely revel in delight.

Lan Chudie smiled slightly, unfazed, and turned to him, “And you are...?”

The man puffed out his chest, trying to appear mature and reliable, and declared, “I am Nie Yong, a disciple under the Great Elder! I am at Qi Movement Realm, Fourth Stage!”

Afterward, he added with a grin, “Rest assured, Senior Sister, if any danger arises on this journey, I will brave fire and water to protect you.”

“Thank you for your kindness, Junior Brother.” Lan Chudie continued to smile, her beauty captivating.

She then shifted her gaze to another man.

This was a towering figure, broad-shouldered and muscular, towering over Yang Kai by a head, with a rugged appearance that seemed quite simple.

Seeing Lan Chudie looking at him, he spoke up, “I’m Zuo An, a disciple of the Blood Battle Gang, at Qi Movement Realm, Fifth Stage.”

With that, he fell silent, clearly not one for many words.

Lan Chudie nodded slightly and turned her attention to another woman.

This woman was very slender, not particularly tall, and exceptionally delicate in appearance. Throughout, she wore a shy, bashful smile.

“I’m Du Yishuang, from Fengyu Tower. You can call me Du Xiaomei; that’s what my senior brothers and sisters call me. I’m at Qi Movement Realm, Sixth Stage,” she introduced herself.

The others looked at her in surprise, causing Du Xiaomei to lower her head bashfully.

No one expected this girl, who looked only fourteen or fifteen, to possess the strength of Qi Movement Realm, Sixth Stage, just one Stage below the highest among them, Lan Chudie.

“Interesting,” Lan Chudie suddenly smiled, “Could it be that we were assigned here based on our strength?”

Upon hearing this, the other four began to ponder. Among them, Lan Chudie was the strongest at Qi Movement Realm, Seventh Stage, followed by Sixth, Fifth, and Fourth Stages, which explained her deduction.

“By the way, what about you? What Stage are you at in Qi Movement Realm?” Lan Chudie looked up at Yang Kai and asked.

Though their cultivation levels were higher than Yang Kai's, they lacked Divine Sense. Unless Yang Kai revealed his Primordial Qi fluctuations, they wouldn’t be able to gauge his depth. Moreover, since the previous few were all at Qi Movement Realm, Lan Chudie instinctively assumed Yang Kai was as well.

Yang Kai pinched his nose, feeling a bit embarrassed as he replied, “I’m Yang Kai, a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, at Open Origin Realm, Seventh Stage!”

Zuo An turned to glance at him, a hint of disdain flashing in his eyes, and spat on the ground, “Damn it!”

“You’re Yang Kai?” Lan Chudie’s eyes lit up with surprise as she looked at him. Nie Yong also stared at him in disbelief, scrutinizing him as if he were a rare specimen.

“Yeah.” Yang Kai nodded. He knew that after the previous incident, his name had likely become well-known in Lingxiao Pavilion, so he didn’t hide it.

However, Yang Kai keenly sensed that upon hearing his name, Nie Yong’s eyes flashed with hostility, while Lan Chudie’s gaze was filled with interest, as if she had discovered something novel.

Yang Kai had anticipated Nie Yong’s hostility. Since he claimed to be a disciple under the Great Elder, he was likely part of Wei Zhuang and Jie Hongchen’s faction. Given that he had offended Wei Zhuang and Jie Hongchen last time, it was no surprise he bore a grudge.

Yet, within this Inheritance Celestial Cave, Yang Kai estimated that Nie Yong wouldn’t dare to act recklessly, so he didn’t need to pay him any mind.

Returning his gaze, Lan Chudie clapped her hands and said, “Alright, since we all know each other now, let’s set off. We don’t know where the treasures are hidden here. To be clear, if we find anything good later, we’ll divide it based on our contributions. If we can’t agree on the division, we can exchange it for silver or other items. How does that sound?”

Nie Yong quickly nodded, “Whatever Senior Sister decides is fine.”

Yang Kai and Zuo An had no objections, and Du Yishuang was even less likely to refute.

Lan Chudie was indeed a decisive woman; in just a few words, she had established her leadership in this small group of five.

While trading with her, Yang Kai had only known that she was not one to make a losing deal, but now it seemed she was also ambitious and would not settle for being beneath others.

“Then let’s go. I’ll lead the way first, and we’ll switch who leads every hour!” Lan Chudie declared, taking the lead. The others hurried to follow, with Nie Yong walking alongside Lan Chudie, showering her with compliments and praise as if he were throwing money at her.

Lan Chudie maintained a gentle smile, occasionally responding, which only encouraged Nie Yong’s enthusiasm.

Zuo An, the burly man, followed behind them, rolling his eyes at the nauseating flattery.

Yang Kai took the rear position. After walking a few steps, Du Xiaomei slowed her pace, coming alongside him and softly said, “Don’t mind them. Just cultivate well, and you’ll definitely reach Qi Movement Realm too.”

Yang Kai turned to look at her, “I’m not bothered.”

“Oh.” Du Yishuang blushed deeply. She had thought Yang Kai’s silence was due to Zuo An’s earlier disdain, and had intended to comfort him, but it seemed she had misread the situation.

“Hehe, but you, you look younger than me. How come your strength is so high?” Yang Kai found himself somewhat fond of this Du Xiaomei. Although she was a disciple of Fengyu Tower, she was gentle and kind, and even approached him to offer comfort despite their unfamiliarity.

“I’m already nineteen; how could I be younger than you?” Du Yishuang explained softly.

“Uh…” Yang Kai felt a bit embarrassed; he hadn’t noticed that.

In their small group, two were chatting lightly in front, while two were quietly conversing in the back, with Zuo An stuck in the middle, feeling quite lonely.

As they walked, Yang Kai suddenly felt a reaction from the Yang Source Seal on his chest, and he looked up in surprise towards the front.

He could sense that just over a hundred zhang away, there was something with a Yang attribute. The direction the five were heading was right towards it, so he didn’t need to remind them.

Moments later, Lan Chudie, who was leading the way, suddenly exclaimed in surprise, and Nie Yong quickly looked ahead, exclaiming, “Yang Flame Stone, Yin Origin Stone?”

Before them lay a large pile of rubble, and these weren’t ordinary stones; they were all Yang Flame Stones and Yin Origin Stones. These stones looked similar to those sold by the Blood Battle Gang at the Black Wind Trading Market, and even their sizes were comparable.

Each piece was worth five hundred taels, and this pile contained definitely over a thousand stones, amounting to a value of five hundred thousand taels.

None of the five were particularly wealthy within their respective sects; who had ever seen five hundred thousand taels of wealth?
