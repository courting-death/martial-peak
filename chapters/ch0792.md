## Chapter 792 — Nine Heavens Sacred Land

A land of clear mountains and limpid waters, where the Heaven-and-Earth Energy was extraordinarily dense; around the ranges, intricate and powerful prohibitive formations and barriers were subtly arrayed, isolating this territory from the outside world.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land!

An ancient power that has persisted through the ages, passed down through generations and still formidable; across the entire continent it counted among the foremost existences.

Yet the moment Yang Kai arrived, he felt a solemn, mournful atmosphere flowing through the Sacred Land—likely because the old Sacred Lord had fallen and a new one had yet to ascend.

Like the Tianxiao Sect, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay wrapped by mountains; however, unlike Tianxiao Sect’s Hundred Peaks Array, the Sacred Land had only nine peaks.

Though fewer in number, the arrangement of these nine peaks harmonized with the Way; an array laid upon these nine peaks was by no means inferior to the Hundred Peaks Array of the Tianxiao Sect—if anything, it surpassed it.

In both defensive strength and the speed at which it gathered Heaven-and-Earth Energy, it rivaled the Hundred Peaks Array in every respect.

Within the ring of those nine peaks, rows of exquisite palaces were set out with tasteful order, and thousands—indeed tens of thousands—of disciples had made their homes here; the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was a paradise apart from the world, yet it bustled with life.

Xu Hui and the others escorted Yang Kai and An Ling'er back into the Sacred Land; rather than slipping in secretly, the old man displayed a grand procession, proceeding straight along the main path toward a magnificent palace at the heart of the Sacred Land.

Along the way, disciples of the Sacred Land would occasionally surge forward from either side to pay their respects to Xu Hui and his party.

When they saw An Ling'er they cried aloud the name of the Saintess, and men and women, old and young alike wore expressions of worship and fervor.

As the sole outsider, Yang Kai naturally attracted even more attention.

Though still young, the way Elder Xu Hui and the others treated him with deference invited speculation.

Whispers rippled from both sides as disciples pointed at Yang Kai and debated whether he might be the next Sacred Lord sought out by the Saintess; curiosity and excitement flickered across every face.

It seemed that if Yang Kai were to inherit the Sacred Lord’s position, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land might be saved!

Those with keener eyes had already made up their minds and offered him grand salutes.

Yang Kai remained calm and composed, his expression unchanged.

Xu Hui and the others were inwardly surprised; their estimation of Yang Kai rose another notch.

Although Yang Kai was from the Tianxiao Sect and still young, Xu Hui had deliberately led him along this formal route so he could experience the Sacred Land’s prosperity and the strength of its disciples; yet under such a spectacle, Yang Kai displayed no fear or panic—he was composed, as if he had weathered great storms—this left Xu Hui and the others impressed.

The temperament of this future Sacred Lord seemed extraordinary indeed.

Xu Hui and the others exchanged looks and felt ever more certain this man should succeed the Sacred Lord.

The procession was lively all the way.

Before a palace built of gilded stone, the ground had been neatly leveled; the palace soared and spread, with many stone pillars before it carved with dragons and phoenixes, images rendered lifelike.

Arriving there, Xu Hui turned and gently waved his hand.

The watching disciples gradually dispersed, though each remained filled with doubt and curiosity—who exactly was Yang Kai, and could he truly inherit the Sacred Lord’s mantle and rescue the Sacred Land from calamity?

“Please, young brother,” Xu Hui bowed his head in a respectful gesture.

Yang Kai heaved a resigned sigh and frowned: “Senior, treat me as a guest touring your Sacred Land; there’s no need to be so ceremonious, is there?”

On hearing this, Xu Hui knew he still felt some distance toward the Sacred Land and them; he gave a light laugh and nodded: “You’re right—then let us enter together.”

“Mm.”

Inside the palace, at Xu Hui’s arrangement they all took seats, and before long a prepared feast was set; it was plain Xu Hui and the others intended to welcome Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not show impatience at the banquet; he accepted his place with the calm of one resigned to fate, clinking cups and sharing drinks with Xu Hui and the others.

He found that so long as the old man did not bring up topics like the Sacred Lord, he was quite easy to get along with.

Though powerful and senior in rank, he was affable; Yang Kai suspected this courtesy stemmed from Xu Hui’s designs—had another young man come, Xu Hui might not have been so patient.

When the wine warmed their hearts, a group of young maidens were summoned in, instruments and singing rising as they danced.

Each maiden was a paragon of beauty; though their clothing was light, it was not immodest—exactly appropriate—and each had a graceful figure and a distinct temperament, dazzling the onlookers.

Yang Kai watched with bright interest, his gaze clear and free of any lecherous intent.

Seated just below him, An Ling'er, seeing this, pursed her lips in a satisfied smile.

After the merriment the banquet was cleared away, and Xu Hui and the others took their leave without mentioning anything that might offend Yang Kai; a maid then led him to rest.

In a vast inner chamber the curtains hung high; a plush fur carpet lay upon the floor, and lighting stones dotted the walls so the room was neither dim nor glaring. In the center stood an incense burner, filled with fine incense whose scent relaxed the mind.

“Young master, would you like to bathe? There is a bath in the side room; warm water has already been prepared,” the maid asked in a soft voice.

Yang Kai glanced at her, slowly shook his head, and waved her away.

The maid obeyed and, after a graceful bow, retired respectfully.

After waiting a while in the chamber, Yang Kai walked to the door and opened it, looking at An Ling'er, who stood outside with a hesitant expression: “Come in—why are you standing there?”

An Ling'er lowered her head and stepped into the room.

“Come, I have something to tell you,” Yang Kai said without preamble, seizing her hand and pulling her toward the bed.

An Ling'er’s face flushed but she offered no real resistance, letting him tug her along.

Soon she sat on the bedside, appearing a little restrained and nervous.

Yang Kai, however, sat cross-legged on the bed and looked at her with an ironic smile: “Xu Hui has had your disciples stare at me and had those dancers tempt me—there’s nothing pure about his intentions.”

“They only want you to take the Sacred Lord’s position; how can that be so sinister? And they aren’t dancers—each is an outstanding disciple handpicked by our Sacred Land. They only perform for the most honored guests,” An Ling'er pursed her lips and stared at him with a hint of grievance. “Don’t you want to be the Sacred Lord?”

“No!” Yang Kai shook his head firmly, then frowned and asked after a moment of thought: “Tell me the truth—what Xu Hui said before, was it true?”

“What do you mean?”

“Once you choose me, you can never choose another.”

An Ling'er nodded lightly.

“Your Sacred Land is strange. After all, I’m an outsider—such an important post as Sacred Lord, why not select from within?”

An Ling'er smiled faintly: “That has been the rule since ancient times. You must have heard it: every Sacred Lord of our Sacred Land was brought back by the Saintess.”

“I have heard as much.”

“Generally that is the case, though there was one exception… I remember records saying that around nine hundred years ago, a Sacred Lord came from our own disciples—several Saintesses sensed him, and so that time the disciple became Sacred Lord. But since then it has not happened again. Ah, if a disciple could become Sacred Lord we wouldn’t have to search outside; Xiao Lian and the others wouldn’t have…” Her expression darkened and her eyes reddened.

"My condolences..." Yang Kai didn’t know how to console her.

An Ling'er wiped her eyes, drew a deep breath, and calmed herself before speaking hesitantly: “If you’re determined not to be Sacred Lord… I can speak to the elders and see if they can make an exception.”

“Don’t bother,” Yang Kai shook his head. “If Xu Hui and the others have fixed upon me as the only candidate, nothing anyone says will change it.”

“Then what will you do?”

“It’s difficult…” Yang Kai sighed; though they wouldn’t dare harm him, their resolute willpower was a headache.

If not for the fact that the Sacred Lords of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land all had short lifespans, with matters having come to this, Yang Kai felt it wouldn’t be a problem to inherit the position; after becoming Sacred Lord, he could properly teach that old codger Xu Hui a lesson to vent the hatred in his heart.

But those pitfalls made Yang Kai wary of the position, and he kept his distance.

An Ling'er appeared troubled as well, her brows knitting into a line: “For now, stay here. Saintess Nan may be outside, and you wouldn’t be safe if you went out—wait a few days and we will see.”

“Mm, that’s all I can do.” Yang Kai nodded. “One more favor—send word to the Tianxiao Sect that I am well and they need not worry.”

“Don’t worry, I will deliver the message,” An Ling'er said seriously.

“Thanks.”

“No need for thanks…” An Ling'er smiled and seemed lighter in spirit as she rose: “You rest; I’ll go back now. If you need anything, just tell me and I’ll have Xu Hui and the others arrange it.”

After An Ling'er left, Yang Kai’s expression turned grave as he released his Divine Sense and began to probe the surroundings.

As he expected, many experts were stationed around the palace, lying in wait—likely to monitor his every move.

Yang Kai gave a faint derisive smile and paid it no mind, knowing Xu Hui had arranged it.

Still, he had no intention of leaving the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; as An Ling'er had said, Saintess Nan might be waiting outside—if he stepped beyond the nine-peak barrier he would be walking into a trap.

Until he had a sure way to shake off Saintess Nan, Yang Kai would not act rashly.

The people of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land meant him no harm; they only wished him to succeed the Sacred Lord. As long as he stubbornly refused, they would be helpless—one cannot force a man into such a role.

Taking the opportunity to consolidate the cultivation he had just broken through and firming his resolve, Yang Kai’s spirits brightened considerably.
