## Chapter 201 — Miao Huacheng's Death

“Mother, run!” The three Separation and Union Realm guards of the Miao family fell dead in less than thirty breaths, and the remaining Qi Movement Realm martial artists dared not linger. With a strange cry, they all rushed out.

“None of you can escape! All of you stay here!” The Earth Demon laughed maniacally, the Soul-Breaking Spike weaving through the air, each swing claiming a life. In mere moments, over a dozen Qi Movement Realm guards lay lifeless on the ground.

The ground was littered with corpses, the air thick with blood and Qi. Yang Kai's Primordial Qi surged violently, a sinister aura radiating from him, and with his pitch-black attire, he appeared as a true demon.

“Bang!” The door ahead burst open, and Miao Huacheng hurriedly rushed out. Upon seeing Yang Kai in the courtyard, his expression changed drastically.

Since the commotion began when Yang Kai stormed into the Miao family, he had heard the chaos. However, he had intended to indulge in some intimate moments with the two beautiful women, and had just managed to dress himself. Even though he knew a battle was raging outside, he had to put on his clothes first; otherwise, running out naked would be ridiculous.

The screams of his guards sent Miao Huacheng into a panic, and he fumbled with his buttons, managing to fasten only two.

As he dashed out, he found that not a single guard remained; they all lay sprawled on the ground.

A dozen zhang away stood several figures in black, their faces obscured, slowly approaching him. His Primordial Qi surged violently, but it was only at the peak of the Qi Movement Realm.

This realization calmed Miao Huacheng’s racing heart.

“Who are you?” Miao Huacheng shouted angrily, his gaze fixed warily on Yang Kai.

The other party did not respond, but instead quickened his pace.

“Seeking death!” Miao Huacheng's anger flared, and he charged toward Yang Kai, the distance between them rapidly closing.

When they were about three zhang apart, Miao Huacheng suddenly pointed at Yang Kai, a sharp finger wind shooting out with a whistling sound.

Yang Kai instinctively dodged to the side, the finger wind grazing past him and leaving a bloody mark.

Miao Huacheng gasped in surprise; he hadn’t expected the opponent to evade his attack at such close range. However, he quickly regained his composure and laughed, flicking out another finger.

Although this technique was not of a high grade, its speed was remarkable, consuming little Primordial Qi, making it hard to defend against.

As the finger wind shot out, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly vanished from Miao Huacheng's sight. The next moment, Miao Huacheng felt a surge of heat coming from behind him.

“Little trick!” Although shocked by Yang Kai's speed, Miao Huacheng was still a peak Separation and Union Realm martial artist, possessing some skills of his own.

He executed a strange movement technique, floating several zhang forward, causing Yang Kai's attack to strike nothing but air.

Turning around, Miao Huacheng leaped into the air, both palms thrusting forward, his Primordial Qi pushed to the limit as he shouted, “Wind Kill!”

A howling wind echoed as Miao Huacheng's palms created a flurry of afterimages, unleashing invisible wind blades that shot toward Yang Kai without pause.

Although these attacks were invisible to the naked eye, Yang Kai's senses were sharp enough to discern their trajectories and movements.

His figure flickered as he hurriedly dodged.

Swish, swish, swish… The wind blades struck the ground around Yang Kai, creating numerous cracks, yet he remained unscathed, with only a few fragments of his clothing fluttering in the air.

Miao Huacheng's expression darkened, and he increased his speed, shouting, “Let’s see how you dodge this!”

Dozens of wind blades surged forth simultaneously, sealing off Yang Kai's escape routes.

Yang Kai's expression turned grim; he no longer wasted time on futile efforts. His Primordial Qi erupted, transforming him into a blinding sun, his arms crossing in front of him to brace for impact.

A series of dull thuds resounded as the wind blades struck him, cutting into his neck and thighs, leaving deep gashes that bled profusely, a gruesome sight.

However, Miao Huacheng was taken aback; although he had injured his opponent, he had not taken Yang Kai's life. In fact, those injuries were merely superficial, not even touching the bones.

How could his Primordial Qi be so pure and vigorous as to withstand an attack from a peak Separation and Union Realm martial artist?

Seeing Yang Kai suffer, the Earth Demon grew furious and prepared to rush in to assist, but Yang Kai called out to him in his heart.

This battle, he would handle alone!

Not only was he testing the limits of his own strength, but he also wished to use this battle to break through his bottleneck. Having the Earth Demon help would make it easy to take Miao Huacheng's life, but it would not align with his intentions.

Sensing Yang Kai's determination, the Earth Demon warned him to be careful but did not interfere further, instead lurking nearby with the Soul-Breaking Spike, ready to assist if necessary.

At this moment, Miao Huacheng finally caught a glimpse of Yang Kai's face. It belonged to a boy who appeared to be around fifteen or sixteen years old, resolute, fierce, bloodthirsty, and composed. These conflicting emotions converged on his face, creating a strangely unsettling impression.

Miao Huacheng frowned and spoke, “Little brat, have we met somewhere before?”

He felt that this face seemed vaguely familiar, but he could not recall where he had seen it.

Months ago, when Yang Kai had encountered him, he had been a filthy little beggar. How could Miao Huacheng connect the current sinister-looking Yang Kai with the little beggar from that day?

Receiving no answer, it was as if the other party were mute.

“Arrogant little brat, daring to run rampant in my Miao family, you’re seeking death!” Miao Huacheng no longer hesitated, his movement technique activated as he charged toward Yang Kai, striking out with his palm.

Yang Kai similarly activated his movement technique to evade, his hands alternating between palm strikes and punches, engaging Miao Huacheng in a relentless battle.

The gap in their strengths was simply too great, a full realm apart. Yang Kai quickly found himself at a disadvantage, forced to defend passively, while Miao Huacheng grew bolder, gaining the upper hand and taunting him mercilessly.

Yet Yang Kai remained unperturbed. Although he was at a severe disadvantage in this life-and-death struggle, and it was indeed dangerous—one misstep could lead to serious injury or even death—he persisted without resorting to his Unyielding Will.

He needed to grasp his own martial path amidst this life-and-death struggle, using it to break through his constraints.

This was not a mere sparring match; it was a true fight to the death. Yang Kai's actions could be likened to walking a tightrope at great heights, causing the Earth Demon to feel a chill run down his spine.

His injuries mounted, and the turbulence of his Primordial Qi intensified. The heat within his bones grew stronger, as if the energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body could no longer be suppressed and was about to surge forth.

Yang Kai held back, relying only on his peak Qi Movement Realm strength to contend with Miao Huacheng.

Miao Huacheng, not young and having trained in martial arts for many years, unleashed a variety of attacks, yet he could not kill Yang Kai. Although he inflicted numerous wounds, it seemed as if his opponent could not be killed, and he had not even left a significant injury.

As time passed, Miao Huacheng began to sense something was off.

This seemingly mad youth, with his chaotic Primordial Qi, was gradually showing signs of restraint, and his attacks became less structured, making him even harder to deal with, acting on impulse with no discernible pattern.

A smile slowly appeared at the corner of Yang Kai's mouth. He faintly felt he was on the verge of breaking through the constraints placed upon him. He focused intently, experiencing his martial way amidst this life-and-death struggle.

His movements gradually became more fluid, as if he would no longer be hindered by anything. Even the set of self-created movement techniques he had developed was now executed with greater finesse than before, seamlessly blending with his impulsive attacks, turning defense into offense.

After fighting for a while longer, Yang Kai's insights deepened significantly. He felt the Primordial Qi surging within him, the power it brought to his fists and feet, and he began to understand the traces of his attacks and the enemy's responses.

“Mirror Moon Kill!” Miao Huacheng suddenly roared, unleashing his strongest technique. As his Primordial Qi erupted, several figures resembling Miao Huacheng appeared around him, as if he had split into multiple selves. Each of these Miao Huachengs raised their fists, grinning savagely as they charged at Yang Kai.

This was his trump card. Once the Mirror Moon Illusions appeared, it was difficult to discern the real from the fake, even for martial artists of the same level. Today, he had resorted to this technique to deal with a peak Qi Movement Realm youth, showcasing Miao Huacheng's desperation and fury.

But this should be the end. With the Mirror Moon Kill unleashed, there was no doubt that it would result in death! Miao Huacheng was confident in this.

Yang Kai's expression remained calm as he quietly observed the enemy figures surrounding him, his previously confused eyes suddenly sharpening.

“Stay true to your heart, separate the union, what’s right and what’s evil, persist in your heart, act on impulse, this is my martial path!”

The previously turbulent Primordial Qi that had begun to settle suddenly erupted once more with a fierce and overwhelming wave, even more violent than before, akin to the force of an avalanche or a collapsing mountain. When Miao Huacheng sensed this ferocious aura, his expression changed drastically.

This… was truly going berserk?

Moreover, he was breaking through to the Separation and Union Realm right before his eyes!

Almost at the moment of his breakthrough, Yang Kai activated his Unyielding Will.

He swiftly ascended from the newly attained Separation and Union Realm to its peak!

Now, he was on the same level as Miao Huacheng.

With composure, he unleashed a punch, his True Yang Primordial Qi erupting violently. The surrounding Miao Huacheng figures shattered like broken mirrors.

With a muffled groan, Miao Huacheng spat out a mouthful of blood, flying backward.

In a clash of the same level, Miao Huacheng was no match for the power of Yang Kai's punch!

Struggling to rise, Miao Huacheng looked at Yang Kai in shock. He saw this mad youth's expression was calm, yet his eyes radiated a bloodthirsty and cruel light as he swiftly approached him.

“Who exactly are you… What enmity do I, Miao Huacheng, have with you?” Miao Huacheng was frightened; he knew he could not defeat this youth and only wanted to know why he had come for him.

However, he received no answer!

Miao Huacheng felt an overwhelming sense of frustration and shouted, “Don’t kill me! My son, Miao Lin, is a disciple of the Yunxia Sect, and the elders of Yunxia value him highly. If you kill me, you will only bring trouble upon yourself!”
