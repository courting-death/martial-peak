## Chapter 1958 — Madman Who Courts Death

The newcomer's attitude was extremely rude, which left Yang Kai thoroughly displeased.

But, considering that disciples of the Biyu Sect were never very harmonious with one another and that he had no ties with them and had not really known them before, Yang Kai let it go.

However, the fact that Kou Wu had actually gone out on a mission a month earlier surprised Yang Kai greatly.

He had no idea what sort of mission had made him leave in such haste.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai did not think further and flew straight ahead.

Ice Cliff lay only ten thousand li from the Biyu Sect; that distance meant little to Yang Kai, and before long he arrived at the Biyu Sect's main headquarters.

Landing in front of his simple dwelling, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe the room next door.

That was Liu Qianyun's dwelling; their residences were only twenty zhang apart.

Inside, Liu Qianyun seemed to be meditating to regulate her breath; upon sensing Yang Kai's Divine Sense she quickly opened her eyes, ran out of her room, and with a face full of joy said, "Brother Yang, you're back?"

She had been alone these past months and had felt helpless in the unfamiliar Biyu Sect.

Although she had not known Yang Kai long, their similar fates and backgrounds had made her instinctively feel close to him, especially since Yang Kai's temper was agreeable and he was generous by nature.

When she first learned that Yang Kai had been placed under confinement, she was worried for quite some time.

If anything had happened to Yang Kai over at Ice Cliff, then she would truly have been utterly alone from then on.

"Just returned," Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

"Nothing serious, right... huh? Brother Yang, you actually broke through?" Liu Qianyun soon noticed signs of Yang Kai's breakthrough, covered her mouth with her hand, and her beautiful eyes were full of astonishment. She had heard how brutal the environment at Ice Cliff was and had feared Yang Kai's safety, yet not only had he returned unscathed, he had advanced a Stage.

"Just luck," Yang Kai said lightly, nodding. "How have the past few months been?"

"How could they be?" Liu Qianyun said with a bitter smile and shook her head. "Just like this, I suppose."

As they spoke, she suddenly coughed lightly; an abnormal flush rose on her delicate cheeks. Although she quickly covered it up, it could not escape Yang Kai's notice.

"Are you injured?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"I had a bit of an accident while cultivating," Liu Qianyun hurriedly answered.

Yang Kai focused his mind on her eyes as if trying to peer into her inner depths. Liu Qianyun forced a smile and said, "It's nothing serious; I rushed during cultivation. I'll recover after a few days' rest."

“Was it truly an accident during cultivation?” Yang Kai’s voice grew steadily colder. Liu Qianyun was a Third Stage Void King Realm cultivator. Though experts at that level could indeed suffer injuries or fall into Qi Deviation while in seclusion, that only ever happened under the premise of entering a life-and-death closed retreat, immersing themselves wholly in comprehending some profound mystery or Secret Art.

How could Liu Qianyun possibly have entered life-and-death seclusion in a place like this?

"Why would I lie to you?" Liu Qianyun said anxiously. "A few days ago I wanted to seclude myself to comprehend the mysteries of the Dao Origin Realm, but I found my strength insufficient..."

"Tell the truth; I'm not a child," Yang Kai interrupted her explanation.

Liu Qianyun opened her mouth, and finally sighed. "Brother Yang, let's leave it at that. Don't ask further. Protector Bian and Senior Brother Kou Wu are both absent from the sect; if any more trouble is stirred up, it might end badly."

"Protector Bian is not in the sect either?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes. A few days ago Protector Bian took many people out, including Senior Brother Kou Wu; no one knows what they went to do. Besides, I'm really fine—just a minor injury. We are still new here; better to endure where one can."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his mouth twisting into a mocking smile. "It's best that you think that way, but I'm afraid some people won't be willing to stop so easily."

As he spoke, he turned his head and looked to one side.

Liu Qianyun was stunned, then realized and followed his gaze; her face immediately fell.

Over there a group of four or five warriors strode over. The man in front had a stern face and a cold expression, hands clasped behind his back in an imposing, untouchable manner; three others followed him, all warriors Yang Kai had seen before.

One of them was Chu Fei, whom Yang Kai had given a severe lesson in the market last time. Three months later, Chu Fei's injuries did not seem fully healed; after all Yang Kai had struck him hard, and even with miraculous Spiritual Pills and Chu Fei's own recovery, three months was not enough to fully mend him. At this moment Chu Fei clearly seemed all bravado and little substance, his complexion less rosy.

The other two were the fellow brothers who had been with Chu Fei then.

Yang Kai had only just returned from Ice Cliff when the group blocked him at his doorway — their intent was unmistakable.

Chu Fei glared at Yang Kai like an enemy seeing a foe again, grinding his teeth and whispering something to the warrior at the head.

The man wore a cold expression and showed no sign of responding, but from Chu Fei's obsequiousness it was clear this man's status in the Biyu Sect was not low; at the very least he was of Kou Wu's rank, and his power was probably similar to Kou Wu's.

The group strode over brazenly; the leading warrior's eyes were sharp like a hawk's, fixed on Yang Kai with nothing but contempt and scorn.

They stopped five zhang away. Chu Fei looked at Yang Kai with a feral expression and sneered, "Junior Brother Yang, long time no see. I didn't expect Protector Bian to lock you up on Ice Cliff and not take your life — seems your luck is truly great."

Yang Kai chuckled and sized up Chu Fei. "Senior Brother Chu Fei, how goes your recovery? Is your skin itching again, wanting your Junior Brother to loosen your muscles? If so, I'm more than happy to oblige."

Upon hearing this, Chu Fei shuddered involuntarily. In that battle three months ago he had no ability to resist Yang Kai; he had been pinned to the ground and pounded, utterly shamed. Even now thinking back felt like a nightmare, his heart chilled.

He couldn't help but flare up in shameful anger. "Don't be so smug. If you're sensible today, your Senior Brother might let you go. But if you're not... hmph..."

"Whoa..." Yang Kai exclaimed exaggeratedly. "Three months apart and Senior Brother Chu Fei has grown bolder. Who gave you such courage? Could it be... this Senior Brother?"

As he spoke Yang Kai's eyes shifted and he fixed them on the leading warrior.

His tone was anything but polite; the other party had obviously come for revenge, and there was no need for him to show weakness.

He paid little mind to Chu Fei and the other two Void King Realm warriors; three months ago, at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm he could easily deal with those three, and now that his power had greatly increased he naturally dismissed them. What concerned Yang Kai was the helper they had brought along.

His power fluctuations were scarcely different from Kou Wu's; if Yang Kai wasn't mistaken, this man was likely a First Stage Dao Origin Realm expert. He had remained silent since appearing, but the moment Yang Kai's gaze met his, a terrifying gleam erupted in those hawk-like eyes. Pure soul-force burst forth, coalescing into a razor-sharp assault that spun like a top and drove straight for Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

He actually unleashed a soul-secret technique, attempting to shatter Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness defenses in one strike and give him a brutal lesson.

Yang Kai flew into a rage.

Divine Sense attacks were extremely dangerous; a slight mistake could result in idiocy. The opponent's savage style showed no intention of holding back. This was completely different in nature from the beating he'd given Chu Fei—no matter how Yang Kai struck, Chu Fei would at most require a longer recovery. But if he couldn't withstand this move, it wouldn't be fixed by mere rest.

That would surely leave lifelong hidden dangers and nightmares.

Anger rising, Yang Kai snorted coldly and wildly drove the power of his Sea of Consciousness, transforming it into roaring angry waves that surged violently to meet the attack.

Facing a Divine Sense attack locked onto him, Yang Kai had no way to evade; his only choice was to confront it head-on!

At the same time, within his Sea of Consciousness the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus bloomed with dazzling iridescent light. The treasure island formed from the Warm Spirit Lotus spun round and round; as it rotated the seven-colored radiance grew brighter, and an inexplicable power flowed into Yang Kai's Divine Sense, enhancing the attack strength of his Divine Sense.

An invisible collision erupted between the two, the danger of which was far greater than real blades and swords.

The man's eyelids narrowed; a look of surprise and horror flashed deep in his eyes — he had not expected Yang Kai's Divine Sense power to match his.

Caught off-guard, he took a small loss; a sharp pain tore through his mind and his face turned somewhat pale.

Yang Kai was similarly not doing well—he would not have engaged in such a perilous Divine Sense clash unless forced. However, relying on the Warm Spirit Lotus's protection and restorative power, he had no worries.

For even if his Divine Sense were damaged, the Warm Spirit Lotus could aid its restoration.

On the contrary, the other man, upon realizing that the opponent he had expected to crush at will had erupted with power able to contend with him, felt astonished and reproached himself for overconfidence; after taking the loss he hastily tried to withdraw his Divine Sense.

But Yang Kai would not allow that.

Leaning on cultivation several tiers above him, he had tried to suppress Yang Kai with a single Divine Sense attack without a word; now he wanted to withdraw? Too late!

Yang Kai clenched his teeth against the violent pain in his mind, forced his Divine Sense onward, and relentlessly pursued.

The man’s expression finally changed; the disdain and mockery he’d worn before vanished completely as terror flooded his gaze. Though he had only crossed swords with Yang Kai once in secret, Yang Kai had already given him the savage aura of a man driven to the brink—a ruthless madman who courted death itself.

Aside from why this Junior Brother, a Third Stage Void King, possessed a Divine Sense capable of rivaling his own, the sheer ferocity—one that treated even himself cruelly while showing no mercy to his foes—was not the work of an ordinary man.

"This bastard... is he trying to die?" Terror and unease churned deep within him.
