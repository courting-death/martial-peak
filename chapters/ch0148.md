## Chapter 148 — Iron-Blooded True Man

As if sensing Yang Kai's thoughts, the Earth Demon spoke again, "Young Master need not worry too much. In matters of inheritance, it all comes down to opportunity. Those with fate may obtain it even with low strength, while those without fate, no matter how capable, will find it useless. Has Young Master forgotten the opportunity of those two girls a few days ago?"

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

He had witnessed the fortune of the sisters Hu Jiao’er firsthand. He had spent over ten days in that cave without discovering anything, yet they had gained benefits as soon as they arrived—this was what it meant to have fate.

"Yes, I understand," Yang Kai nodded slightly, and then he no longer glanced at the sky. He turned around and found a secluded corner nearby, sitting cross-legged.

Since he was going to seize that inheritance, he naturally needed to recover first.

Yang Kai estimated that it would take at least two or three days for whatever was in the clouds to fully descend, meaning he only had two or three days left for himself.

Su Yan glanced at him in surprise, and after a moment of contemplation, she also turned and left the crowd, sitting down not too far from Yang Kai.

Seeing Yang Kai and Su Yan so calm and composed, the younger generation of experts felt they could not show weakness. They could not just stare like ordinary disciples; that would make them seem immature.

Thus, one or two of them cleared their throats, maintaining their poise, and each found a place to meditate. Only the ordinary disciples remained gathered together, shouting and clamoring, their voices filled with shock and awe.

It was unclear what Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er were thinking, but they unexpectedly ran over to sit beside Yang Kai.

Yang Kai opened his eyes to look at them. Both sisters were smiling sweetly, making it hard to distinguish one from the other.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed.

"What's wrong?" One of them, clearly Hu Jiao’er, was displeased. Upon seeing her expression, Yang Kai knew it was her. "Being able to sit here is your blessing; why are you making such a sour face?"

Yang Kai chuckled helplessly, "With two national beauties, twin flowers, accompanying me, it is naturally my honor. How could I dare to wear a sour face?"

After interacting with them a few times, he had gradually become more familiar with them. They were no longer as strange to each other, and some words could be exchanged.

Hu Jiao’er smiled at his words, giving him a playful glare, "You have such a sweet tongue!"

Hu Mei’er added, "I thought you were a serious person, but it turns out you are just as slick-tongued."

Yang Kai replied seriously, "What I said is from the heart; it is not flattery."

The two sisters were even happier, laughing like flowers in bloom, their chests swaying, truly a sight to behold.

Yang Kai shifted the topic, "However, the people from your gang have a lot of opinions about me."

The two exchanged glances and spoke in unison, "Are you afraid?"

Yang Kai laughed, "It's not that I'm afraid. It's just that since there is no fate to form enmity, why bother?"

Hu Jiao’er said, "Anyway, you've already offended the male disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion; what’s one more from the Blood Battle Gang?"

She was, of course, referring to the incident where Yang Kai had leaned against Su Yan.

Yang Kai's expression immediately turned bitter.

Hu Jiao’er chuckled, throwing him a flirtatious glance, "Do you want me to kiss you so that others will envy you even more?"

Yang Kai looked at her and then leaned his face closer, "I would be more than happy!"

Hu Jiao’er immediately blushed, retorting, "You wish!"

"Alright, sister, stop teasing him. Let him recover; his injuries are not healed yet," Hu Mei’er shook her sister's arm, feeling a bit sorry for Yang Kai being teased like this.

Only then did Hu Jiao’er roll her eyes at Yang Kai and obediently close her eyes.

Yang Kai exchanged a smile with Hu Mei’er, and they both fell into meditation.

As time passed, the disciples from the three factions gradually lost their initial curiosity and began to recover themselves. They would occasionally open their eyes to observe the changes in the clouds above.

Two days later, Yang Kai felt someone approach him. He opened his eyes to see Du Yishuang from Fengyu Tower standing in front of him, accompanied by a handsome young man.

This young man was Fang Ziqi, who had previously suggested giving Yang Kai the inner core of the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast.

"Yang Kai, how is your injury?" Du Yishuang asked with genuine concern in her eyes.

"It's nothing serious," Yang Kai smiled at her, then turned his gaze to Fang Ziqi, cupping his fists, "You must be Senior Brother Fang?"

Yang Kai hadn’t recognized Fang Ziqi before, but he could tell from the goodwill shown two days ago that he was not someone to be overly wary of.

"Indeed, I am Fang," Fang Ziqi returned the greeting with a hearty laugh, "That punch from you two days ago was truly magnificent, making this senior brother admire you greatly! I wish I could take your place and enjoy the glory of being in the spotlight; it’s truly enviable."

"Senior Brother Fang, you flatter me."

Fang Ziqi continued, "Yang Kai, you are a man of great stature. I have always respected such people. If it weren't for our different sects, I would have liked to become brothers with you, sharing both hardships and joys!"

Hu Jiao’er shot him a disdainful look, "How cheesy!"

Fang Ziqi's brow twitched.

Du Yishuang tugged at Fang Ziqi's arm, smiling wryly, "Senior Brother, you are too enthusiastic."

Afterward, she looked at Yang Kai and said, "Don't mind him; my senior brother has a few screws loose."

"What are you saying, Junior Sister?" Fang Ziqi immediately glared at Du Yishuang.

"It’s nothing; Senior Brother must be a straightforward man, so he doesn’t pay attention to small matters!" Yang Kai smiled slightly, not expecting Fang Ziqi from Fengyu Tower to be such an interesting person.

"Yang Kai truly understands me," Fang Ziqi said, feeling greatly moved.

Hu Jiao’er interjected, "Yang Kai, you should be careful of him; this guy sees women as dirt, only men can catch his eye. Don't be too polite with him; who knows... he might look at you differently."

After saying that, she covered her mouth and giggled.

Hu Jiao’er’s words had a double meaning and could easily be misunderstood.

Yang Kai's face immediately turned green.

Fang Ziqi exclaimed in frustration, "Hey, how can you slander me like this? Yang Kai, don't listen to her nonsense; I, Fang Ziqi, am not the kind of person you think!"

Yang Kai cleared his throat, his expression somewhat unnatural.

Fang Ziqi, anxious, had veins popping on his forehead. He glanced around and suddenly pulled Du Yishuang, wrapping his arm around her waist, and kissed her on the lips.

Yang Kai stared, dumbfounded.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er also gaped, their mouths slightly open in shock.

Du Yishuang's struggles and muffled sounds reached their ears, causing the sisters' faces to flush.

After a long while, Fang Ziqi finally released Du Yishuang. Wiping his mouth, he chuckled, "Now, Yang Kai should believe me, right?"

Yang Kai was thoroughly impressed, giving him a thumbs up, "Senior Brother Fang is indeed an iron-blooded true man!"

This praise struck a chord with Fang Ziqi, who burst into exaggerated laughter. Amidst his laughter, Du Yishuang's face turned red, her eyes watery, and she slapped Fang Ziqi's face.

"You jerk!" Du Yishuang stomped her foot, covering her cheeks as she fled.

"Slow down! Don't fall!" Fang Ziqi shouted after her while rubbing his cheek where he had been slapped.

"Senior Brother, aren't you going to chase after her?" Yang Kai looked at Du Yishuang's retreating figure, feeling a bit speechless.

"No need to chase her. The little girl is just throwing a tantrum; she’ll come back soon," Fang Ziqi said, completely unconcerned.

Sure enough, after about ten breaths, Du Yishuang returned, her face flushed, her head lowered to her chest, her hands twisting the hem of her clothes as she timidly approached Fang Ziqi.

"Hehe," Fang Ziqi exchanged mischievous glances with Yang Kai, clearly pleased with himself.

"Senior Brother..." Du Yishuang mustered her courage and tugged at Fang Ziqi's arm.

"What is it?" Fang Ziqi raised an eyebrow, his masculine demeanor on full display.

Du Yishuang quickly raised her hand and swiftly slapped Fang Ziqi's other cheek. Gritting her teeth, she said, "You are a big jerk!"

After delivering that slap, Du Yishuang seemed to have vented her anger, turning around and strutting away with her head held high.

Fang Ziqi stood there, stunned, touching his cheek in disbelief.

"Ha ha..." Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er laughed so hard their shoulders shook, clearly not expecting things to develop this way. Initially, they had looked down on Du Yishuang when she returned, but now they could only admire her.

"This junior sister..." Fang Ziqi muttered, not knowing what to feel, then turned to Yang Kai with a forced smile, "I’ll go deal with her later. This is outrageous."

Hu Jiao’er clapped her hands, "This show is truly delightful. Ah, Fang Ziqi, you have your day today."

Fang Ziqi's mouth twitched, letting out a long sigh, "Always walking by the river, how can one not get their shoes wet?"

Yang Kai cleared his throat, not wanting to continue the nonsense, and said, "Senior Brother Fang, did you come to find me for something?"

Upon hearing this, Fang Ziqi's expression turned serious. He looked ten li away and said solemnly, "I came this time to ask one thing: how much do you know about what’s over there?"

Hearing his question, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er's expressions also became serious.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered. Before he could respond, Fang Ziqi added, "Let’s not beat around the bush. Of course, if you say you know nothing about it, I would believe you."

Yang Kai glanced at him, knowing that his previous warning for everyone to stay away from ten li had revealed some clues to him. If he didn’t have some understanding of this place, how could he have retreated early?

However, whether to speak or not was inconsequential. Even if he didn’t say anything, once the things in the clouds fully descended, the disciples from the three factions would still go to investigate.

Looking again at Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er, they were also staring at him.

With this in mind, Yang Kai formulated a plan and said, "I don’t know much, but once the things in the clouds fall, I will go take a look."

Fang Ziqi asked, "Is there danger?"

Yang Kai smiled, "Senior Brother Fang, you’ve asked the wrong person."

Fang Ziqi nodded, cupping his fists, and said solemnly, "Thank you for the reminder, Yang Junior Brother. If there is a chance in the future, please come to Fengyu Tower as a guest. I will definitely drink and chat with you."

"Too polite!"

After Fang Ziqi left, Yang Kai smiled at the sisters, "Now that you know what you wanted to know, do you still want to sit here and let the male disciples of your Blood Battle Gang glare at me?"

"Are you trying to chase us away?" Hu Jiao’er glared at him.

Hu Mei’er hurriedly said, "We didn’t come over for that reason... ah..."
