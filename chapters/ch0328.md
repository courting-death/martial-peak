## Chapter 328 — Short-Sighted

After a brief investigation, Yang Kai suddenly realized how shabby he actually was.

After some careful thought, he still felt it was best to give them a bottle of Heaven-Grade Pill.

A bottle of Heaven-Grade Pill held significant value, and this was something he had secretly acquired from Shan Qingluo's Treasure Vault. Each bottle was worth at least two to three hundred thousand taels of silver.

It should be enough to offset a Purifying Spirit Flask.

Frowning in contemplation, Yang Kai's Divine Sense wandered in the black book space. Although it was merely a moment, to others, it appeared he was lost in thought.

The three individuals were already dissatisfied that Tao Yang had gifted Yang Kai a Purifying Spirit Flask; however, they had tolerated it simply because he was their Senior Brother.

Yet, they still felt that the Senior Brother was overly generous, and somewhat reckless. They had only just met; even if they wanted to befriend him, was it really necessary to be so lavish?

Now, seeing Yang Kai put on an indifferent expression, they couldn't help but feel frustrated.

The girl named Rong Mei appeared to be rather straightforward; she coldly huffed, "When someone gives you something, can you at least say thank you? It's not like you're mute."

The other two wore similarly displeased expressions, as if they had suffered a huge loss.

Yang Kai was taken aback, looking up at them, and said blandly, "Sorry, I was lost in thought."

"Are you done thinking?" Rong Mei pressed, seemingly intent on hearing Yang Kai express gratitude before she'd relent.

"Yeah." Yang Kai nodded slightly, casually tossing a bottle of Pills toward Tao Yang, then clasped his hands together and said, "Until we meet again!"

With that, he shook his figure and vanished like lightning.

"Hey..." Rong Mei chased after him for a few steps but had already lost sight of Yang Kai, feeling both angry and helpless as she stomped her foot, "That guy..."

"You guys... sigh..." Tao Yang shook his head with a sense of helplessness, glancing at his three junior brothers and sisters. Although he didn't scold them, his disappointment was evident.

"Senior Brother!" One lean junior brother looked at him suspiciously, "Is he really worth being so friendly with?"

"Yeah. He doesn't seem like a formidable character, and his attire is rather ordinary. Why give him a Purifying Spirit Flask for free?" Rong Mei's large eyes brimmed with confusion as she murmured, "What an annoying person, not even saying thank you."

"Why should he? He isn't getting the Purifying Spirit Flask for nothing." Tao Yang finally shot them a glare, casually handing the bottle Yang Kai had tossed over to Rong Mei. He said blandly, "Take a look for yourself."

"What is this?" Rong Mei took it with dissatisfaction, pouting, "It's just a bottle of Pill, can it really compare to the value of a Purifying Spirit Flask? Hmph!"

As she complained, she opened the lid nonchalantly. Upon taking a gentle whiff, her expression suddenly changed, staring in shock at Tao Yang.

Tao Yang's eyes flashed with a hint of helplessness.

"No way?" Rong Mei's face lit up with astonishment. She seemed unable to believe it as she tremblingly poured a single Pill into her palm for detailed examination, while the other two leaned in curiously, inhaling the rich scent of the Pill, and gasped in unison, "Heaven-Grade Pill?"

"Look closely." Tao Yang's keen eyesight was clearly sharper than theirs, and he recognized the quality of the Pill at a glance.

"Could it be... an Upper-Level Heaven-Grade Pill?" The three of them, instead of complaining further, now wore expressions of sheer joy.

"Upper-Level Heaven-Grade True Essence Pill!" Tao Yang chuckled bitterly. "So tell me, can its value offset a Purifying Spirit Flask?"

Rong Mei's face flushed, and she hesitantly replied, "Yeah."

These individuals had ventured deep into the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave for training, so naturally, they brought along some restorative and healing Pills. However, the highest grade among the Pills they carried was only the Lower-Level Heaven-Grade True Essence Pill, which was two minor stages lower than the one Yang Kai casually tossed out.

The difference in value was immense!

Moreover, sometimes, a good Pill's worth cannot be measured in gold. It could save a life at a critical moment!

"Who is that guy? Why is he so generous?" The lean junior brother looked astounded, his mind racing.

Interestingly, both senior and that person were meeting for the first time, yet each one showed off their generosity, as if competing.

"Give a peach for a plum, that's just how it goes." Tao Yang smacked his lips, glaring at the three. "No matter who he is, I wanted to befriend him, but you three messed it up."

The three felt a touch ashamed and hurriedly admitted fault.

Rong Mei curiously asked, "Senior Brother, how did you determine he was someone worth building a relationship with? People coming here are from all walks of life. What if he is a villain?"

Tao Yang smiled lightly, "If he were a villain, he wouldn't have deliberately made a commotion just to alert us."

Suddenly, the three realized that they had assumed the noises he made upon arriving were merely mistakes. They hadn’t considered that he intentionally created noise to prevent misunderstandings.

Thus, it seemed he wasn't someone prone to stirring up trouble, and his nature wasn't bad.

"Moreover," Tao Yang's eyes sparkled with insight, "although his words and demeanor hinted that he wasn’t very familiar with this place, the fact that he dared to come alone indicates he must have some backing. Undoubtedly, this person is very strong."

"Is that really the case? He seems a bit younger than us," Rong Mei voiced her skepticism.

"Age doesn’t denote everything. Haven't you noticed that he wasn’t the slightest bit anxious when facing the four of us? He didn’t even regard us as a threat. What does this signify? It means he isn't afraid of us; he might even have the strength to kill us. That’s precisely why I sought to befriend him."

"How is that possible?" The three exclaimed in disbelief, shaking their heads vigorously, "I don't believe it!"

Tao Yang lamented as he looked at them, "Can you stop being so short-sighted? Talents abound in this world—there are plenty of powerful individuals; you should broaden your horizons."

Rong Mei chuckled lightly, "Even if Senior Brother insists, I still don’t believe it. Hehe, there are definitely geniuses, but for someone of his age to be able to kill the four of us, that’s not just a genius; that’s a freak!"

The other two nodded in agreement, clearly expressing their sentiments.

"Sigh..." Tao Yang felt he had wasted countless words but still couldn't broaden the minds of his three junior brothers and sisters. He sighed, "Listen carefully. In this world, you might lack strength, but you cannot lack insight! You must discern who is worth offending and who is worthy of friendship. If you can achieve that, you'll live a long life."

"Alright, alright, we know Senior Brother is going to preach again. Let's go inside. That guy is already ahead of us," Rong Mei stepped forward, tugging at Tao Yang. "Let’s move faster; perhaps we can meet him again. At that moment, we’ll see if he really has the capability. Talking now is useless."

"True." Tao Yang’s eyes lit up as he quickened his pace.

He was also eager to discover what gave Yang Kai the confidence to enter this place alone.

A few miles away.

Yang Kai frowned as he gazed ahead at a flickering, ghostly figure, shimmering green all over, floating like a wraith.

Upon closer observation, he found that the evil spirit was indeed only semi-material; it had no limbs, just vague facial features, appearing quite terrifying.

After watching for a moment, Yang Kai walked toward it.

The evil spirit lacked intelligence but was extremely sensitive to the breath of life; as long as any living being appeared within a certain range, it would pursue and attack. There was no escaping unless the spirit was defeated.

Yang Kai had only approached within several ten zhang when the evil spirit detected him.

With a wail, the evil spirit floated toward Yang Kai like willow fluff.

In an instant, the air turned cold, and mournful cries echoed.

Yang Kai struck out with a palm, sending a scorching gust of palm wind that directly struck the body of the evil spirit.

The evil spirit was immediately thrown into disarray; where the True Yang Yuan Qi invaded, it blazed as if set aflame.

Although the True Yang Yuan Qi was quickly neutralized by the evil spirit's vile energy, that strike seemed to have inflicted considerable damage on it, dulling its vibrant green form significantly.

The approaching body suddenly halted, and its howls ceased abruptly. Then, the evil spirit turned in a panic and fled.

Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback, sensing that something was not quite right, and quickly hurried after it.

However, despite being semi-material, the evil spirit was remarkably swift. Yang Kai pursued it for quite a long while before finally catching up. After a few exchanges, he shattered it, leaving only a mass of evil spirit essence behind.

The ease of it far exceeded Yang Kai's expectations.

Earlier, seeing Tao Yang and the others struggle against those evil spirits, Yang Kai thought he'd be overwhelmed as well.

Standing still and pondering for a long while, Yang Kai always felt that this situation was somewhat unusual.

It was said that evil spirits would stop at nothing when encountering living beings; why did this one flee after just one hit? And why could he take down an evil spirit in only a few exchanges?

Could it be because of the True Yang Yuan Qi's suppressive effect?

After mulling it over, that seemed to be the only plausible reason.

The purest and most Yang natured True Yang Yuan Qi had always been a nemesis to evil entities; it was precisely with this that Yang Kai could suppress the evil energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body.

With this realization, Yang Kai's expression lit up, becoming quite excited.

In this Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, he undoubtedly had a significant advantage over others. If he didn't make use of this advantage, it would be a tremendous waste.

Taking out the Purifying Spirit Flask, Yang Kai imitated Rong Mei's actions, slightly channeling Yuan Qi into the treasure. Instantly, a pulling force emanated from the Purifying Spirit Flask, drawing in the essence of the evil spirit.

Quite interesting, Yang Kai chuckled.

Putting away the Purifying Spirit Flask, he continued on his path.

There didn't seem to be many traces of martial artists' activities nearby, only a handful of people. Yang Kai walked and fought, not letting a single evil spirit escape. After the first chase, Yang Kai became decisive in action, preventing any further chances for the evil spirits to flee and directly smashing them.

In less than half a day, the Purifying Spirit Flask was filled with twenty masses of evil spirit essence; his gains were substantial. However, Yang Kai could also sense that the energy contained within these evil spirit essences wasn't very strong. Even if absorbed, he probably wouldn't gain too much power from it.
