## Chapter 1333 — Midnight Appointment

In the ruins of Tianyun City, Ma Xinyuan and the others stood silently, faces ashen and the atmosphere unbearably heavy.

They had never imagined Yang Kai could actually withstand a move from Fei Zhi Tu and walk away intact.

They had all witnessed the might of that blow and knew Fei Zhi Tu had not held back; a strike like that would have overwhelmed every Origin Returning Realm warrior present, yet it had been stopped by a youth at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Shock filled Ma Xinyuan and the others, but alongside it grew a deep dread of Yang Kai—this brat was only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and already so conspicuous; if he truly reached the Origin Returning Realm, what then?

Every person present was a seasoned fox and understood all too well the need to snuff danger in the bud; especially after the meaningful look Yang Kai had given before leaving, none doubted he would take revenge once his cultivation matured.

After hesitating for a long moment, Ma Xinyuan finally cupped his fist and stammered, “City Lord, are you really going to let him go?”

“If we don’t let him go, what do you propose?” Fei Zhi Tu, brimming with anger and with no outlet, glared coldly at Ma Xinyuan.

“But that brat killed someone from the Xie Family—”

“The Xie Family!” Fei Zhi Tu snorted coldly. “You know they’re Xie Family people—what does their living or dying have to do with me?”

Ma Xinyuan fell silent, unable to say more.

“Hmph. If you don’t want him to leave, you can chase after him now—if you’re confident you can hold him!”

“City Lord, you jest.” The group’s faces were painfully awkward; no one dared bring up Yang Kai again.

“If you lack confidence in your own strength, then stay put! Whoever dares defy this City Lord will find no mercy. Also, do you truly believe that old fellow Qian Tong won’t return? Heh, you’d better pray you made the right choice this time—otherwise Yingyue Hall may not leave any place for you to stand.”

The crowd exchanged nervous glances, about to press for more when Fei Zhi Tu flicked his sleeve and vanished from the spot.

“Brother Ma, what should we do? Lord Fei’s words suggest there’s still trouble in the hall—didn’t the rumor say Elder Qian was—” someone asked Ma Xinyuan.

“Yes, Brother Ma, didn’t you say this was all foolproof? Why else would we have come here to assist the Xie Family against a Saint King Realm cultivator?” another chimed in.

Ma Xinyuan’s face turned ashen as he snapped impatiently, “You ask me? I ask whom? I only relay what the higher-ups say—I don’t know the specifics. If you want answers, ask Deacon Xie; he might tell you something.”

“Deacon Xie…” Hearing Ma Xinyuan pass the buck, the others realized they had been duped and felt a surge of regret; thinking of Qian Tong’s ability, their faces paled and they cupped their fists and left.

At Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai returned with a slightly pale face.

As soon as he entered, he saw Wu Yi, Yang Yan, Qian Yue and the others waiting there; the three women brightened at his arrival and hurried forward to greet him.

“You’re hurt?” Wu Yi cried when she saw Yang Kai’s pallor.

“It’s nothing serious. How are Yu Feng and the others?” Yang Kai waved a hand and asked.

“They’re all already recovering; they should heal before long. If you hadn’t returned, Guest Elder Chang and Guest Elder Hao were going to make another trip to Tianyun City.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded lightly. “Tell them not to go. This matter ends here—Yingyue Hall shouldn’t stir further. But in the meantime, don’t go out; be wary of Xie Family people making a move.”

“I know. I’ll keep watch and not let them out,” Wu Yi replied quickly, then urged with concern, “You should go treat your injuries.”

Yang Kai nodded and headed toward his stone residence.

Fei Zhi Tu truly was an expert at the crest of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; though that blow had seemed unremarkable, its ferocity only became apparent after the fact. Yang Kai knew the man had not used his full strength.

If an attack delivered short of full power could wound him, the gap between himself and the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was clearly large.

He took a few pill bottles from his ring, poured some out, popped a few into his mouth, closed his eyes, and began to cultivate quietly.

The injuries were not severe, only his aura felt somewhat ragged; after half a day of meditation Yang Kai had recovered. His Golden Blood provided powerful regeneration, so such minor wounds were nothing to him.

Sending out his divine sense, he noticed it was deep into the night. His expression shifted; he rose quietly, opened the warding on his stone house, slipped out without a sound, then used his movement technique to hurry toward Tianyun City.

Before long he arrived inside the city and, following the route in his memory, made straight for the City Lord’s mansion.

In the time it took to brew a cup of tea, Yang Kai appeared within the mansion. Though it was his first time there, his divine sense let him take in the layout of the whole place.

The City Lord’s mansion felt strange tonight; all was silent and not a soul stirred. Even the usual guards had been withdrawn.

No one inside the mansion knew why—all they knew was that it was the City Lord’s order: strict prohibition on movement within the residence tonight, and anyone found would be killed without mercy.

Under that edict, naturally, no one dared defy the City Lord’s authority.

Noting this, Yang Kai strode boldly through the mansion, winding through halls until he reached a wing room. Just as he steadied himself, Fei Zhi Tu’s voice drifted from within: “Since you’ve come, come in and sit.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly and pushed the door open with composure.

Inside the room, Fei Zhi Tu sat upright in a chair, wearing a half-smile as he watched the doorway. When Yang Kai entered he waved his hand and a Saint Yuan flashed out, sealing the door once more.

Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged as he walked over and sat in another chair beside Fei Zhi Tu, calm and unhurried.

“I knew you were bold in the daytime, but I still underestimated you. Aren’t you afraid this is a dragon’s den—easy to enter, hard to leave?” Fei Zhi Tu sneered.

“Senior, you must be joking. If you truly wanted to deal with this junior, there’d be no need for all this trouble—you could have just taken action directly,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

A glint of acuity shone in Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes as he nodded, “Good. It seems that old dog Qian Tong wasn’t mistaken about you—you’re a character.”

“Why did you ask me to come tonight?” Yang Kai’s face turned serious as he asked.

After their duel in the daytime, Fei Zhi Tu had unexpectedly sent a message for him to return to the mansion that night, which puzzled Yang Kai. Though unclear on the reasons, he guessed it had to do with the recent upheaval in Yingyue Hall.

“If I said I wanted to ask you a favor, would you believe me?”

“A favor?” Yang Kai frowned. “What favor?”

“Leave that aside for now. First tell me how you view the recent events at Yingyue Hall,” Fei Zhi Tu said gravely, lowering his voice.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I’ve been in seclusion at Dragon Lair Mountain lately and don’t know much about outside affairs—please enlighten me, Elder.”

“I see!” Fei Zhi Tu nodded lightly. “Since that’s the case, this City Lord won’t beat around the bush. The reason your Dragon Lair Mountain was targeted this time is, in truth, because you were caught up in the internal struggles within our Yingyue Hall. In this matter, my Yingyue Hall indeed owes you an apology. After all, over the past few years, your cooperation with us has been smooth and mutually beneficial, bringing great gains to both sides. However, the reason Dragon Lair Mountain has been able to exist peacefully all this time is largely thanks to that old fellow Qian Tong’s protection. But now, Qian Tong has encountered some trouble—someone wants to deal with him. So they used your feud with the Xie Family as an excuse to strike at Dragon Lair Mountain first, testing Qian Tong’s reaction in the process.”

Staring at Yang Kai, Fei Zhi Tu was surprised not to see shock on his face and asked, “You already knew?”

Yang Kai chuckled softly. “I had some suspicions.”

“Impressive.” Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes flashed approval. “Since you already guessed it, matters become simpler. To put it plainly, Yingyue Hall split into two factions: one led by Qian Tong, the other by an elder named Feng Zhen. They differed in philosophy and clashed frequently. One controls the hall’s forging and secret treasures, the other oversees alchemy and pills. The elders and deacons under them balanced each other, so though there were disputes over the years, nothing major erupted. But now, because of one thing, that balance was broken.”

“Master Gelin’s death?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, recalling the matter—Qian Tong had been close to Master Gelin, and with Gelin gone Qian Tong lost a weighty ally, so the other faction might be tempted.

Yang Kai thought his guess correct, but Fei Zhi Tu sneered and shook his head, “Master Gelin’s death was only a catalyst; the real cause for the factions to tear each other apart is something else.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“You’ve seen that thing yourself,” Fei Zhi Tu said lowly. “The Red Candle Fruit flesh!”

“That thing!” Yang Kai suddenly understood.

“In Yingyue Hall, the hallmaster’s cultivation isn’t the most formidable—Qian Tong and Feng Zhen are the strongest and both have real chances of rising to the Void King Realm, and there was only a sliver of Red Candle Fruit flesh. Everyone wanted it. Think how the situation would develop.”

“If that’s so, it does explain things,” Yang Kai’s face showed he understood.

Two years ago, when the Flowing Flame Sandland opened and a Red Candle Fruit appeared on the Third Stage, though Leng Qing of Star Emperor Mountain sliced it into pieces, Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er managed to secure a piece and bring it back to Yingyue Hall. Rumors that such a treasure could help an Origin Returning Realm cultivator break through were overwhelmingly tempting; it’s no wonder Yingyue Hall’s balance was broken.
