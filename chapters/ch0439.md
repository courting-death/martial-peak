## Chapter 439 — Leave

Inside the side hall, Lü Song's Primordial Qi flame blazed arrogantly as he sneered mockingly.

Dong Qinghan and Fan Hong chuckled quietly to themselves. Unlike Lü Song, who was outright foolish, they had already begun to understand some things. Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng, however, showed little reaction; neither of them would interfere, merely watching quietly, waiting to see how the drama would unfold.

Having earned Qiu Yimeng's approving glance, Lü Song grew even more insolent, sneering coldly, “If you want returns, you have to invest first! Can your Yingyue Sect really muster such strength and resources? Sorry, I almost forgot—you are merely a second-rate Sect with no such capability. But at the very least, half of the Lü Family’s forces will step forward, right? If you can’t even manage that, I advise you to take what you brought and go back from where you came.”

“Young Master!” The Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage expert of the Lü Family broke out in a cold sweat on his forehead. He was no longer young and had long been observing carefully. He clearly saw the cold and displeased expression on Yang Kai’s face.

This young master was making a scene in someone else’s manor, boasting arrogantly and bullying Yang Kai’s comrade who had stood through hardships with him. Was this not a great disrespect to Yang Kai?

Moreover, when Yang Kai introduced Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu just now, his tone was extremely serious.

Although their backgrounds were humble, they clearly held Yang Kai’s great favor.

If Lü Song continued on this path, trouble was bound to arise.

“Young Master, you’ve said enough. Please sit and have some tea.” Under everyone's watchful gaze, the expert could not speak plainly but could only silently give Lü Song a warning glance.

However, Lü Song utterly ignored this and continued with his arrogant sneering, growing more and more domineering.

Chen Xueshu’s face grew increasingly grim.

“Lü Song!” Yang Kai suddenly fixed a cold glare on the Lü Family’s heir and spoke sharply.

“What orders, Young Master?” Lü Song immediately ceased his endless taunts and quickly asked. He could show no disrespect toward Chen Xueshu, but he lacked the courage to do so with Yang Kai.

“Leave.”

“Huh?” Lü Song froze, his face full of confusion.

“I’m giving you thirty breaths. If you do not leave my manor within those thirty breaths, I’ll make you stay here forever.” Yang Kai’s expression was as cold as ice, a sharp gleam flashing in his eyes.

Lü Song was completely stunned. He never expected such an ending. Yang Kai’s words clearly meant to chase him away, yet the one being driven out was himself, not the two from Yingyue Sect.

“Young Master, you must be joking?” Lü Song’s lips twitched slightly, his face reddening. To be driven away in front of so many people by Yang Kai would be a humiliating loss of face.

“I am not joking. You have twenty-five breaths left!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Impossible!” Lü Song shouted, incredulous as he stared at Yang Kai. “Our Lü Family has sent men and supplies to assist you in the succession war, and you want to chase me away? Do you not value our support?”

Yang Kai remained silent, merely watching him coldly.

Feeling the chill in those eyes, Lü Song shuddered, suddenly realizing something. He blurted out, “Moreover, my cousin is here helping you, a great asset to you. Aren’t you afraid if you drive me away, she’ll leave too?”

“If she doesn’t know her place, I’ll kick her out too!” Yang Kai sneered, “Twenty breaths left.”

Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes inwardly.

“My cousin…” Lü Song finally panicked, regretting all the nonsense he had just spoken. He looked pleadingly at Qiu Yimeng, hoping she might say something to soften Yang Kai’s arrogance.

Qiu Yimeng sighed. “Lü Song, you should just go. This man is resolute; what he says is law. You've angered him, and I can’t help you.”

“But…” he stammered.

“Fifteen breaths!” Yang Kai issued his final warning.

“Young Master, let’s go.” The Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage expert smiled bitterly, as if watching Lü Song’s folly pained him. Realizing there was no use saying more, he quickly led Lü Song and another person out.

Seeing Lü Song’s embarrassment and helplessness, Shu Xiaoyu’s face flushed with excitement, her fists quietly clenched.

The humiliation and mockery she had suffered earlier seemed all repaid at this moment. She looked gratefully at Yang Kai.

From outside, Lü Song’s shouting could be heard: “I’m not leaving! I brought people and resources to aid in the succession war, and no one can just push me out! If he kicks me out today, I’ll expose this tomorrow. Let’s see who else will dare rely on him!”

Inside the side hall, Qiu Yimeng shook her head, sighing bitterly. If Lü Song hadn’t behaved so miserably, Miss Qiu herself wouldn’t have been so merciless in excluding him. The Lü Family was raised with the Qiu Family's help and was related by blood. If there were a chance, Qiu Yimeng would have been glad to let Lü Song stay.

But hearing his threats, she felt relieved her decision was right. Expelling him only caused him embarrassment; leaving him in would risk Yang Kai killing him someday.

“Did you encourage him?” Yang Kai looked at Qiu Yimeng meaningfully. Despite Lü Song’s stupidity, without her backing, he wouldn’t have dared be so defiant.

Just now, his arrogance and recklessness were clearly signaled by Qiu Yimeng when Yang Kai went to welcome Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu.

“Yeah, I just said a casual word.” Qiu Yimeng nodded lightly. “Isn’t that good? I didn’t want to keep him either.”

“Right, I didn’t want to keep him. But since he brought a batch of goods, simply chasing him away is inappropriate.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“So you should thank me.” Qiu Yimeng’s bright eyes shone as she openly took credit.

With Yang Kai, she had no illusions of politeness. This man was too strong; if she was weak, she’d be led around by him forever.

Yang Kai pretended not to hear and looked at Chen Xueshu, saying, “Brother Chen, you’ve suffered.”

Chen Xueshu scratched his head. From Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng’s brief talk, he understood some of what was going on. It seemed this was a trap set for someone, and he happened to walk right into it.

He didn’t mind and smiled, “Able to help Junior Brother Yang is no trouble. Chen doesn’t mind a few harsh words; no skin off my back!”

Frowning, Chen Xueshu said, “But driving him away like this might harm your reputation.”

Yang Kai was unconcerned. “Keeping him is trouble. He’s unprincipled. Even if he’s not clashing with you now, conflicts with others will arise eventually. One rotten apple spoils the barrel—I won’t allow that. Cutting the knot quickly is better. Didn’t you see even his cousin Qiu Yimeng doesn’t want to bother with him?”

Qiu Yimeng pouted. “Don’t bully me. As if I’m some cruel woman. When you chase him away, I still have to explain to Lü Liang. Ah… I hope Lü Liang understands my difficulties—he could have sent anyone, why send that guy?”

Sensing Qiu Yimeng’s embarrassment, everyone fell silent.

Just then, some power fluctuations came from outside, punctuated by muffled groans.

Everyone’s faces changed. They didn’t know why a fight had broken out, but Yang Kai quickly released his Divine Sense and calmly looked to Qiu Yimeng.

“I’m really glad you managed to get rid of Lü Song.”

“What’s happening outside?” Qiu Yimeng asked anxiously.

Others looked equally puzzled.

“He provoked the wrong person!” Yang Kai sneered. “To be so senseless, it’s his own fault.”

By then, the fight outside had ended, but Lü Song’s miserable screams still echoed, chilling and bone-rattling.

“What’s going on?” Qiu Yimeng was frantic, itching to see for herself.

“Damn, how dare he make a move on me!” An angry voice came in, followed moments later by Huo Xingchen storming in, cursing heatedly. “Who the hell do you think I am? Didn’t you see who you were messing with?”

Once inside, he shouted, “Hey Yang Kai, what’s with that guy just now? Why did he try to snatch my stuff as soon as he saw me?”

“Snatch your stuff?” Yang Kai was taken aback. His Divine Sense had only caught vague details.

“My treasures!” Huo Xingchen waved his hand. “Bring it in!”

Immediately, several people carried in some boxes and set them on the floor.

With hands on hips, Huo Xingchen declared, “These. That guy wanted to steal from me, no idea what he was thinking!”

Qiu Yimeng sighed helplessly and anxiously asked, “What did you do to him?”

“Broke a few ribs and threw him out.” Huo Xingchen answered casually.

Hearing this, Qiu Yimeng relaxed and exchanged a glance with Yang Kai, both somewhat amused.

Lü Song, likely still frustrated from being expelled without supplies, tried to rob Huo Xingchen’s goods to make up for his losses. Lü Song had two Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage experts at his side, while Huo Xingchen only had two at the Fifth Stage. The advantage was clearly his.

Yet, those two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stagers were no ordinary experts. They realized something was wrong too late after the fight started.

Fortunately, Huo Xingchen had no intention of spilling blood inside Yang Kai’s manor; otherwise, Lü Song’s life would be forfeit.

After Qiu Yimeng gave a brief explanation, Huo Xingchen realized, “So he’s your cousin. Luckily I went easy, or I might have killed him. Qiu Yimeng, how do you have such an unbearable cousin?”

“Enough about me. Where did you disappear to last night?” Qiu Yimeng asked back.

Huo Xingchen’s expression turned a little embarrassed, stammering, “Went home to ask my dad for a few things and some people.”

“Your father assigned clan experts to you?” Qiu Yimeng was delighted. With reinforcements from the Huo Family, Yang Kai’s strength would increase greatly.

“Had no choice.” Huo Xingchen looked embarrassed but didn’t elaborate. He went to the boxes and opened them. Then he shouted at Yang Kai, “Look at this—a box of alchemy materials, a box of refining materials, mostly Heaven-Grade, some Mystery-Grade among them. Another box of finished pills, used for healing and quieting the mind during cultivation, all included. And a box of treasures. Yeah, the quality is a bit low—all Earth-Grade—but good enough to arm some troops. There’re even a few decent items.”

After finishing, he looked proudly at Yang Kai and loudly asked, “Four boxes of goods for your choosing, Young Master. Pick what you want.”
