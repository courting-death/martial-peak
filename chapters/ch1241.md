## Chapter 1241 — Retreat

Seeing Yang Kai trapped so easily, the fire bird once again showed a smug and disdainful expression, opened its beak, and a sharp flame, like a blazing sword, shot straight for Yang Kai's face with thunderous speed and unstoppable force.

It seemed intent on taking Yang Kai's life while it had the chance.

Crrrrack……

The hundreds of Vast Heaven Shields guarding in front of Yang Kai shattered on impact, and the Purple Shield only held for an instant before its violet luster suddenly dimmed, appearing to have lost its spirit; it was thrown aside and crashed to the ground.

In the blink of an eye, the fire sword charged to Yang Kai's front, and it looked like Yang Kai's life was about to be ended.

Just then, a pitch-black blade-like attack shot out from before Yang Kai; that blade seemed to tear the very fabric of space, silent and without any fluctuation of energy, extremely uncanny.

Space Blade!

Yang Kai judged that his own methods using Divine Sense and Saint Yuan could not contend with this Artifact Spirit; it actually knew how to use that forging furnace against an enemy, which greatly surprised him.

Artifact Spirits are notoriously troublesome, and now that it had driven the very furnace that birthed it, its ferocity rose another level—continuing to wrestle with it like this would be courting death!

So Yang Kai did not hesitate to employ his trump card.

He had some confidence in the Space Blade; although the Artifact Spirit's means were extraordinary and it was innately versed in fire law, spatial power is an extremely esoteric and potent force. Yang Kai had considerable experience with spatial rules; while not fully perfected, dealing with an Artifact Spirit should pose no great problem.

Sure enough. After the Space Blade met the fire sword, the blade-like rift warped and, stirred by the intense fire spiritual qi, could not stabilize and soon vanished, but before it disappeared it swallowed that fire sword into the void rift.

Yang Kai's crisis was dispelled in an instant.

Before the Artifact Spirit could act again, row upon row of Space Blades leisurely formed—half flew toward the Artifact Spirit, while the other half circled Yang Kai's side, and at once the force that had bound him seemed to be cleaved; he regained his freedom.

At the instant Saint Yuan could be driven, Yang Kai immediately retreated; with a wave of both hands a foot-long Space Blade had already flown out, tearing an opening in the red light curtain that had sealed the passage. Though small, the hole was enough for Yang Kai to pass through safely.

In the next moment, Yang Kai's figure had already rushed into that corridor several hundred zhang long, while the Artifact Spirit's angry cries came from behind.

The opponent was clearly flustered by the Space Blades being forced on it, unable to spare attention to the fleeing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not expect his Space Blade to kill that Artifact Spirit; the opponent's fire spiritual qi was pure and tremendous, not something the current Space Blade could entirely devour. Surprising it and creating an opportunity to escape left Yang Kai more than satisfied.

For now, he must hurry and leave this Earth-Lung Fire Pool and find another place to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water; once his strength increased, if time allowed, he would come back to give it trouble.

As Yang Kai expected, he had barely run less than a hundred zhang when the fire bird seemed to have intercepted all the Space Blades, and a scorching breath followed from behind.

Yang Kai stole a moment to glance back and instantly felt his soul chill.

In the distance of the corridor, the Artifact Spirit had actually wrapped itself in a mass of red light and pursued relentlessly, unwilling to let him go.

The entire corridor was blisteringly hot; even before the fire bird's body arrived, thick fire spiritual qi had already spread and the stone walls along the passage began to melt.

Yang Kai didn't stop his stride and quickened his pace, but compared with such an incorporeal Artifact Spirit his speed still fell short. With the exit almost in sight, the distance between him and the Artifact Spirit grew ever smaller. A hint of ferocity flashed across Yang Kai's eyes as he prepared to turn and strike the Artifact Spirit, when a peculiar cry came from behind.

That cry carried unwillingness and rage, and at the same time the fire spiritual qi that filled the passage receded like an ebbing tide.

Yang Kai was astonished and turned back with delight; instead of fleeing he stopped and watched with interest.

About fifty zhang away, the fire bird flapped in midair, but now chains of energy like shackles had appeared across its body; runes flowed on those chains—clearly a restraining formation—binding the fire bird tight.

It only cried out a few times before the chains abruptly retracted, digging tightly into the bird's flesh.

The fire bird's eyes deepened with resentment, but with a pop its body exploded and turned into specks of luminous light that vanished.

Extinguished? Yang Kai frowned, and quickly sent out his Divine Sense to probe into that stone chamber.

Inside, the forging furnace that had been floating again fell back down; a hush returned, restoring the chamber to the state it had been in when Yang Kai first entered. But the strange bird pattern on the furnace remained—only now it seemed restless, constantly fluttering and roaming across the furnace surface yet never fully leaving it.

Relief flooded Yang Kai's heart and he grinned broadly.

So that thing couldn't stray far from the furnace; once it moved too far it would inevitably be reabsorbed by the furnace. No wonder—after all the fire bird was the Artifact Spirit of the furnace; the two were naturally linked.

Once certain the Artifact Spirit could not get at him, Yang Kai finally exhaled and wiped the cold sweat from his brow.

That battle just now had truly been the most perilous one he had ever faced. Even when he had fought the Origin Returning Realm expert brought by Xie Hongwen, he had handled it with ease and never felt his life in danger—after all, back then he’d had Yang Yan’s formation to assist him.

But this time, driven by the Artifact Spirit in that stone chamber, he had nearly used every method at his disposal short of unleashing the World-Ending Demon Eye, and still had to retreat in disgrace.

The fact he managed to escape with his life meant that if another Saint King Realm had come here, they would most likely have perished on the spot.

Standing in the passageway, adjusting his breath for a moment, Yang Kai began to ponder. Since that Artifact Spirit couldn’t leave the stone chamber, there was no need for him to depart from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool. This was a rare cultivation treasure ground—though the environment outside on the Fifth Layer wasn’t bad, compared to this place, it was utterly insignificant, not even worth mentioning in the same breath.

However, Yang Kai wouldn't dare enter that particular stone chamber; he could, though, go check the other chamber at the very bottom.

He did not believe there would be another Artifact Spirit there; it would be a miracle for one to be born, and a second simply couldn't appear.

If another did appear, Yang Kai would have to move to the level above and abandon the lowest chamber.

With that thought, Yang Kai turned and left the passage, soon stepping into the cavity to the right.

Like the previous cavity, this passage within stretched for several hundred zhang, and beyond it lay an immense stone chamber.

Although he thought a second Artifact Spirit unlikely, Yang Kai remained cautious and carefully examined the chamber mouth; only after discovering that the Void King-Grade forging furnace at the center had been burned to ruin did he relax.

With the forging furnace destroyed, naturally no Artifact Spirit could have been born there.

When Yang Kai's gaze fell on the piles of aura-dense ores and forging materials stacked beside them, his eyes brightened and he hurried over to inspect them one by one.

Truly, surviving great danger often brings great fortune—he hadn't expected such a quantity of forging materials to be stored in this final chamber.

And they were of high quality, at least Origin-Grade in worth, much of it Void King-Grade: rare ores, five-element metals, and materials from demonic beasts, a dazzling array that made the head swim.

Though there were many materials, some had been stored too long and were no longer usable.

Yang Kai sifted through them, keeping what could still be used and discarding the rest; satisfied, he clapped his hands and continued to survey the chamber.

The layout was nearly identical to the left chamber: at the center a furnace several zhang high, and embedded in the surrounding stone walls were a few milky-white spheres emitting a soft glow.

But here the light spheres were fewer—only four, not the eight of the other room—suggesting the owner of this chamber was of somewhat lower status than the one on the left.

Yang Kai didn't pry into it further; he found the four stone pedestals and drove Saint Yuan into each to shut down the chamber's formation.

After waiting a long while, he went to the ruined forging furnace and took it impudently into his Spatial Ring.

Although damaged, the furnace was still a Void King-Grade piece; bringing it back for Yang Yan to inspect and possibly repair was worthwhile—if it could be fixed it would be useful, and if not, no great loss.

He had already collected several damaged Void King-Grade furnaces before.

After taking the furnace, an empty patch appeared where it had stood. The ground there bore an independent formation, small but exceedingly profound. Though not versed in formations, after entering hundreds of chambers and closing so many formations, Yang Kai understood this formation was one method of converting the Earth-Lung Fire Pool's concentrated fire into fuel for forging furnaces.

Moreover, the four surrounding stone pedestals had a significant role; depending on how many of the pedestals' seals were activated, the speed and power of extracting the subterranean fire differed greatly, in direct proportion.

In other words, opening all four pedestals' seals and opening just one would yield entirely different amounts of hearthfire drawn.

Yang Kai was very pleased with this design, thinking the high-level cultivator who arranged these measures must be extraordinary.
