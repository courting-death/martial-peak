## Chapter 2431 — The Withering and Flourishing of Time, Like a Shuttle, Like a Dream

Just brushing against the might of the Emperor Extinction Pill, Yang Kai felt as if his back had been torn open, his internal organs displaced. Without even using Divine Sense to check, he knew his back must be drenched in blood, flesh mangled.

If he hadn’t been skilled in Spatial Force and fled decisively, he would have been reduced to nothing by now.

He gasped for breath, his face pale as paper. Forcing himself to move through the Meteorite Sea, he searched for a larger meteorite to hide behind, then summoned the Xuan Realm Pearl. With a flicker, he slipped into the Small Xuan Realm.

This stretch of Meteorite Sea was drifting, propelled by some unknown force deeper into the boundless Star Domain. No one knew its destination, but Yang Kai couldn’t worry about that now—he had to focus on healing.

Near the medicine garden, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, grabbed a handful of Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring, and stuffed them into his mouth. He quietly circulated his profound arts to dissolve the medicine’s effects, while also gathering the Everlasting Tree’s life energy for his own use.

This time, he’d been badly wounded by Feng Xi, but Yang Kai wasn’t too concerned. His physique was extremely tough, and with the Everlasting Tree planted in the medicine garden, as long as he didn’t die on the spot, he would eventually recover fully.

What truly left him weak was burning so much Essence-Blood to escape the Emperor Extinction Pill’s power. It would take a long time to recover from that.

In the Shattered Star Sea, winds surged and clouds billowed. Over ten thousand Dao Origin Realm elites from the Star Realm poured in, seeking fortune and pursuing higher Martial Dao, hoping to ascend to the Emperor here.

Within the Meteorite Sea, Yang Kai remained in seclusion, focused on healing.

In a flash, a month passed. After a month, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and exhaled softly, a complex look flickering in his gaze.

He hadn’t expected this healing to take so long—something that had never happened before.

As expected of an Emperor Extinction Pill refined by a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. The power of that Wenqing Finger not only wounded him but also left a strange force seeping into his body.

It was to expel this force that Yang Kai spent a whole month. Otherwise, with his physique and the Everlasting Tree’s effects, he would have recovered in just a few days.

His injuries were now fully healed, with no lingering effects, and his strength had returned to its peak. Yet Yang Kai didn’t rush to leave the Xuan Realm Pearl. First, he swept his Divine Sense outside to check the surroundings—everything was silent, not a soul in sight.

After confirming it was safe, he flipped his hand, and in the next moment, four differently colored beads appeared in his palm.

These four beads—Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter—were relics left behind by the Great Emperor of Time.

Long ago, Yang Kai had speculated that gathering all four seasonal beads would yield unexpected gains. Unfortunately, the Winter Pearl had always eluded him, but this time, he’d finally obtained it in Ice Heart Valley.

Feng Xi’s Emperor Extinction Pill had made him realize the danger. Though his current strength meant he didn’t need to fear those of the same level, he still had to guard against their trump cards.

Feng Xi had an Emperor Extinction Pill—who could say the next enemy wouldn’t? Even if not, who knew what other cards they might hold?

After all, those who could enter the Shattered Star Sea were all elite talents of the Star Realm. Many were descendants of powerful Emperor Realm experts, or top disciples of major sects.

Many among them could not be underestimated. Underestimating them could cost one’s life.

That’s why Yang Kai was desperate to improve his strength. He was already at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; the next step was the Emperor Realm. But breaking through to the Emperor Realm was no easy feat—without the right opportunity, he had no idea when he’d glimpse its mysteries.

Since he couldn’t break through, he could only focus on secret arts.

The four seasonal beads were undoubtedly the best choice. If he could comprehend them, perhaps he could inherit the Great Emperor of Time’s legacy.

The Great Emperor of Time was a master of the power of time. In his era, he was a top expert. If Yang Kai could inherit his legacy, it would greatly boost his strength.

So Yang Kai didn’t hesitate. After taking out the Four Seasons Beads, he began to comprehend them, hoping for some gain.

Strangely, when the Winter Pearl met the Summer Pearl in the forbidden area of Ice Heart Valley, they resonated. But now, with all four beads together, there was no reaction at all.

Yang Kai had no idea how to activate the Four Seasons Beads’ power. He could only press them together in his palm, circulate his profound arts, and quietly meditate.

He wasn’t impatient; instead, his mind was calm.

Gradually, he entered a state of emptiness—his mind blank, body and soul relaxed, as if floating among the clouds, his spirit drifting. He completely forgot where he was or why he’d come, utterly immersed in this inescapable sensation.

Half a month passed, then a month, then two months…

The Four Seasons Beads still showed no reaction, but Yang Kai was madly absorbing the Spiritual Qi of the Small Xuan Realm, making his Origin Qi even vaster and purer. His Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation steadily climbed, nearing a peak.

On a certain day three months later, Yang Kai’s heart suddenly trembled—a shock from deep within his soul startled him. Then, a scorching sensation spread from his palm. He snapped his eyes open to see four-colored radiance streaming from his hand, swirling like ribbons and enveloping him.

Within that four-colored radiance, each color contained a unique profound intent and Law Power. The four Laws echoed and complemented each other, much like the mutual generation and restraint of the five elements.

The power of the four seasons!

Yang Kai’s heart leapt—he realized he had inadvertently activated the Four Seasons Beads’ power. Feeling again, he found the beads in his palm had vanished, leaving only the four-colored radiance swirling around him.

He immediately understood this was his opportunity. Not daring to delay, he closed his eyes again, immersing himself and striving to comprehend.

Unlike the previous months of empty meditation, this time he had a clear goal.

As soon as he relaxed his mind, he sensed the four unique powers beside him—spring’s gentle breeze, summer’s heat, autumn’s desolation, winter’s snow. They seemed to form a strange cycle, the power of the four seasons endlessly overlapping, changing the flow of time, never ceasing.

Yang Kai was instantly lost within, forgetting all sense of time.

He seemed to become a castaway exiled by time—his face slowly aged, and in the span of a single incense stick, he became an old man with white hair. Yet at a certain point, he regained his youthful vigor, cycling endlessly between youth and old age, a bizarre sight.

The Laws of the four seasons surged, and even the environment around Yang Kai changed constantly.

The Spiritual Herbs planted in the medicine garden seemed to experience years of growth in moments, flourishing wildly. Only the Everlasting Tree and Firmament Tree were unaffected by the Law Power; all other spiritual herbs and medicines thrived.

Yang Kai felt as if he were dreaming. In that strange dream, he wandered between youth and old age, using his body to remember the feeling of time’s passage, using his mind and soul to experience the concept of fleeting years.

Gradually, some vague ideas surfaced in his heart.

He tried to see them clearly, but it was as if a thin membrane blocked his way—no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t pierce it.

Yet with each cycle, those vague ideas became a little clearer.

At last, those hazy thoughts transformed into a sudden realization.

Yang Kai snapped out of the dreamlike trance, his spirit shining, eyes bright as stars.

The four-colored radiance still circled him, swirling like four ribbons.

Yang Kai remained motionless, his expression solemn. His hands swiftly formed mysterious seals as he murmured in a low voice, “The withering and flourishing of time, like a shuttle, like a dream!”

His voice was slow, his movements even slower.

But as his words fell, a mysterious seal was completed.

In the next instant, the four-colored radiance swirling around him seemed to receive a command, transforming into countless specks of light that burrowed into his body’s vital points.

Boom…

An invisible aura erupted from Yang Kai, spreading outward with astonishing force.

When everything calmed, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with surprise as he exclaimed, "It’s actually the power of the Laws of Time! The Great Emperor of Time truly is extraordinary."

In this world, only the power of Laws of Time could rival the power of Spatial Laws. Both are extremely esoteric, difficult to enter, and even harder to master.

Yang Kai’s mastery of Spatial Force was also a matter of chance.

Along his cultivation journey, he’d met some who had a basic grasp of Spatial Power, but as for true mastery, aside from himself, only Li Wuyi, whom Mo Xiaoqi once mentioned.

Li Wuyi was famous throughout the Star Realm for his mastery of Spatial Power—he was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, and basically no one dared provoke him.

While some could grasp Spatial Power, Yang Kai had never met anyone who cultivated the Laws of Time.

In comparison, the Laws of Time seemed even harder to master than those of Space.

Yet the Great Emperor of Time had cultivated them to an extremely high level!

Yang Kai had thought the power of the four seasons was just the alternation of seasons and the passage of years, but after this realization, he understood the Great Emperor of Time had elevated the power of the four seasons to the level of the Laws of Time, and had profound attainments in it.

Thanks to the Great Emperor of Time, after obtaining the power of the Four Seasons Beads, Yang Kai had now stepped into the threshold of the Laws of Time.

Since ancient times, who could say if anyone else had ever cultivated both Space and Time Laws?
