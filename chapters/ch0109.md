## Chapter 109 — You Really Are a Fool

“You’re forcing my hand!” Yuan Lang’s expression turned cold.

“You’ve gone too far!” Xia Ningshang refused to yield in the slightest.

Yuan Lang’s face grew stern and fierce. He was about to let out a long howl to send a message, but then reconsidered and held back, letting out a light laugh instead. “Then let us see if the young lady’s defensive treasure can withstand my attack!”

He was truly reluctant to let such a delicious meal slip away. If he could subdue Xia Ningshang by his own strength, it would be equivalent to gaining at least one Heaven-Grade secret treasure! With such a treasure in hand, the vast world would be his oyster. There would be no need to remain shackled to the Blood Battle Gang. Moreover, this woman was mysterious and undoubtedly valuable, likely carrying more than one secret treasure.

So he wanted to test his luck! If it didn’t work out, he could always send a message later. After all, he was blocking her path here; she wouldn’t be able to escape even if she sprouted wings.

With this thought, Yuan Lang gave a wicked chuckle and strode toward Xia Ningshang.

Xia Ningshang’s heart ached. Though she had recovered twenty percent of her Primordial Qi and could activate her defensive treasure, it consumed too much Primordial Qi. Once used, she would fall back into a state of utter weakness. She was still counting on that bit of Primordial Qi to find Yang Kai. How could she bear to waste it all at once?

Yet if she didn’t use it, she had no confidence in defeating Yuan Lang. The terrain here was terrible, preventing her from unleashing her full strength.

Her only choice was to hold him off for a while and see if she could find an opportunity to kill him.

She had no intention of showing mercy. He had already bullied her enough; there was no question of compromise.

The distance between them steadily closed. Xia Ningshang slowly rose to her feet, quietly gathering her Primordial Qi, her gaze wary as she fixed on the advancing Yuan Lang.

This was a true confrontation on a narrow path! In a mountain crevice barely wide enough for one, neither could easily dodge the other’s attacks.

Three zhang away, Yuan Lang’s smile faded, his face growing grave.

Suddenly, Xia Ningshang struck without warning, catching Yuan Lang off guard. Her delicate hand formed an orchid finger, then flicked forward. A chilling finger wind shot toward Yuan Lang like an arrow released from a bow.

Yuan Lang’s expression changed drastically. He had never expected this woman to still have the strength to fight. After all, so little time had passed since her injury. Even with pills, she couldn’t have recovered so quickly, could she?

Little did he know, Xia Ningshang’s constitution was unique. Pills taken were fully absorbed and refined. If she had more pills on hand, she wouldn’t be limited to just twenty percent strength now.

The finger wind was icy to the bone, like a sharp ice spike. It was instantly forged by Xia Ningshang using the valley’s yin energy combined with her special traits. Its power was not overwhelming, but it cost her almost no energy and was incredibly fast.

A wailing whistle sounded as Yuan Lang wielded his palm like a blade, Primordial Qi bursting forth. With a shout, he sliced forward, “Flying Cloud Slash!”

Flying Cloud Slash was a blade technique, a Common-Grade Lower-Level martial art with considerable power. But Yuan Lang had no blade, only his palm, so the effect was naturally diminished.

Still, he managed to cut Xia Ningshang’s finger wind in half, rendering it ineffective.

Feeling that the finger wind had little effect, Yuan Lang was about to mock her when another whooshing sound came from ahead—Xia Ningshang had flicked out another finger wind.

Annoyed, Yuan Lang transformed his palm into a fist and punched out, shouting, “Azure Dragon Chant!”

A faint dragon’s roar accompanied the strike, and this move was even more powerful than the Flying Cloud Slash.

Before he could catch his breath, more whooshing sounds came from both sides. Xia Ningshang’s hands moved rapidly, launching a barrage of fierce finger winds.

Yuan Lang held his ground, hastily deploying his own learned techniques to counter.

Thousand Slays Flash, Flying Phoenix Ghost Kill, Destiny Thunder, Iron-Transforming Palm, Steel-Cutting Hand, Spirit Dragon Fist...

Truly a master of the Separation and Union Realm, Yuan Lang wielded a myriad of martial arts, constantly shifting tactics to contend with Xia Ningshang’s attacks. The battle was fierce and relentless.

But Xia Ningshang remained steadfast, responding with unchanging finger winds. No matter what martial arts he used, she was like a cool breeze cutting through the heat. At three zhang apart, the two were evenly matched, worthy opponents.

Sparks flew from the rocky walls of the crevice, scattered by the aftershocks of their techniques.

After a long struggle, Yuan Lang began to sense trouble. His strength was sealed, and he was struggling against the invading cold. Casting so many energy-consuming moves left him feeling weak and fatigued. Yet the woman opposite him remained unchanged—calm and composed, as if her finger winds cost no energy at all.

What he didn’t realize was that most of Xia Ningshang’s finger winds were formed from the valley’s cold yin energy. She only needed to expend a small fraction of her own Primordial Qi to create a potent attack.

After a bit more fighting, Yuan Lang finally understood that in his current state, he could not defeat Xia Ningshang.

Frustrated and humiliated, he snarled, “You filthy woman! If you don’t surrender, I’ll call Young Master Long Hui over. Once he arrives, he will trample you mercilessly, making your life worse than death!”

“Despicable!” Xia Ningshang snapped angrily.

“Heh heh, no woman who falls into Long Hui’s hands ever has a good time. You’d better obediently submit to me. I promise I’ll treat you well!”

“Shameless!” Xia Ningshang continued to glare.

“I’ll count to three. If you don’t surrender, don’t blame me for giving you no chance!” Yuan Lang’s expression turned cold as he issued his final ultimatum, then slowly began counting, “One...”

Their hands never ceased moving during the exchange of words, the fierce battle raging on.

“Two...” Yuan Lang deliberately dragged out the count.

Xia Ningshang’s eyes curved into crescent moons. Though her face was covered by a veil, Yuan Lang was certain she was smiling.

She smiled so beautifully! For a moment, he hesitated to utter the final word.

“Have you made up your mind?” Yuan Lang asked, thinking she had changed her mind.

Her eyes still curved like moons, she snapped, “Do you think you’re the only one who can call for help?”

“What?” Yuan Lang was confused.

“I can call for help too.” Xia Ningshang glanced behind him, her voice trembling with a hint of tears as she stomped her foot, “Junior Brother, you’ve finally arrived!”

Yuan Lang didn’t even turn his head, sneering, “Trying to trick me with such a cheap trick? Do you take me for a fool?”

“You really are a fool.” A cold voice suddenly came from behind. Yuan Lang’s face changed drastically. He hurried to turn and face the threat, but Xia Ningshang gave him no chance. She launched a fierce assault, leaving him scrambling. The narrow crevice trapped him, and he was caught halfway, unable to advance or retreat—an utterly embarrassing predicament.

A sharp sound rang out... Yuan Lang felt a sudden pain in his back. Something sharp had pierced through him. Looking down, he saw the tip of a sword protruding from his chest.
