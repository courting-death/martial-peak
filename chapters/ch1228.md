## Chapter 1228 — Red Candle Base

Li Younan wore an ashen look, nearly collapsing to the ground; he thought the Red Candle Fruit was doomed and would surely be tragically ruined.

At that moment a bolt of lightning struck; as electric sparks flashed the energy column's force weakened considerably, yet it was not entirely dispelled. Under everyone's horrified gaze the energy column slammed into the Red Candle Fruit, leaving everyone utterly shaken.

Whoosh……

The Red Candle Fruit, which until then had remained untouched by the surrounding scuffle, was struck by the energy and shot straight out of the valley.

To everyone's surprise, this seemingly fragile, thin-skinned heaven-defying spirit fruit remained completely unharmed by the blow.

Everyone rejoiced and unleashed their movement techniques, lunging out of the valley—an even more perilous fight had begun.

Earlier, when the Red Candle Fruit lay on the valley floor and red energy swirled, the others had merely stood on the hillocks, each using their methods to claim the spirit fruit without much direct confrontation. But now the Red Candle Fruit had left the valley, throwing the scene into greater chaos; with so many sect elites colliding, there would inevitably be a dragon-and-tiger struggle.

Over at Yingyue Hall's side, Wei Guchang hesitantly glanced at Yang Kai; Yang Kai still showed no sign of opening his eyes, which left him frustrated.

Just as he wondered whether to leave Xuan'er behind to guard the place, Yang Kai suddenly spoke, "You three go ahead, don't worry about me!"

Hearing this, Wei Guchang's expression brightened; after a slight nod he, Xuan'er, and Daiyuan shot off. As long as Yang Kai wasn't sunk in some deep realm of comprehension, there was no need to worry about him being ambushed.

After Wei Guchang and the others left, Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes; his gaze gleamed brilliantly, scintillating with energy, and a flash of joy momentarily passed.

At last, in the final moments before the Red Candle Fruit matured, he clarified the vague idea in his mind. Though he felt his control over Saint Yuan had advanced another level, now was not the time to test it.

He glanced tens of zhang away; although Yang Kai had weathered many storms, the scene before him still caused his brow to crease.

Dozens of Third Stage of the Saint King Realm elite warriors were desperately unleashing their martial skills and activating secret treasures, fighting in clusters of three or five with brutal ferocity and no mercy. Although the scene was explosively violent, in almost every faction there were one or two people who had split their focus to watch the Red Candle Fruit.

It was strange indeed: ever since a cultivator from the Star Emperor Sect blasted the Red Candle Fruit out of the valley, it still hadn't fallen. Whenever it seemed about to drop toward a particular warrior, subtle energy fluctuations would at the right moment sweep it aside, sending it to continue drifting through the air.

The cold warrior from the Star Emperor Sect stood out even more: Fang Tianzhong, Wei Guchang and Qu Changfeng formed a pincer, pinning him down so he couldn't get involved with the Red Candle Fruit. Yet the man still displayed great might—fending off three opponents without showing much disadvantage. Although this wasn't a life-and-death duel, it was astonishing that one man alone could resist three rising talents.

Yang Kai watched with silent alarm; he immediately realized this man from the Star Emperor Sect was not to be trifled with.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai knew that barring some unexpected event, the ownership of this Red Candle Fruit couldn't be decided quickly; only after a certain number of deaths and the full eruption of everyone's strength would it possibly settle.

But who would ultimately claim it was impossible to predict.

Yang Kai wasn't uninterested in the Red Candle Fruit; after all, this heaven-defying spirit fruit was an Upper-Level Void King-Grade item, something even he had never seen. Using it in pill-refinement would greatly benefit his alchemy; once refined into a pill, it could also help Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators break through to the Void King Realm. In the right hands, such a spirit fruit could produce at least four or five Void King Realm experts.

But the fighting scene was far too chaotic.

Yang Kai reckoned that even if he charged in, his chances of seizing the Red Candle Fruit were less than ten percent; it wouldn't be worth getting himself into trouble for nothing.

Besides, it was a hot potato—unless one of those dozens of elites seized it and could hold it, if the Red Candle Fruit fell into the hands of someone without a vast backing like him, it would only invite disaster.

So he had long decided not to get involved in the scramble for the Red Candle Fruit. Because of this detached mindset he had been meditating there without the slightest temptation.

However... although he wouldn't take part in the scramble for the Red Candle Fruit, that didn't mean Yang Kai had no other plans.

Glancing at the valley thick with red energy, Yang Kai grinned slyly. While everyone's attention was fixed on the Red Candle Fruit, he slipped down into the valley and vanished into the red mist.

Although the Red Candle Fruit was indeed precious and rare, the root-stem that gave birth to it was also a rare treasure.

The root-stem of the Red Candle Fruit was called the Red Candle Base; if planted in an area rich with Spiritual Qi, it could absorb that qi and produce spirit fruits like the Red Candle Fruit at its tip.

Of course, such fruits weren't true Red Candle Fruits and lacked the Red Candle Fruit's ability to help Origin Returning Realm cultivators break through, but they did possess a capacity to temper a cultivator's body.

And it was precisely this ability of the spirit fruit that Yang Kai coveted.

The benefits of a powerful body were obvious: his physical form was many times stronger than warriors of the same level; even an ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator could not compare in bodily strength.

As his strength rose and he encountered higher-level cultivators, Yang Kai found his physical strength was subtly holding him back; in recent days he'd been injured repeatedly, which warned him to be cautious.

Furthermore, after he used the power to rend space, he needed an exceptionally strong body as a backbone; otherwise he couldn't withstand the crushing killing force of those spatial rifts.

If he could obtain a Red Candle Base and occasionally take one of its spirit fruits to temper his body, it would be perfect; given enough time he could once again raise his bodily strength.

Then whether fighting others or tearing open space, it would be immensely easier.

He had no use for the Red Candle Fruit right now, and he believed that with his ability and everything he currently had, breaking through to the Void King Realm shouldn't be a problem—what he lacked was only time. But the Red Candle Base was what he needed now, so he wouldn't join the scramble for the fruit; instead he planned to sneak away with the Red Candle Base.

Yang Kai's scheme, however, had been thought of by someone else as well.

When he stealthily entered the valley and searched the red-mist-shrouded place for the Red Candle Base, he saw a vague figure gleefully stuff something into their Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai didn't know who the person was, but he knew with certainty that what they had taken was the Red Candle Base.

That someone would stay behind to collect the Red Candle Base at such a time meant they understood the Red Candle Fruit very well. Daiyuan was out there fighting, and Li Younan of the Medicine Pill Sect was also engaged in combat outside—so it couldn't be either of them.

Then the person remaining here was very likely a member of the Medicine Pill Sect, probably left behind on Li Younan's instructions.

When Yang Kai discovered him, the man clearly noticed Yang Kai as well; in alarm his Saint Yuan surged violently, but before he could unleash any killing move, a puff sounded and he let out a brief, miserable scream before going completely still.

A metallic scent of blood spread; Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled and he darted before the person who had taken the Red Candle Base. Without thinking, he snatched their Spatial Ring and quickly withdrew.

Yang Kai's movements were incredibly fast; in that instant of close proximity he saw a scene that made his skin crawl.

The one who had taken the Red Candle Base was indeed a disciple of the Medicine Pill Sect, as Yang Kai had guessed. But from his chest an arm had thrust out of his body; that huge hand still clutched the disciple's heart, which thudded powerfully.

Moreover, the arm was unusual—withered like a dry branch—yet it could suck the disciple's blood essence. Before stepping back, Yang Kai plainly saw the Medicine Pill Sect disciple's corpse rapidly wither into a dessicated husk.

There was a third person!

Whoever that third person was, to be able to ambush and kill a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior in an instant using such bizarre means was unquestionably extraordinary.

Almost the instant he snatched the Spatial Ring, another hand reached out—only to grasp at empty air—prompting a soft exclamation.

Puff……

Something burst with a crack; the Medicine Pill Sect disciple's corpse in front of Yang Kai shattered, scattering pieces, yet behind him there was no one—the mysterious third person who had killed him had vanished as if fully merged into the surroundings.

In this valley thick with red energy, sight was obstructed—beyond three chi nothing could be seen.

Without thinking, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense; wisps of near-imperceptible Divine Sense Threads spread around him like an all-encompassing net, probing every pocket of space and every corner. To his alarm, the third person truly was gone—his powerful Divine Sense could not detect a trace.

But he knew the other person hadn't left; since they stayed here, they surely had their sights on the Red Candle Base. Now that the Red Candle Base was in his hands, if they wanted it they'd inevitably come for him.

Suddenly a faint movement ran through one of the Divine Sense Threads around Yang Kai's body. Normally he wouldn't pay it any attention, but at that moment every hair on his body stood on end. He spun around and a blazing ball of Demonic Flame rolled atop his fist, roaring heavily into a patch of the void.
