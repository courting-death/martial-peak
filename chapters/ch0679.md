## Chapter 679 — What Does This Mean

Time passed in a blink; Yang Kai had been at the Leiguang Divine Cult for two months. Two months was neither short nor long, but Yang Kai still couldn't decide whether to rely on the Leiguang Divine Cult to achieve his aims.

From his inquiries during that time, he discovered the Leiguang Divine Cult harbored many unsavory dealings, which made him uneasy.

After Ji Meng paid the Spirit-Grade Pills to the Divine Cult's main altar for the second time, she reported a message to Yang Kai: "Elder Duan wishes you to come to the main altar."

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "What for?"

"The Elder didn't say." Ji Meng shook her head. "He only asked you to come as soon as possible. He has important matters to discuss."

"Mm, I understand." Yang Kai nodded. After Duan Hai had brought him here last time, he had not appeared again. As the Great Elder of the Leiguang Divine Cult, Duan Hai surely had many affairs to attend to; Yang Kai understood that.

"Shall we leave now?" Ji Meng asked, seeking his opinion.

"We can." Yang Kai had no intention of delaying; Yang Kai nodded without hesitation and followed Ji Meng, flying toward the Leiguang Divine Cult’s main altar.

This was Yang Kai's first time going to the Leiguang main altar; unfamiliar with the place, he naturally needed Ji Meng to guide him. They flew a long while before arriving gradually at a bustling hub.

From the sky, vast clusters of buildings stretched below. Many cultivators clad in golden uniforms walked the streets, and numerous people flew through the air, all hurrying about.

The entire Leiguang Divine Cult brimmed with vitality; countless martial artists filled its ranks, and formidable figures emerged one after another.

Yang Kai watched and nodded repeatedly, full of admiration.

Leiguang was not a great power on the Tongxuan Continent; within a radius of several thousand Li it was not top-tier. The pinnacle was Tianxiao Sect, a mighty force with Saint Realm masters in residence. Others like Rashomon Gate and Ancient Moon Sanctuary also had greater resources than Leiguang.

Among those four powers, Leiguang ranked near the bottom, yet it still possessed considerable foundation—an advantage Yang Kai’s home world could never match.

When Ji Meng landed directly before an imposing building, Yang Kai produced his Guest Official Nameplate. The guarding disciples hurriedly bowed with respect, seemingly unaccustomed to seeing such a young guest official. They glanced at Yang Kai often, faces full of astonishment.

"You can go up from here; Elder Duan is waiting for you there," Ji Meng indicated.

"Aren't you coming in?"

"I don't have the qualifications to go in." Ji Meng stammered.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Wait for me here a moment; we'll return together afterward."

"Alright." Ji Meng replied cheerfully.

He ascended stair after stair. After a long climb, Yang Kai arrived before the great hall. The doors stood wide open, and he stepped inside.

Duan Hai was there waiting. When he saw Yang Kai arrive, he immediately offered a faint smile and rose to greet him.

"Elder Duan." Yang Kai cupped his fist in salutation.

"Guest Official Yang, two months without seeing you. How have you been?"

"Not bad."

"Have my Divine Cult disciples been attentive in their service? If Guest Official Yang is dissatisfied, I can have someone else attend you; I will ensure your satisfaction."

"No need. Ji Meng is quite good." Yang Kai shook his head.

"As you wish." Duan Hai smiled broadly and invited Yang Kai to sit. Disciples presented fragrant tea; after drinking for a while, Yang Kai asked, "Elder Duan, I wonder what you wished to discuss by summoning me?"

"You're too kind!" Duan Hai hastily waved a hand with humble expression. "There's nothing major this time. I always speak with every guest official who comes to our Divine Cult."

Yang Kai's expression remained calm; he knew Duan Hai was trying to curry favor and build a relationship, a common tactic used by all powers to win hearts.

"Previously you mentioned you could not remain with the Divine Cult permanently. May I ask if you have some pressing matter to attend to?" Duan Hai asked with a squinting smile. "If you do, Guest Official Yang should not be shy to speak a single word; our Divine Cult will offer wholehearted assistance."

"If that time comes, I won't be shy." Yang Kai chuckled.

"That would be best." Duan Hai nodded gently. "By the way, you did say before that when the time was right you would have the Divine Cult do you a favor. May I ask whether the time is now?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"I understand." Duan Hai laughed boisterously. "It appears Guest Official Yang has little attachment to our Divine Cult and no intention of belonging to it; you even seem somewhat distrustful."

Yang Kai frowned and stared intently at Duan Hai, feeling wary. Duan Hai's words clearly bore deeper meaning.

"If it were possible, I would very much hope Guest Official Yang would join the Divine Cult and become one of us," Duan Hai suddenly assumed a grave expression. "But Guest Official Yang seems disinclined, and yet I am eager to uncover the secrets you carry!"

Saying that, he tapped his foot lightly on the ground.

Suddenly, centered on Yang Kai, array runes lit up on the surrounding floor. The patterns contracted swiftly and, before he could react, surged into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai's face changed violently; he immediately began to circulate his True Yuan.

But the moment his True Yuan moved, his meridians throbbed with unbearable pain, as if billions of ants were gnawing at them. His flesh shuddered, and the power he had only just gathered instantly crumbled away.

"Elder Duan, what does this mean?" Yang Kai asked without the slightest panic, checking his condition while turning a cold face toward Duan Hai.

Duan Hai shook his head in disappointment, his face showing some hesitation as he spoke loudly: "Forgive me, Guest Official Yang. I truly did not wish to do this. A Spirit-Grade alchemist of your age would be a tremendous asset to our Divine Cult, but you have no intention of joining us. I believe that no matter how much I try, I will not be able to win you over."

"Heh heh." Yang Kai laughed. "Elder Duan, I haven't done anything to harm the Leiguang Divine Cult, have I?"

"You certainly haven't. I told you, I only acted out of helplessness," Duan Hai said heavily, shaking his head.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered. Though he hadn't yet figured out the reason, the fact remained he had fallen into someone else's trap.

He had come to the Leiguang Divine Cult entirely because of Elder Du. Now he wondered whether Elder Du had any hand in this affair.

Thinking that, Yang Kai fixed his gaze on the screen behind Duan Hai and said coldly, "Would this friend please step out for a moment? Hiding behind a screen and peeking out is meaningless."

He vaguely felt Duan Hai's sudden change of attitude had much to do with whoever hid behind that screen.

Xu Qi, hearing this, was startled; he hadn't expected Yang Kai's intuition to be so sharp. After a moment's thought, he stepped out brazenly.

When Yang Kai saw Xu Qi's face clearly, he suddenly understood.

This was someone he had seen before.

Back when they were outside Blazing Fire City of the Duao Alliance, among the group chasing the Coffin-Bearer, this man had been present.

No wonder the name Leiguang Divine Cult had sounded familiar; Yun Xuan had once mentioned it to him.

At that instant, Yang Kai's understanding cleared.

The whole root of the matter lay with the Coffin-Bearer.

"I see now!" Yang Kai let out a bitter laugh. The Tongxuan Continent was so vast; he had not expected to be noticed so soon after emerging from the Small Xuan Realm.

Back then in Blazing Fire City, only a handful had witnessed him being captured by the Coffin-Bearer—who would have thought it would lead to this day?

No matter how wary Yang Kai was, he could not avoid such a situation.

"I should let Guest Official Yang know: the curse you suffer is my exclusive binding charm. Do not think you can break it. The more you use your True Yuan, the worse you will feel," Duan Hai said with regretful eyes. "I do not wish to trouble you; if you cooperate obediently, I guarantee you no harm will come to you."

Yang Kai gave a cold, mocking laugh. "Elder Duan, aren't you afraid Elder Du will learn of this and hold you responsible?"

Duan Hai shook his head. "Although Elder Du favors you, if he inquires, I have my explanations. You needn't worry about that."

Now Yang Kai was certain Elder Du knew nothing of this matter, which brought him some small comfort.

If even Elder Du had conspired against him, then Yang Kai would only be able to call himself a fool.

Sensing the cultivations of Duan Hai and Xu Qi, Yang Kai forced himself to remain patient and did not act rashly.

Both men were at Transcendent, Second Stage; even if he used all his strength he could not escape them. Besides, this was the Leiguang Divine Cult's main altar, teeming with masters. With his True Yuan sealed by their charm, reckless action would only make things worse.

"May I ask why Elder Duan chose to act only today? You could have struck the moment I arrived," Yang Kai decided to stall, looking for any chance to escape.

Duan Hai replied helplessly, "I told you, I admired you and did not want to move against you, and Elder Du did once tell me you had a strong backing. But after two months of observation and inquiry, I found you would leave sooner or later, and you are not as Elder Du described—you are just a boy from some backwater."

"So Elder Duan grew complacent?" Yang Kai sneered at him.

Duan Hai was noncommittal. "Guest Official Yang, I won't waste words. I did this because I want to learn the Coffin-Bearer's secret. After he captured you, what actually happened? How did you escape from him? Where is he hiding? If you can tell me these things, I will let you go."

"I don't know either." Yang Kai snorted. He had killed to silence others before and would not easily trust Duan Hai. If Duan Hai dared act, he would do so utterly; as long as Yang Kai kept that secret, Duan Hai would not truly harm him—but if Yang Kai spoke, he would be dead the next moment.

"Senior Brother, don't waste words on him. Let me perform the Soul-Searching Technique and extract the secret from his Sea of Consciousness," Xu Qi stepped forward, his voice cold.

Duan Hai sighed. "Guest Official Yang, you see my junior brother is nothing like me; he is impatient. If you do not want to become an idiot from the Soul-Searching Technique, you'd best cooperate."

The two of them played the red-faced and black-faced roles, hoping to smash Yang Kai's psychological defenses with words so he would submit obediently—their hearts were utterly cunning.
