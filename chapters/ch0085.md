## Chapter 85 — Dark Undercurrents

The next morning, outside the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai lightly knocked on the door.

After a moment, the heavy gates swung open, and Xia Ningshang slipped out, a small bundle slung over her shoulder, packed with numerous items.

“Junior Brother, you’ve arrived,” Xia Ningshang greeted softly.

“Mm,” Yang Kai nodded. “Where is Shopkeeper Meng?”

“He suddenly relapsed yesterday with an old injury and must stay behind to recover. He can’t come,” Xia Ningshang explained, her eyes flickering nervously, her long lashes fluttering like delicate fans.

Yang Kai studied her with suspicion, catching a trace of unease in her gaze.

“Should we wait for him?” Though Yang Kai harbored his own suspicions, he did not press the matter.

“No need. I know where we’re headed, and time is short. Master said we shouldn’t wait for him.” Seeing Yang Kai did not pry further, Xia Ningshang relaxed.

“Very well.” After a brief hesitation, Yang Kai agreed.

“This time, Junior Brother, I’ll be relying on you,” Xia Ningshang exhaled deeply.

“Sister, you are too polite,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

The two then departed Lingxiao Pavilion lightly equipped.

Inside a side chamber of the Contribution Hall, Meng Wuya lay face down on a table, snoring deeply. Several plates of exquisite dishes and a few pots of fine wine were spread before him, evidence that Shopkeeper Meng had been savoring a feast before succumbing to slumber.

These delicacies were all crafted by Xia Ningshang herself, though laced with a special seasoning. Forged from her Medicine Spirit Saint Body, this unique concoction was potent enough to overwhelm even a master like Meng Wuya.

This sleep would likely last several days at the very least.

Meng Wuya, ever shrewd, never imagined he would one day stumble so gravely, falling prey to the hands of his treasured disciple. Truly, a single misstep that would haunt him forever—a great ship capsizing in a narrow gutter.

By the time Meng Wuya awoke, all would likely be settled beyond reversal.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang arrived at Wumei Town, purchasing two horses and gathering daily necessities before setting off toward the distant horizon.

While shopping, Yang Kai inquired about their destination. According to Xia Ningshang, it lay roughly ten days’ journey from Wumei Town, deep within Black Wind Mountain. Though the path was long, they still had ample time.

Not long after their departure from Lingxiao Pavilion, this news reached the ears of Jie Hongchen.

Since the day he had witnessed the intimacy between Su Yan and Yang Kai in the Forest Prison, Jie Hongchen had drowned his sorrows in wine for several days, his heart heavy with frustration. Only yesterday did his mind clear, and upon reflection, he realized the scene was not as it seemed.

He knew Su Yan’s nature well. Proud and powerful, how could she stoop to notice a mere Open Origin Realm Third Stage like Yang Kai? Moreover, the two had barely interacted before—practically strangers.

Jie Hongchen finally understood that Su Yan and Yang Kai had been merely putting on a show. Overcome with jealousy and rage, he had not paused to consider the truth.

Now enlightened, his spirit revived, he had gone to confess his feelings to Su Yan yesterday with grace and composure, no longer the wild and reckless man he had been.

Though ultimately rebuffed, he felt his inner knot loosen.

As long as Su Yan remained unattached, she would be his one day! Jie Hongchen was confident—he was Lingxiao Pavilion’s finest male disciple, and Su Yan its best female disciple. Their union would surely be blessed by their elders.

Early this morning, Jie Hongchen prepared himself carefully, intending to visit Su Yan at the Black Wind Trade Market.

But just as he was about to leave, a disciple from the Enforcement Hall hurried in, face alight with excitement.

“Senior Brother Jie, Yang Kai just left Lingxiao Pavilion.”

Jie Hongchen’s eyes brightened. “Did he leave alone?”

“No, he left with a disciple from the Shadow Hall named Xia Ningshang,” the disciple replied.

“Xia Ningshang!” Jie Hongchen narrowed his eyes. “I know her. Her strength rivals mine, but she is not a Core Disciple. That woman has always been strange!”

“Where are they headed?” Jie Hongchen pondered, a wild gleam suddenly flashing in his eyes. Fortune smiled upon him—this worthless wretch was leaving Lingxiao Pavilion at last. If only he could be slain outside, it would settle the grudge in his heart!

“We don’t know their destination, but it seems they are traveling far, as they bought two horses in Wumei Town.”

“Traveling far?” Jie Hongchen raised an eyebrow. “Good, very good.”

Repeating his approval several times, Jie Hongchen suddenly turned, his face twisted with malice.

“Find a few trusted brothers, each at least Separation and Union Realm. Come with me.”

“Senior Brother, what do you intend to do?”

“Heh heh, don’t you know? Why ask?” Jie Hongchen’s expression contorted. He planned to pursue and eliminate Yang Kai, his rival in love, and Xia Ningshang would not be spared either. If word leaked, it would be no small matter.

“Senior Brother, this is unwise,” the Enforcement Hall disciple said nervously. Yang Kai was but an Open Origin Realm trial disciple—his death would hardly stir concern. But Xia Ningshang was different. Her background was unknown, but with peak Separation and Union Realm strength, she was no minor figure. If she died, those involved would surely face severe consequences.

“Do as I say and stop nagging! Must I find the men myself?” Jie Hongchen snapped impatiently.

Blinded by jealousy, his mind was consumed with the thought of killing Yang Kai.

“Senior Brother, remember the Eldest elder brother’s strict order after the last incident—no one is to harm Yang Kai for the time being. Have you forgotten?”

Jie Hongchen was jolted awake by the reminder. Indeed, the Eldest elder brother had issued a sudden decree forbidding any trouble for Yang Kai temporarily. Though puzzling, Jie Hongchen had not taken it seriously.

But such a golden opportunity—should it be wasted? If he did not kill Yang Kai now, who knew when the chance would come again? What if Yang Kai stayed hidden within the sect forever?

Just as his resentment peaked, the Enforcement Hall disciple grinned slyly.

“Senior Brother Jie, we cannot act, but others can. Many covet Yang Kai’s life.”

“What do you mean?” Jie Hongchen narrowed his eyes.

“That would be Long Hui, the grandson of Long Zaitian, Vice Leader of the Blood Battle Gang. For the past month, he has been seeking news of Yang Kai.”

Jie Hongchen knew Long Zaitian well—a prominent figure within the Blood Battle Gang and a Divine Roaming Realm powerhouse. His grandson was less remarkable, only Qi Movement Realm this year.

“Hm?” Jie Hongchen was puzzled. “Why is Long Hui after him?”

The disciple’s expression darkened with implication. “It seems connected to that enchantress Hu Mei’er. Long Hui has long pursued her, claiming her as his forbidden treasure. But Yang Kai’s relationship with Hu Mei’er is ambiguous. Long Hui has vowed to kill Yang Kai one day, to show him the price of coveting another man’s woman.”

“Hu Mei’er!” Jie Hongchen pictured a voluptuous, alluring young woman, his breath growing heavy.

That enchantress was notorious for stirring hearts. Nearly all young disciples in the three factions had heard of her. Jie Hongchen had once encountered her himself.

“That worthless wretch truly is no good, consorting with such a temptress!” Jie Hongchen seethed with jealousy, though his words were righteous indignation.

Pausing, he grew suspicious. “Wait, where did you hear such detailed information?”

Even if Long Hui wished to kill Yang Kai, he would not advertise it so openly. That would only alert Yang Kai, who would never dare leave Lingxiao Pavilion again. Long Hui was no fool.

The disciple’s face flushed, hesitating to answer.

“Speak!” Jie Hongchen’s tone darkened.

“Alright,” the disciple confessed. “A few days ago, I was drinking at the Spring Breeze and Gentle Rain Pavilion in Wumei Town. Long Hui was staying next door, and I overheard him speaking to a woman inside.”

“Spring Breeze and Gentle Rain Pavilion!” Jie Hongchen shot a sharp glance at the disciple. That was a brothel in Wumei Town. His presence there needed no explanation—it was hardly for mere drinking.

The disciple continued, “Senior Brother Jie, if Long Hui learns this, he will not let Yang Kai live. We need not act ourselves. Moreover, Long Hui is lecherous. If we tell him there is a peerless beauty by Yang Kai’s side, what do you think he will do?”

Jie Hongchen’s eyes gleamed coldly. “A perfect scheme!”

Using others to do his dirty work was indeed clever. After a moment’s thought, he decided, “Since Long Hui seeks him, we will send word—but it must be done secretly. Under no circumstances can he know the source of the information. Also, tell Long Hui that the woman beside Yang Kai is a peak Separation and Union Realm expert. He must not act rashly and lose his prize.”

“Yes!” The disciple hurried off.

Yang Kai, this time we shall see if you live or die. Yet… it is a pity for Xia Ningshang. That woman always veiled her face. Though I have never seen her features, I am almost certain she is a peerless beauty.

If such a woman fell into Long Hui’s hands, her fate would be dire beyond imagining. For a moment, Jie Hongchen found himself envying Long Hui.

While the Enforcement Hall of Lingxiao Pavilion stirred with restless intent, another group moved stealthily in a certain corner of Wumei Town.

Shortly after Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang rode away, a group emerged from the shadows. The leader, face cold and grim, fixed his gaze on Yang Kai’s retreating figure.

“Are you sure? That man is Yang Kai?”

“Absolutely, Senior Brother Nu Lang. It was him without a doubt. Last time, he beat us badly. Then Senior Brother Cheng Shaofeng sought out Senior Brother Nu Tao, planning to teach him a lesson. But since that trip to the Black Wind Trade Market, neither has returned.”

Nu Lang’s face darkened. With a wave, he ordered, “Buy some horses. We follow! I must know if my brother is alive or dead, and where he is!”

Nu Taoo had been missing for over a month, vanished alongside Cheng Shaofeng. Nu Lang had searched everywhere, finally tracing the matter to Yang Kai.

The truth remained unknown. Nu Lang intended to catch Yang Kai and question him thoroughly. If Yang Kai was involved, Nu Lang, as an elder brother, would avenge his sibling.
