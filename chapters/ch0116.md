## Chapter 116 — That Kiss

Yang Kai’s expression shifted repeatedly.

He had never expected such a turn of events. Although through experimentation he knew he could absorb energies other than Yang attribute and store them in his bones, how had he ended up absorbing half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew as well? And at such a fierce rate.

After all, this was something Xia Ningshang needed. What was he to do?

Turning his head, Yang Kai’s face grew somewhat awkward. He did not know how to explain this to her when Xia Ningshang, carrying a faint fragrance, suddenly appeared before him.

At this moment, the young senior sister’s cheeks were flushed with a rosy glow, her breath slightly hurried, and her clear, innocent eyes revealed a mixture of panic and shyness.

“Junior Brother… please bear with me,” Xia Ningshang suddenly spoke, slowly reaching out a hand to wrap around Yang Kai’s neck, gently pulling his head downward.

Her hand was somewhat cold, yet soft as if boneless, like the first snowflake drifting down in early winter, bringing a refreshing chill to Yang Kai.

Rising onto her toes, Xia Ningshang closed her eyes, her long eyelashes trembling nervously. Then, lifting her veil and tilting her head slightly, she pressed her ruby-red lips, as delicate as a gem, against Yang Kai’s.

Two soft lips met, and a sweet feminine fragrance lingered at his nostrils.

Yang Kai was stunned.

At that moment, he finally understood why, when he had asked how to collect the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, both Shopkeeper Meng and Xia Ningshang had been evasive and unwilling to explain.

He had not fully grasped the reason before, but now it dawned on him.

Heavenly spiritual treasures require countless unique methods to be tamed; every sentient treasure demands a different approach. And the method for collecting the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was so beautiful, so sweet!

With their lips joined, Yang Kai’s breath quickened, his throat burning with heat. Though the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was in his mouth, it could not suppress the surge of passion coursing through his body.

Xia Ningshang was even more overwhelmed. After pressing her lips onto his, she remained motionless like a statue, her face flushed as if stained with tears of blood, her heartbeat pounding like war drums, utterly bewildered and flustered.

Though Yang Kai did not fully understand the principles or exact method of taming the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, he knew they could not remain in this state indefinitely.

Without hesitation, he wrapped one arm around Xia Ningshang’s slender waist, drawing her closer. Then, using his tongue to envelop the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew in his mouth, he pried open her pearly teeth and sent the heavenly spiritual treasure into her mouth.

The coldness of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew stimulated Xia Ningshang, who finally regained some composure and knew to accept it, swallowing it down.

A sweet sensation rippled endlessly on their tongues. Their bodies pressed tightly together, and Yang Kai leaned forward, his senses sharpening. A vigorous youth like him could hardly resist such temptation.

Almost instinctively, Yang Kai tightened one arm around Xia Ningshang, while his other hand climbed to her rounded, firm hips, kneading them.

Feeling the fullness at her chest, sensing the heat of her body, Yang Kai’s breathing grew even more rapid. After a moment’s fondling, his large hand moved to the front, climbing upward, freely massaging those two astonishingly resilient jade peaks.

A soft moan escaped Xia Ningshang’s lips. Yang Kai saw her large eyes slowly open a slit; her eyelashes fluttered. Realizing he had been staring, she quickly shut them in embarrassment.

Heavy breaths, bodily communication, the touch of tongues, the merging of souls—these young lovers had nearly forgotten everything around them, holding each other tightly, as if desperate to fuse their bodies into one.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s tongue ached sharply, and he let out a miserable cry.

Seizing the opportunity, Xia Ningshang pushed against his chest with both hands, biting lightly with her teeth, and forcefully pushed him away, breaking free from his embrace.

“Why did you bite me?” Yang Kai felt his tongue was bleeding; his mouth tasted faintly of blood.

Covering her chest with one hand, Xia Ningshang’s bosom heaved unevenly as she gasped for breath, struggling to calm her racing heart. After a long moment, she said, “I’m sorry. Refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew requires your innate Pure Yang energy and a drop of blood from your tongue!”

Taming the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew required pure Yang Yuan Qi— the purer, the better. Yang Kai’s cultivation of the True Yang Technique undoubtedly met this condition.

But to refine it, innate Pure Yang energy and a drop of tongue blood were necessary.

Innate Pure Yang energy is not something gained through cultivation; it is a mysterious force present in every man from birth, disappearing after intimate contact with a woman. This energy is usually useless and its loss does not affect the body, but in certain circumstances—such as this—it is required.

Earlier, Yang Kai had felt a surge of energy within him, wrapping the cold Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew; that was his innate Pure Yang energy.

That was why Shopkeeper Meng had seriously asked if Yang Kai was still a boy. Only a boy’s body possesses innate Pure Yang energy, and only tongue blood from a boy could be used to refine the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Hearing Xia Ningshang’s explanation, Yang Kai touched his mouth and said seriously, “I see. Is one drop enough? If not, I have more.”

Just a few drops of tongue blood?

Xia Ningshang was so shy she wished to disappear into the ground, nodding repeatedly, “Enough! One drop is enough!”

“Oh.” Yang Kai felt a bit disappointed, recalling the taste and touch from moments ago, savoring the memory. This was his first time sharing such intimacy with a woman.

“Junior Sister…” Yang Kai stammered, his eyes burning with passion.

Xia Ningshang immediately panicked. She could not miss the hidden meaning in his words.

Quickly, she said, “You are injured. You should heal first. I must also hurry to refine the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.”

“Oh!” Yang Kai recalled that she had once said the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew would vanish completely if not refined within an hour of acquisition.

“By the way, about this…” Yang Kai was about to tell her that he had accidentally absorbed half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, but before he could finish, his vision darkened, the world spun wildly, and he collapsed to the ground, consciousness rapidly fading.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ningshang was alarmed, rushing forward to support him. After a brief examination, her face turned pale.

She found Yang Kai’s pulse extremely weak, his vitality faint and flickering, his Yuan Qi desolate and chaotic, as if his life force was nearly extinguished.

This was a grave matter. Xia Ningshang’s heart nearly shrank with fear.

How could this be? He was fine just moments ago, even with her… How could he suddenly lose consciousness without warning?

But this examination revealed the severity of Yang Kai’s injuries.

His wounds on the abdomen and shoulder were obvious and had been bandaged, but after the fierce battle, the wounds reopened, blood flowing freely. The most serious was the injury to his chest—five ribs fractured, caved inward, nearly piercing his heart and lungs. Wen Feichen’s furious palm strike was not something easily resisted.
