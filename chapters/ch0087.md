## Chapter 87 — The Sorrow of the Furious Waves

Wen Feichen’s eager flattery of Long Hui was not without reason.

Although Hu Man, the Blood Battle Gang’s leader, was a formidable tyrant in his time, fate was unkind—he had no sons, only two daughters as beautiful as blooming flowers.

In Wen Feichen’s eyes, the vast legacy of the Blood Battle Gang would inevitably fall into the hands of the Long family. Naturally, it was wise to cultivate a good relationship with this young master Long. When the Long family eventually took control of the Blood Battle Gang, surely there would be benefits for him as well.

After the group inside the room finished their discussion and prepared to rest, a gentle knock came from outside.

“Enter!” Wen Feichen commanded softly.

The door opened, and a Blood Battle Gang disciple on guard duty stepped in, saluted Long Hui, then leaned close to Wen Feichen’s ear and whispered a few words.

Wen Feichen’s expression immediately shifted, muttering, “So that’s how it is.”

He then cast a meaningful glance around the room and ordered, “Go and capture those people. We cannot allow them to ruin Young Master Long’s grand plan.”

“Yes!” The group responded in unison and quickly slipped out.

“What has happened?” Long Hui asked.

Wen Feichen chuckled lightly. “Young Master Long, this matter is truly intriguing. Do you recall the many horse hoofprints we saw along the way? Yet the intelligence we received stated that Yang Kai’s party consisted of only two people. At first, I suspected those extra hoofprints belonged to passersby, but it turns out… besides us, others have been tracking Yang Kai as well!”

“Oh?” Long Hui’s voice was tinged with suspicion. “Who?”

“A few minor figures from Fengyu Tower. It seems they are preparing to make a move against Yang Kai, unaware that the woman accompanying him possesses strength beyond their ability to contend with!”

“Courting death, indeed!” Long Hui sneered. “Wen Hall Master, have you arranged everything properly?”

“Of course, we cannot let them ruin Young Master Long’s grand design.” Wen Feichen nodded confidently.

As they spoke, several people suddenly surged back into the room. The Blood Battle Gang disciples who had gone out all returned without exception, accompanied by a visibly panicked group including Nu Lang.

Nu Lang and his companions were truly shaken to their core. They had only just managed to track down this place today. They had been planning inside the room to capture Yang Kai soon and gather information on the missing Nu Tao and Cheng Shaofeng.

Yet before they could act, they were seized by these fierce and formidable experts, whose strength far surpassed theirs.

Nu Lang was so terrified he nearly lost control of himself. Once thrown inside, he immediately dropped to his knees, kowtowing and begging for mercy. “Sirs, we have committed no offense against you. I beg you to show mercy!”

“Shut up!” A Blood Battle Gang disciple slapped him hard, blood spilling from his mouth. Nu Lang dared not resist, only obediently obeyed.

Trembling with fear, the Fengyu Tower group glanced around nervously. Though their strength was limited, they clearly saw that any one of these men could kill them with ease, not to mention the six or seven other experts standing nearby.

Who had they offended? No matter how hard they thought, they could not understand. They had done nothing truly wicked recently, only plotting to capture Yang Kai inside the room. But they had not yet acted—was such a grand show really necessary?

As Nu Lang looked around, his eyes suddenly fixed on a young man opposite him, who smiled gently while staring.

Upon closer thought, Nu Lang’s face changed drastically. He cautiously asked, “Are you Long Hui of the Blood Battle Gang?”

Long Hui chuckled softly. “You know me?”

Nu Lang gave an embarrassed smile. “Descendant of Elder Long, your reputation precedes you. Of course I recognize you.”

“Since you know me, this will be easier.” Long Hui nodded slightly.

Nu Lang was filled with doubt. How could he have encountered Blood Battle Gang forces so far away? Meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land was fortunate, but under the current circumstances… one must bow under the roof.

“I ask you, why are you pursuing Yang Kai?” Long Hui narrowed his eyes.

Nu Lang’s heart skipped a beat. He had thought Long Hui might blame him but dared not conceal the truth. He explained the whole matter and then hung his head in despair. “Young Master Long, I only suspected Yang Kai was connected to my brother’s disappearance. I never intended to harm him. If you find this problematic, I will immediately lead my men back to Fengyu Tower and never trouble Yang Kai again.”

Long Hui laughed. “Do you think I am friends with that Yang Kai?”

“Are you not?” Nu Lang’s expression was timid.

“What a joke!” Long Hui snorted coldly. “What status do I hold, and what status does he hold? Friends? You must be blind!”

Nu Lang dared not reply, but inwardly cursed. If they were not friends, why meddle in my feud? Isn’t that a dog chasing mice, meddling in others’ affairs?

“You ungrateful wretches! Young Master Long saved your lives, yet you show no gratitude!” a Blood Battle Gang disciple scolded sharply.

Nu Lang and the others were bewildered.

The disciple sneered, “You only know Yang Kai’s strength is low, but do you know the woman beside him is a peak Separation and Union Realm expert?”

At this, sweat poured down Nu Lang and the others’ faces. The peak Separation and Union Realm was nearly two realms beyond Nu Lang’s current Qi Movement Realm First Stage.

If a fight broke out, that woman alone could annihilate Nu Lang and the others.

Only now did Nu Lang realize the grave mistake they had made. Fear and relief overwhelmed him, and he kowtowed repeatedly. “Thank you, Young Master Long, for your timely rescue. We are deeply grateful!”

The minor figures from Fengyu Tower also hurried to express thanks.

“Hmph, good that you understand,” Long Hui looked pleased with their adulation. “Let me tell you, I came this time to take Yang Kai’s life. But I must wait a while longer. Because of your reckless actions, you almost spooked him and ruined my grand plan.”

“We were unaware, please forgive us, Young Master Long!” Nu Lang’s expression was full of fear.

“Forget it, I won’t hold it against you. Our goal is the same—Yang Kai. You will come with me. Once I capture Yang Kai, you can investigate your brother’s whereabouts.”

Though uneasy, Nu Lang knew their strength was too weak to resist. He nodded. “At your command, Young Master Long, we will follow you through fire and water, even unto death!”

“Return for now. I will seek you out again tomorrow.” Long Hui waved his hand.

“Yes!” Nu Lang and the others rose and slowly retreated. Once outside, they realized their clothes were soaked through.

After they left, Long Hui looked at Wen Feichen with curiosity. “Hall Master Wen, why bring them along? Their strength is too low and easily exposes us. Could it be that we cannot kill Yang Kai or capture that woman ourselves?”

The words Long Hui spoke had been whispered to him by Wen Feichen. Though he obeyed, Long Hui did not understand the reasoning.
