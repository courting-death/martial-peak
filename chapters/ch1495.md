## Chapter 1495 — A Presumptuous Request

This ancient sect’s ruins lay deep within the Fallen Emperor Mountains, covering an immense expanse. By Yang Kai’s estimation, it was in no way inferior to the Lingxiao Sect in scale, and the Spiritual Qi within was extraordinarily abundant—perhaps not quite on par with the present Lingxiao Sect, but not far behind either.

In days to come, this place will likely become a battleground that many great forces vie over!

With such superb conditions, those great Sects and powers will certainly not hand it over lightly; if one could turn it into the headquarters of one’s own Sect, it would greatly benefit the Sect’s future development.

Yang Kai already has Lingxiao Sect, so he was not particularly invested in this place; Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, however, were flushed with heat, clearly having thought this far.

Yingyue Hall’s headquarters is respectable, but compared with this place, it is plainly a notch lower; moreover, Yingyue Hall is close by—only a few days’ journey. If the headquarters could be moved here, the disciples’ growth would quicken.

Even if the headquarters were not moved, treating this place as a branch base would also be feasible.

Thus both Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were stirred; yet when they considered the hardships and obstacles involved, as well as the very real possibility of a Sect war erupting, they snuffed out that notion.

A treasure land like this was something the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect would never let slip through their fingers—Yingyue Hall likely wouldn’t even get a chance to touch it.

The three of them slipped from an unfrequented corner into the Sect’s interior; what greeted their eyes was a forest of palaces. Despite the passage of several tens of thousands of years, most of the structures here remained well preserved, with little damage.

Within their sight, quite a few cultivators had already each picked out different palaces, coming and going—plainly exploring.

Yang Kai exchanged a glance with Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu; unwilling to be idle, they immediately split up, each delving into a different palace to search.

Given the current situation, dispersing to search was naturally more efficient. Although the risk would increase somewhat, none of the three were timid sorts—why would they bind their hands and feet? There was no need for further discussion.

A short while later, Yang Kai stepped out of that palace, his expression calm.

He had gained nothing. Although the palace was intact, there was nothing of value within—in fact, it could be called empty.

This was only normal, and lay within Yang Kai’s expectations.

When he had led people deep into Lingxiao Sect’s interior that day, there had likewise been no treasures left behind there, so he was already mentally prepared for this.

The disciples of this ancient Sect had likely carried off all the good things before danger arrived; whether anything remained now would depend on luck.

Without lingering, Yang Kai quickly entered another palace.

Meanwhile, elsewhere within this ancient Sect, a group of Origin Returning Realm cultivators had gathered; at their head stood a man in green robes and a blue-robed middle-aged man—none other than Battle Sky Alliance’s Alliance Master Qu Zheng and Leitai Sect’s Sect Master Fang Peng.

At this moment, Qu Zheng held a Transmission Compass in his hand; after probing within it with his Divine Sense for a moment, he lifted his head and said, “That brat is ten li off to the left. Brother Fang, shall we make a move now?”

Fang Peng pondered for a moment and asked, “Are Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu together with him?”

“They seem to have separated,” Qu Zheng replied. “But even if they are together, it is of no consequence. A mere Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu—given our manpower, taking them down would not be any trouble.”

“That may be so, but those two are of Yingyue Hall. If we lay hands on them, Yingyue Hall’s side…” Fang Peng appeared somewhat apprehensive.

“What is Yingyue Hall worth? Star Emperor Mountain has already inserted itself. If Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu know what’s good for them, they will naturally know how to act. If they do not—hmph—Dark Star being short one Sect is no great matter.”

“There is sense in that,” Fang Peng sneered, feeling he had been too cautious.

“Father, since that brat is on good terms with Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, should we not seize those two as well? That would make him think twice before acting.” From within the crowd, a handsome, striking youth with straight brows and starry eyes rolled his gaze and spoke up. He held a folding fan, his hair bound with a gold fillet, skin fair—every inch suave and debonair.

Were Yang Kai here, he would certainly recognize this man as Qu Changfeng, the Young Alliance Master of Battle Sky Alliance, renowned among the younger generation on Dark Star.

Yang Kai’s poor impression of Battle Sky Alliance was largely because of this Qu Changfeng. The man’s conduct was wanton and vile; back in Flowing Flame Sandland, he had even tried to kill Yang Kai.

Naturally, Yang Kai had no good impression of him.

“Oh?” Qu Zheng raised a brow. “Why would we act against Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu? Those two old fellows are at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, two Stages higher than that brat. Would that not be putting the cart before the horse and asking for trouble?”

Fang Peng and the others also turned to look at Qu Changfeng, puzzled.

Qu Changfeng chuckled softly, his folding fan snapping open with a crisp sound. He gave it a casual shake and said, “That may be true, but as far as I know, that brat seems to command some grasp of Spatial Force. Even with our numbers, if we can’t cut off his escape route, he might seize the chance to slip away.”

“He understands Spatial Force?” Qu Zheng and Fang Peng both wore looks of shock.

“I heard the Great Elder mention it by chance. Father may as well ask the Great Elder—he should know best.” Qu Changfeng did not elaborate, but looked toward an old man in the crowd. This was Battle Sky Alliance’s Great Elder, Mo Xiaosheng.

Mo Xiaosheng stepped out at the call, his expression solemn as he said, “Correct, the Young Alliance Master has not misspoken. Yang Kai does indeed understand some Spatial Force. On the day of the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain, this old man witnessed it with his own eyes! Others might not perceive it, but it cannot be hidden from the eyes of one like this old man who has likewise cultivated Spatial Force.”

“He actually understands Spatial Force?” Qu Zheng’s brows knitted, his face full of surprise. As Battle Sky Alliance’s Alliance Master, he understood better than anyone how difficult Spatial Force is to cultivate.

This has little to do with aptitude; Spatial Force itself is abstruse and hard to fathom—hard to enter, harder still to train. Had Great Elder Mo Xiaosheng not met with a fortuitous encounter back then, he would never have touched this field; yet after so many years, his attainment in Spatial Force remains exceedingly shallow, unable to take a further step.

“Great Elder, in your view, how well does he command Spatial Force?”

“That day he only used Spatial Force once before this old man; it is hard to judge specifically, but it should be on par with this old man,” Mo Xiaosheng’s lips twitched. Loath as he was to admit that Yang Kai’s attainment in this domain was not far from his own, he had to: Yang Kai’s sudden disappearance before him had clearly been the result of some insight into Spatial Force. He himself could only achieve that much.

It is precisely because he understands some Spatial Force that he holds the post of Battle Sky Alliance’s Great Elder; otherwise, judging by the vigor and purity of Saint Yuan alone and the tempering of momentum, there are quite a few within the alliance stronger than he—how would it be his turn to be Great Elder?

From this, one can see how secretive and rare Spatial Force is.

“If that’s truly the case, then things will be troublesome.” Qu Zheng’s brows furrowed deeply. Even with the Great Elder as their anchor, capturing alive a cultivator who understood Spatial Force was by no means an easy task.

Yang Kai is merely at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; none present paid him any mind. Yet now, no one dared claim full confidence in taking him.

A cultivator who comprehends Spatial Force is bound to possess an exceedingly elusive movement technique and exceptional speed — such people are naturally gifted when it comes to escaping.

“In that case, we truly do need to make a move on Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu first, to make him think twice,” Fang Peng mused.

“Mm. Elder Liang, keep a close watch on Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. If there is an opening, seize the two of them first,” Qu Zheng instructed blandly. “As for Yingyue Hall’s side, I will handle the back-and-forth.”

“Yes!” The elder called Liang Yong—the one who had previously let Yang Kai pass—accepted the order and left at once.

“Father, this child has one presumptuous request!” Qu Changfeng closed his fan with one hand and cupped his fists respectfully.

“Speak,” Qu Zheng said. He doted on his son; before the crowd, he naturally would not bruise his face.

“If we truly block off Yang Kai’s retreat, please allow this child to take the field and battle him!” Qu Changfeng said in a deep voice.

“You?”

“Indeed. After that battle at Dragon Lair Mountain, that brat made quite a name for himself — he’s already hailed as the foremost of the younger generation. Rumor has it across Dark Star that his strength rivals even the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.” Qu Changfeng’s face carried a proud smile. “But in my view, that’s just empty talk. As for who truly stands at the peak of this generation… I intend to prove it myself.” He turned toward another youth in simple hemp robes and asked with an easy smile, “Brother Tianzhong, what do you think?”

This youth was none other than Fang Tianzhong, a name on par with Qu Changfeng’s. On this joint operation of Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect, the two youthful luminaries had come together.

Hands clasped behind his back, he had remained silent to the side. Hearing Qu Changfeng’s question, he merely lifted his eyelids and replied blandly, “A hollow reputation, nothing more. How outsiders choose to appraise him has nothing to do with this Fang.”

“Is that so? Then why did you tag along with such eager eyes—was it not to see with your own eyes how Yang Kai’s strength compares with your previous estimation?” Qu Changfeng chuckled, unceremonious. “Qu is a straightforward man; as for why I came, it is precisely to fight him. Since Brother Tianzhong has no such intention, Qu will take the vanguard.”

“Suit yourself,” Fang Tianzhong said, face indifferent.

“Good. Then it is settled. Have men keep constant watch on Yang Kai’s position. Find a secluded place with few people, and we will strike when the time comes. This is a mission handed down from Star Emperor Mountain—there is no room for even a hair’s breadth of error.” Qu Zheng, ever decisive, waved and barked low when he saw their discussion settled, and the crowd answered in unison.

As for his own son wanting to challenge Yang Kai, he naturally wouldn’t stop him — it was a good thing for the boy to have such a drive to compete.

None of this was known to Yang Kai. It would never occur to him that so many were presently fixated on him, each one harboring ill intent.

Though the ruins of this ancient Sect were vast, the number of cultivators delving into them was likewise not small. Not wishing to clash with others, he chose to explore only in relatively remote places.
