## Chapter 361 — Eagle Cry, Wind Surge

For months, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower had been through thick and thin together; from over a hundred disciples, only a dozen remained, and these few were united in heart and mind.

Seeing Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu pressuring the sisters from the Hu Family, how could they not be enraged?

Fang Ziqi sneered, looking at Nan Sheng and said, “Young Master Nan, Young Master Xiang, can a first-rate family arbitrarily decide the freedom and lives of us second-rate sect disciples?”

“What do you have to say?” Nan Sheng chuckled softly, gazing at Fang Ziqi with apparent disdain.

“If that's the case, then I have nothing more to say.”

“Then shut your mouth!” Nan Sheng flicked the dust off his sleeves and spoke indifferently, “If you want to blame anyone, blame your poor background. Do you think the division of sects and powers into three, six, and nine ranks exists for no reason? It’s to make you recognize your status and the disparity between you and us. If you came from a first-rate power, it wouldn't be me bullying you, would it?”

As he continued, Nan Sheng laughed lightly, seeming utterly oblivious to any problem with his words, a noble superiority radiating from him.

He went on, “If you were a member of a superpower, tsk tsk, I would be scrambling to curry favor with you. Hmph, the law of the jungle is simply that; it’s laughable you can’t see it. When you one day possess the strength and status to bully me, if you do manage to bully me, I guarantee there will not be a single grumble from me!”

“There will come a day.” Fang Ziqi said with a darkened expression.

Nan Sheng scoffed, curling his lip.

Yang Kai quietly watched from the sidelines, remaining silent, not taking action, merely observing the heated exchange between the two sides without expressing any intention to intervene, as if this matter had nothing to do with him.

However, the four experts from the Nan Family and Xiang Family in the Divine Roaming Realm were constantly on guard, wary of his movements.

Among all the young observers, only Yang Kai was an enigma to them. Although he was in the True Yuan Realm Sixth Stage, his vigorous vitality and the peculiar nature of his True Yuan were far from ordinary. Without truly engaging him, they could not fathom his strength.

Yang Kai had been watching for some time, hoping to see how many among them were worth befriending and how many were true to their words.

As the saying goes, the long road tests a horse's power. While time may not reveal true feelings, it certainly reveals one’s heart.

It is in the most trying times that one can see a person's true character and temperament.

If the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower opted for silence at such a time and chose not to intervene in their affairs, Yang Kai would not have found it strange at all.

Preserving oneself is also a way of handling matters. Currently, the Xiang Family and Nan Family had an absolute advantage, and the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower were simply unable to compete; pressing further would likely lead to their destruction.

What brought Yang Kai some comfort was that the three individuals he cared for did not disappoint him!

The sisters from the Hu Family and Fang Ziqi did not waver in the face of their adversaries' might, steadfastly standing in front of him.

Feeling a warmth in his heart, Yang Kai smiled slowly and stepped forward, placing his hand on the shoulders of the sisters from the Hu Family.

His gaze swept over the four Divine Roaming Realm experts before landing on Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng. Yang Kai grinned and softly told the sisters from the Hu Family, “Don’t worry about me; if I want to leave, no one can stop me.”

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er’s beautiful faces lit up, though they could not understand where Yang Kai’s confidence came from. Hearing him so resolute, however, left them without a hint of doubt.

On the other hand, Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu’s expressions darkened.

The elder Fang was even more contemptuous: “Brat, with the four of us here, you dare speak such big words?”

“Wanna try?” Yang Kai provocatively looked at him.

Elder Fang's eyes sparkled with glimmers, observing Yang Kai intently. To his dismay, he could not find a trace of fear in Yang Kai's expression.

It seemed that this young man indeed had the power to escape unharmed.

“Surround him!” Nan Sheng shouted, clearly furious at Yang Kai’s arrogance and disregard. No disciple from a second-rate sect had ever looked at him with such disdain.

That look was like a needle, piercing his heart.

As a young master from a first-rate family, he naturally had his pride and self-satisfaction.

As soon as Nan Sheng's command fell, the two Divine Roaming Realm experts behind him dove towards Yang Kai, encircling him while the two experts from the Xiang Family formed a wedge.

Even surrounded by four peak experts at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, Yang Kai remained unfazed, though his expression had grown a shade more serious.

Given his current state, he could safely escape from two Divine Roaming Realm practitioners, but with four, he would have to pay a price.

This was merely Yang Kai’s estimate; executing it might yield different results.

As long as he wasn’t facing certain death in a single strike, Yang Kai had confidence in his ability to flee.

“Run! I’ll see how you escape!” Nan Sheng glared menacingly at Yang Kai and barked, “Elders, listen well, if any of these second-rate sect disciples refuse to recognize the situation, just kill them without hesitation!”

“Understood!” The four Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Xiang Family and Nan Family responded simultaneously.

A towering dragon roar erupted, and the pitch-Black Jiao circling above Yang Kai began to stir, its copper-gong-sized eyes radiating a chilling light.

Nan Sheng looked at the crowds from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower, grinning sinisterly, “You have ten breaths to leave this wretched creature's side; otherwise, when the fight breaks out, heh heh…”

Xiang Chu frowned and hastily said, “Ladies, don’t be deluded any longer.”

“You are the ones who are being overly aggressive!” Hu Jiao’er retorted sharply.

Xiang Chu's expression suddenly turned cold; he did indeed have intentions toward the sisters from the Hu Family, but it was not a deep-seated love. As a young master from a first-rate family, what kind of stunning beauty had he not seen? Beauties were merely a means of diversion for him, a process of pursuit and conquest that he relished.

But at this moment, Xiang Chu suddenly realized he might never be able to conquer this pair of sisters, and his heart burned with resentment.

That anger quickly transformed into hatred, and with a cold huff, he fell silent.

“Time’s up!” Nan Sheng coldly urged, casting a cursory glance over the crowd. Nonchalantly, he said, “Let’s move!”

The four Divine Roaming Realm experts surrounding them released a surge of True Yuan, their gazes turned ominous as they looked at the crowd.

At that moment, a sharp and piercing eagle cry suddenly echoed from the sky.

The eagle’s cry was incredibly sharp, seeming to contain some indescribable power. Even experts in the Divine Roaming Realm turned their brows at the sound, hurriedly looking up.

In the high sky, several thousand zhang up, a glimmer of gold was shining brightly.

That flash of gold was pure and unblemished, reflecting light that could blind the eyes.

The golden light spiraled in the sky. Above everyone’s heads, it twisted and turned, letting out a series of eagle cries.

Yang Kai’s expression instantaneously became peculiar. He stared at that streak of gold, his face shifting continuously.

The impending battle had been thrown into disarray by the sudden appearance of this golden eagle.

“What a magnificent eagle!” Nan Sheng exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement.

Although the golden eagle soared several thousand zhang in the air, none in attendance were ordinary; their eyesight was extraordinary, and they could naturally see clearly.

“The golden eagle…” Elder Xu from the Xiang Family’s brow furrowed as he seemed to recall something.

“Ha ha, this young master has decided; I will capture it and keep it!” Nan Sheng laughed heartily. Such a striking and impressive eagle, if he were to raise one, it would surely enhance his prestige. When he later went out, with some training, it might even prove to be very useful.

Hearing him, Yang Kai couldn’t help but smirk disdainfully, mocking, “You can't afford it.”

Nan Sheng glanced at him dismissively, sneering lightly but not saying more, simply asking, “Have you seen such a magical beast before?”

Elder Xu pondered for a moment and frowned, saying, “I seem to have heard of it.”

“Where did you hear that?” Xiang Chu asked eagerly.

Elder Xu furrowed his brow tightly, struggling to remember, but he couldn't recall anything no matter how hard he tried.

In the sky, the golden eagle's cries suddenly became urgent and intense, as if it had spotted something and then dove, a streak of golden light shooting straight towards the crowd.

Realizing the opportunity had come, Nan Sheng was ecstatic, rubbing his hands together while laughing, “Interesting, could it be this magical beast has taken a liking to me, specifically coming to seek me out?”

Xiang Chu smiled slightly, saying, “Since Brother Nan has such good taste, I won’t compete with you.”

Nan Sheng grinned, glancing at Yang Kai and saying, “Brat, live a little longer. Let me catch this eagle first.”

“Suit yourself!” Yang Kai shrugged, adopting an attitude of watching a show.

“Yang Kai, take this chance to escape.” Hu Mei’er whispered to him.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head.

“Why are you still here?” Hu Jiao’er looked at him anxiously, worriedly saying, “Once they capture that eagle, they’ll surely come for you immediately.”

“They won’t get the chance!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his mood remarkably relaxed.

The sisters from the Hu Family were filled with suspicion, unaware of what Yang Kai was implying.

Moments later, the golden eagle descended, and just when it was only dozens of zhang from the crowd, Nan Sheng suddenly lunged up into the sky, a look of satisfaction and excitement on his face as he reached out with a palm toward the eagle.

Unexpectedly, not only was that eagle majestic and mighty, but its strength was formidable as well. As its wings flapped, streaks of golden light flew towards Nan Sheng.

Nan Sheng’s expression changed, hastily evading, then shouted triumphantly, “A Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast! Elders, assist me!”

A Fifth-Tier flying Demonic Beast was truly a treasure.

While ordinary Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts might be of little use, a flying one was quite different—whether for reconnaissance or tracking, it was a valuable asset; it could even assist in battle. If they could capture this beast, Nan Sheng’s strength would surely soar.

Seeing the eagle’s abilities, Xiang Chu could not help but feel tempted, regretting his earlier generosity. This eagle was worth far more than many heaven-and-earth treasures, but having spoken, he could not take back what was said. Even if he regretted it, he could only watch helplessly.
