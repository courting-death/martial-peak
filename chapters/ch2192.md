## Chapter 2192 — Monopolize

"What is going on?" Wuchang frowned deeply, his face full of confusion.

He simply couldn't understand why this Pill Tribulation felt like thunder with little rain—one moment, the Heavenly Might was overwhelming and imposing, and the next, everything was calm, the thunderclouds completely dissipated.

No one could make sense of it.

"Get lost!"

At that moment, while everyone was dazed, Yang Kai suddenly shouted in anger. With that shout, surging Origin Qi swept out in all directions, and a terrifying pressure spread outward.

Bang, bang, bang, bang... He was actually fighting someone!

Hearing the commotion, everyone's expressions changed several times, and they quickly turned to look toward where Yang Kai was.

They saw Yang Kai standing in place, one hand on top of the cauldron, the other swirling with energy, forming countless afterimages that struck out in all directions.

Beside him, a figure moved at high speed, the distance between him and Yang Kai constantly shifting, as if trying to break through his attacks to snatch the freshly refined Spiritual Pill!

But no matter how hard this person tried, he couldn't get within three feet of Yang Kai. Every attempt was blocked by Yang Kai.

"Luo Yuan!" Lan Xun's brows knitted as she called out softly.

She naturally recognized at a glance that the one fighting Yang Kai was Luo Yuan of the Eight Directions Sect!

No one knew where he had been hiding before, but when everyone was distracted by the Pill Tribulation, he suddenly attacked, trying to snatch the Supreme Mystic Pills. Unfortunately, at the last moment, he failed and was blocked by Yang Kai.

He had underestimated Yang Kai, thinking that since the latter was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and had just gone through a grueling refinement, he would be no match for him.

Only when they actually fought did he realize how wrong he was.

Yang Kai appeared passive, but he was actually conserving his strength. Moreover, his Origin Qi was vast and pure, and his defense was flawless. Luo Yuan simply couldn't break through in a short time.

He had miscalculated!

Luo Yuan cursed inwardly, knowing he had missed his chance.

His original plan was to snatch the Supreme Mystic Pill and leave, but now, not only had he failed, he was being held back by Yang Kai. The others had already come to their senses, and if he didn't retreat now, he would likely face everyone's combined assault.

With that in mind, Luo Yuan feinted, withdrew, and landed lightly more than a dozen zhang away, glaring at Yang Kai with a sullen face, as if blaming him for ruining his plans.

Though Yang Kai's face was a bit pale, he still grinned at him and teased, "Brother Luo Yuan, quite the scheme. You've been here for a while, haven't you?"

"Hmph!" Luo Yuan snorted coldly, not answering Yang Kai directly, but instead said, "You're a strange one..."

He meant that Yang Kai's true strength and cultivation were completely mismatched.

Yang Kai kept smiling, his gaze sweeping over the crowd, seeing everyone staring hungrily at his Ink Jade Cauldron, itching to make a move. His expression immediately turned stern as he called out, "Everyone, hold on!"

As soon as he spoke, everyone really did stop in place, not daring to move—even Wuchang didn't rush to attack Yang Kai recklessly.

Although Yang Kai and Luo Yuan had only exchanged blows for a short while, anyone with a discerning eye could see that Yang Kai was not easy to deal with. No one present had the ability to take him down instantly.

If they couldn't subdue him in a flash, others would join in, and the situation would spiral out of control.

That was an outcome no one wanted to see.

"As you all can see, I, Yang, have not failed you. The Supreme Mystic Pill... has been refined!" As Yang Kai spoke, he even took out a Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring and popped it into his mouth.

Everyone could tell the Spiritual Pill was for restoring Origin Qi.

"Since it's refined, your part is done. Hand over the Spiritual Pill!" Wuchang said matter-of-factly.

"Heh... I was just about to bring that up." Yang Kai smiled at him, paused for a few breaths, then continued, "Though the Spiritual Pill is refined... I won't hand it over!"

"What did you say?" Wuchang's face suddenly turned cold.

"Brat, you're courting death!"

"You actually want to monopolize this heaven-defying Spiritual Pill? You really don't know your own limits!"

"Kid, let me give you some advice—hand over the Spiritual Pill obediently, or else everyone will attack you together and tear you to pieces. You alone can't withstand so many attacks!"

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, the crowd exploded—curses, threats, and attempts at persuasion came from all directions, flooding Yang Kai's ears.

Yang Kai ignored them, his face turning cold as he swept his gaze around and said, "What nonsense are you all spouting! The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus was discovered by me first, and the Supreme Mystic Pill was refined by me alone. Even the medicinal ingredients for the Spiritual Pill were almost all provided by me. You lot just stood here watching the show and now want the Supreme Mystic Pill for free? Keep dreaming!"

"You've got guts, kid!"

"Heh, this brat must still be dreaming. To speak so shamelessly, I doubt he'll live past today."

"What's the point in talking? Let's just kill him together and snatch the Spiritual Pill!"

Although Yang Kai had just shown some skill, making many realize he wasn't easy to deal with, the crowd felt emboldened by their numbers and no longer took him seriously.

In their eyes, Yang Kai's actions were nothing short of seeking death! As they clamored, their eyes were filled with greed and murderous intent as they stared at him.

"So... this was your plan from the start?" Wuchang looked at Yang Kai coldly, mocking him.

"That's right!" Yang Kai turned to him. "I never intended to give the Supreme Mystic Pill to any of you. Otherwise, when I found the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, I could have just swallowed it right then... Though that would have wasted some of its medicinal power, it would still be better than letting others have it."

"You've got guts!" Wuchang was furious, but laughed in his rage. His aura suddenly surged as he stepped toward Yang Kai. With each step, his aura grew stronger, and he seemed like a great demon emerging from the depths of hell, making everyone shudder. "Your idea is good, but you need the strength to back it up. Do you think... you have what it takes?"

"If I didn't..." Yang Kai grinned at him. "I wouldn't have thought of it!"

If he didn't have some confidence, how could he bring trouble upon himself? Not only did he admit in front of everyone that he was a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist, he even went through the trouble of refining the Supreme Mystic Pill.

Yang Kai would never do something as foolish as making wedding clothes for others.

Even at the cost of exposing himself as a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist, Yang Kai refined the Supreme Mystic Pill for this very moment.

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and shouted, "Shatter!"

With his explosive shout, a series of cracking sounds suddenly rang out.

At the same time, with Yang Kai at the center, the space within a thirty zhang radius shattered like a mirror, forming countless cracks—long and thin, flickering unpredictably, but exuding a deadly threat.

A strange fluctuation of force, an unfathomable Law Power, quietly spread through the air!

Wuchang suddenly stopped, staring at the space ahead, as if sensing something, his expression changing several times.

"Spatial rifts!"

"Spatial Law!"

Exclamations rang out one after another, faces filled with shock and disbelief, eyes brimming with despair and terror!

Spatial Law...

The scene before them, the strange Law Power all around, was definitely Spatial Law—otherwise, there was no way space could change so drastically.

The space within a thirty zhang radius was already shattered. Anyone who entered would have to be prepared to be sliced apart by spatial rifts.

"You actually... comprehended this kind of Law Power!" Wuchang gritted his teeth and roared, his face full of unwillingness and rage, as if Yang Kai had insulted him.

Spatial Law was one of the most mysterious and elusive Laws in the world. That Yang Kai had comprehended it naturally filled Wuchang with resentment.

"For someone with such low cultivation to wield Spatial Law to this extent!" Lan Xun's beautiful eyes were full of admiration as she looked in Yang Kai's direction, her gaze shining.

Because of the interference of Spatial Law and the fluctuations of spatial power, to her, Yang Kai's position seemed to shift unpredictably, sometimes near, sometimes far.

Under the influence of this power, no one else could possibly attack him.

"Maybe he's just using some Secret Treasure!" Xiao Chen said, unconvinced. "Right, doesn't he have an Imperial Treasure? This guy has some background—he must have a spatial Secret Treasure!"

Lan Xun frowned, not bothering to respond.

Although a spatial Secret Treasure could indeed achieve this effect, Lan Xun had seen clearly that before Yang Kai acted, he hadn't used any Secret Treasure at all. He simply raised his hand, and Spatial Law enveloped the area.

This was definitely his own power.

"This kid..." On the other side, Xia Sheng, who had been on edge the whole time, could only smile wryly.

After Yang Kai finished refining the Supreme Mystic Pill, Xia Sheng had started secretly sending him voice transmissions, trying to get him to cooperate.

Who knew Yang Kai would ignore him and pull off something like this in the blink of an eye...

"Looks like he doesn't need our help!" Xiao Baiyi said thoughtfully.

"Mm." Xia Sheng frowned. "If he's mastered Spatial Force, then he can definitely do it... With such a skill, he really doesn't need to fear anyone. It's just..."

"Just what?" Xiao Baiyi looked at Xia Sheng in surprise.

"It's just... what exactly is he trying to do?" Xia Sheng looked at Yang Kai in confusion. "If he wanted to escape with the Supreme Mystic Pill, he could have just left. Why stay behind to taunt everyone? Does he think life is too easy and wants to stir up more trouble for himself?"

Hearing this, Xiao Baiyi was also at a loss, completely unable to guess Yang Kai's intentions.

On the other side, Wuchang's face was ashen as he silently watched Yang Kai for a moment before saying, "Do you think you're safe hiding there?"

Yang Kai laughed, "Brother Wuchang, want to try?"

"Just what I was thinking!" Wuchang shouted, his voice booming like thunder.
