## Chapter 2508 — Phoenix Egg

Amidst the blazing flames, the earth was scorched into barren wasteland. Even the drifting yellow sand melted away before it could touch the inferno.

Where Liu Yan stood, the desert within a hundred zhang radius had become a field of magma, unbearably hot and terrifying.

A massive Fire Phoenix phantom towered behind Liu Yan, its majestic phoenix eyes like a deity gazing down from time immemorial, filled with disdain and mockery. Wrapped in the phantom, Liu Yan did not use any power to resist, letting the world-consuming flames burn her, pain etched across her small face.

Two Divine Senses exchanged across the void.

One was as weak as an ant, the other as mighty as heaven and earth—the contrast was stark.

No one knew what passed between them, but suddenly, the powerful Divine Sense belonging to the Fire Phoenix’s Origin Power grew violent. With a cry, the flames burned even fiercer.

Yang Kai’s eyelids twitched violently—he almost couldn’t stop himself from intervening.

Although Liu Yan’s body was that of a Spirit Puppet, different from ordinary people, under the burning of the True Phoenix Fire, no one knew how long she could last. If she couldn’t hold on, she would be burned to nothing.

But just as Yang Kai was about to act, he glanced at Liu Yan and forcibly stopped himself, sensing something.

He noticed that although Liu Yan’s face was twisted in pain, her brows were peaceful. Two completely contradictory emotions appeared on one face, making it look extremely strange.

Suddenly, a cry rang out—not as clear and bright as the phoenix’s, but crisp and pleasant. Then, a strange bird, fiery red with an extremely long tail, shot out from Liu Yan’s body.

Liu Yan’s true form!

Yang Kai watched solemnly. Though the yellow sand blocked his sight, everything was clear to him through his Divine Sense.

Liu Yan hadn’t revealed her true form in a very long time. Yang Kai still remembered the first time he met her, she appeared like this, and he’d thought she was a Fire Spirit. Only later did he learn she was merely the Artifact Spirit of a Refining Furnace.

If not forced to the limit, Liu Yan would never reveal her true form.

As soon as the strange bird appeared, it soared upward, riding the clouds and wind, instantly arriving at the Fire Phoenix’s head and circling around it.

The Fire Phoenix cried out repeatedly, its fiery feathers spreading wide, lifelike. Torrents of heat swept out in all directions. Liu Yan’s true form was like a small boat in a storm, battered by wave after wave, as if she could be swallowed at any moment.

The fluctuations of Divine Sense communication never ceased, as Liu Yan kept trying.

Yang Kai didn’t know what Liu Yan was doing during this time. He only saw her circling the Fire Phoenix, strange Divine Soul ripples spreading out.

Gradually, the agitated Fire Phoenix phantom calmed down, its spread feathers folding back in. Yet its eyes remained full of disdain, as if the whole world was beneath it.

Seeing this, Liu Yan edged a bit closer to the Fire Phoenix, seemingly trying to be accepted by it.

The process was slow, but nothing drastic happened.

After a long effort, Liu Yan finally landed atop the Fire Phoenix’s head, gently smoothing its feathers.

At the same time, the Fire Phoenix slowly closed its majestic eyes.

Was this a success? Yang Kai frowned, unsure what the situation was now.

Logically, Liu Yan had a much higher chance of refining the Fire Phoenix’s Origin than anyone else, since she herself was a fire-type Artifact Spirit, sharing the same origin as the True Phoenix Fire.

The overwhelming pressure gradually receded. The massive Fire Phoenix phantom slowly shrank and was drawn back into Liu Yan’s body, and the searing heat instantly lost its source. The flames vanished, leaving behind only a field of crimson magma and half-melted yellow sand.

Liu Yan’s true form also returned to her body with the Fire Phoenix phantom.

Yang Kai probed with his Divine Sense. After seeing Liu Yan’s current state, his heart skipped a beat.

At this moment, Liu Yan looked as if she’d been burned for countless years—her whole body charred, with no human features visible, and her once beautiful hair completely gone.

All that could be seen was a human-shaped figure like black charcoal.

Even a Spirit Puppet body was burned like this; if it were any ordinary cultivator, they’d have turned to ashes long ago.

Yang Kai’s heart ached, barely restraining the urge to help, but ready at any moment to take out a leaf from the Everlasting Tree.

From within that charred figure, faint Divine Soul ripples from Liu Yan could still be sensed.

Threads of crimson energy suddenly spread from her body, flickering like flames, dazzling to the eye, carrying both a terrifying aura of destruction and an incredible vitality.

True Phoenix Fire!

Legend had it that phoenixes were immortal, each death merely a cycle of rebirth, and what made them so legendary was this miraculous True Phoenix Fire. Within it lay both endless destruction and boundless life.

Destruction for enemies, life for itself.

Soon, Liu Yan was completely wrapped in this crimson energy, airtight, and the energy gradually solidified, forming something like a rock.

Looking from afar, Liu Yan now seemed to have become an egg half as tall as a person. The eggshell was covered in countless intricate patterns, as if holding great secrets. Out of curiosity, Yang Kai looked a few more times, only to feel a pair of extremely majestic eyes suddenly appear in his Sea of Consciousness, coldly staring at him, making his mind churn and tremble.

Startled, he quickly looked away.

Those majestic eyes were the Fire Phoenix’s. Yang Kai didn’t know why they appeared in his Sea of Consciousness, but he knew that if he kept looking, he might be attacked by some invisible secret art.

This must be the Phoenix Race's inheritance. Those patterns must be their secrets, and anyone who tried to pry would meet a bad end.

Still, this put Yang Kai at ease.

Since the egg encasing Liu Yan now bore Phoenix Race marks, it meant she had been accepted by the True Phoenix Fire. With its protection, no matter how badly injured she was, she could not die.

Now, all that was left was to wait.

Wait for the moment when Liu Yan would break free from her shell and be reborn, to witness that miraculous scene.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected Liu Yan to refine the True Phoenix Fire so quickly. Though it looked dangerous, it had gone smoothly in the end.

He secretly sent a message to his Incarnation, telling him to keep an eye on Liu Yan and contact him immediately if anything went wrong.

The Incarnation naturally agreed.

Only then did Yang Kai flicker and re-enter the Small Xuan Realm.

With the True Phoenix Fire problem solved, the next thing to address was the Small Xuan Realm.

Spreading his Divine Sense in all directions, Yang Kai quickly grasped the situation in the Small Xuan Realm. This time, after extracting a thread of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, the damage was considerable—a third of the realm was in ruins, many places a chaotic blend of Heaven And Earth, like primordial chaos.

These areas were collapsing continuously, spreading outward.

At this rate, if left unchecked, the Small Xuan Realm would be completely destroyed within a month, and the Everlasting Tree, Firmament Tree, and other treasures planted inside would all be lost.

Although Yang Kai could transplant them in advance, he wouldn’t feel safe leaving such treasures anywhere else, especially the Everlasting Tree. If anyone found out, the entire Star Realm would be thrown into chaos.

No matter what, Yang Kai was determined to stabilize the Small Xuan Realm as soon as possible. It wasn’t just for himself—only then could the Everlasting Tree and the Firmament Tree remain safely hidden there in the future.

With a solemn expression, he reached out, and a great bell suddenly appeared before him.

A Primordial Era treasure—the Mountain and River Bell!

Perhaps because it had suppressed a thread of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, the Mountain and River Bell had not shrunk, and the strange patterns on its surface flashed with light, Primordial Era power sweeping in all directions.

When Yang Kai summoned the Mountain and River Bell, he could clearly feel the suppressed Great Might of Heaven and Earth inside it struggling, trying to break free.

Staring at the Mountain and River Bell for a long time, Yang Kai finally formed several hand seals with a serious expression.

The Mountain and River Bell suddenly hummed, and a sliver of its world-suppressing Primordial Era power revealed a gap.

The suppressed Great Might of Heaven and Earth instantly shot out like a cat smelling fish, turning into a stream of light and escaping through the gap at great speed.

Hummm…

An unimaginable pressure descended from the heavens. In the unseen depths, a powerful will seemed to manifest, looming above Yang Kai’s head and radiating an aura of utter destruction.

Yang Kai’s body bent under the pressure.

When he advanced before, he was struck by this Great Might of Heaven and Earth and couldn’t resist at all. But now, he was a true Emperor Realm cultivator, his Emperor Yuan vast and pure, his strength more than ten times greater than before.

Moreover, this was the Small Xuan Realm, where he ruled everything. Even if it was damaged, that fact didn’t change.

He looked up coldly, fixing his gaze on the stream of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth. With a thought, he mobilized all the power of the Small Xuan Realm.

Countless invisible hands seemed to reach out from all directions, firmly grasping the Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

The stream of light buzzed and struggled, but couldn’t move at all.

This Great Might of Heaven and Earth was indeed the Origin of the outside world, but it was only a thread—how could it compete with the power of the entire Small Xuan Realm?

It was like a leopard and a cat. A leopard is fierce, but is a single leopard hair stronger than a cat?

After imprisoning the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, Yang Kai suddenly sat cross-legged, his mind spreading out and instantly enveloping the entire Small Xuan Realm.

Soon, Yang Kai felt a strange sensation, as if he had become the Small Xuan Realm, and it was him—no separation between the two.
