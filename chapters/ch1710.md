## Chapter 1710 — Princess

Qian Mo laughed coldly without concern. "With my status, cultivation, and beauty, if I were to offer myself as a bedmate to that island lord Ming Yue, do you think he'd refuse? Then I could temper my body with a Huntian Pill, and you'd have to obey my orders — guess how I'll torment you."

The sharp‑nosed man went pale in an instant, sweat pouring from him.

If he could picture such a scene, he could also imagine his own end — which would surely be little better than death.

Qian Mo had been sent out to gather the Huntian Lotus precisely because she refused to submit to Ghost Isle's control, but she was not wrong: with her status and beauty, once she consented to offer herself as a bedmate, no man could refuse her — not even island lord Ming Yue.

At that moment, Qian Mo would leap up to become the island lord's honored wife!

That was a sight the sharp‑nosed man absolutely did not want to see; to anger the future island lord's wife would bode him no good.

The sharp‑nosed man's expression shifted; a cold, vicious flash crossed his eyes as he ground his teeth, "You low wench, you're forcing me into this."

Saying that, he strode toward the direction where Qian Mo stood, his face hostile.

He was plainly unwilling to let what he feared come to pass, and the only way to avoid it was to send Qian Mo to the same fate! If Qian Mo died, he could sleep easy — though it would be a pity, what was that compared to his own life?

Qian Mo seemed to have expected this long ago; she showed not the slightest sign of panic and instead let out a cold sneer. “No need for you to lay a hand on me!"

With that she leapt. She jumped off the ship, as if to share fate with Pang Zhen and the others.

She would rather die than submit; earlier she had spoken of offering herself as a bedmate as a last hope to intimidate the sharp‑nosed man, and when that plan failed she chose to jump into the sea.

Falling into the frigid seawater, Qian Mo exchanged a glance with Pang Zhen and gave a slight nod. The next moment, the two prepared to flee in opposite directions.

This matter could not be settled peacefully. The only hope of survival was to flee, to get away from the sharp‑nosed man, the others, and that Sea Beaver Beast — the chances were slim, but they had to try.

Moving through the seawater, the Sea Race undoubtedly held the absolute advantage. After all, they were a people born of the sea.

Boom, boom, boom……

A muffled sound suddenly approached from afar — as if someone were striking the water's surface with great force, those rhythmic impacts transmitted through the water.

Along with it came ripples visible to the naked eye.

The sound grew closer, the ripples clearer, almost merging into a wave.

Everyone froze and turned toward the source of the noise, unsure what was happening. Even the imposing Sea Beaver Beast seemed to sense danger and halted, lingering on the surface.

A row of water columns shot skyward and raced toward them, and before those pillars of water stood a figure, hands clasped behind his back, treading the sea.

The booming sound was the impact of his feet striking the sea surface.

Each footfall carried an indescribable realm of force; as he walked, water spouted behind him like jiao dragons.

The man was not young — he looked fifty or sixty, though his true age was certainly beyond that.

The sharp‑nosed man and the Ghost Isle cultivators were stunned, their minds shaken beyond measure.

For walking on the sea by sheer physical strength alone was extraordinarily difficult; though they could manage it sometimes, none possessed the imposing bearing of this passerby, nor could anyone sustain it long.

Yet this elder strolled as if in a garden; apart from the rather loud sound he made, there was no sign of exhaustion.

It seemed that if he so wished, he could continue like this without end.

What tremendous physical might would be required to sustain such travel for so long?

Looking over Ghost Isle, those capable of such a feat could be counted on the fingers of one hand.

Beside the elder was another figure, a youth sitting cross‑legged, exposed on the sea surface and looking far more at ease than the elder; he made no move yet steadily followed the elder without falling behind.

Drawing closer, the sharp‑nosed man discovered that beneath the youth's rear there was indeed a sea beast bearing him forward.

"This..." the sharp‑nosed man was stunned. Ghost Isle's cultivators had tried to tame sea beasts before, but even with the island lord's personal effort there had been no success. The sea beasts near Ghost Isle's waters, regardless of strength, were all unruly and would rather die than submit, so Ghost Isle had given up after many attempts.

Now someone rode a sea beast — this shocked the sharp‑nosed man even more than the elder treading the sea.

The commotion raised by the old and young naturally alerted Pang Zhen, Qian Mo, and the others.

"Eh — he is..." Pang Zhen watched Yang Kai carefully for a long moment, then his face brightened.

Qian Mo, however, fixed her lovely eyes on the area beneath Yang Kai's rear, hesitation and disbelief flickering in them; very soon she broke into rapturous joy, leapt from the water, and raced across the surface toward Yang Kai.

She could not stroll like the elder, nor sustain it long; she relied on a burst of energy, and when that force was spent Qian Mo would be unable to continue.

Still, she frantically and excitedly closed on Yang Kai, her pretty face wearing a long‑lost reunion's smile.

"Old Sha, do you know this woman?" Yang Kai, seated on the little dolphin, turned to Sha Hu and asked, puzzled.

Sha Hu laughed heartily, "I have not left the mountains in a hundred years — how would I know anyone? Isn't this woman here to look for you?"

"Look for me?" Yang Kai chuckled. "Hardly. She's a leader of the Sea God Palace; I have no ties to her. Uh... but it does seem she truly came for me?"

As the distance closed, Yang Kai realized something was amiss.

This woman named Qian Mo really was charging toward him, waving as if they were well acquainted.

Yang Kai scratched his head, baffled, and did not respond rashly; he could only wait and see.

The little dolphin beneath him suddenly emitted a joyful yet aggrieved cry, its speed surging as it headed straight for Qian Mo.

Before long, Qian Mo reached Yang Kai; she paid him no mind, instead leaning toward the little dolphin with a sigh of relief and, voice trembling, cried, "Princess!"

"Princess?" Yang Kai gaped, stunned on the spot.

The little dolphin chattered excitedly, circled Qian Mo, and then dove into her arms like a child meeting its mother, fussing affectionately.

From above Yang Kai saw Qian Mo's full, supple bosom pressed and somewhat deformed by the dolphin's head, revealing a deep cleavage and a swath of pale skin.

Sha Hu stood quietly to one side, hands clasped behind his back; he looked at Qian Mo, then at the little dolphin, and nodded, "So that's it — it's of the Tunjiao Race; no wonder something felt off."

Yang Kai blinked awake as if from a dream.

Qian Mo called the little dolphin 'Princess', and Sha Hu said the little dolphin belonged to the Tunjiao Race; Yang Kai immediately realized that the little dolphin he had stumbled upon was of high standing among the Sea Race — a member of their royal family, the very princess Qian Mo and Shang Ao had been searching for, which was why the two Sea Race leaders had gone to Xiaguang Island and made a scene.

It seemed Qian Mo and Shang Ao had not lied — the Sea Race princess had indeed gone missing near Xiaguang Island, but she had not been captured by people from the Sea Hall; she had wandered into Ghost Isle.

And had been discovered by him purely by chance...

Finding the Sea Race princess had relaxed Qian Mo completely; she no longer cared for her own safety, allowing the little dolphin to nuzzle her for a long while before suddenly glaring viciously at Yang Kai and snarling, "You despicable human — what have you done to my princess? How dare you ride Her Highness the Princess — unforgivable!"

Yang Kai looked down and smiled lightly, "What could I have possibly done to her?"

He was not angered by Qian Mo's tone; the little dolphin's status among the Sea Race was supreme, and Qian Mo's fury was understandable.

"Get down at once!" Qian Mo snapped.

Yang Kai curled his lip, "If she does not want to carry me, I'll get down. Little one, do you want me to get off?"

His last words were addressed to the little dolphin; under Qian Mo's murderous gaze he reached out and patted the dolphin's head.

Qian Mo was about to explode with rage. Although Her Highness was still young and could not assume a human form, she was sacred and inviolable among the Sea Race; any of the Sea Race who saw her had to bow respectfully. Yet here a despicable human sat on the princess and shamelessly patted her head.

What enraged Qian Mo most was that the princess seemed to thoroughly enjoy herself, blowing a few bubbles and wagging her tail happily.

"Look..." Yang Kai spread his hands, "I didn't force her!"

Qian Mo drew a deep breath, her full bosom rising high, and felt the impulse to punch Yang Kai dead.

The little dolphin emitted strange tones; Qian Mo listened intently. After a while her expression cleared slightly, but she still glared at Yang Kai with righteous fury, "I don't know what trick you've used to make Her Highness so attached to you, but this isn't over — remember that!"

Yang Kai shrugged, ignoring her meaningless threats.

At that moment Pang Zhen swam over to Yang Kai, clasping his fists in greeting, "Sect Master Yang!"

"Island Lord Pang, fate really does bring people together!" Yang Kai answered with a laugh.

Pang Zhen lowered his head to examine his condition, embarrassed for a long moment.

Fortunately Yang Kai shifted the topic in time and asked, "How did you end up in such a sorry state? Those on that ship weren't people from the Sea Hall or Sea God Palace, were they?"
