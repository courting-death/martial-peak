## Chapter 855 — The Mysterious Guy

At the summit of the towering snow-capped peak, Yang Kai sat cross-legged in silence as feather-like snow drifted down, burying him.

Yang Kai remained impassive, his aura constricted to the utmost; even if an expert from the Saint Realm passed by, they might not detect any flaw.

Below the mountain, a streak of green light was rapidly approaching.

Before long the green radiance halted at the summit, revealing a figure — none other than Wu Jie of the Netherworld Sect.

Wu Jie carried Liu Gui in his hand. The War Soul Hall youth looked like he had resigned himself to his fate, his head drooped and spirit spent.

"Where is he?" Wu Jie glanced around but could not find Yang Kai and asked coldly.

Liu Gui hurriedly replied, "Right here — he pointed me to this spot. Why can’t I see him?"

As he spoke he also hurriedly searched the area.

"Why did it take so long?" Suddenly a voice sounded directly in front of the two. Liu Gui was startled, then overjoyed when he recognized the speaker and called out, "Saint Lord!"

Wu Jie focused his mind and looked ahead, seeing a pair of eyes glinting from a nearby snowdrift.

A man rose from the snow; as his True Yuan circulated, the packed snow around him melted.

Wu Jie’s expression turned stern, but he let out a chuckle, dropped Liu Gui to the ground, and cupped his hands, "Saint Lord, long time no see — your bearing is unchanged!"

As he spoke, those ghost-fire eyes appraised Yang Kai up and down, as if gauging how much he had grown. Upon realizing Yang Kai was now at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, the emerald glow in his eyes flickered even more rapidly.

"Master Wu, likewise," Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Wu Jie hastened to explain, "Heh heh, I slipped away from the others to come alone, it took quite a while — please pardon me, Saint Lord."

"It’s fine you came," Yang Kai replied calmly, then looked at Liu Gui, "You’ve worked hard."

Liu Gui waved his hand anxiously, "Not hard at all, it’s my honor to serve the Saint Lord. Besides, Master Wu brought this disciple here by flight… heh heh…"

He stammered a little, appearing hesitant and embarrassed.

Yang Kai casually tossed him a jade vial. "This is your reward for this time. There may be other times I need you — train well when you return."

Liu Gui accepted it, overjoyed, "Thank you, Saint Lord!"

The last time he went with Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu of the Duao Alliance to meet Yang Kai, he received a Spirit-Grade Pill as recompense. Thanks to that pill his strength had improved greatly; now Yang Kai gave him another bottle, so Liu Gui was naturally pleased.

Clutching the jade vial tightly, Liu Gui asked cautiously, "Sirs, if you have no further use for me, I’ll take my leave now. If I stay away too long people will grow suspicious."

"Go on," Yang Kai waved him off.

Liu Gui dashed off like a shot.

While Yang Kai and Liu Gui spoke, Wu Jie had stood silently to the side listening without interrupting. His shifting, eerie eyes held a strange light, as if lost in thought.

Only after Liu Gui left did Wu Jie ask in a hoarse voice, "How did you get involved with that War Soul Hall disciple?"

Yang Kai smiled, "When you attacked the Nine Heavens Sacred Land I planted a pawn inside the War Soul Hall. I didn’t expect it would be useful this time. Hmm, take back whatever you did to him and spare his life — he might still be of use."

Wu Jie laughed wickedly, admiringly, "Saint Lord truly has sharp eyes — you saw through it. It seems your Divine Sense is stronger than mine."

Otherwise, when he first came to the peak he wouldn’t have failed to sense Yang Kai’s presence.

What did it mean for a Third Stage Transcendent to have a Divine Sense surpassing that of a Saint Realm cultivator?

Wu Jie felt deeply shaken within.

As he spoke he moved his finger; after a moment a horrific, ghostly face drifted back from the direction Liu Gui had gone and vanished into Wu Jie’s body.

"Master Wu, how did your sect come to be here?" Yang Kai’s expression grew serious as he addressed the matter.

When Yang Kai had released his Divine Sense in Giant Stone City and felt Liu Gui’s presence, he had scarcely believed it. Liu Gui being here meant the War Soul Hall had people here — and that the Netherworld Sect and Poxuan Palace must be present as well.

Those three forces had once allied against the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

That they’d traveled tens of thousands of li to this endless snow mountain was curious indeed. Although Yang Kai had his suspicions, he needed Wu Jie to confirm them.

"You didn’t come here chasing me, did you?" Yang Kai glanced sidelong at Wu Jie and asked with a smirk.

Wu Jie pondered, "You could say that, but it’s not because of you — we came to look for someone."

"Who?" Yang Kai’s gaze sharpened on Wu Jie. For a moment his pressure made even the formidable Wu Jie feel a trace of oppression.

Wu Jie frowned, "This person should have some connection to the Saint Lord, and from your nervous look it seems you’ve guessed why we came. So you truly know the secret of the Coffin-Bearer and where he’s hiding?"

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and exhaled inwardly — they indeed sought the Coffin-Bearer.

When he had first met Wu Jie, the matter had been hinted: a War Soul Hall cultivator named Yao Di had once witnessed Yang Kai being captured by the Coffin-Bearer in Blazing Fire City. Because of ties to the Coffin-Bearer, Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall had relentlessly pursued Yang Kai.

At the time Yang Kai had not paid much heed, believing those two forces were not to be feared.

Yet over two years later they had tracked down this endless snow mountain and come searching in person.

"Whether I know or not is irrelevant — tell me what you know. How did you find this place?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

Wu Jie chuckled, "Finding this place was easy. The Saint Lord’s origins are mysterious; Zhang Ao of Poxuan Palace and Cao Guan of the War Soul Hall were embarrassed by it, so they investigated your background. They discovered you once belonged to the Tianxiao Sect… and, interestingly, you didn’t come from Tianxiao — you came from a remote backwater and before reaching Tianxiao you visited the Leiguang Divine Cult as an honored guest. From the disciples of Leiguang we learned your first appearance in this area was when you walked out of the snow mountain. That appearance followed your capture by the Coffin-Bearer, which naturally led people to suspect the Coffin-Bearer might be hiding in this endless snow mountain."

"Careful thinking," Yang Kai snorted coldly.

His being captured by the Coffin-Bearer and later appearing from the snow did give observant people useful clues, leading them to assume the Coffin-Bearer hid within this range.

And in fact, that was indeed the case.

Wu Jie’s expression turned solemn. "Zhang Ao and Cao Guan hate you with a vengeance and covet the power behind the Coffin-Bearer. They’ve searched relentlessly — it wasn’t difficult to learn these facts."

"However…" Wu Jie’s tone shifted, "even though they’d learned some information and suspected the Coffin-Bearer hid in the snow mountain, this range is vast like a sea — finding one person here is like fishing for a needle in the ocean. Zhang Ao and Cao Guan didn’t want to lead anyone here at first."

"Then why did they come?" Yang Kai frowned.

Wu Jie paused and smiled bitterly, "To be honest, a couple years ago the three of us chased you for months and then lost your trail; each returned to our own sects. Zhang Ao and Cao Guan feared that once the Nine Heavens Sacred Land recovered its Yuan Qi it would exact revenge, so they sought a power to oppose it or contemplated relocating their sect. Shortly after, a mysterious guy approached Zhang Ao and urged him to investigate you; it’s because of this person that they entered the snow mountain."

"A mysterious guy?" Yang Kai was stunned. "How mysterious?"

"Beyond imagining!" Wu Jie’s face grew grave. "He’s wrapped in black robes so you can’t tell male or female, and his cultivation is unfathomable. He also brought an aide who seems to be his subordinate; that aide alone is near the peak of the First Stage of the Saint Realm."

Yang Kai’s expression changed.

If the subordinate was at the peak of the First Stage of the Saint Realm, how powerful must the mysterious man himself be?

"This matter was led by that person, so the Netherworld Sect couldn’t stand aside and had to get involved."

"Do you know who this mysterious person is?" Yang Kai asked.

Wu Jie slowly shook his head. "He only promised that once this was done, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land would no longer threaten us. So Zhang Ao and Cao Guan exerted themselves — they even called in friends and spent heavily to invite the Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Rashomon Gate to come along."

Yang Kai nodded. With such a vast mountain range, manpower would be needed to search; although Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Rashomon Gate held no top experts, their cultivators could still help search.

Ran Jing and Mao Da’s trip to Giant Stone City to seek Du Wan’s antidote pill was likely in preparation for the poisonous rot that seeps from the Coffin-Bearer’s decaying body.

"Though I don’t know who that guy is… I think there are very few in the world who could reach that level of cultivation, and… both he and his subordinate carry an unsettling aura."

"What kind of aura?"

Wu Jie pondered for a moment and then said in a low voice, "Demonic qi!"

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically, "You mean that person comes from…"

Wu Jie shook his head slowly, "I don’t know that. I only sense a resemblance in their aura. For this matter I think it’s best you don’t intervene — it’s beyond what I can handle. To be honest, I feel my life hangs by a thread when I’m there."

"I know my limits!" Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.
