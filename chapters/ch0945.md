## Chapter 945 — Our Own

It took a full three days before several thousand soldiers and riders could safely traverse the Void Passage and all arrive on the Tongxuan Continent.

Within a fifty-li radius, countless martial artists from Great Han each sought out suitable spots, sat cross-legged, absorbed Spiritual Qi, cultivated the heavenly and martial Dao, shattered their own shackles, and pushed their cultivation to the next Stage.

Because the laws of heaven and earth here differed, all who had arrived on the Tongxuan Continent experienced, to varying degrees, some increase in power.

Those poised on the brink of breakthrough could naturally seize this opportunity and advance in a single stroke.

Yang Kai had been the same when he first set foot in this world years ago.

When the Ancient Demon Clan was brought out of that Small Xuan Realm by Yang Kai, the same thing happened—many of the clan's members saw their realms improve.

Now it was the turn of these Great Han warriors; Yang Kai, well practiced and prepared, had cleared a fifty li area to give everyone a safe environment for breakthroughs.

Of the several thousand troops, at least a third were at the critical moment of breakthrough; the others, though not so fortunate, were content—their True Yuan and personal realms had somewhat improved, and they spread out around the area to stand guard and protect their companions attempting breakthroughs.

Qiu Yimeng came winding over from a place ten li away, lightly biting her silver teeth and muttering under her breath, as if cursing something.

She streaked to Yang Kai's side, tilting her head back, her beautiful eyes glaring at him: "This is the grand gift you gave me?"

"Satisfied?" Yang Kai grinned.

"Satisfied, yes, but this has nothing to do with you, right? Look around—so many people are breaking through..." Qiu Yimeng gestured in a circle; as far as the eye could see, countless cultivators sat cross-legged, drawing in Spiritual Qi—the spectacle was magnificent.

“As long as you’re satisfied, that’s what matters—don’t take it so seriously.”

"Don’t you dare disappoint a woman’s heart, or you’ll answer to me!" Qiu Yimeng stamped her foot, then, fed up with Yang Kai, darted off to where the Qiu family were gathered.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose, his expression helpless.

"Saint Lord!" At that moment Shi Kun suddenly appeared from who knew where, urgently reporting, "A large group is approaching—coming on fiercely; something seems off."

"Who are they?" Yang Kai frowned.

"I didn't have time to scout them, but there's a Saint Realm expert among them."

"Let's go and see." Yang Kai's expression soured. The only nearby great power was the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, but after having so many of its masters slain it had all but fallen apart. When coming over from Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai had even sent Li Rong to pay a visit to the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, but when Li Rong arrived she found the place deserted.

Who would be so heedless as to come charging over now?

He had gone only a short distance when he saw tiny black dots on the horizon rapidly closing in; as they drew nearer, the figures became clearer.

Sending out his divine sense, Yang Kai's expression turned strange.

He discovered that among the approaching group there was indeed only one Saint Realm cultivator, and even that one was only First Stage of the Saint Realm; the others were Transcendent Realm practitioners, with a few from the Divine Roaming Realm.

What struck him as odd was not their lack of strength, but that many of them carried auras he recognized.

On further inspection, Yang Kai could not help but smile wryly.

The approaching warriors had apparently noticed the situation here as well; they halted a li away, and their leader called out loudly, "May I ask if you over there are friends of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult? I am Chen Zhou, Palace Master of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace; today I come seeking counsel on a matter."

"Dragon-Phoenix Palace?" Li Rong, standing behind Yang Kai, frowned—she had no impression of a sect by that name.

"They're our people," Yang Kai said casually, then called out, "Sun Yu, are you over there?"

At his words, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace cultivators all knitted their brows; Chen Zhou furtively shifted to hide a young man within the crowd, shielding him from Yang Kai's sight.

"Disciple, someone over there is calling you—do you also have acquaintances over with the Xiaoyao Divine Cult?" Ling Jian asked suspiciously as he looked at Sun Yu, who was being kept in the middle.

As a master, he naturally knew his disciple's life story better than anyone.

Sun Yu had been picked up by Ling Jian when he was very young and brought to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace to cultivate; over the years he had never left the Palace, so if not for his insistence to come here this time Ling Jian would never have let him go.

Now he was the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's hope for the future and could not suffer any mishap.

Having almost never left the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, how could he possibly have acquaintances in the Xiaoyao Divine Cult? Ling Jian was baffled.

Chen Zhou also turned his gaze to Sun Yu and asked, "Do you know the person calling out?"

Sun Yu's face lit with joy; without answering he stepped out of the crowd, awe on his face, and cried, "Is it Senior Yang?"

Yang Kai smiled and inclined his head. "Yes."

"It really is Senior Yang!" Sun Yu cried with delight and, without waiting, left his group and sped toward them.

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace experts changed expression and hurried to follow.

While rushing over, Chen Zhou asked puzzledly, "Elder Ling, what is this 'Senior Yang' that Sun Yu keeps calling—why is he so enthusiastic?"

"I don't know either," Ling Jian admitted, equally perplexed.

By the time they reached Yang Kai, Sun Yu was excited and elated, respectfully cupping his fists: "Greetings, Senior Yang—so you are here too."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and let his gaze pass over Sun Yu to those standing behind him.

Nearly all of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's experts had come out with Sun Yu as layered protection; even now they regarded Yang Kai with wary looks, afraid he might harm Sun Yu.

"Let me introduce you," Sun Yu said enthusiastically, pointing at Yang Kai: "This is Senior Yang."

He then pointed to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace group: "This is our Palace Master Chen Zhou, this is my master Ling Jian, this is Elder Xiao Ling, and this is..."

As he introduced them one by one, Yang Kai nodded and exchanged greetings.

"Young man, for someone so young, what right have you to be called a senior?" Chen Zhou's face showed displeasure.

Sun Yu was now the Dragon Emperor of Dragon-Phoenix Palace, a position of immense prestige that even outranked the Palace Master; to have him call a comparably young man 'senior' left Chen Zhou feeling belittled.

If Yang Kai had been middle-aged that might have been different, but Chen Zhou plainly saw him as a youth not yet thirty.

"Palace Master, this Senior Yang has done me a great favor; I won't allow you to speak of him like that," Sun Yu said in a low, determined voice.

Chen Zhou was taken aback, his face awkward as he cupped his fist: "Friend, please forgive me—my tongue was blunt, I meant no offense."

"Palace Master Chen needn't be so formal," Yang Kai said casually; Chen Zhou's immediate yielding at Sun Yu's word only demonstrated how highly he valued Sun Yu.

Nearby, Elder Xiao Ling of Dragon-Phoenix Palace suddenly stared at Shi Kun and, after a long hesitation, asked, "May I ask if you are Elder Shi Kun of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

"I am Shi Kun—have we met?" Shi Kun asked dubiously.

Xiao Ling's face altered and he exclaimed, "No wonder you seemed familiar—half a year ago I went to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land seeking a master to refine pills, and Elder Shi Kun sat in the stone pavilion outside the Nine Peaks, so I met you then, though you may not have remembered."

"I see..." Shi Kun nodded; too many people came to plead for pills at the Nine Peaks each day—he could not remember them all.

"Has your Dragon-Phoenix Palace ever sought pills there?" Yang Kai asked Sun Yu.

"Yes—Elder Xiao returned saying there were so many people in line that he waited a month before his turn, and the pills obtained were given to me to take," Sun Yu said with a simple laugh.

"Next time you need pills, just say you're looking for me; you won't have to wait in line," Yang Kai instructed.

Instantly, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace people's attitudes toward Yang Kai shifted.

Chen Zhou, growing awkward, cautiously asked, "May I ask what relation you have with Yang Kai, master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

Shi Kun, an Elder of the Sacred Land, stood just a step behind Yang Kai, clearly acknowledging him as the one in charge.

Sun Yu had just called him Senior Yang.

Chen Zhou could not help but form several conjectures—he was shrewd and quick-witted, and immediately entertained guesses.

"This is the master of our Sacred Land!" Shi Kun said in a deep voice.

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace people trembled and looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Chen Zhou's face flushed with shame as he bowed repeatedly: "It turns out you are Saint Lord Yang—my earlier ignorance offended you; please forgive me."

Had he known at first sight, he would not have so rudely questioned Yang Kai—who would have thought this youth had become the most prominent figure in the world?

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace and the Nine Heavens Sacred Land were worlds apart in strength; if they had angered the latter outright, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace would have no hope.

At the thought, Chen Zhou was seized by fright, his body turning cold.

"Palace Master Chen needn't worry; Sun Yu and I are friends, so I take no offense," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

"Friends..." The Dragon-Phoenix Palace group were dumbstruck; one by one their faces flushed with excitement—being allied with Yang Kai seemed a great honor.

Looking at Sun Yu, their gazes grew even more reverent and thrilled.

Each of them thought privately, the Dragon Emperor truly lives up to his title to befriend such a figure.

He was still young and relatively weak, yet could receive such favor from the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; Yang Kai clearly had great insight and had seen Sun Yu's promise.

While the Dragon-Phoenix Palace experts indulged in their speculation and private elation, Yang Kai asked Sun Yu, "What brings you here?"

Sun Yu scratched his head: "Senior Yang once told me to gather intelligence, so I had people watching for leads; at last they discovered that this Small Xuan Realm has information you wanted, so I brought people over—who knew Senior Yang would be here too?"

"Hmm, I only learned of this place not long ago myself."

Sun Yu turned his head and looked around, discovering that some four or five thousand people had gathered here, and he could not help but gape in silent astonishment.
