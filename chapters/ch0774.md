## Chapter 774 — No Hope

The void force is peculiar; it only ever emanates from places where a Void Passage exists.

The presence of void force meant there was a Void Passage ahead; Yang Kai's spirit jolted and he peered into the distance.

After a while, a pitch-black opening came into view; it lay perhaps dozens of li from where the Yang Clan resided.

No wonder he hadn't sensed the void force earlier, Yang Kai thought to himself.

A moment later, the Divine Tree halted before the Void Passage.

The Void Passage was roughly one zhang in diameter, large enough for several people to enter at once, but there was no way the Divine Tree's massive trunk could fit.

Forcing its way in would very likely destroy the Void Passage and have the chaotic void force tear it to bits.

"Brother Gou Chi, do you have any recollection of this place?" Yang Kai asked gravely.

Gou Chi looked about for a moment, then nodded slightly. "Yes. After we were captured it seems they brought us in through here."

"That's good!" Yang Kai said, thoroughly pleased.

Although he'd reached an agreement with the Yang Clan, there was no guarantee they'd lead him to the correct Void Passage; if the world beyond wasn't the Demon Domain but some perilous or unknown place, all their efforts would be wasted.

"You're a cautious one," the Yang Clan leader mocked. "Since I promised to let you leave, I won't go back on my word, and this place has only one entrance—there are no other Void Passages!"

"Better safe than sorry," Yang Kai replied casually, then grew serious and instructed Gou Chi and the other demon, "You two take An Ling'er and go first — I'll follow shortly."

Gou Chi and the demon's True Yuan and Divine Sense had both been sealed; apart from being physically stronger, they were no different from ordinary mortals and would be useless if they stayed.

At this, they both nodded. The demon said nothing and leapt into the Void Passage, vanishing from sight; Gou Chi, however, rumbled a warning to Yang Kai: "Brother, be careful—I'll wait for you on the other side!"

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Only then did Gou Chi and An Ling'er depart together, their forms disappearing into the Void Passage; An Ling'er cast a worried glance back at Yang Kai, as if fearful he might not make it out.

After the three had gone, Yang Kai drew a quiet breath; instead of leaving, he sat cross-legged upon the trunk.

The Yang Clan members frowned and watched him warily, afraid he might be scheming something.

"Boy, why aren't you leaving? I've granted all your demands!" the Yang Clan leader sneered like a grim reaper, eager to see him gone; they were willing to bear the losses so long as they could keep this sentient Divine Tree.

"No need to rush, I'm resting a bit," Yang Kai chuckled, visibly circulating his True Yuan as he began to recuperate.

His mind silently sank into the trunk. His spirit body manifested within the tree's heart. With the Divine Tree guarding him, he felt no fear of the Yang Clan experts turning on him.

Sensing Yang Kai's arrival, the Divine Tree brightened with joy; energy within the trunk surged more briskly.

"Don't get too excited!" Yang Kai quickly sent a thought. "Listen—I plan to leave this place now; will you come with me?"

The mass of spirit-energy in the tree's heart immediately enveloped Yang Kai, conveying urgent eagerness.

"Then that's a yes," Yang Kai grinned. "Good. Though I've never tried this, the method should work—I hope it does. Remember, if it fails you'll probably have to stay here temporarily. I promise you: I won't be gone long; I'll come back and take you away."

Yang Kai's messages were somewhat complex, and the Divine Tree seemed unable to fully grasp them at first; yet from his emotions it understood enough, momentarily fell into a melancholy, then quickly brightened again—apparently reassured by his promise.

"It's settled then—I'll brand you first!" Yang Kai declared, pouring vast spirit-energy to leave his mark within the Divine Tree's heart.

Thus, even if he couldn't take the Divine Tree today, he would still be able to sense its presence through this subtle brand.

This differed from the spirit-brand used to subdue An Ling'er: that one was taking; this was giving. In other words, if the Divine Tree's heart were harmed, Yang Kai's spirit would suffer as well; conversely, harm to An Ling'er would not affect him.

Once their communion ended, Yang Kai withdrew his mind from the tree heart and returned to his body.

Under everyone's gaze Yang Kai rose slowly, staring coldly at the Yang Clan experts below; his eyes held a peculiar intent, his body as straight as a spear, expression resolute and ruthless.

The Yang Clan leader's heart lurched and he barked, "No—this brat is untrustworthy. He's probably planning some trick!"

Yang Kai laughed and called out, "No tricks—just a farewell surprise for you!"

As he spoke, the Divine Sense power from his Sea of Consciousness erupted like a tidal wave, sweeping forth and enveloping the Divine Tree.

From within his body, where the Wordless Black Book was hidden, a tremendous tugging force made itself felt.

Thud...

Yang Kai's heart contracted violently, emitting a muffled, drum-like thud.

In an instant his face went ashen, his body swayed; Yang Kai felt the breath of death wash over him.

Yet, before all eyes, that great Divine Tree transformed into a stream of light and eerily vanished.

Everyone stood stunned, dumbfounded.

Yang Kai forced himself to stay conscious, then spun and dashed into the Void Passage; several killing moves he'd primed burst forth, striking outward in all directions.

His True Yuan surged chaotically; his energies were in disarray.

Rumble...

With the sound of explosions the Void Passage writhed and warped; chaotic void force spewed from the black mouth as the Passage abruptly contracted and vanished from the Yang Clan's sight.

At the same time, horrific screams rose from all directions.

The moment Yang Kai departed, the dormant Soul Devouring Worms were unleashed and rioted; warriors below the Saint Realm collapsed and died in droves!

The Yang Clan leader and the Saint Realm experts stared blankly, their faces contorted; none could form words—their minds were a void.

The Divine Tree had vanished strangely. The Void Passage was destroyed, tribe members suffered sudden casualties... such horrors were unbearable.

The Passage's destruction was expected. These Yang Clan experts had long suspected Yang Kai's plan, yet they didn't stop him—after all they'd spent their lives in this Small Xuan Realm and the outside Demon Domain was dangerous; if the Passage was destroyed, so be it.

The deaths among their people were understandable; the boy's methods were unfathomable—he'd silently killed several before, right under their noses, and likely repeated the trick.

What they couldn't fathom was how the Divine Tree had disappeared.

A Void Passage wasn't big enough to carry off the Divine Tree; it was far too huge to enter—yet, before their very eyes, it had vanishingly disappeared.

"You little thief, I'll tear you limb from limb!" the Yang Clan leader suddenly screamed hysterically, his red hair thrashing like a madman.

The other Yang Clan experts wore faces that vowed vengeance, but there was no target left to vent their fury on.

...

Within a sea of sand, Yang Kai's body crashed down onto the scorching dunes; Gou Chi and the others, who had arrived ahead of him, hurried over.

Seeing Yang Kai's condition, An Ling'er was instantly thrown into panic.

Yang Kai's face was pale, his lips dark; his True Yuan was in chaotic ruin and his Divine Sense power was nearly exhausted—dried up.

Though he bore no outward wounds, his body was unnaturally cold, as if at death's door; slow yet powerful heartbeats sounded eerily from his chest.

Even when Saintess Nan had once hunted him, Yang Kai had not fallen to such a dire state.

An Ling'er had no idea what had transpired in the Small Xuan Realm after she left, but seeing Yang Kai like this tore at her heart.

"Brother—" Gou Chi rushed over, shaking Yang Kai's arm to no avail; on closer inspection he saw Yang Kai's pupils dilated and his Divine Sense scattered—apparently his Sea of Consciousness had suffered grievous injury.

"He's beyond saving..." the other demon slowly shook his head, his face dim.

Though not close to Yang Kai, the demon owed his life to him this time; seeing Yang Kai thus left him feeling sour.

Gou Chi pressed his lips, about to speak, but upon seeing An Ling'er's inconsolable grief, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

They had carried many Spirit-Grade Pills, but in the Small Xuan Realm even their Spatial Pouches had been seized by the Yang Clan, so now even if they wished to save Yang Kai they were powerless.

Their True Yuan and Divine Sense had been sealed, so there was nothing they could do.

"No—he won't die," An Ling'er kept shaking her head, cradling Yang Kai's upper body and laying his head on her thigh; with trembling hands she brushed the dust from his face, careful not to move him too roughly. "He survived such grievous wounds before—he'll survive this too."

Thud...

Another uncanny heartbeat sounded from Yang Kai's chest; after it his life aura seemed to falter considerably.

An Ling'er burst into weeping, her heart overflowing with pain.

"Don't cry, girl," Gou Chi grunted. "Your True Yuan isn't sealed, is it? Hurry and see if you can save him."

At that, An Ling'er snapped out of her stupor and began to employ the myriad profound techniques of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to try to revive Yang Kai—but no matter how she strived, he showed no sign of improvement, leaving her helplessly distraught.

"Ah!" Gou Chi sighed heavily, pitying Yang Kai—having owed him his life, he had wanted to repay him properly; unexpectedly, of the four of them, three escaped the Small Xuan Realm while the one left behind, Yang Kai, had become like this.
