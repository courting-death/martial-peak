## Chapter 2605 — Extortion

“Sir Yang’s abilities are truly unfathomable. Seeing them today has really opened my eyes,” Fan Wu sincerely praised. This wasn’t flattery—he was genuinely amazed.

To make such a massive Stone Spirit vanish into thin air—one couldn’t help but be impressed.

Fan Wu knew he himself was incapable of such a feat.

With just this one display, the three Saint Venerables regarded Yang Kai as someone extraordinary.

Thinking further, Yang Kai was so young yet possessed such astonishing cultivation, and was also proficient in the Power of Space. Given time, it was entirely possible he could vie for the position of a Great Emperor. Even if he couldn’t become a Great Emperor, reaching the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was guaranteed. A Third Stage Emperor Realm cultivator who mastered space powers—such a person, even if not as strong as a Great Emperor, would still be among the top experts of the Emperor Realm. And he also had the Mountain and River Bell, plus that Heaven’s Punisher descendant was infatuated with him…

Reassessing Yang Kai, the three Saint Venerables realized this young man harbored unimaginable potential, and each of their minds became active with new thoughts.

Fan Wu cupped his fists and said, “Sir Yang, now that this matter is settled, why not move to my humble abode for a short rest?”

After realizing Yang Kai’s potential, Fan Wu was no longer opposed to him staying in the Ancient Land. On the contrary, he was quite enthusiastic.

Cang Gou and Luan Feng clearly noticed this as well. Before Fan Wu could finish, Cang Gou said, “My palace also welcomes Sir Yang. If you wouldn’t mind…”

Luan Feng directly interrupted him, “I would also like to invite Sir Yang to my place. I just fear Sir Yang might refuse.”

Cang Gou, unable to finish his sentence, felt stifled and glared at Luan Feng, looking thoroughly frustrated.

Yang Kai glanced at the three with a smile, his mind clear as a mirror—he knew exactly what they were thinking. He sneered inwardly, wondering if they would remain so enthusiastic once they learned his true intentions. After a moment’s thought, he said, “Thank you for your hospitality. I won’t stand on ceremony—whose palace is closest?”

He didn’t have much of a relationship with any of the three Saint Venerables. The only one he found somewhat agreeable was Luan Feng—after all, she was a woman, which gave her some natural advantages. And because of Ruoxi, Yang Kai’s impression of her was a bit better than the other two.

But at this point, it didn’t matter where he went. The real show would begin after he arrived.

Luan Feng’s beautiful eyes lit up as she said, “My palace is the closest.”

Cang Gou immediately objected, “It’s only a hundred thousand li closer than mine. You call that close?”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Since Lady Feng’s palace is the nearest, I’ll stay there. Ahem… My injuries haven’t healed yet, so I really shouldn’t travel far.” As he spoke, he suddenly coughed violently, spraying a mouthful of Golden Blood like rain.

The three were shocked. Luan Feng cried out, “Sir Yang, what’s wrong?!”

Standing to the side, the Third Disciple’s face paled as well. She hurried forward to support Yang Kai, asking with concern, “Master…”

Clutching his chest, Yang Kai replied with difficulty, “Shi Huo was too ruthless. I’m seriously injured and probably won’t recover anytime soon.”

Fan Wu and the others were stunned. Hadn’t that Heaven’s Punisher descendant just given him a Ten-Thousand-Year Phoenix Blood Fruit? With such a miraculous healing medicine, what injury couldn’t be cured? Besides, he’d been fine just moments ago—how was he suddenly coughing up blood? They all wore strange expressions, not knowing what Yang Kai was up to.

“Cough, cough…” Yang Kai’s face was pale and he panted, “I’ve heard there are many Spiritual Herbs in the Ancient Land with long medicinal ages. If I could get some to take, they would surely help my injuries. Alas, I’m wounded and don’t have the strength to search for them myself.”

Fan Wu’s face darkened as he suddenly understood Yang Kai’s intentions. The corner of his mouth twitched as he said, “Rest assured, Sir Yang. I’ll have my Yao Kings search for those Spiritual Herbs and personally deliver them to you. Please hold on a bit longer.”

After speaking, he secretly glared at Cang Gou and sent him a message.

Cang Gou shuddered and quickly added, “Sir Yang’s matters are my duty as well.”

“Good, good.” Yang Kai wiped the blood from his mouth, half his body leaning on Third Disciple, and continued, “Besides those rare herbs, if there are any Upper-Level Source Crystals or precious treasures… my injuries should recover even faster.”

What did Source Crystals and treasures have to do with injuries? Fan Wu and the others wanted to question Yang Kai, but wasn’t this blatant extortion?

“Don’t worry, all of you. Once I’m healed, I’ll leave the Ancient Land and won’t trouble you for long.” Yang Kai forced a harmless smile, looking extremely weak.

Fan Wu’s eye twitched as he replied insincerely, “You’re too polite, Sir Yang. With your status, you can stay in the Ancient Land as long as you wish.”

“Oh, right.” Yang Kai suddenly seemed to remember something. “Since Shi Huo has been executed, the treasures he’s hoarded over the years are useless now. I’ll have to trouble you to carefully inventory his palace and send everything to me. After all, they’re Ruoxi’s spoils of war. When she comes out of the Blood Gate, I’ll have to give them to her.”

At these words, Fan Wu and the others felt their hearts bleeding. But since Yang Kai invoked the Heaven’s Punisher descendant, they dared not object.

Fan Wu replied, “You’re right, Sir Yang. Shi Huo did collect quite a few good things over the years. I’ll take people to inventory them and send them all to you.” Then he looked at Luan Feng, “Madam Feng, take good care of Sir Yang.”

Luan Feng nodded, “I understand.” She turned to Yang Kai, “Sir Yang, let me take you back to my palace.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Luan Feng immediately summoned her power, wrapping Yang Kai and the Third Disciple as they soared into the sky.

Before leaving, Yang Kai waved to Fan Wu and Cang Gou, “I’ll be waiting for good news from you two. Please do your best.”

Fan Wu and Cang Gou forced smiles uglier than crying and cupped their fists in farewell.

Once Yang Kai and the others disappeared from sight, Fan Wu’s face fell and he shook his head with a bitter smile, “It’s easy to invite a god, but hard to send one away.”

Cang Gou looked at him, “Shi Huo’s things… do we really have to give them all to him? Shi Huo collected quite a fortune over the years.”

Fan Wu glanced at him, “Which is more important, treasures or your life?”

Cang Gou said, “He doesn’t know how much Shi Huo actually amassed. He’s just a First Stage Emperor. If we give him a little, he’ll probably be overjoyed. There’s so much good stuff—can he even use it all?”

Fan Wu snorted, “He may not know, but Madam Feng does. If he asks her and she lets something slip, how will we explain ourselves?”

Cang Gou frowned, “Madam Feng isn’t that talkative, is she?”

Fan Wu sighed, “He’s using the Heaven’s Punisher descendant as leverage. Demanding Shi Huo’s inheritance in her name—Madam Feng probably won’t dare hide much.”

Cang Gou also sighed heavily, his face full of pain at the loss.

Towering mountains pierced the sky, their peaks wreathed in drifting clouds like an immortal realm. Atop these lofty heights, palaces were scattered like stars, while rare birds and exotic beasts soared and frolicked amidst the mist—a true paradise on earth.

This was where Luan Feng’s palace was located.

As one of the Four Great Saint Venerables’ palaces, this place naturally occupied an excellent Earth Vein. The Spiritual Qi here was incredibly dense, auspicious energy filling the air.

Luan Feng landed with Yang Kai and the Third Disciple. Yang Kai’s eyes sparkled as he looked around, secretly full of admiration.

As soon as they landed, a group of beautiful women dressed as maids came forward—two rows of eight in total. Each exuded a fierce Yao Qi, clearly all powerful members of the Yao Race.

Sweeping them with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found all eight maids were at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm.

The maids stopped in front, bowed in unison, and greeted, “Greetings, my lord!”

Luan Feng waved her hand for them to rise, then pointed to Yang Kai, “This is Sir Yang, a distinguished guest of my palace. He’ll be staying at Fengluo Palace for some time. Inform everyone below: from now on, treat Sir Yang as you would me. Not the slightest discourtesy will be tolerated.”

The eight maids were all shocked by these words. After responding, they secretly sized up Yang Kai.

Pairs of beautiful eyes looked over and, seeing that Yang Kai was actually human, they were all quite surprised. They wondered what kind of person could earn such respect from the Saint Venerable.

To be treated as the Saint Venerable herself—this was an immense honor.

As they were speaking, a mischievous little girl of about seven or eight suddenly darted out from ahead. She was exquisitely adorable, her features delicate and refined, bearing a clear resemblance to Luan Feng. Her hair was styled into two cute little braids, and with a joyful cry, she dashed forward and leapt straight into Luan Feng’s arms, her small head burrowing about, causing Luan Feng’s ample chest to twist and deform under her enthusiastic embrace.

Watching this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but swallow.

Luan Feng’s face flushed as she was jostled. Noticing Yang Kai’s odd gaze, she quickly picked up the little girl and scolded, “Ling’er, behave! Mother has a guest today. I’ll play with you later.”

She smiled apologetically at Yang Kai, “The child is spoiled. Please don’t mind, Sir Yang.”

“Not at all,” Yang Kai replied, looking Ling’er up and down. “Lady Feng, is this the daughter I saw years ago at the Yuqing Mountain?”

“That’s right!” Lady Feng set Ling’er down, doting as she patted her head.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue in amazement.

He had indeed seen this Ling’er girl years ago at the Yuqing Mountain, when she appeared as a little Luan Feng. He hadn’t expected that after all these years, she could now take human form, and her cultivation was impressive—already at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

But as a descendant of a Divine Spirit, such astonishing growth was not surprising.

Watching her, Yang Kai grew curious.

To have children, after all, required a man and a woman. But how did Luan Feng give birth to this daughter? There probably wasn’t another male Luan Feng in the world, was there?

Could it be… she had an affair with one of her Yao Kings? At this thought, Yang Kai’s expression turned odd.
