## Chapter 2174 — Another Bead

The lake water was icy cold, but still bearable. Yang Kai ventured deeper without encountering danger, only the sound of his heartbeat echoing in the silence.

Suddenly, Yang Kai sensed something and gazed intently in a certain direction.

From there, the sound of splashing water reached him.

What met his eyes was an utterly unbelievable scene.

In the very center of the lake, a woman was bathing. Her black hair was smooth, her features exquisite, her face delicate and beautiful, with delicate shoulders exposed. The heat from her body collided with the cold lake water, creating a thin mist that made her seem unreal, as if shrouded in haze.

The lake’s surface shimmered; the clear water refracted the submerged parts of the woman’s body, quickening the pulse and inflaming the imagination.

At this moment, the woman was gently raising one soft arm, while her other hand scooped up clear water to slowly wipe her flawless, snow-white skin, seemingly completely unaware of Yang Kai’s arrival.

However... as Yang Kai’s gaze fell upon her, she clearly sensed it too, hurriedly turning her head to look over.

Her beautiful eyes shone like stars, radiating a unique brilliance. Just one glance made it impossible to look away, as if one would sink into them.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai was momentarily dazed. Instead, the woman pursed her lips and smiled, a soul-stealing, enchanting smile.

A layer of light, invisible to the naked eye, spread out from her, enveloping Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression grew even more blank...

The woman grinned, and her smile suddenly became incomparably ferocious. Then she opened her mouth wide—her once cherry-like lips transforming into a monstrous maw that lunged at Yang Kai.

Even though they were separated by more than a dozen zhang, that terrifying mouth swallowed Yang Kai whole, taking a good portion of the lake water with him.

As the giant mouth closed, the scene where the woman had been bathing twisted and distorted. There was no longer any beauty in the water; in her place was a bizarre beast, chewing on something.

The strange beast defied proper description. Its entire form was a sphere roughly three to four zhang across, its surface pitch-black, studded with more than a dozen eyes, and from that surface sprouted seven or eight tendril-like appendages that writhed and lashed without pause.

On the shore, Liu Yan, who had been closely watching Yang Kai, couldn’t help but let her pretty face fall at this sight. Yet she didn’t show much worry, for she could sense that Yang Kai was unharmed.

Instead, Little Snowflake was startled, fluttering rapidly in place, as if wanting to rescue Yang Kai but not quite daring to.

“Heh heh... A demonic beast skilled in soul attacks is quite rare!” Yang Kai’s voice echoed eerily from somewhere in the void. The next moment, his figure appeared, standing atop the round beast’s head, completely unscathed.

When the scene of the woman bathing appeared in his vision, Yang Kai had already sensed something was wrong.

In a place like this, what sect’s female disciple would bathe so calmly? Even Dao Origin Realm cultivators who entered the Four Seasons Land wouldn’t have such leisure.

At first, he thought the woman’s form was a demonic beast’s transformation, but after being attacked, he suddenly realized it was a soul assault. The bathing beauty was just an illusion conjured after he was attacked.

The illusion was simply too real—even Yang Kai hadn’t seen through it at first glance.

Once he understood, it was easy to deal with. When the truly fatal attack arrived, a single teleport was enough to escape.

As Yang Kai finished speaking, the beast that had been chewing suddenly froze. All its many eyes turned to look at Yang Kai, then it opened its huge mouth, spitting out the lake water. A maw-like opening split open at the front of its body, filled with fangs, and it let out a furious howl.

The sound gathered into waves, visible to the naked eye, spreading in all directions. The once calm lake surface rippled violently.

Origin Qi rose across Yang Kai’s body, warding off the strange assault within the sound wave and dispersing it into ripples of light.

“Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm...” Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over, instantly discerning the beast’s level and strength.

The beast, seeing its sonic attack fail, seemed enraged. Its many eyes shrank, and an invisible force surged forth.

Yang Kai raised his brow and shouted, “Soul power on par with the peak of the Dao Origin Realm!”

His expression grew grave. His Sea of Consciousness churned, and his fierce Divine Sense surged forth, transforming into an invisible shockwave to meet the attack head-on.

Boom...

A loud bang rang out. Yang Kai’s body trembled, forcing him to stagger back several steps, his mind wracked with intense pain.

The beast fared no better. Its round body convulsed violently, tentacles flailing, and it let out a heartrending wail.

The clash of Divine Senses was the most perilous and unpredictable. The beast relied on its mastery of soul attacks and didn’t take Yang Kai seriously, but Yang Kai couldn’t afford to show weakness.

He possessed the Warm Spirit Lotus, so he had no fear of clashing soul power head-on!

In this exchange, neither man nor beast gained the upper hand.

But with the Warm Spirit Lotus dissolving the damage to his Divine Sense, Yang Kai quickly recovered. The beast, however, was still unable to compose itself, trembling as if the collision had caused it great harm.

Seeing this, Yang Kai wasted no time. The Myriad Sword appeared in his hand, Imperial Might surged, and his body turned into a rainbow as he slashed forward with a single sword.

Swish, swish, swish...

A long sword swept up thousands of sword lights, shooting toward the beast like a storm.

In an instant, blood dyed the lake red.

The beast howled in pain, its many eyes filled with terror, its tentacles flailing wildly to block the omnipresent sword gleams.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai’s strike failed to kill it!

Yang Kai had expected that, despite the beast’s Second Stage Dao Origin Realm strength, its body would be the weak point even if its soul power was near the peak.

Yet its round body was incredibly elastic. Most sword energy glanced off its glossy surface, causing only minor injuries.

The flailing tentacles weren’t so lucky, however, and were sliced into countless pieces, scattering across the water.

Now, the beast looked even uglier—a round ball covered in eyes...

Sensing danger, the beast had no intention of fighting Yang Kai to the death. Instead, it sank straight to the bottom of the lake, diving rapidly.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. Bold and skilled, he dove into the lake, chasing after it.

The water was crystal clear, and with blood trailing the way, Yang Kai had no fear of losing track.

The lake was at least a dozen zhang deep. The further down he went, the darker it became, but with his power and vision, Yang Kai wasn’t worried about losing sight.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he followed the trail to a spot at the lakebed and looked ahead, raising his brow in surprise.

There, the beast lay quietly on the bottom. Roughly three feet above the lakebed stood an altar-like structure, upon which an object rested.

It was a bead!

A bead emitting a green light, about the size of a longan.

The moment Yang Kai saw the bead, his heart stirred.

Aside from the color, this bead was identical in every way to the treasure he had snatched from the Time Temple before—even the size seemed cast from the same mold.

“Could it be...?”

A vague suspicion arose in Yang Kai’s heart, but he couldn’t confirm it.

At this moment, the beast was quietly standing there, the green bead radiating a misty light that enveloped it. Under this protection, the wounds Yang Kai had inflicted had already completely healed, with no more blood flowing.

Of course, the tentacles couldn’t regrow so quickly. No matter how strong its vitality, it couldn’t achieve such miraculous regeneration.

“This must be the most precious thing in the Winter Domain,” Yang Kai thought to himself as he gazed at the green bead.

Little Snowflake had brought him here, and aside from the beast, the only thing in the lake was the bead on the altar. It couldn’t be that the beast itself was the Winter Domain’s greatest treasure.

Other than this green bead, there was no other explanation.

Yang Kai’s arrival seemed to disturb the beast as it was healing.

Without turning, its many eyes spotted Yang Kai. The next moment, it opened its fanged mouth and roared in fury, full of menace. But without its tentacles, it couldn’t unleash any real killing moves.

It could only gather its soul power again, blasting it at Yang Kai through its many eyes!

"Courting death!" Yang Kai's expression darkened. In the blink of an eye, his left eye flickered open, revealing the World-Ending Demon Eye. Within the golden pupil a lotus bud quietly took shape, spinning gently before vanishing from Yang Kai's sight.

In the next instant, the beast froze in place as if struck by a binding spell.

In its vision, the budding lotus filled everything. The lotus bloomed, drawing on its soul power as nourishment...

Though its soul power was formidable, it had already been wounded in the earlier clash with Yang Kai. Now, struck by the Blooming Lotus secret technique, it was powerless to resist.

Soon, with a series of soft pops, all the beast’s many eyes burst, as if an immense pressure from within had crushed them.

Yang Kai gripped the Myriad Sword, merging with his sword, and vanished in a flash of light.

When he reappeared, he was already behind the beast.

A huge hole had opened in the beast’s round body, exposing its internal organs.

Yang Kai struck with a backhand palm, Spatial Force surging, and chanted in a low voice, “Banish!”

A deep black hole appeared, like a beast’s gaping maw, devouring the beast’s corpse completely. When the black hole vanished, only Yang Kai remained.

He opened his palm to reveal a dark red Inner Core!
