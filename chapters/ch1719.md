## Chapter 1719 — Slave-Insect Bracelet

The entire Lingxiao Sect was overseen by Ye Xijun, so Yang Kai had no need to worry much; even if he were absent, everything would be handled smoothly.

After parting from the other elders, Yang Kai went to see his Little Senior Sister.

The greatest gain from this trip to Ghost Isle was naturally the several thousand to tens of thousands of Huntian Lotus of assorted colors; with that many Huntian Lotus, even if Yang Kai personally refined them, it would take no small amount of time.

Time, however, was not a problem for Xia Ningshang.

She could fully rely on pill-refining to cultivate.

Huntian Lotus and Huntian Pill were utterly impossible to find in the outside world. Xia Ningshang had taken a keen interest; after obtaining all the medicinal materials and pill formulas, she immediately entered seclusion to focus on pill-refining.

It was believed that before long the Lingxiao Sect would produce a great quantity of Huntian Pill; with these body-tempering Pills, the overall strength of the Lingxiao Sect would undoubtedly rise another notch.

Yang Kai also had his own plans for those forthcoming Huntian Pill. Although tens of thousands of Huntian Lotus seemed numerous, once refined into Pills they would amount to at most seventy to eighty thousand Pills.

Now that the Lingxiao Sect had over ten thousand disciples, those seventy to eighty thousand Pills naturally could not be evenly distributed to everyone.

Besides the Origin Returning Realm experts who qualified to receive a certain number of Huntian Pill for body tempering, Yang Kai planned to set aside a portion of the Huntian Pill as rewards to commend ordinary disciples who had contributed to the Lingxiao Sect.

Of course, this was only Yang Kai's scheme; to implement it would require some time, and he did not intend to handle the matter himself. He planned to entrust everything to Ye Xijun.

After leaving the Pill Treasure Peak where Xia Ningshang resided, Yang Kai headed straight to the Sixth Layer of Flowing Flame Sandland, the place where Yang Yan slept.

He strolled into that pavilion and reached the second floor; Yang Yan perceived him and drew his spirit body into her Sea of Consciousness.

Just as when they had last met, their spirit bodies sat cross-legged facing each other, while beneath them Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness roared and surged, blisteringly hot.

"I heard from Ye Xijun that you went to hunt down the Insect Emperor — how did it go?" Yang Yan asked.

"I am now the lord of Dark Star; what do you think his end was?" Yang Kai chuckled.

“Looks like he’s dead,” Yang Yan said with a slight nod, then sighed softly. “The Insect Emperor was a hero of his age — who would’ve thought he’d meet his end at your hands? If his old enemies were to hear of this, they likely wouldn’t believe it.”

Yang Kai was unconcerned. No matter how formidable the Insect Emperor had been, that was a matter from tens of thousands of years ago. Previously his cultivation had plunged; he was not even at the Void King Realm, and when he fought Yang Kai on Dark Star there had been no way out for him.

The main reason he had been able to kill the Insect Emperor this time was that Yang Yan had bestowed the Dark Star's origin upon Yang Kai; otherwise, with Yang Kai's present strength he would not have been able to deal with the Insect Emperor.

The Insect Emperor's escape abilities were indeed remarkable; even ordinary Void King Realm practitioners would have been at a loss when trying to hunt him down.

"Quite a haul?" Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled. "There were many valuable things on the Insect Emperor."

"There wasn't much, only the Soul-Severing Blade and a secret treasure that looked like a bracelet."

The Soul-Severing Blade and that bracelet-like secret treasure were undoubtedly both of Imperial Treasure rank. Like the Extinction Thunder Bead, Xuan Realm Pearl, and Three Flames Ring, Yang Kai had a rough idea of the Soul-Severing Blade's use — it could sever souls and its power was unfathomable — but alas, as an Imperial Treasure its rank was too high; Yang Kai could not make use of it and could only temper and refine it for the time being, hoping that one day it would be capable of exerting its power.

As for that bracelet-like secret treasure, Yang Kai was utterly baffled and could not discern its purpose at all.

"Slave-Insect Bracelet?" Yang Yan raised her brows and spoke the treasure's name plainly.

"That thing is called Slave-Insect Bracelet?" Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise.

"Indeed. The treasures the Insect Emperor carried were all renowned; no need to mention the Soul-Severing Blade — the Slave-Insect Bracelet was the foundation of his standing!"

"Oh? What does it do? Tell me." Yang Kai's interest was immediately piqued.

"The Slave-Insect Bracelet is extremely useful," Yang Yan smiled with pursed lips. "Not only can this treasure naturally suppress those strange insects and anomalous beasts, it can even exert some deterrent effect on certain smaller demonic beasts. As for the little creatures the Insect Emperor raised within the bracelet, once released they could easily devastate an entire Star Domain."

Yang Kai's expression grew grave. He asked in astonishment, "There were things inside the Slave-Insect Bracelet?"

Yang Yan gave a tinkling, girlish laugh. "Did you think the Insect Emperor raised his little things on his body? He wouldn't keep them on himself. The Slave-Insect Bracelet was where he bred his strange insects and anomalous beasts. The Insect Emperor controlled dozens to hundreds of ancient exotic insects that had long since gone extinct; each was ferocious to the extreme and each had a different use. Back then I suffered no small loss from the Slave-Insect Bracelet."

The more Yang Kai listened, the brighter his eyes grew, as if he had discovered a world-shaking hoard.

"Tempted?" Yang Yan teased.

"To be honest, somewhat," Yang Kai's excitement gradually subsided. "But I still think cultivation must be human-centered; such Slave-Insect methods are only supplementary. If one were to devote one's mind entirely to them, one might lose sight of the fundamental."

Yang Yan slowly shook her head. “There are three thousand Great Daos — and the Dao of Slave Insects is one among them. Otherwise, the Insect Emperor could never have reached the heights he did. All I can say is that your path differs from his.”

"Different paths..." Yang Kai pondered.

Yang Yan smiled softly. "This is still too early for you. You should ascend to the Void King Realm first. After Void King, you will see more and go further."

"Is there a higher realm above Void King Realm?" Yang Kai asked suddenly.

"Of course there is."

"And you?" Yang Kai's gaze burned as he looked at Yang Yan.

"I have already surpassed that realm!" Yang Yan answered faintly.

Yang Kai fell silent. From what Yang Yan had revealed he could fairly conclude that above the Void King Realm there indeed lay deeper realms, and above those realms still greater existences — Yang Yan belonged to that circle.

Before learning these things, Yang Kai hadn’t thought much of it. But now that he knew, he felt as though he were standing at the foot of a towering mountain, gazing upward — the peaks shrouded in swirling mist, obscuring the path ahead.

The road ahead was endless; the Martial Dao had no true peak.

Yang Yan did not speak further but watched Yang Kai's reaction; seeing that he was not disheartened but after a moment of silence drew a light breath and seemed relaxed, with eyes like burning flames that displayed the driving force within his heart.

Yang Yan smiled with pursed lips and praised, "Your mindset is very good."

Yang Kai beamed. "I have cultivated for decades, clawing and crawling up from the lowest rung, and now have achieved a little. Even if the road ahead is thorny and dangerous, I'll treat it as another climb; sooner or later I'll stand as high as you and see as far as you do!"

Yang Yan covered her rosy lips with a delicate hand, her eyes curved in amusement. “May I say — the boy is teachable?”

"Say what you like!" Yang Kai shrugged and teased, "Just don't be afraid of sounding old when you say it."

Yang Yan couldn't help but glare at him.

"By the way, that Slave-Insect Bracelet — can I use it now?" Yang Kai asked.

"Better not yet," Yang Yan's expression turned serious. "Those strange insects and anomalous beasts kept in the Slave-Insect Bracelet are exceedingly ferocious. With your current cultivation, even if you released them you could not command them; you would only be devoured in return. Did you see the Insect Emperor use the Slave-Insect Bracelet against you?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "From beginning to end he only used the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu to control his subordinates and to attempt possession."

"Exactly — even the Insect Emperor did not dare use them lightly, let alone you. Wait until you reach the Void King Realm."

"Fine!" Yang Kai nodded indifferently. In any case he now had many methods for fighting, and he did not lack the Slave-Insect Bracelet's assistance.

Afterwards Yang Kai recounted the events on Ghost Isle to Yang Yan. Yang Yan did not deny that Ghost Isle was related to her, and she told Yang Kai that she had used her means to seal Ghost Isle.

However, she did not explain what exactly was hidden within.

"I can only tell you that Ghost Isle is a gate. If you truly want to open it, gather all the Star Emperor Tokens; when the time comes you will naturally know."

After leaving Yang Yan, Yang Kai went to Ice Grace Peak.

Ice Grace Peak was one of the seventy-two auxiliary peaks among the Lingxiao Sect's eighty-one peaks; its Spiritual Qi was not shabby and its scenery beautiful.

What was rare about it was that an ice-attributed Earth Vein flowed beneath the peak. As a result, for dozens of kilometers around Ice Grace Peak, the climate remained frigid year-round, the temperature bone-chillingly low. From time to time, great flakes of snow would drift down, blanketing the entire mountain in silvery white.

This condition became even more pronounced after Su Yan settled at Ice Grace Peak.

Since Su Yan became the peak master of Ice Grace Peak, the icy Spiritual Qi of the peak had become so dense it seemed almost impossible to dissipate. Warriors of somewhat lower strength could not even approach Ice Grace Peak, while those slightly stronger had to circulate Saint Yuan to resist the severe cold upon entering.

However, this environment was extremely comfortable for Su Yan.

There was no one else on Ice Grace Peak; only a few members of the original Ice Sect lived and cultivated there. Besides Su Yan there were Qing Ya, Qian Yue, and her brother Qian Hao.

Yang Kai went straight to the southwest corner of Ice Grace Peak.

The ground was covered by a thick ice layer that reflected like a mirror, and Yang Kai's footsteps were very light.

In the southwest corner, beneath a great tree draped in silver frost, Su Yan sat cross-legged atop the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform. Behind her, a pair of pristine Saint Yuan wings were unfurled; her delicate face bore a solemn, sacred expression, exuding an aura that brooked no defiance. Her hands were forming a series of mysterious seals, and three feet before her, the Profound Frost Divine Sword she had obtained from Ice Heart Valley floated silently in midair. With each breath she took, the world’s icy Spiritual Qi surged into her body like ten thousand streams flowing into the sea, while the white wings behind her beat with the faintest, almost imperceptible rhythm.

Centered on Su Yan, within a radius of one hundred zhang there spread a peculiar profound intent that seemed able to freeze all things within heaven and earth.

An almost consummate Shi field!
