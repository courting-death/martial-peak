## Chapter 2049 — Strange Trial

Darkness surrounded him; Yang Kai felt his body continually falling downward as if there were no end, and when he looked up there was not the slightest hint of light.

Yang Kai frowned slightly; although he was somewhat surprised by his present predicament, he was not overly alarmed.

The events he had encountered earlier in the stone chamber had made one thing clear to him.

Those stone cauldrons were likely all triggers for the mechanism, so he could not probe any clues with his Divine Sense — only when they were touched would the chamber’s trap mechanisms be activated.

Thinking it over this way, the people from the Blazing Fire Hall must have fallen into the same kind of trap, which explained why the stone chamber above had been empty.

He couldn't tell whether Kang Siran had come down with him, nor whether any of the Blazing Fire Hall's cultivators remained below.

He dared not be careless; he quietly circulated his strength, prepared so that the moment anything went wrong he would unleash slaughter.

Not long after, a thread of light suddenly appeared below; Yang Kai hastily released his Divine Sense to sweep downward, and after a moment his expression grew strange.

Below was another stone chamber, though it was not quite what he had expected; there were no cultivators from the Blazing Fire Hall inside — it, too, was utterly deserted.

After a moment, Yang Kai fell into the stone chamber. He glanced around; the place was utterly deserted — there wasn’t even a single stone cauldron.

Before Yang Kai could examine things carefully, an unusual fluctuation of energy suddenly rose within the chamber, and then, in the very center, a stone platform slowly materialized.

The stone platform rose slowly with rumbling sounds. Yang Kai watched warily and waited until the platform completely stabilized, finding no danger had appeared.

He furrowed his brow and slowly walked toward the stone platform.

Reaching the front of the platform, he climbed the steps and soon arrived at its top.

"An array?" Yang Kai raised his brow in surprise as he stared at the extremely arcane pattern that had appeared on the platform’s smooth surface; from that pattern he faintly sensed a ripple of spatial force.

"A teleportation array?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised, but this confirmed something for him: if the array on the platform were activated, it should transport him to another place.

However, this teleportation array differed significantly from what he had learned, so Yang Kai did not dare act rashly and instead watched it closely, hoping to glean some clue.

On closer inspection, Yang Kai discovered a line of small characters beneath the platform, obscured by dust.

He cautiously reached out and brushed away the dust; the line of characters immediately leapt into view.

"Pour fire-type energy into the array and it will activate!" Yang Kai murmured the line aloud, and his brow tightened.

It was clearly a teleportation array, so why did it require fire-type energy to be poured in? This puzzled Yang Kai, and why such a special array existed in this chamber was another mystery.

He thought for a while and could not make sense of it, so he stopped dwelling on it.

He did possess fire-type power, whether Divine Sense Fire or the Fire Sword Qi, but he did not rashly trigger the array; instead he stood in place and waited quietly.

He wanted to wait for Kang Siran, to act together when he arrived.

But to Yang Kai’s disappointment, he waited in place for half an hour and still saw no sign of Kang Siran.

Kang Siran must have seen the scene when he triggered the stone cauldron mechanism and fell; given Kang Siran’s temperament, he would not simply leave him, so Yang Kai was certain Kang Siran would have touched that stone cauldron as well.

Yet since there was no sign of Kang Siran at all, there was only one explanation — Kang Siran had fallen into a different stone chamber.

There must be more than one chamber here; otherwise when he fell he would not have failed to see any of the Blazing Fire Hall disciples.

Perhaps all who had fallen had been separated, unable to cooperate.

Of course, this was merely Yang Kai’s conjecture based on the situation; whether it was true he could not verify.

Since he could not wait for Kang Siran, Yang Kai had no choice but to act alone; thinking this, he no longer hesitated and reached toward the array, urging his internal fire-type energy into it.

A scorching aura appeared, the whole chamber trembled, and the array lines on the platform suddenly flared.

Seeing this, Yang Kai knew he had not been mistaken — this array indeed needed fire-type energy to activate, and he began to pump his fire-type power even more frantically.

Rumbling sounds followed, and the array on the platform flashed a blinding light that enveloped Yang Kai; when the light faded, Yang Kai had already vanished.

"This is…" Yang Kai turned and looked around, only to find that he was still in a stone chamber; if not for the earlier sensation of teleportation, he might have assumed he had never moved at all.

"What on earth is this for!" Yang Kai frowned, unable to fathom it.

In general, an exalted master’s dwelling was rigged with many restrictions and arrays; that was understandable — no cultivator’s lair lacked such measures. But this dwelling was odd: it had countless identical stone chambers. The first chamber he had passed through required only pouring fire-type energy into the array and was otherwise harmless; the purpose of this particular chamber remained unknown.

As he puzzled over it, the familiar humming sounded again, and in the next moment Yang Kai saw a stone platform gradually rise in the center of the chamber, no different from the previous one.

He furrowed his brow, resigned to accept whatever lay ahead, and slowly climbed onto the stone platform.

Looking around, Yang Kai could not help but give a slight exclamation.

This time the platform had no array lines; instead, many grooves had appeared.

In those grooves lay different kinds of medicinal herbs.

These medicinal herbs had been preserved by special methods and had not decayed over thousands of years; their properties remained intact, and they appeared as if freshly picked.

Yang Kai glanced and found most of these herbs unfamiliar; he could only recognize two or three of them — the rest he did not know at all.

He then turned his attention to beneath the platform and indeed found another line of small characters; he brushed away the dust and read aloud: "Select fifteen poisonous herbs from among them and the array will activate!"

"Select fifteen?" Yang Kai was taken aback, and after carefully counting the herbs on the platform he discovered there were only twenty-five kinds in total — in other words, more than half of these herbs were poisonous.

What did the owner of this dwelling intend by doing this? To set such a riddle for him filled Yang Kai with puzzlement.

He shook his head, focused his mind, and concentrated on the twenty-five herbs before him.

Although the small characters did not explain the consequences of choosing incorrectly, Yang Kai also knew he could not casually experiment; this dwelling, whether or not it had been left by Gongsun Mu, was definitely the former possession of a powerful Emperor Realm expert.

The measures of an Emperor Realm master were beyond Yang Kai’s ability to guess; one wrong choice might mean death here.

He dared not gamble with his life, and his expression became extremely solemn.

"Hmm, this Tianxin Orchid is poisonous, this Huiyin Grass is too…" Yang Kai studied for a time and first removed the few herbs he could recognize from the grooves and set them aside.

He was cautious throughout the process, but after taking those herbs out he did not trigger any restrictions, so it seemed he had chosen correctly.

Before long, he had identified three poisonous herbs among them.

The remaining herbs were all unfamiliar to him; this was partly due to his limited knowledge of Star Realm produce and partly because the herbs were extremely obscure.

Even alchemists native to the Star Realm would not necessarily recognize all these herbs.

However, as an alchemist himself, Yang Kai had studied medicinal herbs; each herb’s medicinal properties had patterns and characteristics, so even if he did not know most of them, he could still judge whether they were poisonous.

He leaned over and sniffed the herbs carefully, and soon selected several more poisonous specimens.

The toxins in these herbs were subtle; ordinary people could not determine them by scent — only alchemists or those who had studied herbs for years could possess such skill.

After some work, Yang Kai had picked out seven or eight, but he was still halfway to the required fifteen.

The remaining herbs could not be judged for toxicity by scent alone.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and decided he would have to taste them himself, using his tongue and bodily sensations to determine their nature.

With that in mind, he no longer hesitated; he pinched off a bit of a pale blue flower petal and placed it in his mouth, chewing it.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s face changed; his complexion suddenly went ashen as an ice-cold chill spread through his mouth, nearly freezing his tongue stiff.

In alarm, Yang Kai hastily circulated his strength and barely managed to dispel it.

"Although it’s potent, this is not poisonous!" After a moment, Yang Kai looked at the pale blue flower with wary eyes, not knowing what herb it was that contained such overwhelming coldness.

Having confirmed that, he turned his attention to the next herb.

Repeating the process, he pinched off another bit and popped it in his mouth; after a short while Yang Kai's face contorted in waves of blue and purple, as if enduring immense torment.

Only after the time it took an incense stick to burn did he open his mouth and spit; a jet of pitch-black blood shot from his mouth, and his vitality sagged considerably.

"The toxin is vicious!" Yang Kai said, still shaken — he had only chewed such a tiny amount and already been poisoned thus; had he swallowed the herb whole, he would likely have died instantly.
