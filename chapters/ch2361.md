## Chapter 2361 — Twin Lotus on One Stem

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, a sudden noise came from not far away, and immediately after, a figure shot into the sky and landed nearby.

Seeing this person, Yang Kai's expression changed drastically. He quickly pulled Liu Qianyun back, putting distance between themselves and the newcomer.

This person was actually Yao Changjun!

When the whirlpool swallowed them earlier, Yang Kai hadn’t seen any sign of Yao Changjun. He didn’t know whether Yao Changjun had been pulled in before or after him, but judging by his current appearance, he hadn’t escaped either and had ended up stranded here.

Moreover, Yao Changjun’s current state looked utterly miserable. His clothes were in tatters, his hair disheveled and white, his whole body covered in blood, and his aura was unstable—obviously suffering severe backlash from resisting the devouring force earlier.

Yang Kai had only managed to fare better because of Liu Qianyun’s warning, so he gave up resisting. Even though he didn’t look great now, he was still in much better shape than Yao Changjun.

This guy actually survived! Yang Kai couldn’t help but admire his formidable cultivation. As expected of a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert—even with his Divine Soul heavily damaged, he wasn’t so easily killed.

“It’s you, you little beast!” Yao Changjun quickly spotted Yang Kai, his face turning cold as murderous intent surged.

If not for Yang Kai, why would he have risked entering Jixu Ridge? If not for chasing into Jixu Ridge, how would he have encountered the Great Jixu Whirlpool? Now, stranded here, Yang Kai was the root of all his misfortune. Naturally, seeing his enemy now, his eyes blazed with hatred.

Just as he was about to attack Yang Kai in his fury, another soft sound came from not far away, and another figure burst out from beneath the earth.

This unexpected development startled both Yang Kai and Yao Changjun, and they both looked over. But when they saw who it was, they quickly relaxed.

Because the third person to appear here was none other than Pang Guang, the City Lord of Gao City!

Yao Changjun knew Pang Guang had been trailing behind, but he had been focused on tracking Yang Kai’s whereabouts and hadn’t paid Pang Guang much mind. When the disaster struck Jixu Ridge, Pang Guang naturally had no power to resist and was sucked in as well.

What surprised him, though, was that Pang Guang’s condition was much better than his own. He looked only a bit disheveled, but not injured at all, and his energy was full.

“You two are actually unharmed?” As soon as Pang Guang appeared and saw Yang Kai and Yao Changjun facing off, he was shocked.

Yao Changjun immediately snorted coldly, “You wish something had happened to me?”

Seeing Pang Guang’s appearance, he knew the man understood how to avoid the devouring force. That’s why he was unscathed, while Yao Changjun, who had hidden his identity in Gao City for two hundred years, ended up in such a sorry state. For a moment, he felt he’d lost face.

Having suffered a big loss to Yao Changjun before, Pang Guang didn’t dare act rashly. He forced a smile and said, “It’s best that Senior is unharmed. I was just asking casually, just asking.”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “City Lord Pang, that’s not very kind of you. You knew how to avoid danger but didn’t tell Senior Yao. Clearly, you wanted him to die early and be reborn sooner. Senior Yao, if I were you, I wouldn’t stand for it—I’d have to beat him up to vent my anger.”

Pang Guang’s face darkened. He cautiously glanced at Yao Changjun, seeing his expression calm and unreadable. He immediately barked, “Brat, stop spouting nonsense! I haven’t even settled accounts with you for killing my men and stealing my property! Senior Yao is a reclusive master, with eyes like a torch—how could he be swayed by your petty provocations!”

As he spoke, he turned to Yao Changjun, cupped his fists, and said, “Senior, though I have grudges with this brat, they’re just minor matters. Here, you are the most important. If you want to kill or flay him, I’ll just watch the show and won’t interfere.”

Yao Changjun glanced at him indifferently and said slowly, “You’ve been trailing behind me all this time—just to watch the show?”

Cold sweat immediately broke out on Pang Guang’s forehead. He forced a smile and said, “Senior, you misunderstand. I entered Jixu Ridge for some business, not to follow you.”

Yao Changjun merely snorted coldly, neither confirming nor denying Pang Guang’s words, his bearing proud and aloof. Though he’d suffered considerable injuries when swallowed by the great whirlpool, he still didn’t regard Pang Guang or Yang Kai as threats. The reason he’d been hurt in the teahouse by Yang Kai before was only because he’d been caught off guard.

Still, given his current state, it was best not to fall out with Pang Guang if possible. After all, he wasn’t at his peak, and Pang Guang was at least a First Stage of the Emperor Realm. If they really fought, even if he could kill Pang Guang, he’d have to pay a price.

“Senior, is this place the legendary Jixu Secret Realm?” Pang Guang, seeing he was silent and feeling uneasy, quickly changed the subject.

“Jixu Secret Realm?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows at this.

What he wanted most now was to figure out what this place was. Unlike Pang Guang and Yao Changjun, he was new here, while those two clearly knew something. So he pricked up his ears and listened with interest.

“Since you know, why ask me?” Yao Changjun snorted coldly, clearly not wanting to talk to him.

Pang Guang said awkwardly, “I really didn’t expect it. The Jixu Secret Realm actually exists. After serving as City Lord for hundreds of years, I’ve finally broadened my horizons today.”

“What kind of place is the Jixu Secret Realm, and how do we get out?” Yang Kai quickly asked.

Pang Guang’s face hardened as he barked, “Why are you asking so many questions, kid? Just wait here to die quietly.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “City Lord Pang, whatever grudges we had before, we’re all in the same boat now. Why not share what you know? It’s not like I killed your father or stole your wife—no need to be so stingy.”

Pang Guang sneered, “We walk different paths, so there’s no point in talking. This Lord has nothing to say to you. If you can survive under Senior Yao’s hand, then maybe we’ll speak again.”

Since Yang Kai had offended Yao Changjun, Pang Guang already considered him a dead man and had no interest in chatting. After speaking, he smiled obsequiously at Yao Changjun and said, “Senior, this Jixu Secret Realm only exists in legend. It’s easy to enter but hard to leave. I wonder if Senior has any good ideas?”

He changed his face faster than flipping a page in a book.

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “So you don’t know how to get out either!”

Pang Guang snorted, “What’s so funny about that? Be careful you don’t laugh your teeth out..."

As he was speaking, Pang Guang suddenly frowned, sniffed the air lightly, and asked suspiciously, “What’s that smell?”

Suddenly, a strange fragrance drifted through the air, making everyone who smelled it feel invigorated.

Yang Kai and Yao Changjun clearly smelled it too. The scent felt extremely familiar to them. They exchanged glances and, thinking of the same thing, exclaimed in unison, “Butian Lotus!”

As soon as the words fell, the two of them rushed toward the source of the fragrance.

Pang Guang was momentarily stunned, but when he heard the words "Butian Lotus," his expression changed and he hurried after them.

Although Pang Guang and Yao Changjun were both Emperor Realm experts, Yang Kai possessed space abilities, so in terms of explosive speed, they couldn’t compare. With a single teleport, Yang Kai arrived at the source of the fragrance.

It was a mound of earth, clearly transferred here from Jixu Ridge, the soil still fresh.

Yang Kai immediately thrust his hand into the mound and grabbed something. Feeling its size and the energy it emitted, he was overjoyed and was about to toss it into his Spatial Ring.

“Brat, you’re courting death!” Yao Changjun roared in fury, sending a palm strike at Yang Kai, wind and clouds surging.

Fortunately, he didn’t dare use his full strength, fearing he’d damage the Spiritual Herb, but even so, the blow was not something Yang Kai could withstand.

Yang Kai grunted, forcibly summoned his strength, and teleported away from the spot.

Boom...

The mound was smashed to powder, leaving a huge pit in its place. The newly formed island shook violently, as if it might collapse at any moment.

Yao Changjun stood where he was, his face ashen, coldly staring in one direction.

Pang Guang also stopped, a look of disbelief on his face. Yang Kai had actually dodged Yao Changjun’s strike. This scene was completely beyond his expectations—even he might not have been able to avoid it.

“Senior, why are you so angry? You nearly scared me to death.” Yang Kai said as he shook the dirt from his hand, revealing the Spiritual Herb he’d grabbed.

The Spiritual Herb was indeed the Butian Lotus. Its size and shape matched the one Liu Qianyun had obtained before: that one was pure white, while this one was pitch black and incomparably strange.

The Butian Lotus always grew as twin lotuses on one stem. Liu Qianyun had obtained one by chance before, but for some reason hadn’t found the second.

Now that the Great Jixu Whirlpool had appeared, a large amount of Spiritual Herbs and soil had been swallowed and transferred to this island, and the second Butian Lotus had appeared as well.

Staring at the Butian Lotus in Yang Kai’s hand, Yao Changjun’s breathing grew rapid.

He had wasted two hundred years in Gao City for what? For the Butian Lotus! As long as he could obtain it and have someone refine the Twin Butian Pill, his injuries would heal, and he could return to his peak to seek revenge.

But... after waiting two hundred years, the Butian Lotus had finally appeared, only for Yang Kai to ruin things again and again.

The first one had been snatched by Yang Kai when he wasn’t paying attention, and now the second was the same.

Yao Changjun was about to explode with rage. Since advancing to the Emperor Realm, he’d never suffered such losses, and now he’d suffered them twice in a row at the hands of a mere Dao Origin Realm brat.

Watching Yang Kai slowly put the Butian Lotus into his Spatial Ring, Yao Changjun forcibly suppressed his urge to snatch it and said in a deep voice, “Brat, hand over the Butian Lotus, and I’ll let bygones be bygones. I can even take you out of here.”

Pang Guang’s eyes lit up at this and he quickly said, “Senior Yao, you must take me with you then!”

Yao Changjun, unable to contain his anger, glared at him and shouted, “If you say one more word, I’ll kill you right now!”

Pang Guang was startled and immediately fell silent.
