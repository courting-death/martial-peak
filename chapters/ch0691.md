## Chapter 691 — Hundred Peaks Spirit Formation

Although the martial artists here were not as densely concentrated as Leiguang, Yang Kai discovered that the overall caliber of these fighters was decidedly superior to Leiguang's.

The Spiritual Qi here was rich as river water, flowing ceaselessly through the valley; the moment Yang Kai arrived and took a single breath, he felt his whole body ease, his mind clear, and a deep relaxation wash over him.

The valley was immense; Yang Kai hovered in midair and glanced down, and it seemed to stretch without end, leaving him visibly astonished.

It was more accurate to call this a sunken plain than a mere valley.

Ringing the valley were peaks that pierced the clouds, towering and jagged, numbering well over a hundred; within those mountains were birds and beasts, Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine, all exuding vigorous life.

Though the peaks appeared scattered around the valley, Yang Kai felt they were arranged in a special pattern. The heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi from afar seemed drawn by some mysterious force, being channeled through the surrounding hundred peaks into the valley, nourishing the cultivators within and the wondrous herbs atop the mountains.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu exchanged a glance and both nodded inwardly.

Yang Kai could tell at a glance there was some hidden mechanism here; his perception was clearly exceptional.

"These hundred peaks are the foundation of my Tianxiao Sect," Cang Yan explained.

"Oh? What purpose do they serve?"

"Naturally they serve one." Cang Yan nodded lightly. "You should have noticed the outside Spiritual Qi gathering into the sect. This is the Hundred Peaks Spirit Formation, a staggering grand array established using the one hundred and one surrounding peaks as its pivots! Only half of these peaks are naturally formed."

"And the other half?"

"They were created single-handedly by the Founding Patriarch." Cang Yan grinned.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he exclaimed, "Your sect's Founding Patriarch is truly formidable."

"Of course. Once one's power reaches a certain level, one can turn rivers and seas inside out, even pluck stars and invite moons. It is said some strong ones can penetrate into the starry sky and seek great opportunities and immense destinies among the countless stars."

"Penetrate the starry sky?" Yang Kai’s gaze lit with astonishment, as though a majestic gate had slowly swung open before him, unveiling wonders beyond imagination. His eyes gleamed as he absorbed every word.

"Penetrate the starry sky!" Cang Yan nodded emphatically. "A few days ago you saw Elder Du with a strange green stone in his hand, right? That was a product from the starry sky—something not found on Tongxuan Continent. That stone was unimaginably precious, though sadly it was damaged in the end."

"The starry sky holds medicines and minerals beyond imagination, things far exceeding Saint-Grade in quality. There are even star beasts more powerful than those who have entered the Saint Realm—each unrivaled in might and extraordinarily vast. Perhaps even the smallest of them is larger than my Tianxiao Sect's valley."

Yang Kai gaped, looking somewhat incredulous.

What Cang Yan spoke of was extraordinarily arcane.

"Mm, it's only a legend. What the starry sky truly is, I don't actually know—no one strong has proven they have truly ventured into it." Cang Yan sniffed and added.

Yang Kai laughed in surprise and nodded. "But your Tianxiao Sect's Hundred Peaks Spirit Formation is also astonishing; on my side such a feat is unimaginable."

"Your side?" Cang Yan was taken aback.

"Oh, I'm from a small place, a remote backwater—nothing like the splendor here," Yang Kai replied lightly.

"I see." Cang Yan nodded slightly. "The Hundred Peaks Spirit Formation is indeed a marvel; even on Tongxuan Continent it is rarely seen. This formation does more than gather heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi—if a great calamity struck, it could serve a defensive role. But no one dares assault our Tianxiao Sect, so I've never seen the Hundred Peaks Spirit Formation fully activated."

"You two, enough chatter—hurry and get down." Fei Yu interrupted them impatiently.

"Introduce him a little, come on." Cang Yan decided to cultivate a good rapport with Yang Kai, and his tone grew more friendly.

Cang Yan said no more and led Yang Kai and Fei Yu downward.

Perhaps because the Spiritual Qi was so dense here, the view downward was unclear; everything below the valley appeared shrouded in mist, as if a treacherous realm.

After a short while, the three landed.

Cang Yan strolled forward and the Tianxiao Sect disciples they encountered along the way bowed and greeted them respectfully. These cultivators were no lightweights—the majority were of the Divine Roaming Stage, their auras thick and seeming much stronger than others of the same rank and Stage.

Yang Kai watched in amazement.

These Tianxiao Sect disciples held their vigor and spirit tightly; their life force surged, their flesh and meridians were unusually solid, and their True Yuan was exceedingly dense and robust—their combat potential was clearly not to be underestimated.

After entrusting the five rescued disciples to others for care, Cang Yan led Yang Kai to a quiet, secluded courtyard and said, “Stay here for the time being. I will report to the Founding Patriarch, then return to find you.”

"Don't I need to meet that elder now?" Yang Kai frowned—he had expected to be taken immediately before the Tianxiao Sect's Founding Patriarch.

He had many questions and wanted to meet that Saint Realm powerhouse to resolve his doubts, but from Cang Yan's tone it was clear the time had not yet come.

"Wait until the Founding Patriarch summons you," Cang Yan smiled, said no more, and turned to leave with untroubled ease.

Fei Yu looked at Yang Kai more considerately and said, "You needn't worry too much—the Founding Patriarch would not bear ill will toward a small fellow like you. If he meant to harm you, he wouldn't have sent Cang Yan. Here, take two things to while away your time."

Saying that, she suddenly tossed two items to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught them and discovered they were shackles fashioned from some unknown stone.

"What is this?" Yang Kai examined them and found nothing particularly remarkable; they weighed no more than half a jin, and showed no trace of formations or energy—seemingly merely toys.

"Try pouring in your True Yuan to the fullest!" Fei Yu reminded him.

Yang Kai nodded; his True Yuan surged forth and he poured it into the two shackles.

The next moment he suddenly felt a crushing weight strike him; the heaviness was so great he could not steady it, his body pitching forward as if about to topple face-first.

He rolled a few times in midair and barely avoided that humiliating fate.

Boom... boom...

With two muffled thuds the two shackles fell to the ground, smashing out a massive, deep pit.

Yang Kai's face went ashen as he stared blankly at the sudden turn of events.

A string of tinkling, silver-bell laughter accompanied the scene; Fei Yu, all coquettish, was ecstatic.

"You tricked me?" Yang Kai frowned, glowering at the beautiful woman.

Because he felt the woman meant him no harm, Yang Kai had not thought much of it, yet he had not expected her to be so malicious. Those two shackles were clearly not ordinary toys but objects of great significance.

"Sister was only teaching you not to trust anyone so easily," Fei Yu giggled.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and nodded. "Lesson learned, auntie—you really are devious."

Fei Yu's laughter cut off abruptly; fury flared in her beautiful eyes as she glared at Yang Kai.

A loud, hearty laugh came from the treetop nearby.

Fei Yu flicked her hand and a snarling water-dragon shot out, lunging to bite the person hidden in the big tree.

"Laugh again and see if I don't rip your mouth off!" Fei Yu glared at him with icy menace.

The man shrank his neck and indeed dared not laugh again; with a snap of his fingers he shattered Fei Yu's water-dragon, then vanished like lightning, his voice carrying from afar: "Kid, if you want to live a long life, stay away from that crazy hag."

"Li Wan, you're dead today!" Fei Yu's slender form flicked and she gave chase.

Yang Kai's expression grew stern.

Another Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm expert!

That man had been concealed nearby; not even Yang Kai had noticed him—his concealment of aura was utterly perfect.

Though only a hurried glimpse, Yang Kai had seen his face: small and short, with a pair of drooping mustaches at the corners of his mouth—making him look utterly sleazy and therefore all the more memorable.

On the way here, Cang Yan had told him the Tianxiao Sect had four Third Stage Transcendent Realm guardians; Cang Yan and Fei Yu were two of them.

This Li Wan was likely another; as for the fourth, Yang Kai had not yet encountered him.

But it now seemed the four each had their own specialty within a particular domain.

Cang Yan was fire, Fei Yu was water—Li Wan was probably speed or strength. The explosive burst just now was clear to Yang Kai; he recognized how formidable Li Wan was.

Standing there dazed and with no one coming to greet him, Yang Kai's expression was strange.

Having stumbled into such a powerful Sect in such a confused manner, and without knowing the reason, made Yang Kai somewhat uneasy.

But fretting would do no good; for now he could only wait until he met the Tianxiao Sect's Founding Patriarch to learn the truth.

His eyes flickering, Yang Kai stared at the two strange shackles in the pit and reached out to retrieve them.

When he took them up, Yang Kai was surprised to find they were not heavy—still as he had felt before, at most half a jin in weight.

Yet in that earlier instant they had been so heavy they almost sent him flying, and it was true they had smashed a deep pit into the ground.

Frowning in hesitation, Yang Kai poured True Yuan into them.

The next moment Yang Kai's brow rose in delight; just as he had expected, with the infusion of True Yuan the two shackles became much heavier, pressing his shoulders with force.

He continued to pour in and the heaviness grew ever stronger.

Before he had exerted his full strength, he found he could scarcely hold the shackles—they must weigh at least five or six thousand jin.

The ground where he stood suddenly split with spider-web-like fissures; the earth could not bear such tremendous pressure.

Realizing the secret of these two shackles, Yang Kai's face lit with joy; he suddenly thought Fei Yu's gift had been quite useful—both for killing time and for strengthening his physical body.
