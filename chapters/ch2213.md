## Chapter 2213 — The Calamity Star Emerges

At this very moment, inside the palace of Divine Roaming City, in a grand hall, the Divine Roaming Nation's Grand General, Zhou Dian, was enjoying himself with beauties in his arms, fine wine, and lavish feasts, indulging in every pleasure.

Zhou Dian had a bear's waist and a tiger's back, a fierce, menacing appearance, and stood nine zhang tall—truly not an ordinary man.

In his early years, he had followed the Divine Roaming Nation's monarch in campaigns across the land, rendering great service in founding the nation. Thus, after the Divine Roaming Nation was established, Zhou Dian received his due reward and was granted the title of Grand General, second only to the monarch, above all others.

Now, in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, there had been no wars for a hundred years, no smoke of battle for a thousand. As Grand General, Zhou Dian found himself with nothing to do, growing moldy from idleness.

He himself was already an expert at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, his cultivation at its peak, his strength unfathomable. Feeling there was no point in further cultivation, he began to indulge himself without restraint.

On ordinary days, he stayed in his palace, gathering beauties from all over the world and living a life of ease and pleasure.

At this moment, below the grand hall, a group of young women sang and danced, their revealing clothes fluttering, figures half-concealed, each displaying utmost seduction and casting flirtatious glances at Zhou Dian to catch his attention.

Meanwhile, Zhou Dian's hands each held a beauty of different temperament, as he drank fine wine and ate spirit fruits, his face full of contentment and enjoyment.

In the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, there were many unique products unseen in the outside world—such as the spirit fruits before Zhou Dian. These were specialties of the Divine Roaming Mirror, greatly beneficial to the soul when consumed, and extremely precious. Yet Zhou Dian treated them as mere food, devouring them heartily—a true waste of heavenly treasures.

Laughter, flirtatious whispers, coquettish protests, and Zhou Dian’s wild, unrestrained guffaws filled the palace, creating an atmosphere of utter decadence and indulgence...

Suddenly, all these sounds came to an abrupt halt.

It was as if, in that instant, all sound was cut off by an invisible force.

An unimaginable pressure descended from the heavens, and a figure slowly walked in from outside the hall.

Even without seeing the figure, the dancing girls below could feel a massive shadow appear behind them, as if it could block out all their light, making them tremble all over.

Zhou Dian's mouth hung open, his eyes trembling as he stared at the approaching figure, a grape-like spirit fruit falling from his lips without him noticing.

The figure seemed to move slowly, but in the blink of an eye, entered the grand hall.

Looking over, this person wore a wide, pitch-black cloak that completely covered them and a ghastly mask—extremely fierce and terrifying!

Just from the appearance, it was impossible to tell if this person was male or female.

If this person walked through the palace, at least ninety percent of people would not recognize them.

But Zhou Dian recognized them!

The moment this person appeared, Zhou Dian wiped his mouth, his body shuddered, and he flung the two women in his arms aside. He hurried down, stopping three zhang before the person, his expression solemn, bending at the waist and kneeling on one knee. He called out in a low voice, "Grand General Zhou Dian greets the King!"

At these words, all the singing girls showed looks of shock.

Although they knew the monarch lived in this palace, since entering, none of them had actually seen him.

Usually, when they joked with Zhou Dian, they would say he should take them to meet the monarch, to see the genius who had almost single-handedly founded the Divine Roaming Nation.

But every time, Zhou Dian would casually change the subject, never agreeing.

Yet today, this legendary figure had suddenly appeared before them.

Naturally, they were extremely shocked.

At the same time, they curiously looked over at the newcomer.

But all they could see was that the monarch's features were completely hidden by the wide black cloak and ghastly mask, not a bit of skin exposed.

From the figure, it was impossible to tell the person's gender.

Looking any longer, they couldn't help but feel dizzy and dazed, so frightened they quickly averted their eyes.

"Rise," the person before Zhou Dian said indifferently.

The voice was hoarse, a neutral tone, making it impossible to tell if it was male or female.

"Thank you, Your Majesty!" Zhou Dian replied in a deep voice, standing up but still slightly bowing, looking at the monarch with some curiosity. "Your Majesty, what instructions do you have for your subordinate?"

Ever since founding the Divine Roaming Nation, the monarch had rarely asked Zhou Dian to do anything. For the monarch to come here personally this time, Zhou Dian faintly sensed that something major was about to happen.

After asking, Zhou Dian quietly awaited the answer.

The monarch was silent for a long time. Only after a while did the hoarse voice sound: "In the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, the Calamity Star has emerged, shaking the nation's fate. Great chaos is coming!"

"What?" Zhou Dian's expression changed as he exclaimed, "Such a thing has happened?"

He gritted his teeth fiercely, his face savage, the brutality he usually hid now fully revealed. He grinned viciously, "Rest assured, Your Majesty, I will immediately send people..."

"You will go personally!" the monarch interrupted before he could finish.

Zhou Dian was stunned, but quickly replied, "Your subordinate obeys, I will not fail Your Majesty's trust!"

"Very good!" the monarch said indifferently, then turned and floated away.

In the blink of an eye, the figure was gone.

From afar, a voice drifted over: "Bring them back alive!"

Zhou Dian cupped his fists in the direction of the voice: "Yes!"

After speaking, he burst out laughing, muttering coldly, "At last... there's something to do. I hope this trip won't be too boring for this general!"

"Take me with you, won't you? I want to see the lord's unmatched style too."

"I want to go too."

"Me too, me too!"

A group of women crowded around, chattering noisily.

Zhou Dian grinned savagely. Looking around, he suddenly snorted, and an invisible force burst out, sending all the women flying.

Falling to the ground, the beauties all cried out in pain. Bright, flickering lights shone on their bodies, clearly showing their souls had suffered considerable damage.

"When men do business, women should stay out of the way!" Zhou Dian said, then strode out of the palace.

To the women he had just been so tender with, he now showed not a trace of affection, discarding them like worn-out shoes. Clearly, he was a truly capricious and cruel man.

Soon after, Zhou Dian assembled his troops. Leading a group of men and horses, he charged out of the palace with great momentum, heading straight for the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range.

...

In a mountain hollow of the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, a peak Eleventh-Tier Xuan Earth Turtle was fighting desperately, several figures weaving around it, attacking and retreating.

Xia Sheng slashed down, Divine Sense bursting forth. Power channeled through the blade, turning into a world-shaking light, slicing into the turtle's vulnerable neck, making the beast howl in pain and try to flee.

Xiao Baiyi's Divine Soul Secret Treasure was much like the one he used with his physical body—a sword-shaped Secret Treasure. Here he used his soul power to unleash learned secret techniques; though unorthodox, they were still formidable.

Sword light condensed from Divine Sense slashed over, blocking the turtle's escape.

Murong Xiaoxiao's expression was solemn. A long whip danced gracefully, its shadows swirling, all attacks circling the beast, leaving it no way in or out. Yet, though the whip's movements were beautiful, they lacked much killing intent.

Shen Muji's Divine Soul Secret Treasure was a spinning flying blade. Infused with Divine Sense and thrown, it stirred up Heavenly Might, constantly wearing down the beast's strength.

Yang Kai, protected by the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier, fought the turtle at close range, every punch fierce and violent.

Five Dao Origin Realm cultivators surrounded a Demonic Beast roughly at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm, yet still could not bring it down after a long fight.

It was not Yang Kai and the others' fault—the beast's defenses were astonishing. Its thick turtle shell was as solid as iron, and at the slightest attack it would retract its limbs and head inside.

Whenever their assault slowed, the beast would poke its head out and unleash a barrage of energy orbs, densely packed and relentless, forcing Yang Kai and the others to scramble in defense.

Of the five, only Yang Kai had a defensive Secret Treasure and dared to fight it up close. The other four didn't dare get too near, lest they be caught off guard and struck.

If not for the beast's own sluggishness, Yang Kai and the others would have long since tired of fighting it.

Yet it was this very Demonic Beast that quickly made everyone realize their own shortcomings in battle.

After a fierce struggle, seeing the turtle's body flash with light, as if it was at death's door, Xia Sheng shouted, following his blade as he leapt up, then dove down like a falling meteor.

Xiao Baiyi and the others also unleashed their strongest moves, all striking at the beast.

Seeing this, Yang Kai feinted, retreating to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Boom, boom, boom...

A series of explosions rang out, energy raging and refusing to settle for a long time.

When the dust finally cleared, the Xuan Earth Turtle lay motionless on the ground. Before everyone's eyes, its body gradually faded, dissipating into the world and leaving behind a pea-sized orb of light.

Whether in color, brightness, or size, this orb was far beyond what any Demonic Beast they had previously encountered could produce.

After all, this one was at the peak of the Eleventh-Tier!

Yet, though the spoils were right before them, no one rushed to claim them. Instead, they all stood in place, frowning in deep thought, each seeming to have gained some insight.

"Our past battle experience... seems useless here," Xia Sheng said first.

"Mm," Xiao Baiyi nodded. "I think everyone has noticed—we're always holding back in these fights, unable to go all out!"
