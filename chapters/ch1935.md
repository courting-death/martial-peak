## Chapter 1935 — I'll Remember You

Only an Imperial Treasure could possess such horrifying destructive power — a single strike could rend the Netherworld Domain Veil and severely sap its spiritual potency; Secret Treasures of the same Dao Origin-Grade simply lacked this kind of might.

Who on earth was this brat? Not only did he possess a genuine Dragon Scale and refined it into his body, he even wielded an Imperial Treasure — hadn’t they said their Star Domain had been sealed for tens of thousands of years? How could there be such deep reserves here?

In that instant, Yin Lesheng’s eyes trembled violently.

Plop…

A mouthful of blood surged up uncontrollably; he spat it out.

Only then did he horrifiedly realize that the Imperial Treasure’s blow had not only torn his Netherworld Domain Veil, it had grievously wounded him as well — a force that annihilated all things was ravenously tearing through his flesh and meridians, and no matter how he tried to marshal his strength he could not suppress it.

Yin Lesheng grew instantly tense, and a sliver of relief surfaced.

He was relieved Yang Kai’s strength was too low to unleash the Imperial Treasure’s full might; otherwise, under that strike even Dao Origin Realm experts would likely be wiped to ashes, let alone himself.

That Imperial Treasure… he must seize it at all costs. If the Dragon Scale’s value already outstripped the Netherworld Domain Veil, then this Imperial Treasure’s worth soars even above the Dragon Scale — even in the Star Realm it would be a priceless, rarely encountered treasure!

Yin Lesheng jabbed at himself, frantically circulating force to repress the wound, while pulling out handfuls of Spiritual Pills and stuffing them into his mouth like a man gone mad.

At that moment his feet shifted; dragging his grievously wounded body, he lunged at Yang Kai in a desperate, murderous charge!

But at that moment, a shout suddenly rang out not far off; Liu Qianyun cried, “Senior Brother Yin!”

Yin Lesheng halted in surprise, turned his head, and his face went white with terror.

The Starlight Passage — when had a vast chasm appeared within it? That ravine gaped like a natural moat, a fissure that ran across the passage; within the crack there was only chaotic void, and innumerable starlights were being inexplicably drawn, pouring into that rent.

Crack… crack…

Countless more fissures appeared within the Starlight Passage.

In an instant the whole Starlight Passage seemed to turn into a shattered mirror, cracks crisscrossing like jagged teeth, stretching in every direction.

“This is bad!” Yin Lesheng’s face drained of color; he realized the force of the Imperial Treasure’s blow had shaken the Starlight Passage’s stability — this place would soon collapse.

“Damn it!” Yin Lesheng cursed furiously; he had never expected this outcome. He had assumed that by waiting here for five years and converting all his Saint Yuan into Origin Qi, then bolstering himself with the Netherworld Domain Veil’s impenetrable defense, he could slaughter at will, killing anyone who came!

Who would have guessed Yang Kai would be such an unpredictable variable.

The Starlight Passage was the route Star Domain warriors took to reach the Star Realm; typically those who entered here were Void King Realm, and no matter how much a Void King might thrash about, they could not affect the Starlight Passage’s stability.

But Yang Kai’s use of the Imperial Treasure’s might was different — the power contained in the Extinction Thunder Bead was that of an Emperor; how could the Starlight Passage endure it?

That was why the scene before them had come to pass.

“Senior Brother Yin, what’s wrong here?” Feng De’s face had gone pale as well; sensing the Starlight Passage beginning to collapse, he fluttered about like a headless fly, no longer in the mood to rush off and finish Ghost Ancestor and the others.

“This place is collapsing.” Yin Lesheng said hastily, then turned and glared ferociously at Yang Kai, “If we can’t capture you alive, then you all must die — kill them at once!”

His final order was directed at Feng De and Liu Qianyun.

Yang Kai’s face changed, and he shouted fiercely, “Don’t even think about it!”

As he spoke, ignoring his own depletion, he frantically unleashed his Golden Blood to replenish the body drained by using the Extinction Thunder Bead, and a thick, tumultuous spatial force surged forth.

Yang Kai looked almost mad as he thrust his hand and struck the void.

Layer upon layer of Spatial Force rippled outward like waves, pressing upon the already-unstable Starlight Passage; in an instant it became even more fragile, and within only two breaths it began to splinter apart.

Huge rifts in space emerged like beasts ready to devour, monstrous and hideous.

Yin Lesheng seemed to perceive Yang Kai’s intent and charged like a madman.

Yang Kai ignored him, engrossed in manipulating the spatial power, using his own strength to influence the Starlight Passage’s changes.

Rumble…

As if a mirror were smashed, the Starlight Passage shattered in an instant; innumerable spatial fissures formed and hung in the void.

“Yang Kai!” Ai Ou suddenly cried out; the place where he and the others stood was swallowed by a spatial rift, and as the words left his mouth he vanished into the chaotic void.

Yang Kai fought through his bodily discomfort and shot out his Divine Sense, pouring it into the void-rift to guide Ai Ou and the others in the right direction.

A delicate cry sounded as Liu Qianyun was swallowed by another spatial rift; in the next instant Feng De’s figure disappeared as well.

“Liu Yan!” The Fire Bird Liu Yan finally broke free and beat her wings, flying toward Yang Kai, but between them yawned another rift that was like a heavenly river, cutting them off.

Anxiety filled Liu Yan’s eyes, yet she could not reach Yang Kai; after three breaths she too was swallowed by a spatial rift.

Little Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts were unknown; at that moment only Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng remained inside the Starlight Passage.

Yin Lesheng’s expression was feral as he reached Yang Kai; his enormous bone spear flashed with cold light, aiming at Yang Kai’s face.

Yang Kai gave a cold laugh. "This grudge will be repaid a hundredfold one day — I won't forget you!"

With those words he leapt backward of his own accord and plunged into the spatial rift behind him; the bone spear struck nothing but air.

“Damn you, damn you!” Yin Lesheng roared like a madman; seeing the fissures multiply and space grow ever more unstable, he gritted his teeth and leapt into the nearest rift, disappearing.

Once everyone had left, the Starlight Passage suddenly exploded into fragments; countless spatial fissures lashed about like blades — anyone left here would be ground to pieces.

That scene persisted for half an hour before, under the might of the local heaven-and-earth laws, it slowly mended.

……

In the great mountains Yang Kai lay motionless in a hollow, staring up at the brilliant starry sky.

His expression was calm as still water, neither sorrowful nor joyful, only indifferent.

The encounter and battle with Yin Lesheng and the others made Yang Kai instantly aware of his own shortcomings — six of them were among the finest in their Star Domain, yet had been toyed with by a single Yin Lesheng, almost left without the strength to resist; had he not used the Extinction Thunder Bead in the end, all six of them might have met their end there.

Yin Lesheng had come from a Star Domain too, a place called Great Wilderness; he had not even entered the Star Realm yet he wielded such power — what unimaginable means would those in the truly higher tiers possess?

Yang Kai’s heart yearned to know.

As for Ghost Ancestor and the others, Yang Kai was not too worried; after all, the five of them had been together, and at the crucial moment Yang Kai had split off threads of his Divine Sense to guide them — they should not have become lost in the spatial rifts.

As for the Fire Bird and the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao, they had separated from him during the battle as well.

Yang Kai worried for the two of them: the Fire Bird was an Artifact Spirit manifest and would easily draw attention, while Xiaoxiao’s special form would make it a likely target for capture and enslavement.

But worrying now was useless; Yang Kai himself had not yet escaped danger.

Using the Extinction Thunder Bead had exhausted his internal power; in the end he had also used spatial techniques to interfere with the Starlight Passage’s collapse, so this time he had truly exceeded his limits.

Since arriving here Yang Kai had not moved; he silently examined his wounds while recovering his strength.

The injuries were not severe, merely a severe depletion of his power; after all, with the dragon scale guarding him, even someone as strong as Yin Lesheng had not dealt him substantive damage.

Was this the Star Realm? Yang Kai could not be entirely certain.

When lying here and looking up, what he saw was different from the Star Domain’s skies — huge nebulae formed magnificent shapes, each taking on distinct formations and looking extraordinarily beautiful.

Such scenery could not be seen within the Star Domain, where the night sky was only filled with twinkling stars.

Moreover, Yang Kai vaguely perceived a link to the direction of his home Star Domain; something seemed to connect him to his home so that no matter where he was he could sense its position and presence.

He frowned, unsure of the cause.

After waiting a long time and when his Divine Sense had recovered somewhat, Yang Kai exhaled and painstakingly took various healing Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring and shoved them into his mouth.

Immediately he manifested his Spirit Body and dove into his Sea of Consciousness.

He dimly sensed that the key linking him to his homeland lay within his Sea of Consciousness.

Gazing about, Yang Kai studied carefully.

When his eyes fell upon the upper reaches of his Sea of Consciousness, he suddenly lit up — he finally understood what had connected him to his homeland.

The Star Chart!

It turned out to be the Star Chart he had always regarded as useful only for finding direction, a thing of little value!

Now, looking at the Star Chart, Yang Kai discovered its shape exactly matched one of the nebulae he had seen in the starry sky earlier.

He could not help but appear thoughtful.

So that patch of nebula among the countless ones he had seen was truly the Star Domain of his homeland — hence why that nebula’s shape matched the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness.

And the other nebulae corresponded to other Star Domains?

Thinking this through, Yang Kai was stunned — from his observations, there were innumerable patches of nebula in the sky; if each nebula represented a Star Domain of a certain kind, then this world was truly vast.

Even an Emperor would likely be unable to behold its entirety.

When Wu Shengfeng saw the Star Chart in Yang Kai’s mind earlier he had been greatly stirred, which made Yang Kai realize the Star Chart likely involved some immense secret; later Yang Yan had not said much when asked.

But Yang Kai guessed the Star Chart probably had a tremendous connection to becoming a Star Domain’s guardian!
