## Chapter 2211 — Personal Belongings

As everyone swept the area with their Divine Sense, the wild boar-like demonic beast clearly sensed it as well. In an instant, it turned around, glaring at the group with a pair of blood-red eyes.

It stamped its hooves, its massive body stirring a fierce wind as it charged the group, murderous intent surging.

"Xia Sheng, I'll leave this Red-Eyed Evil Boar to you," Gao Xueting said calmly.

"Then... this disciple will go!" Upon hearing this, Xia Sheng's expression turned serious. With a tap of his foot, he charged straight at the Red-Eyed Evil Boar.

He understood Gao Xueting was intentionally letting him fight this beast so she could explain things in more detail, so he did not refuse.

In the blink of an eye, man and beast were less than ten zhang apart.

Xia Sheng suddenly halted, his waist sinking slightly. Standing firmly in place, he placed one hand flat before his chest, the other slowly pushing forward as he shouted, "Great Primordial Palm!"

Not knowing whether demonic beasts here matched those outside in strength, Xia Sheng used a secret technique from the start, not underestimating the Red-Eyed Evil Boar despite it being at the peak of the Tenth-Tier.

"Indeed. Since we entered this world as Spirit Bodies, most of the secret techniques and cultivation methods we usually practice are completely useless here," Gao Xueting's voice echoed in everyone's ears.

The group all nodded thoughtfully.

Meanwhile, Xia Sheng's expression changed slightly, for when he unleashed his secret technique, nothing happened—he had merely struck a pose.

After hearing Gao Xueting's words, he immediately realized his grave mistake. In that instant, the Red-Eyed Evil Boar had already charged to within three zhang of him.

Even so, he did not panic. Reaching into the void as if to draw a Secret Treasure, he shouted fiercely, "Wretched beast, don't get cocky! Come meet your end!"

Gao Xueting spoke again: "Secret Treasures are also unusable. Normally, activating a Secret Treasure requires the cooperation of Origin Qi and the physical body."

Just as Gao Xueting finished speaking, Xia Sheng suddenly cried out, "Heavens above…!"

As he shouted, he turned and ran toward Gao Xueting, crying out in panic, "Elder Gao, save me!"

Gao Xueting looked at him coldly and sneered, "You're overacting. Although I know you're doing this to help them better understand the peculiarities of this world, are you insulting your own intelligence or your Junior Brothers' and Junior Sisters' intelligence? Finish it quickly!"

"Yes, ma'am!" Xia Sheng replied, immediately turning around and waving his hand. Suddenly, a long-bladed Secret Treasure appeared in his hand, radiating an unusual power fluctuation—it was clearly a Divine Soul Secret Treasure!

Xia Sheng poured his Divine Sense into it and, without hesitation, slashed at the Red-Eyed Evil Boar.

There was no fancy technique, no graceful movement—just a simple, direct strike powered by force.

The blade flashed. A miserable howl rang out.

Violent energy swept in all directions.

The Red-Eyed Evil Boar was cleaved in two by that strike. Due to inertia, its massive body continued charging forward for quite a distance before suddenly collapsing to the ground.

Xia Sheng sheathed his blade and stood tall, his face cold and unruffled.

There was no blood, no foul-smelling innards. After being slain, the Red-Eyed Evil Boar simply lay quietly on the ground. Under everyone's gaze, its body gradually faded, as if turning into energy and dispersing into the world.

At the spot where one half of its corpse had vanished, a tiny mote of pale yellow light was left behind, no larger than a mung bean.

Everyone couldn't help but look over in surprise. Sweeping it with their Divine Sense, Yang Kai and the others were all moved.

They discovered that within this bean-sized orb of light lay an extremely pure soul energy, unimaginably pure and without the slightest impurity.

"This is a Divine Soul Origin," Gao Xueting explained. "In this world, every living being possesses its own Divine Soul Origin. Once slain, that Origin is left behind, allowing us to absorb it and strengthen our own Divine Souls."

As she spoke, Xia Sheng had already scampered over to the Divine Soul Origin and reached out to grab it.

Strangely, as soon as he grasped it, the Divine Soul Origin fused directly with his palm and merged into his body.

Xia Sheng immediately closed his eyes, a look of utter bliss appearing on his face. After a while, he opened his eyes again and shouted, "Wonderful!"

Gao Xueting said calmly, "A Divine Soul Origin like this, by my estimation, is roughly equivalent to seven or eight days of arduous cultivation."

Yang Kai and the others' eyes lit up at her words!

The Divine Soul Origin left behind by a peak Tenth-Tier demonic beast was already so beneficial. If it were an Eleventh-Tier... that would be at least a month or two!

One is already so much, ten would be about a year, and a hundred would be nearly a century!

A century of closed-door cultivation to increase Divine Sense strength could be achieved with just a hundred Eleventh-Tier demonic beasts' Divine Soul Origins—an unimaginable thing.

"Don't get too excited just yet!" Gao Xueting warned. "Although the Divine Soul Origins left behind by these beings are very pure and easy for us to absorb, they are still an external force, not gained through your own cultivation. If you feel any discomfort, stop absorbing immediately, or you may suffer mental instability with dire consequences."

Everyone's expressions turned serious. Only now did they realize that this absorption was not without limits, just not obvious at first.

"Of course, if you can find Soul Jade, that's another matter entirely," Gao Xueting added.

"Soul Jade?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously, the others also looking confused.

"It's a unique product of this world, formed from the purest soul energy. Here, it appears as a type of jade, which can be absorbed without any worries! No matter how much you absorb, there will never be any problems!" Gao Xueting explained. "I've entered this place four times, but so far, I've only ever obtained a single piece of Middle-Level Soul Jade. Even in this world, Soul Jade is extremely rare."

Upon hearing this, everyone immediately understood that Soul Jade was something that could only be found by chance.

"Additionally, there's something here called Soul Crystal. Although it differs from Soul Jade by only one word, they are completely different things," Gao Xueting continued, trying to give the newcomers a clearer understanding. "You can think of Soul Crystal as the Source Crystal from our side... It's the hard currency for transactions in this world. Although it can also be used for cultivation, the effect is not ideal!"

"Understood," Xia Sheng and the others nodded solemnly.

"This strange world has many peculiar products, most of which are of great help to the soul. If you have the chance to encounter them, you'll understand. Also, as you saw from Xia Sheng's battle just now, only Divine Soul Secret Treasures and Divine Soul Secret Techniques can be used here! When passing through the Divine Roaming Mirror, most of the items we carried with our physical bodies couldn't be brought over. Only things related to the soul can pass through unimpeded. Check yourselves to see what you can use, so you won't be caught off guard by a strong enemy!" Gao Xueting said, scanning the surroundings calmly.

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone began checking themselves.

Sweeping his Divine Sense through his body, Yang Kai immediately found the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier that Gao Xueting had given him earlier.

This was a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, so naturally it could be brought into the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror. With a slight activation, a layer of purple light appeared on Yang Kai's body, looking extremely sturdy.

But aside from this Divine Soul Secret Treasure, Yang Kai discovered several other things he hadn't expected at all.

"Warm Spirit Lotus..." Yang Kai stared speechlessly at a certain spot within himself, thinking, "Although the Warm Spirit Lotus isn't a Secret Treasure, it's related to the soul and has always been placed in my Sea of Consciousness, so it's only natural it would be brought in. But..."

"How did these guys come in too?"

The 'guys' he referred to were the Soul-Devouring Worms he had obtained years ago on the Tongxuan Continent.

He had possessed these Soul-Devouring Worms for countless years. Because of the special properties of his Divine Sense Fire, he did not fear these nemeses of the soul. Instead, with the help of the Warm Spirit Lotus, he could even command them in battle.

Over the years, the Soul-Devouring Worms had always been nurtured on the Seven-Colored Treasure Isle manifested by the Warm Spirit Lotus. With its nourishment, they had grown ever stronger.

Most crucially, last time outside Fenglin City, when Yang Kai entered a Demonic State, these Soul-Devouring Worms had rioted, madly devouring the Demon Yuan of the Ancient Giant Demon in Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, causing their forms to change dramatically. They turned pitch-black, exuding a vicious and violent aura—clearly not to be trifled with.

At this moment, these countless Soul-Devouring Worms had also come here with the Warm Spirit Lotus, coiled atop it, being nurtured within Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

Upon discovering the Soul-Devouring Worms, Yang Kai's face darkened.

This couldn’t be helped…

If these things were exposed, Gao Xueting would quickly connect them to the Ancient Giant Demon, because back then, outside Fenglin City, Yang Kai had fought Gao Xueting in his demonic form. How could an Emperor Realm expert like her forget such a unique power?

If things went badly, Gao Xueting might recognize Yang Kai as the demon from that day! If that happened, he would have no way to explain himself...

Thinking of this, Yang Kai secretly resolved that, no matter what, he could not let these Soul-Devouring Worms appear in front of Gao Xueting, or the consequences would be unimaginable!

After checking the Warm Spirit Lotus and Soul-Devouring Worms, Yang Kai found yet another thing within his Spirit Body—something he had never expected.

"This thing... counts as a Divine Soul Secret Treasure too? I never knew!"
