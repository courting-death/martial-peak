## Chapter 2150 — Make a Mountain Out of a Molehill

Somewhere in the Two Seasons Mountain, the atmosphere was strange and tense.

Luo Yuan and Wuchang both looked astonished, staring ahead.

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao likewise widened their eyes, unable to believe what they were seeing.

On the other side, Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes flashed with surprise; she was secretly shocked, while Xiao Chen murmured, “What’s going on?”

Just now, Luo Yuan and Wuchang had attacked Yang Kai at the same time. Everyone thought Yang Kai was doomed. Whether the arrogant Luo Yuan was a paper tiger or truly had the strength to match his attitude, Wuchang alone was no ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator. His fierce reputation was widespread, his nature cruel—anyone targeted by him rarely met a good end.

The two struck together, one in front and one behind, without warning. Yang Kai had no way to dodge.

Everyone could almost imagine the tragic scene of Yang Kai dying right before their eyes…

Yet the result was the opposite—Luo Yuan and Wuchang, who attacked, were both forced back, while Yang Kai showed no sign of injury at all.

How did he do it?

Looking again, Yang Kai was still standing in the same spot, unmoving. His face was pale, his expression panicked, as if he’d been scared out of his wits. His body trembled slightly, and sweat beaded on his forehead.

Though he looked a bit disheveled, he was truly unharmed.

“What did that brat just do?” Xiao Chen muttered, unable to understand.

Luo Yuan and Wuchang couldn’t have been forced back for no reason. The only explanation was that Yang Kai had secretly used some astonishing technique to escape danger, but no one saw it clearly.

Xiao Chen’s brows furrowed; he felt Yang Kai was a bit odd.

“Curious…” Lan Xun’s bright eyes lit up, a look of intrigued delight blooming upon her face as she regarded Yang Kai with lively interest.

Although she was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, as the cherished daughter of the Radiant Moon Emperor, she had inherited a special constitution. Growing up at the Emperor’s side, she had gained far more experience and insight than anyone present.

Even though she hadn’t seen everything clearly, she understood more than the others.

Just as Luo Yuan and Wuchang’s attacks were about to land, Lan Xun distinctly saw Yang Kai’s body blur for an instant. In that moment, it was as if he had vanished from this world and entered another space.

At the same time, Wuchang and Luo Yuan’s killing moves arrived together.

Having lost their target, the two attacks collided with each other.

In other words, it was Wuchang who forced Luo Yuan back, and Luo Yuan who forced Wuchang back!

The two had simply exchanged blows!

“Such a strange secret art!” Lan Xun’s bright eyes sparkled as she glanced at Luo Yuan again, thinking, “This fellow is absurdly strong. To trade evenly with Wuchang—since when did Eight Directions Sect produce such a monster? It seems Father was right: never underestimate anyone. Even with humble origins, one can have a bright and boundless future; Luo Yuan is the best example… And that other guy is definitely not as slovenly and useless as he’s pretending. Hmph, this act is far too fake. Only these thick-headed, muscle-brained men would actually believe it… But come to think of it, what is that guy’s name, anyway?”

All sorts of thoughts flashed through Lan Xun’s mind. She was convinced Yang Kai was playing dumb to hide his strength, and couldn’t help but shoot a teasing look at the trembling Yang Kai in midair—a look that said, “I’ve already seen through you.”

Just then, Wuchang finally snapped out of it. His gaze passed over Yang Kai and fixed coldly on Luo Yuan. “Are you looking for death?”

Although he hadn’t figured out exactly what Yang Kai had done to force him back, he quickly realized whose attack he’d actually taken.

With his arrogant personality, looking down on everyone, he immediately turned his anger toward Luo Yuan! He believed Luo Yuan had ruined his plans, giving Yang Kai the chance to use that strange secret technique and escape danger.

“Who are you asking?” Yang Kai looked panicked, pointing at himself. “You’re not talking about me, right? I don’t want to die, don’t kill me…”

As he spoke, he called out to Xiao Baiyi, “Xiao Bai, explain to Brother Wuchang for me! Let him spare me, please?”

Xiao Baiyi glared at him, gritting his teeth. “I really want to rush over and kill you right now.”

Luckily, Yang Kai wasn’t a disciple of Qingyang Shrine. Otherwise, Xiao Baiyi really might have done it. Sharing a sect with someone like this was truly shameful. Xiao Baiyi secretly regretted not seeing Yang Kai’s true nature earlier; if he had, he would never have agreed to let Xue Yi’s spot go to Yang Kai.

Even Murong Xiaoxiao, standing beside him, gave Yang Kai a strange look.

“If you want to fight… I’ll fight!” Luo Yuan’s gaze also passed over Yang Kai, his voice ringing with determination and a look of eager anticipation. He wasn’t afraid of the famous Wuchang at all; deep down, he was itching to battle Wuchang and prove himself.

The two of them completely ignored Yang Kai.

“You’ve got guts!” Wuchang grinned, looking pleased. “I haven’t met someone like you in ages. You really make things interesting!”

As he spoke, he even stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, looking ravenous—like a hungry wolf spotting a naked beauty…

Their gazes clashed in midair, sparks flying, the tension in the air reaching its peak.

Yang Kai stood between them, ignored but forced to endure the pressure from both sides. His already pale face grew even paler.

Whoosh, whoosh...

Even the howling wind was filled with chilling murderous intent, making one’s spine tingle.

“Enough!”

Seeing that Luo Yuan and Wuchang were about to fight, Lan Xun couldn’t stand it anymore. She stepped forward and called out, “You two are both rising stars of my Southern Territory, future pillars of strength. There’s no need to make things unpleasant over such a small matter. Before we came in, Uncle Xiao said we should keep the bigger picture in mind. Our opponents aren’t each other, but the people from the other three territories. Please, for my sake, let’s turn hostility into friendship.”

At her words, Wuchang and Luo Yuan both frowned, apparently surprised that Princess Lan Xun would step in to mediate at a time like this.

Though both felt a bit unhappy, neither dared disrespect Princess Lan Xun. Offending her here might not seem serious, but if word spread beyond Four Seasons Land, their sects might not protect them.

“Since the princess has spoken… you two should let it go, or you’ll be my enemy!” Xiao Chen also stepped forward. As a proper protector, he knew exactly what to say at a time like this.

“You got lucky!”

Wuchang and Luo Yuan spoke in unison, withdrawing their auras as if magnanimously letting the other off.

Wuchang glanced at Luo Yuan, then said to Lan Xun, “Princess, this time I’ll give you face and let it go. But if there’s a next time… even if the Emperor himself is here, I’ll kill this arrogant fool!”

In his eyes, aside from a few, all other martial artists were trash!

He didn’t even care about the elite disciples of Qingyang Shrine and Wuhua Hall, let alone Luo Yuan from Eight Directions Sect. To be provoked by such trash—if Lan Xun hadn’t intervened, he would never have let it go.

“I’ve long heard how formidable Wuchang of Tianwu Sacred Land is, but now it seems it’s all talk.” Luo Yuan wasn’t easy to deal with either, his words sharp and almost reigniting the tension.

“Enough, enough.” Lan Xun sighed inwardly. “If you were fighting over some rare heaven-and-earth treasure, I wouldn’t bother stopping you. But for a single Star Seal… it’s not worth it. There’s more than one Star Seal in Four Seasons Land, and plenty of time. Everyone can go look for their own.”

As she spoke, she glanced at the back of Yang Kai’s hand and added, “Besides… this is just a simple diamond-shaped Star Seal. It’s even less worth fighting over.”

“What? There are different grades of Star Seals?” Yang Kai immediately caught something unusual in Lan Xun’s words and asked in surprise.

“Why are you talking so much?” Xiao Chen shot him a cold look, mocking, “You barely escaped with your life. You should tuck your tail and run, not stick around waiting to die.”

“Heh…” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched awkwardly.

He turned to Xiao Baiyi, wanting to ask about the Star Seal, but Xiao Baiyi just looked away, refusing to answer.

Yang Kai was instantly frustrated.

Judging by Xiao Baiyi’s reaction, he probably knew something, but this information was likely as secret as the existence of the Time Temple—sect secrets he couldn’t reveal.

Beside him, Murong Xiaoxiao gave Yang Kai an apologetic look.

Yang Kai understood and didn’t press further.

“Alright, since the Star Seal already has an owner, let’s not waste any more effort. Go do what you need to do.” Lan Xun’s words settled the matter, indirectly helping Yang Kai out.

With her statement, anyone with a bit of pride or reputation wouldn’t try to snatch Yang Kai’s Star Seal again.

Wuchang and Luo Yuan, though combative and unruly, still cared about their reputations. They wouldn’t act one way in public and another in secret.

As Lan Xun finished speaking, Wuchang and Luo Yuan exchanged a look from a distance, their eyes sending the same message: “Don’t let me run into you again, or you’ll regret it!”

Then, both snorted coldly, turned away from each other, and prepared to leave.

Just then, a sudden change occurred.

Deep within Two Seasons Mountain, a strange tremor erupted, followed by a series of rumbling sounds like muffled thunder rolling through the earth, making it hard to stand firm.

Everyone present turned pale, looking around in shock, completely at a loss for what was happening.

The commotion wasn’t over yet—a startled cry rang out: “Look at the sky, something’s falling down!”
