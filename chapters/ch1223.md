## Chapter 1223 — The Second Red Sun

It really was the Star Emperor Sect! Ever since Yang Kai saw Qu Changfeng treating that man so cautiously in the Stalactite Cave, he had harbored suspicions; only someone from the Star Emperor Sect would make the arrogant, overbearing Qu Changfeng so restrained in their presence—so much so that even when he suffered losses he would pinch his nose and accept it, not daring to take revenge openly.

Daiyuan, as if afraid Yang Kai didn't grasp how formidable the Star Emperor Sect was, said solemnly: “On the entire Dark Star, the three most powerful forces openly are the Star Emperor Sect, the Battle Sky Alliance, and the Leitai Sect, but in truth every power knows that the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect are not remotely comparable to the Star Emperor Sect. It’s said that on Star Emperor Mountain there are over a hundred formidable fighters who are peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — a terrifying figure that the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect cannot match. I’ve also heard they possess several Void King-Grade secret treasures of tremendous power.”

“That strong?” Yang Kai shuddered inwardly; one sect possessing over a hundred peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts was truly astonishing.

“Yes, but their total numbers are relatively few, and they never recruit disciples from outside, which is why their reputation isn’t widely known.”

“Then how do their traditions continue?” Yang Kai asked, frowning.

“Not too sure,” Daiyuan said with a faint smile, “but over the countless years, there have been rumors—of a few extraordinarily fortunate people who happened to encounter an expert descending from Star Emperor Mountain on a worldly journey and were taken back there to cultivate. Such cases are exceedingly rare though—only four or five in total. The people on Star Emperor Mountain seldom leave their seclusion. Though they have many powerful experts, as long as other forces don’t provoke them, they won’t abuse their strength. But if someone does offend them…”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed; he noticed Daiyuan’s delicate body tremble slightly.

A chill passed through him; he thought to himself that if anyone truly dared provoke such a terrifying existence, their fate would be miserable indeed.

Daiyuan lowered her voice and parted her lips slightly: “Generally, every ten or perhaps twenty or thirty years one or several young disciples will leave Star Emperor Mountain to gain experience. These disciples likewise keep a low profile and are very discreet; likely no one knows their origins until they return to Star Emperor Mountain. I once read in a Liuli Sect record of hidden matters that two thousand years ago there was a sect on Dark Star that ranked with the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect — apparently called the Guyang Sect. At that time a young warrior who had come down from Star Emperor Mountain happened to obtain a great treasure. Some people from the Guyang Sect learned of it, set an ambush and killed him on the spot, seizing the treasure. A month later… the Guyang Sect was uprooted in a single night, annihilated to the last man. It was a slaughter!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

No need to wonder — the ones who wiped out the Guyang Sect were certainly the Star Emperor Sect. To eradicate at a stroke a power that once ranked with the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect testified to just how immense the Star Emperor Sect’s strength must be.

Daiyuan smiled ruefully, brushing a stray lock of hair from her ear: “But that was over two thousand years ago; whether it’s true no one knows. Elders of our sect treat the matter with deep taboo and never mention it, and you can’t get anything out of them. However, there is a place on Dark Star now called Zangxiong Valley — a thousand-li-wide area where nothing grows, a wasteland thick with yin energy. Rumor has it that was once the site of the Guyang Sect. In the past many warriors would go there in groups searching for chance, claiming the Guyang Sect had a hidden grotto full of rare treasures and vast wealth, but nobody found it and quite a few perished.”

“You’ve been there?” Yang Kai asked, smiling at Daiyuan. Though she couched her words in hearsay and rumor, Yang Kai could tell from her tone she believed the stories to be true; it seemed she had indeed been to Zangxiong Valley.

“Of course I’ve been,” Daiyuan nodded lightly. “But I found nothing of worth; instead I was clung to by a strand of chilling yin energy and spent days back at Liuli Sect before I could dispel it. If you’re interested, Junior Brother, you can go and take a look, but you must be extremely careful.”

“Mm, maybe if there’s a chance.” Yang Kai nodded indifferently, though inwardly he was unconvinced — even if the Guyang Sect once hid a grotto, two thousand years had passed; he doubted such a thing would remain undiscovered. He wasn’t eager to waste time and energy on a likely empty quest.

“Heh.” Daiyuan saw through Yang Kai’s perfunctory tone and didn’t press the matter further, saying only: “Those who come from Star Emperor Mountain rarely get noticed, but this time was different — it coincided with the opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland, and before entering our master warned me to be wary of lone strangers with unfamiliar faces but earth-shattering methods, because they might just be disciples of the Star Emperor Sect. To be honest, when I first met you, Junior Brother, I thought you were from the Star Emperor Sect…”

Yang Kai was taken aback; he hadn’t expected such a misunderstanding, but it made sense—he was a stranger on Dark Star, and to be able to break into the Third Layer as a First Stage Saint King indicated remarkable means, so Daiyuan’s mistake was understandable.

Thinking on it, Yang Kai realized why Meng Hongliang of the Quehe Sect and Huang Xiran of the Jidao Sect had hesitated when he displayed certain techniques — they had thought he hailed from Star Emperor Mountain, which explained Meng Hongliang’s caution.

Daiyuan had the same misconception, but upon learning Yang Kai associated with Wei Guchang she immediately dismissed the idea, since the Star Emperor Sect ordinarily does not socialise with outsiders.

After they arrived and saw that cold man, she instantly understood he was the true Star Emperor Sect disciple.

The two spoke for a while longer, then fell silent, closing their eyes to continue meditating and comprehending.

The red sun rose gradually, climbing higher and higher until it reached the zenith.

The fruit aroma in the air grew richer, and the insights one could derive from that fragrance deepened, uplifting and inspiring every cultivator present.

Suddenly the ground trembled slightly, and a world-shaking energy leisurely burst forth.

The change caused every cultivator present to blanch; in an instant they snapped out of their deep comprehension, staring in horror at the valley before them.

It seemed a layer of red mist had formed in the valley, and within that red fog lay an extraordinarily fearsome potency.

The red mist appeared with eerie suddenness and without any prior sign; by the time the cultivators looked, it had already spread through the valley, moving at astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye it had covered the entire valley.

Immediately an incredible heat radiated outward, forming a gust of hot wind that blew across every corner of the Flowing Flame Sandland’s Third Layer.

Everyone had experienced this before, and seeing it again their terror eased a great deal — they knew this hot wind might look frightening, but it would do them no harm.

Sure enough, as that hot wind brushed past the gathered cultivators and spread away, no one suffered any ill effects.

At the very center of the valley, another red sun was born, slowly rising from the valley floor!

The red sun was small, roughly the size of a bamboo hat; Divine Sense could not penetrate it, and the naked eye could not make out its details—stare too long and one would quickly grow dizzy and faint.

The fruit fragrance swelled even more intensely, and one by one the cultivators’ hearts thudded violently within their chests.

The second red sun had appeared.

This meant the Red Candle Fruit was one step closer to true maturity. Those sects who had learned the truth of this place from Li Younan of the Medicine Pill Sect could no longer hold back their eagerness; a tense, hostile atmosphere quickly spread around the valley as each party eyed the others like sworn enemies, itching to rush forward and slaughter anyone in their way.

The cultivators from sects who did not yet understand the phenomenon of the Red Candle Fruit’s ripening were likewise affected. They watched others closely for any sign, leaving no clue unexamined, while sending people back to friendly sects to gather intelligence.

Soon the various secrets about the Red Candle Fruit spread, allowing everyone present to understand the reasons behind the spectacle, which calmed the tumult somewhat.

Since the wondrous phenomenon of the Three Suns Rising had yet to fully appear—only two scarlet suns had risen so far—there was no need to act rashly. Moreover, before the Red Candle Fruit reached true ripeness, it would not even show itself. Even if someone wished to seize it, there was simply nowhere to start; they could only retreat in frustration.

After the second red sun appeared, the valley was stirred only briefly before falling silent again, everyone once more immersing themselves in the fruit fragrance to refine and integrate its wonders into their own cultivation.

Yang Kai was likewise absorbed; he felt his control over Saint Yuan rise another level, and a vague notion flickered in his mind. Although he had grasped some traces, he could not yet comprehend them fully.

The feeling was like dozens of cat’s claws irritating an itch, making Yang Kai restless. He bent his mind inward, intent on using the opportunity before the Red Candle Fruit matured to clarify that vague thought; if he could truly realize it, his combat power would increase considerably.

Time ticked by, and just as everyone felt they were about to gain some harvest, a roar suddenly sounded from a hillock: “Bastard, how dare you secretly set an array!”

The shout startled many cultivators out of their meditation. Following the voice toward its source, they saw a man from the Battle Sky Alliance, his face full of rage as he brandished a huge fan. A blue resonance flowed across that fan, and its power was no small thing — it was clearly a fine secret treasure.
