## Chapter 151 — The Decision of the Sister Flowers

After resting for half a day, the three of them set off once more, stepping onto the seemingly endless staircase.

Time flowed slowly, and on the third day since they had descended from the towering structure, many disciples from the three sects could no longer endure and gradually escaped from within.

Although they had not reached the very top, none of these individuals appeared defeated; instead, they were filled with excitement and joy. Each person had gained something from this trial, and many had even broken through their current realms.

This naturally brought them happiness.

On the fourth day, even more people came down, some drenched in sweat, while others trembled from the cold.

After recovering at the bottom, they wished to re-enter the light barrier.

However, this time, no matter what methods they employed, they could not break through the barrier to ascend the endless staircase.

Realizing this, everyone understood that opportunities were fleeting; once missed, they could never be reclaimed. This left many feeling regretful. Each person pondered how much greater the benefits might have been had they persevered a little longer inside.

Such was the nature of this trial, and how many things in life mirrored this truth?

Opportunities are always singular; if one does not seize them well at the moment, all that remains after missing out is a lament.

On the fifth day, more than half of the disciples from the three sects had exited the trial. They gathered by the light barrier, envying those who still persisted within, while lamenting their own choices.

More discussions arose, speculating who could reach the very peak.

Without a doubt, Su Yan’s name was at the forefront!

Those who had come out knew that it was a battle between cold and heat, and Su Yan’s cultivation method undoubtedly provided her with a significant advantage. Furthermore, among the young disciples of the three sects, her strength was the greatest, so it was no surprise that she could reach the summit.

This acclaim made many disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion beam with pride; Su Yan held a significant place in the hearts of every disciple, whether male or female.

Her strength and nobility had surpassed the threshold of envy and jealousy, leaving only admiration and worship.

On the staircase around the five-thousandth level, Yang Kai and the Hu sisters were still trudging along. Yang Kai remained as he always was, but the sisters’ appearances were somewhat different now.

It was not that they were particularly fatigued, but rather that their current state was undeniably alluring.

The sweltering staircase left them drenched in fragrant sweat, their faces flushed, and their eyes shimmering like two ripe peaches, tempting enough to take a bite and savor their sweetness.

“It’s so hot!” Hu Jiao’er exclaimed, lifting her collar while walking up, gently fanning herself, her figure partially revealed.

She was already wearing little, and with the sweat, her dress clung to her body, accentuating her perfect curves.

Hu Mei’er was also sweating profusely; her lips, once ruby-red, were now dry, and she kept licking them with her fragrant tongue to moisten her mouth.

“Why don’t we take another break?” Hu Jiao’er said, somewhat exasperated, glancing at Yang Kai ahead. She hadn’t expected that someone she deemed much weaker than herself could still act as if nothing were wrong, which left her both annoyed and impressed.

Hearing her words, Yang Kai, who was walking ahead, paused and turned to look at her, saying, “Just a bit longer, and it won’t be hot anymore.”

From his elevated position, he caught sight of the stunningly fair skin and enticing curves of Hu Jiao’er’s chest.

Yang Kai momentarily lost his focus.

Hu Jiao’er clearly sensed her own lapse in composure. She quickly adjusted her collar, covering herself, and shot him a glare, saying, “What are you looking at?”

Yang Kai chuckled, not only failing to withdraw his gaze but instead brazenly lingering on both sisters.

Under his scrutiny, the Hu sisters suddenly felt uneasy.

The reason they walked behind Yang Kai was that they were both drenched. With their alluring figures partially exposed, how could they advance alongside him?

Yet, this person was unexpectedly shameless and bold.

“Are you still looking?” Hu Jiao’er warned, pulling her sister behind her to shield her, her face flushed with embarrassment, glaring at Yang Kai.

“Haha!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, turning back to continue forward, saying, “This journey has been exceedingly dull; there’s some scenery along the way, so naturally, I must stop to admire it, lest I waste the opportunity.”

“I really misjudged you.” Hu Jiao’er lamented, “I thought you were a gentleman, but it turns out you’re just as lewd! I wish I could gouge out my eyes and throw them at your face.”

Yang Kai did not turn back, casually replying, “It’s only natural for men to look at women; what does that have to do with being a gentleman or a rogue? Besides, if you’re angry, you should gouge out my eyes, not your own. Jiao’er, you’re being ridiculous.”

Hu Jiao’er was fuming, her chest rising and falling, gritting her teeth, “Do you want me to beat you up before you’ll shut up?”

“You’ve said that wrong again; have you forgotten you’re here to protect me?” Yang Kai suddenly turned around, raising an eyebrow at her, his tone filled with teasing.

Her face flushed at his words, and the fierce demeanor she had moments ago vanished without a trace as she shyly replied, “Can we not talk about that? It’s quite embarrassing.”

She had volunteered to protect Yang Kai, but now it seemed he didn’t need any protection at all; rather, it was the two sisters who were slowing him down.

Thinking of this made Hu Jiao’er feel awkward.

“Alright, you both should say less; with this energy, you might as well climb a few more levels.” Hu Mei’er stepped forward to mediate.

“Hmph, turn your head away, and you still look!” Hu Jiao’er shot Yang Kai a glare.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, choosing not to continue the banter.

Following behind him, Hu Jiao’er whispered to her sister, “I don’t think he’s a good person; be careful in the future, or he might devour you whole without spitting out the bones.”

“Sister…” Hu Mei’er blushed deeply.

After walking for an hour, Yang Kai suddenly halted, standing still.

The sisters hurried forward, and as they stepped onto the staircase where Yang Kai stood, they involuntarily shivered.

“It’s so cold!” Hu Jiao’er rubbed her arms, covered in goosebumps, and their fragrant sweat turned to ice in that instant.

As they reached the five-hundredth level, they entered a place of cold attributes.

Without speaking, the Hu sisters moved to either side of Yang Kai, pressing close to him like quails in winter, trembling incessantly.

From the three-thousandth level to now, they had spent their time like this; in the areas of Yang attributes, the sisters followed behind Yang Kai, and upon reaching the cold attributes, they huddled against him for warmth. This journey had fostered a sense of shared hardship.

Another day passed, and when the three of them stopped to rest once more, the Hu sisters exchanged glances and nodded at each other, as if they had made a decision.

“Yang Kai!” Hu Jiao’er suddenly called out.

“What is it?”

“We’ve thought it over, and we won’t be going with you anymore.”

Yang Kai revealed a hint of surprise but remained silent, waiting for them to continue.

Hu Jiao’er spoke bitterly, “With your own strength, you should be able to move faster. If it weren’t for taking care of us, you wouldn’t still be here. Continuing with you would only be a burden.”

Hu Mei’er nodded slightly beside her, adding, “Sister intended to protect you, but it seems the trial here is not closely related to one’s strength; there’s no need for protection at all.”

Yang Kai still said nothing, quietly watching them.

Hu Jiao’er smiled, “Do you think we’re giving up? We’re just not going with you; you can go your own way, and we will catch up.”

“Is that your final decision?” Yang Kai asked.

“En.”

Slowly standing up, Yang Kai said, “If you’ve made up your minds, I won’t try to persuade you.”

They were two understanding girls; trying to persuade them would only make him seem hypocritical.

Looking up at the peak above the clouds, Yang Kai said, “Thank you for accompanying me on this journey; it has made these past few days less dull.”

A hint of joy flashed across Hu Mei’er’s face, her eyes shy. The hostility and wariness in Hu Jiao’er’s heart shattered with those words.

“I will reach the peak! I want to see what is at the top!” Yang Kai turned and stepped upward, his speed undoubtedly much faster than before.

“Remember to tell us when you come back!” Hu Jiao’er said with a smile.

“Alright!”

They waited until Yang Kai’s figure became a small black dot in the distance before the sisters stood up, struggling against the invading cold as they continued to ascend.

However, they had barely taken a few steps when two gusts of gentle wind suddenly surged from the air. Under the caress of these gentle winds, both of them involuntarily leaned back.

In the next moment, their bodies felt light, and they floated up, directly carried away by the two gusts of cold wind from the endless staircase.

When they regained their senses, they found themselves outside the light barrier.

Turning back in shock, they saw many others, just like them, evidently just sent out, their faces bearing expressions of fear, and without exception, all were women; not a single man was present.

“Where’s Yang Kai?” Hu Mei’er looked around but found no trace of him.

“He’s still inside!” Hu Jiao’er whispered, though she didn’t know what had just happened, but since Yang Kai was not here, he must still be pushing forward.

But why were only women sent out?

The sudden appearance of a large group of young women caused the previously exited disciples from the three sects to be momentarily stunned.

Before long, the disciples hurriedly surrounded them, some asking about their well-being, others inquiring about the situation inside.

After listening for a while, the Hu sisters discovered that their experiences were the same as those of the other women; they had been walking when suddenly wrapped in a gentle wind and sent down, without any harm.
