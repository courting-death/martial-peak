## Chapter 2291 — Saving You

"Heh heh..." The Incarnation suddenly grinned, flashing a smile at Mountain Ghost.

Cold sweat poured down Mountain Ghost's forehead like rain. Swallowing nervously, he called out, "Wind Ghost, I... I don't think this is an illusion."

Wind Ghost's expression darkened as he barked, "Steady your mind! Don't let your senses be deceived!"

Even now, he still believed everything before his eyes was an illusion. After all, no one could conjure a stone man and a mature woman out of thin air—not even the Great Emperors could do such a thing.

Hearing this, Mountain Ghost took a deep breath, his panic subsiding a little.

At that moment, Yang Kai gave Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost a strange smile and said, "Guess how many hits your brother Mountain Ghost can withstand?"

Thunder Ghost snorted coldly. "Would it kill you not to show off? Even if that's not an illusion, even if an Emperor Realm expert were here, Mountain Ghost could stand firm for ten breaths."

Wind Ghost added, "Kid, don't underestimate us Blood Saber Four Ghosts!"

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "I'll turn your Four Ghosts into real ghosts in a moment!" Then he shouted to the Incarnation, "Did you hear that? They say even if an Emperor Realm expert attacks, this Mountain Ghost brother can last ten breaths without falling!"

"Ten breaths, huh..." The Incarnation chuckled, his smile turning ferocious in an instant. He rumbled, "Three breaths is enough!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly punched at Mountain Ghost.

Perhaps because of the combined attack technique, Mountain Ghost hadn't moved since he appeared. He sat cross-legged in midair, responsible for defense and suppression, and seemed to be the core through which the four's powers flowed and connected.

So even when he saw the Incarnation's punch, he made no move to dodge.

Instead, his face grew grave as he pointed a finger. Sumeru Peak appeared once more, but this time it was almost solid, radiating dazzling light, as if a real mountain stood before him.

"Like a mantis trying to stop a chariot!" the Incarnation snorted coldly, his mountain-sized fist smashing down.

Boom...

A deafening crash rang out. Heaven and earth trembled. Where the fist met Sumeru Peak, ripples of power spread out in waves, turning into a vortex that radiated in all directions.

Mountain Ghost's previously solemn expression instantly turned deathly pale. He spat out a mouthful of blood, his aura collapsing. At the same time, the Sumeru Peak between the Incarnation and Mountain Ghost shattered with a roar, breaking into countless rays of light that shot everywhere.

"What?" Wind Ghost's face changed dramatically.

"Impossible!" Thunder Ghost cried out in shock.

The two simply couldn't believe their eyes.

Mountain Ghost, born with powerful defenses, had his guard and Sumeru Peak shattered and was gravely injured in a single exchange with the stone man. Both kept asking themselves: Is this also an illusion? If so, it's far too real.

Mountain Ghost coughed up blood, the scent of it filling the air and making Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost tremble all over.

The Incarnation, after his first strike, didn't stop—he threw another punch.

Boom...

The second deafening crash sounded. This time, Mountain Ghost had no Sumeru Peak to shield him. He desperately changed his hand seals, unleashing his full earth element power. The Law of Earth swirled around him, forming a protective barrier.

Crackle crackle...

A dense, brittle sound rang out. Within several hundred zhang around them, a transparent dome-like barrier trembled into view. But now, it looked like a shattered mirror, splitting into countless cracks before collapsing into specks of light and vanishing.

Yang Kai felt his whole body lighten. Grinning, he said to Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost, "Looks like the sealing force has been broken. Are you still sure this is just an illusion?"

Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost’s faces darkened to the extreme, their hearts in utter turmoil. What they saw before their eyes and heard with their own ears left them shaken and conflicted, so much so that they truly no longer dared to be certain whether this was an illusion or reality.

"Pfft..."

On the other side, Mountain Ghost spat out another mouthful of blood. His already weak aura grew even more feeble, his face as pale as paper. Looking toward Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost, he struggled to say, "Save... me!"

The Incarnation grinned savagely and threw a third punch.

But by now, Mountain Ghost had no strength left to defend. Seeing that mountain-sized fist coming at him, he felt only cold all over, his limbs numb.

The fist struck Mountain Ghost directly. In midair, his body exploded into a cloud of blood, raining down, his presence vanishing in an instant.

"See? Three breaths!" The Incarnation finished and turned to smile at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave him a thumbs up.

Wind Ghost and Thunder Ghost exchanged glances, both knowing things had gone terribly wrong. Ignoring the spatial cracks around them, they suddenly surged their power, wrapped themselves in their own laws, and broke through the Spatial Force's seal, fleeing in two directions.

"Since you've come, don't even think of leaving!" Yang Kai grinned, his figure flickering as he suddenly appeared before Wind Ghost. His dragon hand turned into a claw, grabbing at him.

Wind Ghost was terrified, raising his Blood Saber to slash with all his might. The long blade howled with wind, brimming with immense power.

A fierce glint flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he grabbed the Blood Saber with one hand.

Instantly, a harsh screech of metal rang out.

"Are you kidding me..." Wind Ghost's eyes nearly popped out. He was horrified to find the other had caught his attack barehanded, completely unscathed.

His Blood Saber was a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. Even an Emperor Realm expert wouldn't dare catch it with their bare hands during a desperate strike.

Yet the other had done just that.

In that instant of shock, Yang Kai's other hand pressed against Wind Ghost's chest, pouring wild Origin Qi into his body.

With a cry, Wind Ghost was struck as if by lightning, coughing up blood as his aura dimmed instantly.

Yang Kai pressed his advantage, his hands forming seals as he jabbed Wind Ghost several times, directly suppressing his cultivation.

Though Wind Ghost looked utterly defeated and shocked, he still glared coldly at Yang Kai and shouted, "If you're going to kill me, do it! This will be reported to the Blood Saber headquarters. Next time, someone even stronger will come for you."

"If I kill all of you, who will leak my situation?" Yang Kai sneered.

Wind Ghost said, "Thunder Ghost's escape technique is unmatched. You won't catch him."

"Are you still dreaming?" Yang Kai mocked.

"Wind Ghost..."

Just then, a dejected voice called out nearby. Wind Ghost was stunned and turned to look, only to see Thunder Ghost standing in midair, head hanging in defeat, surrounded by countless pitch-black Moon Blades, humming and ready to strike, leaving him no room to move.

"Why..." Wind Ghost stared at Thunder Ghost in disbelief, never expecting him not to run.

"We lost!" Thunder Ghost sighed, looking at Yang Kai with a complicated gaze. "The higher-ups underestimated this man. We're... no match for him!"

"So that's how it is..." Wind Ghost gave a miserable smile.

"I'll go first!" Thunder Ghost suddenly said in a deep voice. He formed a seal with both hands, and his Origin Qi instantly went berserk, his body swelling up.

Yang Kai's face changed dramatically as he shouted, "Don't you dare!"

Thunder Ghost sneered, "This Lord may not be your match, but I still have the right to choose how I die!"

As soon as he finished, he exploded, leaving no remains behind.

He actually chose to self-destruct after being trapped. His resolve and decisiveness were beyond imagination. Yang Kai couldn't stop him in time.

The self-destruction of a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert was terrifyingly powerful.

A black hole was blasted open in the void, space destabilized, violent currents raging everywhere. Even though Yang Kai wasn't close, the shockwave left him unsteady, while the crippled Wind Ghost let out a muffled groan, his bones shattering and blood streaming from his orifices as he died.

Ye Qinghan was also sent flying by the shockwave, constantly channeling Origin Qi to resist, her pretty face pale.

Only after a while did the aftershocks gradually subside.

Yang Kai staggered over to Wind Ghost, only to find he had no breath left—dead beyond dead.

"Damn it!" Yang Kai cursed, then looked toward Hua Qingsi and shouted, "Sister Hua, leave one alive!"

He knew nothing about what kind of organization Blood Saber was or why they had come for him this time. If he could capture one or two alive, he might be able to get some information.

He hadn't killed Wind Ghost outright, only crippled his cultivation for this very reason. But he hadn't expected Wind Ghost to be killed by Thunder Ghost's self-destruction after all.

Mountain Ghost had already been blown apart by the Incarnation. Now, only Fire Ghost remained alive, and Yang Kai certainly didn't want him to die as well.

But as soon as he shouted, he froze on the spot.

Hua Qingsi, ribbons swirling around her, turned to him with a wry smile and said, "That... might be a bit difficult."

Not far in front of her, Fire Ghost was laughing maniacally, his Blood Saber already stabbed into his own heart. Blood gushed from his mouth, but despite the pain, he laughed wildly: "When Blood Saber acts, it's to the death! Hahaha!"

Clearly, he had killed himself, probably seeing that the other three had died and there was no hope of escape, so he stabbed his own heart with the Blood Saber.

Such a fatal wound would kill even an Emperor Realm expert, let alone Fire Ghost, who was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If left alone, he'd be dead in moments.

Yang Kai's face was ashen. After a moment of struggle, he gritted his teeth and shouted, "You think you can die without my permission? Dream on!"

As soon as he finished, he flickered over to Fire Ghost, slapped him to seal his power, preventing him from self-destructing like Thunder Ghost. If that happened, there'd be no saving him.

"W-What are you doing!" Even with death looming, Fire Ghost was startled by Yang Kai's fierce expression.

Yang Kai sneered, "What am I doing? Obviously, I'm saving you. No need to thank me!"
