## Chapter 326 — Bloodthirsty Evil Cave

"By the way, what do you plan to do with Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman?" Yang Kai asked, furrowing his brows. "Luo Xiaoman isn't a problem; although Ziwei Valley has some power, they are still weaker compared to you. But Qiu Yimeng is from the Qiu Family."

"I understand the stakes," Shan Qingluo replied with a light chuckle. "However, I can't let them go just yet. I will take them to the battlefield tomorrow."

"Battlefield?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes, the major forces of the world are encircling the Cangyun Evil Land. The battle has been ongoing for a long time," Shan Qingluo said, looking at Yang Kai with a smile.

"What do you need to take them to the battlefield for?"

"I have my reasons. Would you like to come with me?"

"No, thanks." Yang Kai stretched his body and chuckled, "It's hard to come by freedom, and I would rather not be at your beck and call any longer."

"Such a heartless man, ungrateful and unkind, how could you treat my sincerity like this?" Shan Qingluo gazed at him with a hint of melancholy.

"Cut it out!"

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai recalled something and asked, "By the way, what kind of place is the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave?"

Shan Qingluo looked at him in surprise. "Where did you hear about it?"

"I heard about it while fighting Le Yu the other day; someone mentioned that the martial skill he used was comprehended from the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave."

Shan Qingluo nodded slightly, not probing further into the grievances between Yang Kai and Le Yu, as her sharp mind could guess that Bilo was likely involved.

She merely said, "The Bloodthirsty Evil Cave is a very peculiar place, filled with evil energy, and is considered a dangerous area. Le Yu's Purple Qi Evil Body is a good martial skill, but he can't unleash its full power. So, its might is greatly diminished. Are you thinking of going there?"

"That's somewhat the idea." Yang Kai did not deny it. That day when he refined the Purple Evil Energy, his Proud Bone Golden Body subtly resonated, which made him very curious. He wondered what kind of mysteries the evil energy in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave concealed.

If possible, he might be able to catch a glimpse of the secrets of his Proud Bone Golden Body there.

With chaos engulfing the world and smoke rising everywhere, Yang Kai felt his strength was too low to involve himself. It would be better to find a place to train diligently, allowing him to grow for future plans.

"Going there..." Shan Qingluo furrowed her beautiful brows, a trace of worry creeping in, but it quickly relaxed. "It’s fine; your cultivation also seems to involve an evil technique. It might yield some benefits if you go there. But the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave is located in the territory of the Yinming Ghost King. It is not as safe as Piaoxiang City, and there may be enemies everywhere. Here’s the plan: I will have Bilo take you there tomorrow; she knows the way and can save you the trouble of getting lost."

"Great!"

The next day, as the sky brightened, Bilo came running.

Since that passionate day, this enchanting girl had not shown up in front of Yang Kai again. Seeing her now, her cheeks flushed slightly and she gasped, but she still shot a fierce glare at Yang Kai. Pouting, she huffed, "The lord asked me to take you to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave. You idiot, looking for death by going to such a place. If you had just said so, I could have taken care of you without running this errand; how troublesome!"

Yang Kai chuckled and nodded, "Thank you."

"Enough already! Do you have anything to pack? If not, let’s set off now. The place isn't near Piaoxiang City, and it’ll take several days to go back and forth."

"I don’t, let’s go."

The two exited the palace and ran into Shan Qingluo, Qiu Yimeng, and Luo Xiaoman waiting outside. They seemed to be hoping Yang Kai would say a few more supportive words to alleviate their troubling situation.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai pretended he didn't see them.

Since Shan Qingluo had no intention of taking their lives, she must have other arrangements. So, it wouldn’t help him to intervene.

"I’ll take you partway first, then we will part ways half a day later; this will help save your strength," Shan Qingluo said with a light smile, waving her hand. A gentle force enveloped them all, and they soared out of Piaoxiang City.

Just this effortless maneuver made Yang Kai’s brows twitch, while Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman felt hopeless, realizing that escaping the Enchantress Queen was a fool's dream.

The group traveled at great speed, covering hundreds of zhang in an instant.

While flying through the air, Shan Qingluo spoke softly to Yang Kai, "The Bloodthirsty Evil Cave is in the territory of the Yinming Ghost King. With my Evil King's order in hand, no one should provoke you. But once you and Bilo arrive there, don’t stir up trouble. The people there aren’t as easy to deal with as those in Piaoxiang City. Bilo will take you there and then come back."

"Okay," Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"The cave is filled with numerous evil spirits. Although some people gain benefits from it every year, more often than not, people die within. Do not venture too deep; the deeper you go, the stronger the evil spirits become. You won’t be able to handle them!"

"What are evil spirits?" Yang Kai frowned and asked.

"Evil spirits are formed from the condensation of evil energy and killing intent inside. They're semi-ethereal and hard to deal with. They lack intelligence but are highly aggressive; they attack any living beings."

"Besides comprehending martial skills, what other benefits can one obtain there?" Yang Kai pressed, hoping to gain insights from Shan Qingluo, who seemed to know the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave well.

"Besides martial skills, you can also grow stronger. When those evil spirits are defeated, they leave behind some evil spirit essence. This is a form of energy that can enhance strength if absorbed and refined. Thus, many people train in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, hoping to become stronger. Not only martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land go there; there are also outside people disguised to infiltrate, a mix of all sorts of characters."

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded secretly.

"However, some evil spirit essences contain special things, like bizarre martial skills. Le Yu's Purple Qi Evil Body was comprehended this way, but these martial skills tend to be rather sinister. For instance, there are essences that can enhance one’s Divine Sense power; someone has gained such benefits within, greatly boosting their Divine Sense."

"Such good things exist?" Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he had been eager to increase his Divine Sense power for some time.

"There are many good things, but one must have the skill to obtain them," Shan Qingluo smiled faintly.

"Indeed, the world is truly wondrous. Such things do exist." Yang Kai expressed his amazement, recalling the otherworldly experience while training in the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, which also left him puzzled.

"I heard from my mother that the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave connects to another realm…" Shan Qingluo finished speaking and laughed lightly, seemingly not taking it very seriously.

"Which realm?" Yang Kai asked.

"The Demon Realm..."

The group fell silent, astonished as they had never heard of it before.

"It could be true; otherwise, it wouldn’t explain why evil spirits are so rampant and never-ending."

"Are you joking?" Yang Kai scoffed.

"Hehe… My mother also heard it from her mother," Shan Qingluo giggled.

"Yang Kai, you’re going to train in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave?" Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes sparkled with curiosity as she looked at him.

"Yeah," Yang Kai nodded.

"Can you take us with you? I want to go too," Qiu Yimeng said with a sweet smile.

Shan Qingluo shot her a knowing look.

Qiu Yimeng chuckled awkwardly, "I can help him, right? More people means more assurance; my strength isn’t too low either."

"Don't worry, I won’t treat you badly," Shan Qingluo comforted them. "I’ll take you to the battlefield just so you can witness how those attacking the Cangyun Evil Land treat the people here."

Qiu Yimeng froze slightly, beginning to understand Shan Qingluo's intentions.

"In truth, good and evil aren’t as clear-cut as you think; this world isn’t merely black and white!" Shan Qingluo's typically soft and seductive voice carried a slight heaviness at this moment.

Half a day later, the group parted ways. Shan Qingluo led Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman away while Yang Kai and Bilo flew toward the territory of the Yinming Ghost King.

The Yinming Ghost King, resembling a vengeful spirit, holds a higher rank among the six Evil Kings, making him quite difficult to handle. The ghost king once coveted the beauty of the previous Enchantress Queen and even resorted to stealthy attacks. However, the previous Enchantress Queen turned the situation around, resulting in a less than favorable relationship between him and Shan Qingluo's faction.

As a result, the two territories had a somewhat strained relationship.

Thus, even though Bilo carried Shan Qingluo's Evil King's order, she dared not show it indiscriminately to avoid drawing the attention of the ghost king's martial artists.

The two tread carefully toward the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, encountering no significant troubles along the way.

Occasionally, they encountered other martial artists, who merely regarded each other warily without taking any rash actions.

Three days later, they reached the vicinity of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

At this point, Bilo stopped and pointed ahead. "The place you want to go is right there."

"Oh." Yang Kai looked up to see that the location was rather unremarkable, lacking the overwhelming traces of evil energy he had imagined.

"Hey, you idiot, be cautious once you go inside, and be sure not to die!" Bilo huffed angrily.

Yang Kai turned to glance at her and suddenly chuckled. "Why are you so concerned about me? You wouldn’t have developed feelings for me, would you?"

"Shut up!" Bilo swore loudly, "Why would I like you? I would prefer dog poop over you! Stop lingering around me; I’m telling you, last time was a mutual favor. If you dare go out and talk about it, I’ll have you castrated."

While she continued to rant, Yang Kai suddenly dashed forward, wrapping his arms around her waist, and kissed her fiercely.

"Ow…" Bilo struggled fiercely, trying to retaliate.

Yang Kai abruptly released her, laughing heartily as he quickly retreated.

"You bastard!" Bilo pressed her red lips together, feeling as if they were cut, a metallic taste spreading across her tongue.

What a loss! I'll never touch a man again! Bilo thought resentfully.

She waited until Yang Kai disappeared from her sight, then let out a cold huff, her expression dark as she turned to leave.

Three miles away, Yang Kai discovered a pitch-black deep pit on the ground. Standing by its edge, a chilling breeze wafted up from below, causing him to shiver, making even his Divine Sense feel abnormally cold.

As expected of a cursed place, it indeed felt somewhat strange. Yang Kai focused himself.

The True Yang Technique subtly operated, dispersing the cold sensation as he leaped, plunging down with the sounds of the whistling wind.
