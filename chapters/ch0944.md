## Chapter 944 — We're Friends

Inside the main hall, Changyuan's single sentence instantly turned the atmosphere strange and tense.

The claim that, given enough time, Yang Kai could grow to the height of a Great Demon God sent Meng Ge and Xueli's sense of crisis soaring. Even Lord Changyuan admitted that was a height beyond his reach—if Yang Kai truly rose to such power, what would become of them?

The Great Demon God once swept the world and stood peerless; Yang Kai could do the same.

When that day came, all living beings under heaven would be at his mercy.

The two demon generals couldn't help but feel a dangerous urge to strangle Yang Kai here and now, to prevent that day from ever arriving.

"No impudence!" Changyuan barked, "I said I want to be friends with Saint Lord Yang, so I'll speak plainly and won't hide things. If either of you dares to keep acting murderous, I'll cripple you first!"

Meng Ge and Xueli were stunned—no one expected Changyuan to scold them like this for Yang Kai's sake. Only then did they realize the lord's resolve was more than words; they quickly bowed their heads and admitted their fault.

Changyuan nodded with satisfaction, then looked at Yang Kai. "That said, Saint Lord, don't get your hopes up too high. The Demon Domain is under my control now; I won't hand over such a vast territory to a mere human."

"I don't intend to take the Demon Domain."

"Good." Changyuan smiled lightly. "The safest course would be for me to kill you and seize your Demon God's Secret Codex. But even if I killed you, I know I couldn't obtain the Demon God's inheritance—the Great Demon God's legacy is unique and irreplaceable. If he chose you, there are reasons. All demons are descendants of the Great Demon God, so I only ask, Saint Lord Yang, that you not regard us as enemies. I swear by the Great Demon God's name that I will not harm you in the future; you must not cause trouble for me either. Agreed?"

Yang Kai was quietly moved.

No demon would dare swear by the Great Demon God's name lightly; those three characters carry unfathomable weight in any demon's heart, even the current lord.

Yang Kai recognized Changyuan's sincerity and grew serious, nodding: "Agreed."

Changyuan laughed heartily, clearly pleased. "Then it's settled. Though young, Saint Lord, you act decisively—exactly my taste. Dealing with someone like you is effortless."

"You're straightforward too!"

"So we're friends then?" Changyuan beamed at Yang Kai.

"At least not enemies." Yang Kai returned the smile.

"Very well." Changyuan rose. "That will be all for today. I should take my leave. If Saint Lord Yang has leisure another day, please visit Demon Capital—I should play the host. Also, I'm curious about the secret the Demon God left behind and would like to borrow the Demon God's Secret Codex to examine it. Would you allow that?"

"All right, I'll come."

"Much obliged! When Saint Lord Yang visits the Demon Capital, give prior notice. My Demon Domain will permit you free passage, and no one will harm you." Changyuan nodded and immediately departed.

"Li Rong, see them out!" Yang Kai instructed.

Li Rong promptly acted, escorting Changyuan and the two demon generals out of the hall.

A moment later she returned, and together with Han Fei, the two of them watched Yang Kai.

"Master, do you truly believe Changyuan?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai asked back without answering directly.

Li Rong thought carefully. "He does seem sincere, but we're hardly familiar with him—can't fully trust him."

"I think so too." Han Fei nodded.

"I actually find him quite decent." Yang Kai grinned, leaving the two women momentarily surprised.

Yang Kai was no child; if Changyuan could fool him in a few words, he wouldn't have survived this long. He'd given Changyuan's attitude and words his own consideration.

"Shall we go to the Demon Capital?"

"Yes—definitely." Yang Kai nodded earnestly.

But not because of Changyuan's invitation; Yang Kai was curious about the secret the Great Demon God left behind. If his hunch was right, the secret was related to what the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation had mentioned in that strange space.

When Meng Wuya and the Little Senior Sister were brought back, the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation had told Yang Kai that if he had time he should visit the Demon Capital—there everything would become clear.

Yang Kai had not paid much heed before, but Changyuan's visit and words today revealed an opportunity.

The entire Small Xuan Realm had opened because he destroyed that place; the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation said it was the continent's core. Yang Kai couldn't rest until he understood the earth-shattering secrets hidden there.

While he contemplated, a crowd surged into the hall—led by Ling Taixu—rushing over to exchange pleasantries and ask whether the Demon Lord had harmed him.

Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, offering reassurances.

Dozens of li away above Lingxiao Pavilion, Changyuan left at speed, flying with Meng Ge and Xueli.

The two demon generals followed behind the lord, exchanging glances; they couldn't fathom why he hadn't seized the chance to kill the human, instead choosing to stoop and make friends.

Such a terrifying person should naturally be eliminated early, lest his rise threaten the entire Demon Domain.

As if seeing through the doubts in their hearts, Changyuan, still flying, suddenly said: “He cannot be killed—don’t even think about it.”

Meng Ge and Xueli trembled.

Changyuan continued, "If the Great Demon God selected Yang Kai as his successor, how bad could he be? Don't look down on him for merely being a Third Stage Transcendent; if he truly fights with everything, I estimate he could display power comparable to the Second Stage of the Saint Realm."

"Impossible!" Meng Ge and Xueli cried out.

"Why impossible?" Changyuan chuckled. "The Demon God was famed for fighting beyond his rank—rumor says he could surpass several ranks to defeat foes. You're demon generals; you surely know such tales."

Meng Ge and Xueli were speechless. They knew these facts but hadn't linked them to Yang Kai.

"That would be merely his innate strength. He might also possess some Demon God divine ability; if he survives one strike, he'll harbor enmity. If we wait until he truly grows, my Demon Domain is finished—I won't risk that!"

"Moreover, that Ancient Demon Clan woman by his side… I cannot defeat her. As long as she stays with Yang Kai, no one in the world could threaten his life."

The two Demon Generals couldn’t help but lose focus. Although they had personally experienced Li Rong’s terrifying strength before, and even compared her to the Demon Lord, to hear Changyuan admit with his own mouth that he could not defeat her—Meng Ge and Xueli still found it hard to believe.

"What you said today…" Meng Ge began but fell silent.

"I'm not lying. I really want to make friends with him. If you want to befriend someone, do it while he's weak—waiting until he grows is too late. Remember this: whatever grievances you had with him are settled now; don't provoke him again. I won't have the relationship I've worked hard to build ruined by you."

Meng Ge and Xueli felt a swirl of emotions and, unable to reply, could only nod.

…

Five days later, at Yang Kai's order, several thousand troops marched grandly through the Void Passage toward the Tongxuan Continent.

After waiting those days, those who were coming had arrived; those absent likely wouldn't come—no need to wait any longer.

Yang Kai felt gratified that most of the friends he'd made were willing to follow him and entrusted their lives and fortunes to him.

They had full confidence in Yang Kai.

Near the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, Yang Kai, with Li Rong, Han Fei, and Shi Kun, had arrived early and cleared out nearby martial artists; within fifty li the area was almost empty.

Shi Kun looked at Yang Kai in puzzlement. "Saint Lord, won't this provoke anger? Ten li would be enough."

He couldn't understand why Yang Kai cleared such a wide fifty-li area.

"You'll see soon enough." Yang Kai smiled faintly and fixed his gaze on the Void Passage.

Figures began to emerge from the passage—one after another. The first wave was the Yang Family's direct line, all staring around in wonder as if they had arrived in a new world, elated.

When they sensed the dense Spiritual Qi here, they were overjoyed and greedily inhaled the air, expressions of rapture appearing on their faces.

Guided by Yang Kai, the first arrivals from the Yang Family flew down, found an open space, and waited for their kin.

Among them a lovely figure separated from the Yang Family straight line; after stepping out she looked around and then flew straight toward Yang Kai, smiling as she landed before him.

"Weren't your Qiu Family due in the fourth wave? Why did the head of house come so early?" Yang Kai asked Qiu Yimeng in surprise.

Qiu Yimeng reached out a hand. "I'm here to collect a gift from you."

"What gift?"

"You said you'd give me a big present when we reached this place!" Her pretty eyes turned a little mournful. "What, did you forget?"

"Oh, that gift!" Yang Kai slapped his forehead. "I remember—I'd prepared it long ago."

Qiu Yimeng leaped with joy. "Quick, give it to me. If I'm not satisfied, you'll pay."

"You'll be satisfied." Yang Kai smiled and casually tapped her.

"What are you doing?" Qiu Yimeng eyed him suspiciously and checked the spot he touched—no trace remained.

"I just poured a surge of energy into your body to help you break through your current realm," Yang Kai said earnestly. "Feel carefully—any special sensations?"

Qiu Yimeng regarded him skeptically but, concentrating, her face suddenly went blank with surprise as she muttered, "Oh… I seem to be on the verge of a breakthrough."

"Go find a place to cultivate the mystery; within this fifty li safe zone it's secure." Yang Kai waved.

Qiu Yimeng didn't delay and vanished in a flash.

"So easy to fool." Yang Kai sighed softly.

Li Rong and Han Fei stood at his side, suppressing smiles.
