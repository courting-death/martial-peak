## Chapter 2510 — Li Wuyi and Jiu Feng

Mo Xiaoqi fidgeted a little, speaking shyly, "Eldest Brother Yang, I didn't mean to hide it from you, it's just that my father..."

Yang Kai raised his hand and said, "No need to explain, I understand."

Mo Xiaoqi was clearly afraid that her father's reputation was too intimidating, so she had never mentioned her true identity to Yang Kai. Now that Yang Kai had exposed it, she felt somewhat uneasy.

Yang Kai smiled, "The Beast Great Emperor is the Beast Great Emperor, and you are you. The one I know is the mischievous Mo Xiaoqi, not the daughter of the Beast Great Emperor."

Hearing this, Mo Xiaoqi thought seriously for a moment, then suddenly broke into a relieved smile, her eyes curving like crescent moons, looking especially lovely.

Just then, Yang Kai's expression suddenly grew serious as he looked up into the void.

At the same time, Zhang Ruoxi also let out a low cry, "Sir!"

As she spoke, her Origin Qi surged restlessly, and she looked up at the sky with great vigilance.

Ruoxi could actually sense it? Yang Kai looked at her in astonishment, noticing that her beautiful eyes now radiated a chilling aura, completely different from her usual gentle self.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked, feeling more and more that Zhang Ruoxi's bloodline was quite peculiar.

In that once-calm sky, ripples suddenly spread out like a stone thrown into a lake. The ripples quickly expanded outward, growing more and more distinct.

Soon, a certain spot in the sky began to twist, and a clear yet bizarre fluctuation of power emanated from that direction.

"Power of Space!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed in shock.

He hadn’t expected to encounter such a clear and powerful manifestation of the Power of Space in a place like this. The scene before him made it obvious—someone had torn open the fabric of space itself, crossing over from an unimaginably distant place. Judging by the fluctuations in that spatial energy, the person arriving was at least as skilled in manipulating space as Yang Kai himself—perhaps even more accomplished!

Yang Kai's expression became extremely grave. Although he didn't know who was coming, anyone who could tear space and cross over like this was definitely not ordinary.

Who could it be? And why had they come here?

He didn't dare relax in the slightest. While quickly withdrawing his Incarnation, he secretly circulated his Emperor Yuan in preparation.

If he were alone, he could have simply left and hidden to observe. But now, with Zhang Ruoxi, Mo Xiaoqi, and Liu Yan—who was still in the Phoenix Egg—by his side, there was no way to escape.

"Ah!" Mo Xiaoqi also noticed the anomaly in the sky. After a startled cry, her face turned pale. In a flash, she hid behind Yang Kai, trembling like a mouse meeting a cat, and whispered, "Eldest Brother Yang, let's run! If we don't go now, it'll be too late!"

Yang Kai's face darkened. "It's already too late to run."

Whoosh—

The sky was torn open, like an invisible beast opening its maw, ready to devour anyone in its path.

Under Yang Kai's intense gaze, a foot suddenly stepped out from the pitch-black rift.

Thud—

Even though that foot landed in the void, to Yang Kai it felt as if it had stomped directly on his heart, making his face pale and his aura falter in an instant.

So strong! Yang Kai's eyes were filled with shock. He had already known the newcomer wouldn't be weak, but only now did he realize he had underestimated their strength.

This person was definitely a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert! And not an ordinary one at that!

After the foot, a figure slowly emerged from the rift, as if stepping out for a stroll. His face was calm and relaxed, completely at ease.

Only now did Yang Kai see the newcomer's appearance clearly.

It was a middle-aged man dressed as a scholar, exuding extraordinary bearing, with a gentle smile on his face, looking completely harmless.

After appearing, the man's gaze swept lightly over the scene before settling on Yang Kai, his smile turning enigmatic.

Gulp—

Even though he knew he couldn't show weakness, Yang Kai couldn't help but swallow hard. Being stared at by this man, he felt like a lamb being eyed by a hungry wolf, every inch of his flesh trembling involuntarily.

It wasn't over yet. After the scholar appeared, another figure stepped out from the rift.

Unlike the scholar's leisurely manner, this second person was like a blazing flame, exuding a fierce aura. The moment she appeared, the surrounding temperature soared.

She was a beautiful, voluptuous woman, with a full chest, slender waist, ruby-red lips shining like jewels, porcelain-white skin as delicate as jade, and sparkling eyes that would make any man daydream. Most striking of all was her fiery red hair, which created a powerful visual impact, making it impossible to look away.

Damn! Why is it her? Yang Kai nearly bit his tongue, cursing inwardly.

Because he actually knew this beautiful woman!

She was none other than the Aunt Feng that Mo Xiaoqi often mentioned!

In the past, Yang Kai hadn't known Aunt Feng's real name, but during an argument between Mo Xiaoqi and Lan Xun in the Shattered Star Sea, Lan Xun had mentioned it.

Spirit Beast Island's Jiu Feng! Although not one of the Ten Great Emperors, her name was renowned throughout the Star Realm. Among higher-level cultivators, few didn't know of her.

If this beautiful woman was Jiu Feng, then the identity of the middle-aged scholar was obvious.

Li Wuyi!

Yang Kai's eyes suddenly shone with excitement as he met Li Wuyi's gaze without hesitation. Although this was their first meeting, Yang Kai had long heard of his great name. Li Wuyi was the Star Realm's foremost expert in the Power of Space, and himself a Third Stage Emperor Realm master.

Mo Xiaoqi had even said before that she wanted to introduce Yang Kai to Li Wuyi, so he could become his disciple and learn the mysteries of space power.

Realizing these two were Spirit Beast Island experts, Yang Kai quickly understood why they had come.

They were clearly here to find Mo Xiaoqi.

But how did they know Mo Xiaoqi was here? And they had torn through space to arrive so precisely.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai realized that Mo Xiaoqi must have had something placed on her by them, allowing the people of the Spirit Beast Island to sense her location. That was why, not long after leaving the Shattered Star Sea, Li Wuyi and Jiu Feng had come straight for them.

No wonder Mo Xiaoqi had hidden behind him at the first sign of trouble in the sky, urging him to run—she had immediately realized they were coming to catch her.

The moment Jiu Feng appeared, she stormed over, grabbed Li Wuyi by the collar, and hoisted him clean off the ground. Her voice thundered with fury, "Li Wuyi, you bastard! How dare you leave me behind in the void rift? Do you have any idea how close I came to being swallowed by the void currents?"

Li Wuyi, a top Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, now looked like a helpless chick in Jiu Feng's grasp, not even daring to resist.

Cold sweat streamed down his face as he forced a stiff smile. “There are juniors watching below! If you do this, I’ll completely lose face!”

“Face?” Jiu Feng’s phoenix eyes widened as she snapped, “Face is something you earn yourself—not something others hand to you. If you want to keep your face, then treat this lady better. Got it?”

"Got it, got it!" Li Wuyi nodded like a pecking chicken, pleading, “Could you put me down first so we can talk? This is really undignified.”

"What's dignity?" Jiu Feng sneered, "Can you eat it?"

Li Wuyi immediately put on a pitiful face, looking helplessly toward Yang Kai, "Xiaoqi, save me!"

"You can't see me, you can't see me, you can't see me!" Mo Xiaoqi hid tightly behind Yang Kai, muttering to herself.

"If you dare leave me in the void rift again, I'll break your third leg!" Jiu Feng gritted her teeth, looking fierce.

Li Wuyi instinctively clamped his legs together and hurriedly said, "I wouldn't dare, never again! Please spare me, Ancestor!"

"Hmph!" Only then did Jiu Feng toss Li Wuyi aside like garbage. Her tone and demeanor changed drastically, turning bashful and coy as she said, "Really, you should know I'm afraid of the dark."

After speaking, her beautiful eyes sparkled as she glanced down, fixing on Yang Kai, and greeted him warmly, "Oh, Junior Brother, we meet again! We really are fated, aren't we?"

Yang Kai swallowed hard, his expression stiff. The towering images of Aunt Feng and Li Wuyi as Great Emperor-level experts in his heart were crumbling bit by bit, the sound of shattering echoing deep in his soul.

With a dark face, he cupped his fists and said, "Junior Yang Kai greets Senior Li and Senior Jiu Feng!"

Li Wuyi smiled, a subtle cold light in his eyes, "Just now... did you see anything?"

Yang Kai replied solemnly, "Just now, space power surged and the void twisted chaotically. Though I strained my eyes, my strength is too low and I saw nothing. I am truly ashamed!"

Hearing this, Li Wuyi's brows rose and the cold light faded from his eyes. He nodded, "A teachable child! I often heard Xiaoqi mention you on the island. I hear you are also skilled in the Power of Space?"

Yang Kai quickly replied, "Senior flatters me. I have only dabbled a little, and would never dare show off before Senior Li. If I have the chance, I would love to seek your guidance."

Li Wuyi’s eyes lit up with delight, his brows dancing as he declared, “Excellent, truly excellent! If you ever visit Spirit Beast Island, this Lord will personally teach you a unique secret art.”

Yang Kai was overjoyed and immediately said, "No time like the present—how about today?"

Li Wuyi still smiled, but said lightly, "You cheeky brat, my secret art isn't something you can just learn whenever you want."

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he retorted, “Senior, you’re really stingy! Not even a hint of generosity toward your juniors. I’m honestly quite disappointed.”

"Whether you're happy or not is none of my business," Li Wuyi laughed heartily. "As long as this Lord is happy, that's all that matters."
