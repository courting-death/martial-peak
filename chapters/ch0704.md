## Chapter 704 — The Alchemy Duel

A scream of agony rang out as Nie Cong staggered backward, blood gushing from the wound in great fountains, impossible to stop.

The onlookers all uttered a startled exclamation in unison; none of them had expected such a scene to occur.

Yang Kai's punch had been laced with killing intent, yet it was meant only as a warning and not to finish him off; Nie Cong's wrist had been severed because of that young man’s action. Without the protection of True Yuan, the broken wrist burst apart under Yang Kai's force.

The vendor stood agape, mouth wide, utterly incredulous.

“You... you dare hurt me? You all deserve to die!” Nie Cong suddenly snapped back to his senses, clutching at his severed wrist, eyes filled with murderous hatred as he raved and howled at Yang Kai and the youth in a near-hysterical frenzy.

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent; he stared coldly at him.

The young man responded in an icy voice, “Didn't I tell you? If you put out a hand again, I'll chop it off.”

Nie Cong went numb, a chill sweeping through him; a cold dread rose in his heart and his eyes trembled.

“Take one more step closer and I'll kill you!” the youth threw out another chilling threat.

Nie Cong's expression shifted, he fought to stifle the searing pain and suddenly roared, “Just you wait!”

Leaving behind a final vicious remark, Nie Cong shot into the air, trailing blood along his path.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered; he restrained the urge to eradicate the trouble at its root and cast a glance at his rival.

Silence fell over the scene, so still one could hear a pin drop. Every eye was fixed on Yang Kai and the youth, faces showing various emotions—schadenfreude, sympathy, pity, and some contemplative looks wondering whether these two had powerful backers and were not afraid of Saint Realm experts.

“You two... ah!” The vendor was at a loss for words; he had never imagined that selling some herbs would provoke such a commotion.

“Sorry, got a little excited,” the youth said sheepishly, then glanced at Yang Kai. “You aren't afraid this stirred up so much trouble?”

“You're not afraid, so why should I be?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Interesting, I find I'm starting to like you.”

Yang Kai's face darkened. “I'm not interested in men.”

The youth immediately realized the ambiguity of his words and waved his hand hurriedly. “You misunderstand. I just mean you suit my taste—how about being friends?”

“Fine, but first hand over the Earthfire Core.”

The other man ground his teeth, hesitated a moment, then said, “If we keep arguing like this, neither of us will back down.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. Strictly speaking, he had noticed the similarity between their temperaments; when like-minded people clash, it's hard to reach agreement because each will insist on their chosen path. Yet sometimes there is a tacit understanding—both had moved to deal with Nie Cong at the same time, and both had harbored the thought of eradicating the problem completely.

“Friend is an alchemist?” the man asked with a smile.

“You are as well.”

“Since we're both alchemists and the dispute is over medicinal ingredients, why not settle it with a contest?” the man suggested with narrowed eyes and a low voice.

“Agreed!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, confidence shining on his face.

“Pleasure!” the other man nodded heavily and laughed. “But let's be clear: whoever wins takes the Earthfire Core. Until then, this beauty will keep it safe.”

He said this while glancing at Fei Yu.

Fei Yu giggled, covering her mouth. “You young man, you're quite the talker.”

“Facts speak for themselves!”

Fei Yu's smile grew wider.

After asking the vendor the price of the Earthfire Core, Yang Kai and the other man each put up half the Crystal Stone and purchased the Earthfire Core; Fei Yu accepted it solemnly and said, “Junior nephew, although Senior Aunt would like to help you, since this is a contest you've arranged, whoever wins in the end, Senior Aunt will give it to. If you lose, don't blame Senior Aunt—men must keep their word.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “Let's find a quieter place; there seem to be too many people here.”

The other man agreed.

The vendor said helplessly, “You two should leave Fuyun City quickly; you've injured Young Master Nie Cong. If you don't flee now, you may not be able to leave—he will surely bring reinforcements once he returns.”

“No matter,” the youth shook his head calmly and told Yang Kai, “Let's go to your place; my lodgings are inconvenient.”

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent; he and Fei Yu led the way and departed.

Only after the three had left did the vendor shake his head. “Those two are lunatics.”

“Why worry? If they're so brazen, they must have backing; Nie Cong will probably take a tumble this time. Heh heh, I'd love to see it.” A companion of the vendor chuckled softly, clearly holding no affection for Nie Cong and hoping these two would teach him a lesson.

Those words drew much agreement, and some idle onlookers followed the direction the three had taken, preparing to watch the spectacle.

Inside the inn, in the room belonging to Yang Kai and Fei Yu.

When he entered, the youth scanned the room, nodded slightly, then offered a hand and introduced himself: “Zhai Yao, friend—what do you go by?”

“Yang Kai.” Yang Kai did not conceal his name and cast a glance at Fei Yu. “This is my Senior Aunt, Fei Yu.”

“You two are here for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, right?”

“Mm, are you as well?”

“Sort of, though my goal differs from yours, so don't worry about me stealing the Thousand-Year Demon Flower—I might even cooperate with you later.”

“Cooperate?” Yang Kai frowned. “How would that work?”

“We'll leave that for another time—perhaps you won't even be able to reach Wangtian Cliff,” Zhai Yao smiled faintly. “For now, let's deal with the matter at hand.”

“How do you propose we compete?” Yang Kai settled cross-legged and produced his censer.

The censer had been obtained from the third page of the Black Book; Yang Kai now used it as his furnace when refining pills.

At the sight of the censer, Zhai Yao's eyes brightened. “You truly are a master—such a small furnace is rare.”

When alchemists refine pills they inscribe various spirit formations into the furnace to assist the process; larger furnaces make it easier to inscribe such formations, while smaller ones make it harder.

Thus a skilful alchemist does not require a large furnace; to some extent, the smaller the furnace an alchemist can use, the more refined his technique.

As he spoke, Zhai Yao casually summoned his own furnace.

His furnace was exquisite, carved with dragons and phoenixes and finely crafted, clearly the work of a master artificer; its size was nearly identical to Yang Kai's.

Compared to that, Yang Kai's censer seemed plain and unadorned, yet everyone could tell Yang Kai's censer was of a higher grade.

Zhai Yao looked at Yang Kai's censer with envy and wonder, clicking his tongue.

His furnace had been a gift from his teacher, famed across the world, used by his teacher in his youth; he had believed nothing could be better than it, until now.

“One pill decides the victor. Regardless of what pill is refined, we judge only by the pill's grade and quality, and the time taken.” Zhai Yao composed himself and stated the rules.

“Agreed.” Yang Kai accepted the challenge without hesitation.

“Then begin.” Zhai Yao cocked his head, then straightened and quickly produced several sample herbs.

At the same time Yang Kai's hands moved as well; rare medicinal materials were continuously drawn from the Black Book Space, each in perfect quantity and age.

Invisible forces swirled in the room as the two young men focused intently, circulating True Yuan to cloak their furnaces and inscribe spirit formations within.

Fei Yu's beautiful eyes did not blink as she fixed them on their movements, covering her mouth in admiration.

She noticed that the two young men moved in uncanny unison; in the speed at which they inscribed spirit formations, neither had the upper hand.

Could there really be anyone in this world who could match her junior nephew in alchemy? Who exactly was this Zhai Yao?

Fei Yu was stunned, utterly absorbed, holding her breath.

In barely ten breaths' time, the spirit formations were perfectly inscribed in both furnaces. Each man then took out a single herb, True Yuan flickering uncertainly on their hands.

Yang Kai's True Yuan was the most rigid and yang, while his opponent's True Yuan, like Cang Yan's, was scorching flame—both well-suited to alchemy.

The medicinal essences churned within the True Yuan; liquids were swiftly agitated and condensed, visible impurities being stripped away and evaporating clean.

The liquid danced in the True Yuan like raindrops; each ripple rendered it purer and more condensed.

Both men's hands trembled slightly as the condensed essences precisely fell into their furnaces.

The second herb was brought forth and processed in the same manner.

A strange light gleamed in Fei Yu's eyes as she watched intently.

She observed that both young men had their minds wholly immersed in the alchemy, oblivious to everything around them; their concentration was beyond reproach.

Men, when earnest, possess a distinctive bearing.

Fei Yu glanced between them, feeling stirred; she realized both were destined for great achievements in the future, heights beyond ordinary reach.

Time passed slowly and the room gradually filled with an enticing pill fragrance.

The two True Yuans cloaked their furnaces as they performed the final refinements.

Suddenly Zhai Yao's face lit with joy; a faint smile curved his lips as he slapped his furnace. A round, golden pill shot out and was caught in his hand.

He examined the pill's quality and grade and nodded in satisfaction; though hurried and tense, he had perfectly demonstrated his alchemical skill.

As for Yang Kai, he, too, seemed to have reached the final critical moment.

Fei Yu could not help but grow anxious; Yang Kai had fallen behind in time, and if he could not surpass Zhai Yao in quality, Yang Kai would surely lose.

The contest between these two young alchemists concealed surging tempests, leaving Fei Yu nearly breathless.
