## Chapter 854 — Reentering the Snow Mountains

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

During this time Yang Kai stayed inside the Alchemists' Association, teaching Wu'er and Mi Na while refining his own alchemy; life had been fairly leisurely.

Yang Kai watched Wu'er's progress with a fond eye and threw himself into nurturing her all the more; he rather liked this quick-witted, peculiar little girl who grasped things at a touch.

One day, while busy in the pill workshop, Yang Kai noticed a disturbance, paused his work, and looked up to see Elder Du enter wearing a deeply troubled expression.

The three of them hurriedly saluted.

Elder Du waved his hand and said, "I'm here to tell you: if you have no urgent business, don't go out for a while."

"What's wrong?" Mi Na asked suspiciously.

"Things outside have been a bit unsettled…" Elder Du said gravely, "going out might get you into trouble."

"What kind of trouble?" Mi Na looked puzzled.

Yang Kai frowned and said suddenly, "It has to do with those outsiders who have been pouring into Giant Stone City recently, doesn't it?"

Du Wan looked at Yang Kai in surprise and smiled, "Correct — you noticed it too. For months now many outsiders have been lingering in Giant Stone City, seemingly probing for something. The number of people has only grown."

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Although he had stayed inside the Alchemists' Association, the changes in Giant Stone City could not be hidden from his divine sense.

These newcomers moved hurriedly, coming to the city from time to time to buy living supplies or cultivation materials and then leaving quickly; all of it was highly unusual.

Especially lately, more and more outsiders used Giant Stone City as a transit point, lingering for a time before setting off again.

It seemed they were heading into that endless snow mountain.

Thinking of that, Yang Kai couldn't help but knit his brow and asked, "Elder Du, have you heard any concrete news?"

Du Wan nodded lightly. "A bit. Today Ran Jing from Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Mao Da from Rashomon Gate came to me, asking me to refine several antidote pills. I asked casually, and they said they were going deep into the snow mountain to look for something and wanted antidotes to guard against the unexpected… I guess what they're seeking is related to a deadly poison."

Antidote pills could resist the invasion of toxins when swallowed; pills made by a master like Du Wan could basically make one immune to most poisons. Though costly, they were worth the price.

Yang Kai had heard of Ran Jing of Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Mao Da of Rashomon Gate.

Centered on Giant Stone City, four nearby powers were reasonably notable.

They were the Tianxiao Sect, the Leiguang Divine Cult, Ancient Moon Sanctuary, and Rashomon Gate.

Yang Kai had once served as an honored guest at the Leiguang Divine Cult.

When Yang Kai first came to Giant Stone City, Du Wan had explained the strengths and weaknesses of these four powers. Tianxiao Sect was the strongest; the other three were comparable and lacked Saint Realm experts. Ran Jing and Mao Da were on par with Xia Chengyin, the deceased leader of the Leiguang Divine Cult — all at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

Not only were large numbers of outsiders pouring into the snow mountains, but Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Rashomon Gate nearby were also being dragged into the affair.

Hearing Du Wan's words, Yang Kai suddenly realized something; his expression changed as a tidal wave of divine sense surged outward, stretching into a silken thread that pierced a thousand miles.

After a long while his expression shifted and he retracted his divine sense, his gaze grave.

"Elder Du, I'm going out!" Yang Kai said in a low voice.

"Ah?" Du Wan was stunned. He had come specifically to warn them not to go out; he didn't expect Yang Kai to volunteer to leave. After a moment he asked gravely, "These outsiders' intentions — this has nothing to do with you, does it?"

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. "I hope not, but judging by the look of things, it seems it might be."

Du Wan looked puzzled and stared at Yang Kai for a long moment before advising, "Be careful. It's best to return to the Tianxiao Sect first and speak with your four senior uncles — with them protecting you, there should be no trouble."

"Mm, I'll see to it," Yang Kai replied casually, then hurried off.

After he left, Du Wan slowly shook his head and sighed, "If only I hadn't said anything…"

Mi Na's brows drew into a line. "Elder Du, what's really going on this time? And what does it have to do with Yang Kai?"

"I don't know… I hope he's safe," Du Wan said ruefully; had he known, he would have pressed Ran Jing and Mao Da for more information — if they were taking action, they surely knew something.

……

Leaving the Alchemists' Association, Yang Kai moved like lightning, not toward the Tianxiao Sect but straight for the endless snow mountain.

From what he had heard from Du Wan and his own investigations, Yang Kai had a vague idea of what might unfold here.

He had not expected matters to play out with such drama.

When out of sight of others, his Wind-and-Thunder Wings spread and he plunged into the clouds, his divine sense wrapped around him so no one detected his presence.

Below in the air, cultivators could occasionally be seen braving the biting cold as they flew onward.

Three days later, Yang Kai had penetrated into the snow mountain.

The towering, endless ranges were cloaked in silver — utterly white.

He sent out a quiet probe with his divine sense and soon detected a faint response; grinning, he flew toward that direction.

Half a day later, Yang Kai hid on a snow-white peak and gazed toward a certain direction.

In that direction a large number of cultivators had gathered — at least a few thousand — all recent arrivals transiting through Giant Stone City.

Among those thousands, a peculiar soul fluctuation stood out, subtly connected to Yang Kai in a strange way.

Yang Kai sent some mental messages toward that direction.

Inside a tent nearby, several Divine Roaming Realm cultivators were recuperating. Though they had reached that realm, the biting cold consumed True Yuan rapidly; even they were feeling the strain after a long time.

One young man sitting in meditation suddenly changed expression, snapping his eyes open as his aura became disordered.

Sensing his abnormality, the others opened their eyes and looked at him, seeing his face drained of color as if he had witnessed something terrifying.

"Liu Gui, what's wrong?" someone on the left asked hurriedly.

Liu Gui showed no reaction at first; after a long moment he pulled a mournful face and said, "It's nothing. You all keep recovering; I'm going out for a while."

"Go out now? Tomorrow we'll be scouting the area looking for that person's trail — how can you manage if you don't recover?" someone urged.

Liu Gui gave no answer and was already gone.

The others in the tent slowly shook their heads and stopped paying him any mind.

These men were from the same force and knew one another well. Previously Liu Gui's talent had been mediocre, far below theirs, but over the past two years his strength had suddenly soared until he reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, on par with them.

They had come to this endless snow mountain tens of thousands of li away to search for one person, but the ranges were vast and no one knew where that person might be hidden, or even whether he was truly in the mountains.

Liu Gui traversed the snow, following the voice echoing in his mind until he came to the outside of a spacious tent.

This tent was unlike the others — exquisitely luxurious, glowing with splendor outside. Clearly intricate formations had been set inside, and Spiritual Qi streamed steadily into the tent.

The only disturbing thing was a faint green aura leaking from within, with muffled wails and howls that sent a chill through the bones.

Standing outside the tent, Liu Gui swallowed involuntarily and glanced around furtively. Finding no one's attention on him, he was about to speak when the tent split open and a large hand reached out, seizing him and pulling him inside.

At that moment, Liu Gui's peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivation was powerless to resist; he felt a deathly aura and trembled as fear filled his eyes.

A cackling voice rang in his ears like a death knell. A figure wrapped in green aura gazed at him with cold amusement; those green eyes burned like ghostly flames, their shifting light unnerving anyone who looked.

"Kid, you've got guts — sneaking around my tent!" the green-aura figure laughed, calm and leisurely. "Tell me, how do you want to die? I can help you."

Liu Gui's face went ashen; in a trembling voice he cried, "Lord Wu Jie, spare me! I didn't mean to snoop…"

"Then why were you skulking outside my tent? Acting under orders from your War Soul Hall master Cao Guan?" Wu Jie snorted.

"No, Lord," Liu Gui knelt and hurriedly explained, "I was asked by someone to deliver a message to you."

"Asked by someone? Who?" Wu Jie frowned.

"Well…" Liu Gui hesitated, appearing reluctant to name the person.

Wu Jie sneered, "What message did he ask you to bring me?"

Liu Gui breathed a sigh of relief and hurried out, "He said he wanted to see you. As for his identity, he only said that if I told you the word 'space' you'd know who he was."

The moment those words left his mouth, Wu Jie's face changed. He waved his hand and activated all the sealing formations inside the tent, cutting off any external probing. He narrowed his eyes at Liu Gui and said in a low voice, "How did you get in contact with him?"

Liu Gui offered an awkward laugh. "What can I say?"

"You tell me," Wu Jie said icily.

Liu Gui sighed and, with no choice, told the whole truth.
