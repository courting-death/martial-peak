## Chapter 2165 — My Name Is Xiao Baiyi

“You?” Xiao Baiyi’s eyes turned cold, a sneer curling on his lips. “Such shameless boasting!”

“Brother Xiao Bai…” Yang Kai said earnestly, his tone sincere and persuasive. “Why don’t we find a place to sit down and carefully search this strange place together? Maybe there’s a way out we’ve missed…”

“No. Before you came, I already searched this place thoroughly—between you and me… there is only battle!” Xiao Baiyi cut Yang Kai off before he could finish, his voice cold. “To be frank, with your strength, defeating Xue Yi and seizing his spot was truly unexpected. You do indeed have the qualifications to enter the Four Seasons Land. However, I, Xiao Baiyi, am a disciple of Qingyang Shrine and Senior Brother to Xue Yi. I cannot stand by while he is humiliated. The grudge of that day—I will repay on his behalf today. But rest easy: our cultivation is far apart, and I will not use my full power. Sixty percent is enough to deal with you… and if possible, I won’t kill you.”

As his words fell, Xiao Baiyi gave his long sword a slight shake and turned into a startling arc of light, drifting to a position directly above Yang Kai. The blade flowed like water, cold as ice, exuding a resolute chill as it descended to envelop him. Brilliant sword radiance flared, pouring down like a waterfall.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Since this battle is unavoidable, if I offend you, Brother Xiao Bai, please don’t hold it against me!”

As soon as he spoke, sword light enveloped his position, his body pierced through by the sword’s radiance—yet, strangely, no blood flowed, and that smile remained on his face.

Xiao Baiyi’s expression shifted, Origin Qi bursting forth, his aura surging like a rainbow. A chilling cold radiated from his body, like a raging blizzard. With a reverse swing, his sword suddenly grew enormous, as if it were a sword that could hold up the sky, and he slashed down with a thunderous roar.

On the other side, Yang Kai’s figure appeared like a ghost, but his eyes narrowed, and he was forced to dodge again.

Boom…

The giant sword fell, Spiritual Qi surged. Xiao Baiyi withdrew his sword and stood, turning to gaze into the void, where Yang Kai’s figure appeared.

“You truly are different from the rest. Defeating Xue Yi was no fluke!” Xiao Baiyi said in a deep voice.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Brother Xiao Bai, was that sixty percent of your strength just now? If so, I advise you to use your full power. Otherwise…”

“Relax, that was only thirty percent!” Xiao Baiyi replied proudly.

“Thirty percent, huh…” Yang Kai murmured, then nodded in admiration. “No wonder you’re the elite of Qingyang Shrine. You’re very different from the Dao Origin Realm cultivators I’ve met before!”

“It’s not too late to surrender now!” Xiao Baiyi shouted, running his fingers along his sword. His body spun, suddenly wrapping himself in sword light, transforming into a streak of energy that shot straight for Yang Kai’s chest and abdomen.

The strike was swift, precise, and ruthless. Law Power coiled along the blade, and as its frigid might swept out, thin layers of frost formed across the Platform of Discourse. In an instant, the entire stage seemed to plunge into the depths of midwinter; a bitter gale howled faintly past the ears, chilling the heart of any who faced it.

“Ice Law!” Yang Kai shouted, feeling the Law Power invading and affecting him. The surrounding space seemed to freeze, forcing him to roar. Multicolored light burst from his body, dispelling all discomfort. With a flick of his wrist, the Myriad Sword appeared.

He swung his sword and chanted, “A million swords unleashed, one man guards the pass!”

Sword light crisscrossed. Tens of thousands of sword energies clashed and danced, like a torrential downpour, meeting Xiao Baiyi’s attack head-on.

“Again the Imperial Treasure!”

From within the sword light, Xiao Baiyi’s cold snort could be heard, but he didn’t dodge at all. Instead, he urged his sword light forward, his aura surging as he charged in.

A razor-edged hiss split the air.

The astonishing sword light severed all the Myriad Sword’s radiance, its momentum undiminished as it pressed toward Yang Kai.

Whoosh…

Xiao Baiyi’s figure suddenly appeared, his gaze sharp as a blade, his entire body radiating a shocking aura as he slashed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled and raised his sword to block.

With a clang, an unmatched force rippled out, and the space above the Platform of Discourse was sliced into countless cracks by the stray sword energies, vanishing in a flash.

Xiao Baiyi paused for a moment, but quickly shook off the influence of the Imperial Treasure, turning into a blur as his sword struck at Yang Kai from all directions.

He still had energy to taunt: “Imperial Treasure may be strong, but with your strength, how much power can you really unleash? Xue Yi only lost to you because he was careless!”

Yang Kai moved like a swimming dragon, wielding the Myriad Sword, constantly blocking attacks from all sides. He smiled, “Brother Xiao Bai, you seem to have a lot of opinions about this sword!”

As they spoke, their hands never stopped moving. The constant clangs rang out like a musical score, pleasing to the ear…

“Hmph, relying on the might of a Secret Treasure is still a skill of sorts!”

“Since you say so… I’ll switch swords!” As soon as Yang Kai finished, the Myriad Sword vanished, replaced by another Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level sword.

Xiao Baiyi frowned, leaping out of the battle circle, and said in a low voice, “Changing weapons mid-battle, what’s the meaning of this…”

“No special meaning.” Yang Kai tilted his head at him. “I just don’t want you to say I only won because I relied on the Imperial Treasure!”

“Looking down on me?” Xiao Baiyi’s anger flared, his white robes fluttering without wind as he slowly floated into the air. He said coldly, “If you switch back now, I’ll pretend I didn’t see it. Otherwise, you’ll regret it!”

As he spoke, his sword pointed skyward, and suddenly a blizzard appeared in the sky. At first, it wasn’t too fierce, but in the blink of an eye, it surged with world-destroying force, enveloping Xiao Baiyi completely.

A chilling voice came from within the blizzard as Xiao Baiyi chanted, “This is my sixty percent strength. If you can’t withstand it, you’ll die. I advise you to dodge!”

With that, he shouted, “Man and sword, annihilate!”

The blizzard suddenly transformed into an ice dragon, its eyes as big as bronze gongs, charging down at Yang Kai with unstoppable force.

Yang Kai finally put away his playful expression, his face solemn as he stared at the incoming killing move, feeling the power within. He said in a deep voice, “No wonder you’re Qingyang Shrine’s second in the sect’s martial demonstration, Brother Xiao Bai, you truly deserve your reputation. Even at sixty percent strength, you have such might. If you went all out…”

Though he praised with his mouth, his hands didn’t stop. His sword vibrated, humming, and Yang Kai’s expression grew serious as he chanted, “Three Thousand Sword Dao, Liu Yan burns like fire!”

In an instant, his sword turned crimson, and from its blade, a fire bird shot out, its form identical to Liu Yan’s true body. With a long cry, the two ultimate moves collided in midair.

Boom boom boom…

The ice dragon dissipated, the fire vanished.

Xiao Baiyi was knocked back, shouting in a low voice, “How is this possible?”

His eyes widened in shock as he fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, his voice turning cold: “What ties do you have to Lord Chen Wenhao of Tianwu Sacred Land?”

As an elite disciple of Qingyang Shrine, he naturally knew of Chen Wenhao. This Three Thousand Sword Dao was clearly the sword intent Chen Wenhao had comprehended, and now Yang Kai was using it.

Though it was somewhat different from the rumors, it seemed quite powerful.

“No relationship!” Yang Kai twirled his sword carelessly. “I just fought him once, saw him use this Three Thousand Sword Dao, thought it was pretty good, so I borrowed it.”

Yang Kai was telling the truth…

That day, when he was invaded by demonic thoughts, he did fight Chen Wenhao, and also Gao Xueting and Feng Ming. The three Emperor Realm experts unleashed their ultimate moves, which Yang Kai remembered well and gained some insight from.

But the Three Thousand Sword Dao he used now was only superficially similar to Chen Wenhao’s own comprehension—completely different in essence. Yang Kai was just channeling the fire sword energy from the Undying Five Elements Sword, shaping it into Liu Yan’s form.

The ultimate moves of Emperor Realm experts are not so easily understood. Their mysteries and wonders can only be grasped and performed by those in the Emperor Realm.

Still, it was more than enough for the current situation. Xiao Baiyi had only heard of the Three Thousand Sword Dao, never seen it in person, so how could he tell real from fake?

“Enough!” Xiao Baiyi shouted angrily, looking truly furious. “There’s a limit to your nonsense! Who would believe your wild words? Whether you have anything to do with Lord Chen Wenhao or not, today’s outcome won’t change!”

His aura suddenly surged. Apparently, he realized sixty percent strength wasn’t enough to defeat Yang Kai, so he was about to use even more power.

Shhh shhh shhh…

Lightning suddenly crackled, arcs of electricity flashing wildly over Xiao Baiyi’s body. The entire Platform of Discourse instantly turned into a sea of thunder and lightning, looking terrifying.

“You’ve mastered the Ice Law, and you can use thunder techniques too?” Yang Kai was amazed, full of praise. “Brother Xiao Bai, you truly are extraordinary. Given time, you might have a place among the rulers of the Star Realm!”

“Flattery won’t work! Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai… you sure like calling me that. Take this—Earth Sword… Falling Thunder!”

His sword pointed, thunder roared, and bolts of lightning crashed down, completely engulfing Yang Kai. The power of Falling Thunder was fierce and wild, seemingly able to seal off even space itself.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred, and he shouted, “So that’s it… it’s because you don’t like being called Brother Xiao Bai!”

As soon as he finished, Yang Kai was swallowed by the sea of lightning, and the air was filled with the smell of scorched flesh.

Xiao Baiyi’s eyes flickered as he stared below, frowning. “Remember, my name is Xiao Baiyi!”

“I just thought… calling you Brother Xiao Bai felt friendly, that’s all. No need to get so angry, Brother Xiao!” Yang Kai’s voice came from below, full of energy, as if he wasn’t hurt at all.

Xiao Baiyi’s eyes widened instantly, staring in shock at the scene below.

In the sea of lightning, Yang Kai’s body seemed to undergo a huge transformation. Multicolored light burst from his skin, the power of the five elements cycling endlessly, forming a strong defense against the lightning. If that were all, it would be nothing, but now both his hands were covered in fine scales, turning into dragon claws.

On his cheeks, forehead, and all exposed skin, those scales radiated a shocking aura.
