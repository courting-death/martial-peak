## Chapter 278 — Enemies Meet on a Narrow Road, Grudges Unresolved

A whole day passed, and Aunt Xiang was busy in front of the furnace, occasionally tossing in herbs into the medicinal soup. It was only by evening that she finally breathed a sigh of relief, her body glistening with sweat, and informed Yang Kai that he could come out after absorbing the medicinal power. With that, she left the room to rest.

Yang Kai soaked in the medicinal soup for an entire night, absorbing every drop of its medicinal essence.

Returning to his own room, he closed his eyes and sat in meditation, feeling the changes in his body.

His Realm had improved slightly, and the True Yuan within him had also become purer. The most significant improvement was in his meridians and flesh.

Aunt Xiang had mentioned during the day that the primary function of that batch of medicinal soup was to fundamentally improve a person's meridians, making it easier for them to refine Yuan Qi in the future, allowing it to become more solid and pure.

While this benefit might not be immediately apparent, it was enough to influence a lifetime.

Attempting to operate the True Yang Technique, Yang Kai was astonished to find that the speed of its operation was noticeably swifter than before, and the natural energy absorbed into his body was indeed a bit purer than usual.

This change was subtle, but as the saying goes, "dripping water penetrates stone," and over the years, such accumulation would surely yield remarkable results.

With just a batch of medicinal soup and a set of miraculous techniques, Xiao Fusheng's methods were indeed extraordinary.

His combat strength might not rank highly in the world, but he was one of the few Upper-Level Mystery-Grade alchemists, having reached the pinnacle of alchemical mastery. The various miraculous techniques gleaned from alchemy could be said to be a testament to his profound understanding.

At dawn, Xiao Fusheng called for Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan.

He did not impart alchemical techniques but instead passed down a method for controlling Yuan Qi.

This was closely related to alchemy, as an alchemist needed to master the control of their own Yuan Qi to perfection when refining pills. It was said that a slight deviation could lead to great errors. To refine a good pill, the subtle manipulation of Yuan Qi was essential.

This method of controlling Yuan Qi was also highly relevant to any martial artist. In battle, the execution of martial techniques was tied to the manipulation of Yuan Qi.

Every strong practitioner would meticulously calculate their Yuan Qi usage. If they could release a martial technique with a portion of their Yuan Qi, they would never waste even half of it! Such meticulousness allowed Yuan Qi to achieve maximum efficacy, enabling a martial artist to sustain their combat for the longest duration.

Thus, both Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan studied diligently.

This set of techniques was something Xiao Fusheng had developed through his own exploration during alchemy, and it could be considered one of his most precious experiences, shared without reservation.

This instruction took several days. After intermittent learning, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan became thoroughly familiar with the methods; they just needed practical application.

At this point, Yang Kai suddenly recalled another phrase Xiao Fusheng had mentioned.

Who said that alchemy could not lead one to the pinnacle of martial arts?

When Elder Xiao said this, his face was filled with profound confidence.

Just mastering the manipulation of Yuan Qi to its utmost could potentially unveil the secrets of the peak.

Yang Kai felt a surge of respect! Every word Elder Xiao spoke held great significance, worthy of deep contemplation, each word a gem.

In the following days, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan practiced the exquisite control of Yuan Qi. As time passed, Yang Kai discovered that this practice not only allowed him to better control each portion of Yuan Qi but also gradually refined his True Yuan in an imperceptible manner.

The True Yuan Realm had reached the peak of its second layer, and he was just a step away from breaking through to the third layer.

One day, while Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan were outside practicing their martial techniques and controlling Yuan Qi, they suddenly noticed that the surrounding peaks were bustling with activity. Many people were walking along the rugged mountain paths, among them were several disciples from Yao Wang Valley, as well as many outsiders.

“What’s going on?” Dong Qingyan paused, curiously looking around the peaks. “Why are there so many outsiders at Yao Wang Valley?”

Yang Kai shook his head, indicating he did not know.

“The alchemy conference is about to begin in a few days,” Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan strolled over, gently explaining.

“Although Yao Wang Valley usually does not allow outsiders to enter, it is, after all, connected to various major forces in the world. So at this time, many people come to visit the elders of the various peaks.”

Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan suddenly realized that since entering Hidden Cloud Peak, they had been carefree and secluded, living their days so quickly that they had not noticed the signs of the upcoming alchemy conference.

Aunt Xiang chuckled lightly, “All the peaks are lively, except for the forbidden area of Dan Sheng Peak and our Hidden Cloud Peak!”

“Indeed, it’s still peaceful here!” Aunt Lan also smiled slightly.

Dong Qingyan giggled, “If Master were to open the mountain gate, those people would surely flock here! I’m afraid the peaks would soon be quiet again.”

Aunt Xiang shot her a glance, “Then Aunt Lan and I would be exhausted, serving so many visitors with tea and water; how could we manage?”

During this time together, Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan had grown quite fond of Dong Qingyan. Both beautiful women had no children of their own and regarded Dong Qingyan as their daughter, caring for her deeply.

The little girl had a sweet tongue and did not look down on them because they were ordinary people and maids, which endeared her to them.

As soon as Aunt Xiang's words fell, Xiao Fusheng's door suddenly swung open, and a hearty laugh rang out, “It seems that our Hidden Cloud Peak cannot be peaceful today!”

“Master!”

“Elder Xiao!”

Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan hurriedly bowed. They saw Xiao Fusheng emerge from his room, his face beaming, walking with the grace of a dragon and the might of a tiger.

“Master, what’s the occasion that brings you such joy?” Dong Qingyan stepped forward and asked sweetly, while Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. His cousin was quirky in front of him but utterly obedient in front of Xiao Fusheng and Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan.

“Friends have come from afar, so of course I’m happy,” Xiao Fusheng laughed heartily.

Dong Qingyan's eyes twinkled, “I thought you didn’t like visitors, Master. It turns out that’s not the case.”

Xiao Fusheng chuckled, “That depends on who it is. If they come to ask me for favors, I naturally do not welcome them, but the one who is about to arrive is different.”

“Haha… Elder Xiao, I too have come to ask you for a favor. Are you going to drive me away?” A loud laugh echoed, and a figure swiftly approached from down the mountain path.

Hearing this voice, Yang Kai's brows furrowed, and his expression suddenly became strange.

This voice… how could it be…

Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan were astonished to hear someone dare to address Elder Xiao so casually. They clearly did not know who the visitor was.

In the world, even the heads of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu would respectfully call him Master Xiao!

No one dared to be so presumptuous as to call him Elder Xiao!

Yet, upon hearing this title, Elder Xiao not only did not get angry but instead joked, “How could I dare to drive you away? I still owe you a life!”

With just a few words, Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan suddenly realized that the visitor was actually a life-saving benefactor of Elder Xiao. They immediately straightened their expressions and welcomed him respectfully.

The figure below swayed slightly, and the person who had been hundreds of zhang away suddenly appeared before everyone.

And it was not just one person who came, but two.

The first was an old man of similar age to Elder Xiao, his face wrinkled but with a warm smile. Following him was a striking young woman, her eyes sparkling like stars, dressed in a light green dress. A sky-blue gem adorned her smooth forehead, and the sheer fabric made it difficult to see her features.

As the wind blew, it stirred her veil and dress, making her appear ethereal, untainted by dust.

Yang Kai's expression changed, and a strange smile crept onto his lips as he stared at the veiled woman.

The woman felt the aggressive and unrestrained gaze upon her and could not help but furrow her brows slightly, casting a faint glance at Yang Kai.

In an instant, her star-like eyes flashed with intense surprise, and her densely fringed eyelashes fluttered slightly as she blinked in disbelief.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai smiled slightly, causing the woman's eyes to curve into crescent moons.

This woman was none other than Xia Ningshang, and the old man who had come first was actually Meng Wuya.

“Meng brother, it’s been a long time!” Elder Xiao stepped forward, cupping his hands in greeting.

Meng Wuya beamed, quickly returning the gesture, “Elder… uh… cough, cough, cough…”

He had only managed to utter one word when it seemed he was suddenly choked, coughing loudly until he felt dizzy, his ears ringing, and his consciousness blurred.

“Master!” Xia Ningshang was startled and quickly patted Meng Wuya's back.

“Brother Meng, are you injured?” Xiao Fusheng's expression turned serious, and he hurried forward to check Meng Wuya's pulse.

Meng Wuya quickly waved his hand, coughing for a long time before finally catching his breath, his expression one of disbelief as he stared at Yang Kai, unable to help but laugh and cry, “You little brat, what are you doing here?”

Damn! What a narrow road for enemies, and the grudges refuse to dissipate.

More than a year ago, this brat had been sent by Ling Taixu to undergo training in Ghostly Underworld Mountain. They had not seen each other for over a year. Although at first, his precious disciple had been listless and sighing all day, with time and his earnest teachings, his disciple had finally emerged from the shadow of longing, growing stronger and progressing rapidly.

Meng Wuya had thought that his disciple would have forgotten Yang Kai by now, but unexpectedly, they met again in this broken place.

Seeing the deep feelings in his precious disciple's eyes, Meng Wuya could not help but realize that she had not forgotten Yang Kai at all; she had merely buried that longing deep within her heart.

Perhaps, in solitude, she would take it out to reminisce and relieve her yearning.

At this moment, Meng Wuya understood what it meant for love to be like fine wine, the longer it was hidden, the richer it became!

At this moment, Meng Wuya wanted to turn around and leave, but it was clearly too late.

At this moment, Meng Wuya wished he could slap himself a dozen times!

He had noticed that Xia Ningshang had been somewhat downcast lately, and with the alchemy conference being held at Yao Wang Valley, he had specially brought her out to relax. He never expected to run into this brat here!

Damn it, I told you to mind your own business! Meng Wuya felt like he wanted to hang himself.
