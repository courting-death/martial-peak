## Chapter 2592 — Total Annihilation

The Elder’s hopeful gaze swept over Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou, but to his disappointment, all three wore indifferent expressions, showing no intention of intervening.

“He’s just a single human. Why must you all trouble him?” the Elder asked angrily.

The other three Saint Venerables remained silent. Shi Huo snorted coldly, “Elder, don’t be stubborn. This Lord and your Stone Spirit Race share some history. If not for that, after today, your only option would be extermination. This Lord is already showing mercy, so don’t push your luck!”

The Elder was about to say more, but Yang Kai suddenly spoke, “Elder, agree to his terms. Don’t worry about me.”

The Elder growled, “This matter was caused by our tribe, dragging you into it. If we withdraw now, what face would our tribe have left in this world?”

Xiaoxiao kept shaking his head beside them, clearly unwilling to let the Elder abandon Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly and said in a low voice, “If I were alone, I’d have left long ago. But it’s not too late now. Take care, I’ll go ahead!”

As he spoke, he urged his Power of Space, and his whole body vanished mysteriously from sight.

Since it was clear the Four Great Saint Venerables only wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Race, not wipe them out, Yang Kai felt relieved. In this situation, the Stone Spirit Race definitely couldn’t escape, so he could only try to protect himself. He didn’t even have time to retrieve his Incarnation into the Small Xuan Realm.

Still, the Incarnation was a Stone Spirit. Mixed among the Stone Spirits, it shouldn’t be in any danger. Once he escaped, he could figure out how to retrieve the Incarnation later, or even find a chance to lead the Stone Spirit Race far away from this place of trouble.

This bizarre scene left Shi Huo, who was staring at Yang Kai, momentarily stunned, clearly not understanding what had just happened.

Fan Wu’s eyes flashed with a sharp light, exclaiming in shock, “Spatial Divine Ability!”

As he spoke, his figure spun suddenly, facing a direction, and pointed with two fingers toward the void!

A muffled groan sounded, and a figure appeared like a ghost in that direction—it was Yang Kai, who had just vanished. At this moment, Yang Kai wore a look of disbelief, staring in shock toward Fan Wu.

He hadn’t expected this Divine Spirit to be able to pull him out of the void.

Their eyes met for just a moment. Fan Wu’s face remained calm, betraying no emotion. Yang Kai gritted his teeth and once again used his teleportation secret technique, his figure turning into nothingness and disappearing.

Luan Feng glanced around with her beautiful eyes, then suddenly opened her mouth. A jet-black flame shot out, like a lively black snake, vanishing into the void.

Moments later, accompanied by a strange cry, Yang Kai appeared in a sorry state, with the World-Ending Black Flame chasing him, clinging to him like a maggot to a bone, impossible to shake off.

Cang Gou sneered, “This kid’s spatial abilities are decent, but he’s still a bit lacking.”

Fan Wu said blandly, “If he grows a bit more, he’ll be able to come and go freely before us. Then no one could stop him. Spatial abilities truly are wondrous.”

Clang...

A bell rang out—at the critical moment, Yang Kai summoned the Mountain and River Bell to block the World-Ending Black Flame’s attack. The bell’s sound rang, and the flame capable of burning all things suddenly extinguished.

Hovering in midair, Yang Kai’s face darkened as he gritted his teeth and said, “The esteemed Lords join forces against me. Truly, I am honored.”

Anyone could hear the mockery in his words, but neither Fan Wu nor Luan Feng showed the slightest hint of shame. Fan Wu replied calmly, “Extraordinary people require extraordinary measures. There’s no need for you to be so sarcastic.”

Yang Kai sneered, but his heart sank.

He hadn’t expected that, before these Divine Spirits, his teleportation technique would be useless. His last escape route was cut off—today, his prospects were grim.

“Human brat, this Lord doesn’t wish to bully the weak, but if you want to live, it’s not impossible. Abandon your cultivation, leave behind the Mountain and River Bell, and you can leave the Ancient Land.” Shi Huo glared at Yang Kai, his gaze sweeping greedily over the bell.

The Elder was furious, “Lord, forcing him to abandon his cultivation is no different from killing him!”

Shi Huo turned, his voice cold, “Elder, don’t test this Lord’s patience. I’ve been tolerant enough. If you keep being stubborn, I’ll have to teach you a lesson.”

The Elder said solemnly, “He is our tribe’s guest. Today’s events are our fault for implicating him. If you have grievances, take them out on us!”

Shi Huo grinned viciously, nodding, “Fine, since you’re so stubborn, this Lord will oblige you.”

As he finished, he roared, transforming like the Stone Spirit Race into a five zhang tall Stone Giant. But Shi Huo’s Stone Giant form looked far more ferocious than the Stone Spirit Race’s, his whole body wreathed in dark flames similar to Luan Feng’s World-Ending Black Flame. Sharp stone spikes jutted from his body, exuding a violent, sinister aura that made people uncomfortable, as if it suppressed their spirits.

Revealing his true form, Shi Huo sneered and beckoned to the Elder, “Come on, let me show you what a difference in strength means.”

The words were deeply insulting. The Stone Spirit Race were all top experts, born fighters. Faced with Shi Huo’s provocation, they couldn’t hold back. Without waiting for the Elder’s command, they roared and charged forward.

Even if the Elder wanted to stop them, he was powerless now and could only grit his teeth and join the fray.

In an instant, twelve massive Stone Giants tangled together, like twelve mountains colliding. Fists flew, blows exchanged, shattering the sky and overturning the world.

All the Yao Kings watched, their eyes trembling. Such a pure contest of strength was rare. They had just fought the Stone Spirit Race themselves and knew how tough these Stone Giants were. Yet Shi Huo was now fighting the whole tribe alone, making the scene even more shocking.

“Hahaha!” Shi Huo laughed arrogantly, the dark flames on his body burning fiercer, wrapping around his fists and seemingly granting him endless power.

As fists flew, the Stone Spirit Race cried out in pain, unable to get close. Even when they managed to attack, Shi Huo’s sharp spikes left them helpless.

Boom...

Amid the chaos, a Stone Spirit was sent flying by Shi Huo, crashing to the ground and leaving a huge crater.

Before the Stone Spirit could climb out, Fan Wu raised a hand and struck him with a seal, hitting his body.

The struggling Stone Spirit staggered and knelt, unable to stand.

“Take him!” Fan Wu snorted.

Immediately, several Yao Kings pounced, surrounding the Stone Spirit. Each revealed their true form, restraining him in place.

“Roar!” The Stone Spirit was unwilling, but after being sealed by Fan Wu, most of his strength was suppressed. With several Yao Kings holding him down, he couldn’t move.

He could only kneel, looking up at the sky, his face full of unwillingness.

Boom...

Another Stone Spirit was sent flying, creating another huge crater. Fan Wu repeated his actions, and several Yao Kings pounced to subdue the Stone Spirit.

Boom boom boom...

One Stone Spirit after another was sent flying. The tribe fought Shi Huo, but the battle was one-sided, leaving the Yao Kings dazzled and excited.

Of the four Divine Spirits present, only Shi Huo could defeat the Stone Spirit Race so directly. The others—Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou—didn’t have this ability. It wasn’t that their strength was less; in fact, Luan Feng was the strongest, Fan Wu second, and Cang Gou and Shi Huo were about equal.

However, Shi Huo was a stone yao. Like the Stone Spirit Race, he was born with immense strength and a body tough as iron, but he possessed two distinct advantages: the aid of his yao flames and a body covered in razor-sharp spikes. These gave him a decisive edge over the Stone Spirits.

In pure strength, Divine Spirit Shi Huo was about equal to the Stone Spirit Race.

But in overall power, Shi Huo left the Stone Spirit Race far behind.

The difference was obvious. Even with the whole tribe fighting, they weren’t Shi Huo’s match.

Ten Stone Spirits with the Incarnation lasted less than half a tea’s time before being completely defeated, all sealed by Fan Wu and controlled by the Yao Kings.

Each Stone Spirit kept growling, their faces full of humiliation.

Shi Huo stood alone between heaven and earth, his gaze arrogant and cold as he looked at Yang Kai.

In the previous battle, Yang Kai hadn’t intervened—not because he didn’t want to, but because he couldn’t. Fan Wu’s Divine Sense had locked onto him, leaving him unable to move.

“Brat, this Lord gave you a chance. Since you won’t abandon your cultivation, I’ll send you on your way!” As Shi Huo finished, he punched at Yang Kai from afar.

Yang Kai’s face changed. He slapped the Mountain and River Bell before him, and the primordial treasure instantly grew to man-height, blocking him. The bell rang, sending a shockwave toward Shi Huo’s fist.

Shi Huo sneered, “If you wielded this bell at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, perhaps even I would have to think twice. But unfortunately… you’re only at the First Stage. How much of the bell’s true power can you actually unleash?”

Shi Huo didn’t dodge or evade—he simply threw his fist straight at the shockwave, smashing down with overwhelming force.

Crack...

The shockwave visibly shattered, but Shi Huo’s fist, though slowed, still struck the Mountain and River Bell.

Another bell rang. Shi Huo’s massive body shook and retreated a few steps.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, was shaken by the tremendous force—his chest churned with turbulent qi and blood. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood as his body was sent flying backward through the air.

“Primordial treasure, truly worthy of its name!” Shi Huo was delighted, swallowing as he stared greedily at the Mountain and River Bell flying with Yang Kai.

A mere First Stage Emperor could block his attack with the Mountain and River Bell. If he could claim this treasure, he’d even dare to challenge the Dragon Clan.
