## Chapter 2446 — Mountain and River Bell

"I'm not interested in what your name is, and you don't need to try to get close to me!" Lan He said coldly.

She had a terrible impression of Yang Kai. After all, he had snatched things from her twice already. It would be strange if she thought well of him. So, from the bottom of her heart, she didn't want to have anything to do with Yang Kai, lest he really jinx her and snatch her treasures at every turn. Besides, seeing how he was hiding his face and acting so secretive, it was obvious he had provoked some powerful enemy and didn't dare show his true face. For him to come talk to her at this moment, he probably wanted to drag her into his mess.

Naturally, Lan He wanted to keep her distance from someone like that.

Yang Kai grinned and said, "A meeting is fate, Miss Lan He, there's no need to be so cold."

"Who's fated with you? Get lost!" Lan He couldn't help but snap when she saw how Yang Kai kept chattering on.

"Alright, alright!" Yang Kai, seeing he was unwelcome, didn't pester her further and simply stood to the side, quietly observing.

Speaking of which, although Lan He had a bit of a temper, she seemed to be a decent person. After all, Yang Kai had snatched things from her twice, and though Lan He had never managed to snatch anything from him, she hadn't made a scene about it either.

If it had been another cultivator, they might have tried to snatch things back from Yang Kai even after he succeeded.

There were only a few Star Seals, but dozens of cultivators had been drawn here by the commotion, so those few Star Seals were quickly claimed.

Yang Kai noticed that Yin Lesheng had indeed snatched one of the Star Seals and landed about two hundred zhang away from him. Beside Yin Lesheng were three other disciples of the Netherworld Sect, their auras gloomy and cold, clearly having cultivated the sect's special techniques.

No one dared approach them. It was probably because everyone felt uncomfortable with the sinister aura they exuded.

Just as Yang Kai was secretly observing Yin Lesheng, the latter seemed to sense something and suddenly turned to look in Yang Kai's direction, his gaze icy cold.

Yang Kai quickly averted his eyes, his heart slightly startled.

Back when he first met this guy in the Starlight Passage, Yang Kai had known he was the top expert of the Great Wilderness Star Domain—not only a Star Lord, but also exceptionally talented. Now, seeing him again, Yin Lesheng had indeed soared to new heights, his cultivation advancing just as quickly as Yang Kai's own.

Back then, Yin Lesheng had suffered a huge loss in the Starlight Passage and bore a deep grudge against Yang Kai. If Xiaoxiao really fell into his hands, who knows what torment he might suffer. Yang Kai had to find out Xiaoxiao's whereabouts from him as soon as possible.

As Yang Kai was lost in thought, whispers began to spread around him.

The gathered cultivators were all pointing at the bell-shaped mountain ahead, speculating about the origins of this Imperial Treasure. Unfortunately, the great battle in the Shattered Star Sea had happened tens of thousands of years ago, and the current generation knew little about it. No one knew what this secret treasure truly was, or who had left it behind.

Yang Kai glanced around, but to his disappointment, he didn't spot a single familiar face. None of the elites from the Southern Territory were here; he had no idea where they'd gone.

The Shattered Star Sea was vast, with countless opportunities. About ten thousand cultivators had entered, but those who made it here were just a drop in the ocean. Not seeing the Southern Territory's elites was perfectly normal.

"Brother Qi Hai, among everyone here, you are the most learned and well-read. If possible, could you tell us about this Imperial Treasure?" someone suddenly called out, their voice echoing far and wide.

Everyone turned to look at him.

That person wore a gentle smile, quietly gazing at another scholar-like man not far away.

Following his gaze, everyone looked toward the scholar as well.

The scholar's face was gloomy. Clearly, he didn't want to stand out in front of so many people. Even if he knew something about the Imperial Treasure, he wouldn't want to share it here.

But the man who'd spoken had deliberately raised his voice, so now everyone was looking at the scholar expectantly. If he didn't speak, it would seem like he was hiding his knowledge, which could offend people. With so many experts watching, he had no choice but to say something.

Everyone here was shrewd. They could tell that the scholar and the man who'd called out weren't on good terms. If they were friends, the man wouldn't have put the scholar on the spot like this.

Still, though everyone understood, no one blamed the speaker. Instead, they all looked eagerly at the scholar, wanting to hear his opinion.

Under so many watchful eyes, the scholar could only glare resentfully at the man who'd spoken first and say, "I don't dare claim to be learned or well-read. I just happened to read a few more books in my spare time—hardly worthy of such praise."

The man smiled and said, "Brother Qi Hai, you're too modest. Compared to you, my knowledge is like a firefly's light next to the bright moon. Please, enlighten us!"

As soon as he finished, a burly man with a fierce expression suddenly interjected, "So what exactly is this Imperial Treasure, and why is it so powerful?"

"Yes, yes, Brother Qi, if you know, why not tell us? We're all very curious."

"Go on, tell us."

Qi Hai took a deep breath, finding it hard to back down. After a moment's thought, he finally said, "The Shattered Star Sea is the battlefield of the Great Emperors. I think everyone here knows that much."

Many people nodded lightly.

"Back then, although the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor's cultivation was unmatched and his means were peerless, he was too willful and slaughtered recklessly. In the end, he provoked the wrath of heaven and man. The Great Emperors joined forces to fight him here, shattering an entire Star Domain and creating the Shattered Star Sea. It's said that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was killed by the combined might of the Great Emperors, but the price was steep. Of all the experts who joined the siege, none escaped unscathed—many died or were gravely wounded. It's said that Great Emperor Tianshu is still healing in the Valley of Destiny, in seclusion to this day!"

Everyone gasped in shock.

Yang Kai was also stunned. He didn't know if Qi Hai's story was true, but he had heard of Great Emperor Tianshu—one of the current Ten Great Emperors.

This Great Emperor was a particularly unique figure among the Ten, for legend had it he could divine destiny, see the future, and peer into the past.

Before the opening of the Four Seasons Land, Great Emperor Tianshu had even sent word to the Qingyang Shrine, informing all the major sects of the Southern Territory that Star Seals would appear in the Four Seasons Land.

If Qi Hai was telling the truth, then Great Emperor Tianshu had been healing for tens of thousands of years. It was hard to imagine how severe his injuries must have been during the siege of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Still, to survive for tens of thousands of years while wounded—Great Emperor Tianshu was truly remarkable.

"And in that battle, four Great Emperors died!" Qi Hai said solemnly.

"Which four?" someone asked urgently.

Qi Hai recited them as easily as counting his own treasures: “The Green Lotus Great Emperor, the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor, the Vast Sea Great Emperor, and the Martial Flame Great Emperor—four in all!”

Most people had never heard of these names, so everyone listened intently. Yang Kai was the same. He had heard of the Green Lotus Great Emperor a few days ago—Sister Hua had mentioned that someone had obtained his Immortal Green Lotus in the Shattered Star Sea five thousand years ago, and later founded the Green Lotus Palace in the Eastern Territory, which was now one of the top sects there.

"These four perished here. Their life-bound Imperial Treasures, spatial rings, and other treasures—even their legacies—all ended up scattered throughout the Shattered Star Sea. Among them were the Immortal Green Lotus of the Green Lotus Great Emperor, the Mountain and River Bell of the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor, the Reverse Vast Sea of the Vast Sea Great Emperor, and the True Phoenix Fire of the Martial Flame Great Emperor. Any one of these is a peerless treasure." Qi Hai paused, then continued, "The Immortal Green Lotus has already been claimed. You all must have heard of the Green Lotus Palace in the Eastern Territory—the palace master is the current owner of the Immortal Green Lotus. As for the treasures of the other three Great Emperors, none have been found to this day."

At this, his gaze shifted to the bell-shaped mountain and he said in a deep voice, "The Imperial Treasure before you should be the Mountain and River Bell of the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor. The Mountain and River Bell—its chime can suppress mountains and rivers, and its Imperial Aura can reverse the heavens!"

Gulp...

The sound of swallowing echoed one after another. Everyone's eyes turned fiery with greed and desire as they stared at the mountain ahead.

"What proof do you have?" a skeptical voice suddenly called out.

Yang Kai turned to see that it was Yin Lesheng who had spoken. Though he looked excited, he kept his composure and asked Qi Hai warily, "You say it's the Mountain and River Bell of the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor—what proof do you have?"

Qi Hai sneered, "I say it is, so it is. You can believe it or not!"

Forced to reveal such a closely guarded secret in front of so many people, Qi Hai was already feeling quite disgruntled. Now, to have his words questioned on top of that, he couldn't help but feel like he'd offered his goodwill only to be met with cold indifference. His tone instantly turned frosty.

"Since Brother Qi Hai says so, of course we believe him! Some people just doubt everything but can't prove anything themselves. Brother Qi Hai, you don't need to pay them any mind!" a handsome young man suddenly smiled flatteringly at Qi Hai, belittling Yin Lesheng.

Yin Lesheng's gaze turned icy as he stared intently at the young man, as if looking at a dead man—clearly, he had taken note of him.

The young man, oblivious, continued to smile and asked Qi Hai, "Brother Qi Hai, since this is the Mountain and River Bell of the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor, how should we go about claiming it? Please, give us some guidance!"

Everyone focused their attention on him, full of anticipation.

Qi Hai snorted, "If I knew how to claim it, would I still be standing here talking to you?"

The young man looked embarrassed. He knew his question was a bit foolish, but he still couldn't help hoping for an answer.
