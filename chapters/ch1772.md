## Chapter 1772 — Not a Secret

Moreover, the Ghost Ancestor's strength was immense; even Ni Guang had been extremely wary of him. Cultivating a good relationship with him was no bad thing — one might need his assistance at some point in the future.

"Hm, there is a place that requires your power to enter," the Ghost Ancestor mused. "With only this old man I truly dare not rush in. Fine, come with me."

The Ghost Ancestor was a straightforward man; after speaking he immediately took the lead.

Yang Kai reached back to support Xue Yue on his back, making her lie more comfortably, and hurried to follow.

Along the way, after some idle chat, Yang Kai learned that the Ghost Ancestor had already intended to shadow him from the moment he had first seen him before entering the Lost Realm — after all, the Lost Realm contained many spatial rifts, and only those proficient in spatial power could traverse it unharmed.

And the Ghost Ancestor just happened to know that Yang Kai had considerable talent in spatial force.

The Ghost Ancestor's original plan had been to find a chance to spirit Yang Kai away from Ni Guang and Luo Lan, then take him to explore the Lost Realm together; but after entering he had not immediately found Yang Kai, only vaguely ascertaining Yang Kai's direction of travel, so he had kept trailing behind.

But later an accident occurred and he lost Yang Kai's trail.

Not until just now had Yang Kai suddenly burst from a void rift and appeared before him.

"It seems Elder and I are rather fated," Yang Kai said with a laugh after hearing his explanation.

There were countless connections between void rifts and the Lost Realm; what were the odds? An injured Jingkong Beast fled and happened to appear before the Ghost Ancestor — such a coincidence was almost impossible.

"I was also surprised; I thought I could no longer count on you," the Ghost Ancestor said, wrapping himself in black qi again so that his features could not be seen. From his tone, however, it was clear this chance meeting was a pleasant surprise to him.

"By the way, Elder, where are you taking me?"

"A Medicine Valley!" the Ghost Ancestor called as he ran ahead without looking back. "When I passed by before I saw many rare spiritual medicines, but that damned place was riddled with spatial rifts. I did not dare to press in; I only gathered a few Wudao Flowers before having to withdraw."

"Wudao Flowers!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

Wudao Flowers — those were Origin-Grade, Middle-Level spiritual medicines! And they seemed scarcely to be found anywhere in the Star Domain, for the current laws of heaven and earth did not favor the growth of such ancient spiritual herbs; only in the environments of the ancient age could Wudao Flowers survive.

And the Lost Realm almost everywhere harbored a trace of ancient aura, so the presence of Wudao Flowers was not surprising.

Such ancient spiritual herbs—whether used to refine Wudao Pills or taken directly—could greatly aid a Void King Realm warrior in strengthening both power and state of mind!

No wonder even someone of the Ghost Ancestor's cultivation yearned for that place; it turned out he had obtained a few Wudao Flowers there.

"Yes, besides Wudao Flowers there were many other good things. Some of them I could not even recognize, but that place was absolutely a paradise for Void King Realm warriors! If I could gain enough benefit there, I would be confident of pushing for the Third Stage of the Void King Realm in my lifetime!" The Ghost Ancestor's voice carried a faint madness.

Hearing him, Yang Kai's heart stirred; he surmised that the Ghost Ancestor must already be an expert of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, otherwise he would not speak of assaulting the Third Stage so casually.

It seemed Ni Guang's fear of him was not unfounded.

"After I withdrew from there I meant to see whether I could find you. If there is anyone who can safely enter that Medicine Valley, it would probably be you! I did not hold out much hope, but I was lucky," the Ghost Ancestor said.

"That must be the Medicine Valley Uncle Ni spoke of."

As the Ghost Ancestor finished speaking, a weak voice came from behind Yang Kai.

The voice still sounded a little feeble, but it seemed she was no longer in any great danger.

"You're awake?" Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at her; Xue Yue's complexion had already flushed much rosier. It seemed her healing secret art was indeed extraordinary — in such a short time she had stabilized her injuries.

"Hm, I was dazed just now, but I'm clear-headed now," Xue Yue nodded, showing no intention of getting off Yang Kai's back; instead she hugged him tighter, comfortably enjoying the warmth of his care. Then she cast a suspicious glance at the Ghost Ancestor and asked cautiously in Yang Kai's ear, "This Elder is...?"

"This is Elder Ghost Ancestor," Yang Kai chuckled. "Don't worry, he's an old acquaintance of mine."

"Heh heh..." the Ghost Ancestor gave a strange laugh. "Little lass, you're young but crafty; if I truly wanted to make my move against you, would you still be alive? Rest assured, as your lover says, we are old acquaintances. Meeting here in this damned place is like finding a friend in a foreign land; I bear you no ill will."

Hearing the word "lover," a faint pink rose on Xue Yue's neck and a smile lifted the corner of her mouth. She said softly, "Elder, be magnanimous — I am injured and cannot properly pay my respects."

"No matter, no matter!" the Ghost Ancestor showed no concern, then looked at Xue Yue thoughtfully. "But little girl, you are Xue Yue of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, aren't you?"

Xue Yue's expression changed briefly, then she quickly recovered and nodded. "How did Elder tell?"

She had used a Secret Treasure to change her appearance and body; the form she showed the world was completely different from her true self, and that Secret Treasure had been crafted by a master artificer of the Hengluo Commerce Guild — unless one had top-tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, one could hardly perceive its flaws.

Xue Yue did not know why the Ghost Ancestor had seen through her at a glance.

"I'm not an idiot," the Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "There are only so few people who enter the Lost Realm. You were wearing the same clothing as Xue Yue and just called out 'Uncle Ni'... if I still could not see through your background then my years would have been wasted." As he spoke he appeared relieved; earlier he had been curious about the woman Yang Kai carried, for he had not noticed her presence when he first entered the Lost Realm.

Later, by piecing together various clues, he had realized the truth and was struck with sudden understanding.

"I see now," Xue Yue bowed her head and at last understood that the Ghost Ancestor had not been especially formidable but that she herself had shown too many flaws.

"The esteemed Third Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild is actually a woman — that is indeed most surprising," the Ghost Ancestor clicked his tongue in wonder.

"Elder, Xue Yue carries certain secrets and does not wish her gender to be known; please keep this confidential," Yang Kai said with a grin. "You know how great the Hengluo Commerce Guild is — if this gets out..."

“This old master isn’t one for idle gossip.” The Ghost Ancestor sneered disdainfully, “Whether that one is male or female has nothing to do with me.”

"Thank you, Elder," Xue Yue bit her red lip and offered thanks.

After a moment she leaned close to Yang Kai's ear and breathed fragrant air. "I'll change my appearance back. If we meet anyone else, I might be discovered again."

"Do as you wish," Yang Kai nodded.

Xue Yue touched a spot on her chest and activated her Saint Yuan; the Secret Treasure she wore to alter her appearance and body took effect again, transforming her into the previous male guise.

"Little lass, when you said just now that your Hengluo Commerce Guild also knew of that Medicine Valley, did you mean they were aware of its location?" the Ghost Ancestor asked again.

"Yes." Xue Yue nodded lightly. "Our Hengluo Commerce Guild has long known of that Medicine Valley's existence. Whenever the Lost Realm opens, people come; occasionally there are gains, but because that place contains so many spatial rifts no one dares to venture too deep. Our previous objective was also that Medicine Valley, but we encountered many Illusory Void Butterflies and were separated from Uncle Ni and the others."

"So it's not some secret after all," the Ghost Ancestor said, greatly disappointed. "Boy Yang, it seems we must pick up the pace, otherwise if someone else gets there first we might not even get so much as a sip of soup. Fine, let this old man escort you a stretch!"

As he spoke, the Ghost Ancestor formed hand seals and summoned the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. In the next moment the banner enveloped the three of them, turning into a black light that shot forward, its speed increasing more than twofold.

The Ghost Ancestor's discovery of the Medicine Valley had been pure chance. He had no special purpose in entering the Lost Realm — only the rumor that it contained many things that could aid Void King Realm experts in strengthening themselves had tempted him in to take the risk. While tracking Yang Kai he had passed near the Medicine Valley and found a few Wudao Flowers.

Unfortunately, even with his formidable power he had not dared to delve deeply and had been forced to retreat with pain.

Now that he had Yang Kai with him, he felt elated and was ready to go in and lay waste without restraint.

The Medicine Valley was not very close to the spot where he and Yang Kai had met, but it was by no means near; it took a full day before the three arrived at their destination.

The Ten Thousand Souls Banner was withdrawn gently, revealing the three of them.

But when the Ghost Ancestor released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings, his face darkened and he snorted coldly, "So many have come!"

Within a hundred-li radius, many Void King Realm experts had gathered; it was unknown how they had gotten the information, or whether, like the Ghost Ancestor, they had discovered the place by chance.

With a casual glance Yang Kai saw Zi Long, owner of the Purple Star, and the young master Zi Donglai, both with the same purple hair, perched on a small hill and standing out strikingly.

Besides them, Xu Wei, who had previously plotted against Yang Kai, was plainly present, and even Kong Fa had come.

The two were still in league with one another, though Kong Fa seemed rather badly wounded, his face somewhat pale; it appeared he had gained no advantage from the earlier Illusory Void Butterfly attack, and to have merely kept his life was fortunate.

"Xue Yue!" came a tense and joyful shout from not far to the right.

Yang Kai turned and saw Ni Guang rushing over anxiously, casting wary glances at the Ghost Ancestor, with Luo Lan close behind him.
