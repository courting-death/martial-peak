## Chapter 97 — Kill Two First

These two Fengyu Tower disciples bore no grudge against Yang Kai originally, but having pursued him all this way, and with several of their junior brothers slain, they could not seek vengeance on Wen Feichen and thus pinned the blame on Yang Kai.

When enemies meet, their hatred naturally flares.

Senior Brother Xiong eyed Yang Kai with a cruel smile and coldly said, “Such boldness, daring to throw yourself into the trap. Where is the woman you saved?”

“Defeat me, and I will tell you!” Yang Kai’s fists cracked sharply as he shook his neck and slowly advanced toward the two.

Senior Brother Xiong sneered, “Foolish and reckless. Junior Brother, cover me; I will teach him a lesson!”

With that, the long sword at his waist slid from its sheath with a sharp scrape. He spun the blade into a dazzling sword flower and charged at Yang Kai.

Xiong possessed the strength of the Open Origin Realm, Sixth Stage, while Yang Kai was only at the Fourth Stage—two full levels apart. Moreover, Xiong wielded a weapon, giving him a clear advantage.

This first strike was merely a probe; Xiong did not expect to fell Yang Kai in one blow.

The sword flower flashed in the darkness. Yang Kai sidestepped and raised both palms to engage Xiong in combat. Palm against sword, Yang Kai was at a disadvantage, forced to retreat step by step. By the time Xiong unleashed his ninth strike, Yang Kai had withdrawn more than ten paces.

Xiong laughed heartily. “A mere grain of rice dares to shine! Yang Kai, prepare to die!”

The earlier probing had revealed Yang Kai’s true strength, so now Xiong intended to strike decisively. His Primordial Qi surged, and the long sword emitted the rumble of wind and thunder.

“Thunder Wind Chant!” Xiong roared, brandishing his sword with imposing might. Suddenly, arcs of electric light crackled along the blade, sharp beyond compare, thrusting toward Yang Kai’s chest at an inescapable speed.

Yang Kai could not dodge, but his face showed no fear. Instead, he raised a palm and struck the sword.

Xiong sneered coldly, confident that his sword was charged with thunderpower. If a mere Open Origin Realm Fourth Stage warrior touched it, he would be paralyzed and helpless.

With this thought, Xiong did not withdraw his strike; instead, the sword moved faster.

Yang Kai shouted, his palm suddenly glowing a deep red as if aflame. A scorching wave of Yang Flame surged forth, dispelling the cold around Xiong and burning him as if cast into a sea of fire.

With a sharp clang, Yang Kai’s palm struck the sword’s surface. The electric arcs vanished instantly, and the sword veered off course, grazing Yang Kai’s shoulder without causing harm.

Xiong was stunned. His Primordial Qi had been overwhelmed! He thought Yang Kai was only Open Origin Realm Fourth Stage—how could his energy be more potent?

Moreover, the searing energy in that palm strike was so refined it extinguished his thunderpower.

Panicked, Xiong hastily withdrew his sword to catch his breath and reconsider his strategy. But Yang Kai gave him no chance. Seizing the moment of retreat, he closed the distance and, to Xiong’s shock and terror, pressed a finger to his chest.

Knowing he faced multiple foes, Yang Kai struck decisively, expending a drop of Yang Liquid to ensure a fatal blow.

Xiong’s body froze, and only the howling, mournful winds echoed through the valley.

The Fengyu Tower junior brother covering Xiong did not immediately understand. He called out softly, “Senior Brother Xiong, Senior Brother Xiong.”

Before his words faded, Xiong’s body collapsed stiffly. Yang Kai sneered, “Your Senior Brother waits for you on the Yellow Springs Road.”

The junior brother was dumbfounded, then screamed and fled.

His strength was slightly inferior to Xiong’s, only Open Origin Realm Fifth Stage. Yang Kai had slain Xiong with ease; dealing with him would be effortless.

“Think you can run?” Yang Kai sneered, seizing Xiong’s long sword and giving chase.

The dense Yin energy in the valley greatly aided Yang Kai. Everyone’s strength was diminished by the pervasive Yin Qi, except Yang Kai, who cultivated the True Yang Technique. His Primordial Qi was the Yin Qi’s natural nemesis, so he suffered no ill effects, only needing to expend some True Yang Primordial Qi to dispel the chill.

Though the Fengyu Tower junior brother was Open Origin Realm Fifth Stage, his effective strength here was weaker than Yang Kai’s.

Before long, Yang Kai closed the gap to about ten zhang—a close enough distance.

Running, Yang Kai suddenly hurled the long sword behind him. The junior brother reacted swiftly, dodging just in time to avoid the blade.

But the delay allowed Yang Kai to close the distance completely.

With no chance to flee, the junior brother turned and drew his weapon to fight. Yet a red light flashed before him. Instinctively, he raised his weapon to block.

With a crisp snap, his fine steel weapon was sliced in two like tofu. The next moment, a sharp heat seared his neck as if something had slashed through.

Yang Kai stopped. On his fingertip glimmered a blood-red blade, thin as a cicada’s wing, shining brilliantly. A drop of fresh blood rolled down its edge.

The Fengyu Tower junior brother’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he stared at Yang Kai, pointing at him but unable to speak. After several breaths, his head shot upward, and a spray of blood erupted from his neck.

Kill two first!

This battle was effortless. Yang Kai did not even need to use the Unyielding Will technique. In past fights, he had to rely on this mysterious martial art to overcome foes, but now he realized he possessed the strength to slay beyond his level without it.

He felt it necessary to reevaluate himself.

Just as Yang Kai prepared to leave swiftly, the rustling of robes came from both left and right.

Two figures rapidly approached from the left, one from the right—likely drawn by the junior brother’s scream. They were about a hundred zhang away.

Yang Kai had intended to hide but reconsidered and swiftly moved toward the left.

If his guess was correct, these were the remaining three Fengyu Tower disciples.

They likely split up to better search for him and Xia Ningshang, though they were not far apart.

With all three now present, Yang Kai welcomed the opportunity. The Fengyu Tower disciples were far weaker than the Blood Battle Gang’s, perfect for testing his strength.
