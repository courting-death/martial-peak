## Chapter 1960 — Utter Humiliation

In front of the crude wooden hut, Yang Kai's right arm was dripping with blood, and the blood seeping from the corner of his mouth made his expression all the more grim and terrifying; his right hand had plunged into Zhou Yi's chest, gripping the heart that was pounding violently.

Zhou Yi had toppled to the ground, his body entangled in a golden net formed by Golden Blood Threads, his eyes trembling as he stared at Yang Kai.

Madman! This fellow was absolutely a madman! Zhou Yi kept crying out in his mind.

The two remained locked in that frozen standoff, not moving a muscle.

The air was so heavy with murderous intent it was almost impossible to breathe.

Not far away, Liu Qianyun covered her mouth with a small hand, her beautiful eyes trembling violently; Chu Fei and the other two Void King Realm cultivators could only be heard swallowing hard.

"Heh heh, Senior Brother, you're finished!" Yang Kai suddenly grinned wickedly.

Zhou Yi's face twitched slightly; though filled with unwillingness, the situation before him forced him to admit that his life was being held at someone else's mercy and his fate was completely out of his control.

If Yang Kai applied a little more force, he could take his life.

"Kill me and you won't live either!" Zhou Yi said coldly to Yang Kai, showing no sign of begging, only fierce stubbornness.

"Do you want to try? See if after I kill you I can leave this damned place! Junior Brother, I boast no great skill except that I'm first-rate at running away!" Yang Kai chuckled lowly, that smile sounding downright evil, making Zhou Yi hesitate to speak, for fear the other might really squeeze his heart to pieces.

If that really was the case, whether Yang Kai lived or died didn't matter — he was certainly doomed. He only had one life, how could he not cling to it?

"You dare move and I'll kill him!" Yang Kai suddenly turned his head, looking coldly toward Chu Fei, who was stealthily preparing to flee.

Only then did Liu Qianyun snap back to her senses; she swayed and came to Chu Fei's side, watching him warily to prevent his escape.

Chu Fei wore a woeful expression; indeed, he did not dare move, his face a portrait of misery.

"You seem like a sensible person; you don't want things to end with both sides dead, do you? Open a path and Senior Brother will take it," Zhou Yi said, his expression flickering as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a cold laugh. "Of course I don't want mutual destruction. But today's matter has blown up to this degree. It's hard to settle. Senior Brother, tell me — should I kill you and run... or kill you and wait for the Sect's punishment? Don't give me that foolish line about 'if you spare me I won't trouble you again'; I won't believe such childish talk."

Zhou Yi's face darkened; he did not know how to respond.

"Forget it," Yang Kai suddenly laughed again. "I'll vent first."

He turned and looked at Chu Fei, his gaze growing icy. "Speaking of which, this was all caused by you lot, and you even got me confined for three months. Since that's the case, I'll start with you: get on your knees and slap your own face, and while you slap, call yourself a pig!"

At those words, Chu Fei and the others' faces changed drastically.

"You, you bully people too much!" Chu Fei roared. Though this place was remote and few came and went, if he truly did such a thing how could he stand in the Sect afterwards? It would spread and become the laughingstock of the whole Sect.

One of the cultivators, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, also shouted angrily, "A gentleman may be killed but not humiliated!"

Yang Kai smiled slightly and ignored Chu Fei and the others; instead he turned to Zhou Yi, slowly increasing the pressure with his hand and said coldly, "Senior Brother, Senior Brother Chu and the others aren't cooperating — what should I do? Junior Brother currently has no spare bodies and can't force them; it vexes me, and if I misjudge my force..."

Sweat beaded on Zhou Yi's brow; he felt the hand squeezing his heart grow ever stronger and his breathing became somewhat obstructed. Panicked, he turned to Chu Fei and the others and cried out, "Every grievance has its debtor; this was caused by you. If you want to see me die, then do nothing. But if I manage to escape this calamity, you'll know what fury you'll face."

Once Zhou Yi spoke, Chu Fei and the others' faces paled; one by one they looked at Yang Kai with hatred and pleading, as if hoping he would show mercy and spare them this once.

Yang Kai pretended not to hear and his hand continued to tighten.

"Kneel!" Zhou Yi suddenly shouted.

Chu Fei and the others did not dare hesitate; with thuds they all fell to their knees, their expressions as ugly as if their parents had just died.

What a crushing humiliation!

They were all Void King Realm cultivators; injury and bleeding were common, but when had any of them ever been forced to kneel? Each of them cursed Yang Kai profanely in their hearts and vowed to seek revenge a hundredfold for today's disgrace, else they could not wash away the hatred in their chests.

"I don't hear the sound of slapping!" Yang Kai cocked his head, feigning puzzlement.

Zhou Yi cast a fierce glare at Chu Fei and the others.

Smack, smack...

Chu Fei and the others flailed their hands, slapping their own cheeks again and again in a mechanical rhythm.

"Anything else?" Yang Kai continued to sneer.

A mouthful of Qi and blood churned in Chu Fei's chest; he nearly vomited, wishing he could rush forward and die with Yang Kai, but intimidated by Zhou Yi's former severity, he dared not resist.

Steeling himself, he began to wail.

"I'm a pig, boohoo..." he cried.

With Chu Fei leading, the other two naturally had to follow. A strange sight unfolded: three Biyu Sect disciples knelt, slapped their own faces and cursed themselves — such humiliation was a hundred times worse than any Sect punishment.

"I shouldn't have provoked Junior Brother Yang; I'm a pig!"

"I'm a pig, Junior Brother Yang, be magnanimous and spare us this once."

......

"Isn't this great," Yang Kai said with satisfaction. "People really do act under pressure."

"Isn't that enough?" Zhou Yi said coldly, glaring at Yang Kai; his teeth seemed to have been bitten until they bled, the hatred in his eyes congealing into something solid.

"Senior Brother, your gaze is so fierce!" Yang Kai put on a frightened air. "Junior Brother is timid — don't glare at me like that, what if Junior Brother gets flustered and squeezes your heart to bits..."

Zhou Yi closed his eyes and took a deep breath; when he opened them again he had returned to normal and said in a low voice, "Junior Brother Yang, it was my fault for being blind. You've had your venting today; isn't it time to stop? After all, we're fellow disciples — we'll see each other often..."

Before he could finish, Yang Kai suddenly raised his left hand and slapped him.

Slap — Zhou Yi's cheek bore a red palm print, and several of his teeth were knocked out.

"Now you know we're fellow disciples who will see each other often? Why didn't you say that when you came to trouble me earlier!"

"You..."

"You what?" Yang Kai spat, slapping him again. Zhou Yi instinctively tried to resist but felt the hand on his heart tighten; he dared not move and took the second slap, his barely quelled anger flaring anew until his eyes turned bloodshot.

“You say one more word and I’ll slap you again. Go on, try it—oh? You dare glare at me?” As he spoke, Yang Kai drove a fist straight into Zhou Yi’s eye socket, turning it into a panda eye on the spot.

Zhou Yi finally kept quiet, realizing Yang Kai was somewhat mad and that making a fuss now would only bring harm upon himself. He bowed his head and did not look at Yang Kai, instead plotting how to torment Yang Kai later to avenge today's shame.

"Qianyun, was it this fellow who injured you?" Yang Kai suddenly asked a strange question.

Liu Qianyun's expression stirred; she opened her mouth as if to speak but in the end merely nodded.

It was not hard for Yang Kai to guess — given Liu Qianyun's strength, Chu Fei could not have wounded her; the only person who could have hurt her was Zhou Yi.

Yang Kai nodded coldly and snarled, "As a Sect Senior Brother, you wouldn't even take care of us new Junior Brother and Sister, and instead you bully us on purpose — Senior Brother Zhou Yi, you really have talent for this."

With that, Yang Kai raised his left fist and brutally beat Zhou Yi.

Zhou Yi had no room to resist and could only endure the beating.

Although Yang Kai's cultivation was one Stage lower, his physical body was exceptionally strong; the force behind his punches was immense, and before long Zhou Yi's face was battered and swollen, his features horribly distorted.

Suddenly Zhou Yi laughed coldly, his words slurred: "Kid, if you don't kill me today, you'll regret it in the future."

Yang Kai frowned, glanced into the distance and snorted coldly, "Don't worry — before I die I'll drag you to the grave with me!"

In his perception, a powerful expert was rapidly flying this way.

After all, they had made such a commotion here for a long time; it must have already alerted others in the Biyu Sect, so someone coming was well within Yang Kai's expectations.

What surprised him a little was that the newcomer seemed to be a very formidable expert; the pressure that arrived before the person did indicated a strength not weaker than Bian Yuqing.

Which Protector had come? Yang Kai's face darkened.

Liu Qianyun had obviously noticed as well; worry filled her beautiful eyes as she looked at Yang Kai, for Yang Kai's actions had indeed been fierce today — Chu Fei and the others were still kneeling, slapping themselves and cursing.

Shortly after, a mysterious light shot over and stopped not far above Yang Kai and the others; as the light dispersed, several figures appeared within it.

An indescribable pressure descended from above; everyone involuntarily held their breath and their bodies grew heavy, as if pressed down by a mountain.
