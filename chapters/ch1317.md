## Chapter 1317 — New Complications

Sure enough, the young woman gave an apologetic smile and said, "Young Master, I’m afraid this transaction cannot be completed!"

"Cannot be completed?" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and vexation clouded his face as he asked coldly, "Is the price I offered insufficient?"

"Not that!" The young woman shook her head helplessly. "I just received a transmission from above saying Yue'er cannot be redeemed, and the specific reasons cannot be disclosed!"

At the news, Qian Yue's delicate body trembled and her face went pale; she had only just seen a glimmer of freedom, and it was now cruelly snuffed out — the blow was immense.

Yang Kai’s expression was equally grim. He fixed the young woman with a cold stare, and seeing the embarrassment and forced smile on her face, he immediately understood that this matter was likely beyond her control. Losing his temper would be pointless. Taking a deep breath, he asked thoughtfully, “The message you received — does it say that I cannot redeem Miss Yue’er, or that no one can?”

"Is there a difference?" The young woman was momentarily taken aback.

"Just answer plainly." Yang Kai snorted.

Perhaps feeling guilty for her sudden reversal, the young woman hesitated, then said, "They only mentioned Yue'er's name; they did not speak of anyone else."

“I see. Heh heh.” Yang Kai let out a few cold laughs, his expression flickering slightly as he said, “Madam, how about this — I still believe there’s no deal in this world that can’t be made, only prices one can’t afford. If you agree to let me take Miss Yue’er away, I’ll offer one more Pill. How about that?”

As he spoke, Yang Kai produced an exquisite small bottle, pain briefly flickering across his face, and solemnly handed it to the young woman.

The young woman forced a wry smile. "Young Master, you put me in a difficult position. Since the order has already come down, this truly is not my decision to make."

"Whether you can decide, take a look at the pill in this bottle first. If you truly cannot agree, then please contact the one who sent the transmission and ask what price they require of me."

A look of astonishment flashed in the young woman's eyes. She exclaimed, "It seems Yue'er truly means a great deal to the Young Master. Yue'er is indeed fortunate to be favored by such a man."

When she glanced at Qian Yue, a trace of envy appeared — Yang Kai's insistence on redeeming Qian Yue showed how much he valued her; to a woman working in such a place, this was undoubtedly the greatest happiness.

As a woman herself, she could sympathize deeply.

She did not refuse Yang Kai outright; instead she symbolically opened the small bottle and peered inside. Her previously casual expression suddenly changed as her eyes widened in disbelief.

Inside the bottle was a single pill, round and pure white, exuding an exceptionally soothing aura; a sniff brought an immediate calm to the young woman's mood.

She glanced at Yang Kai in astonishment and, seeing his half-smile, carefully poured out the pill and inspected it in her palm.

After a long while, she finally placed the pill back, took a soft breath, and looked at Yang Kai with a trace of surprise in her eyes. “Although I don’t know much about pills,” she said, “I can barely recognize this one — isn’t it a Demon-Slaying Pill?”

"Your eye is keen — it is indeed a Demon-Slaying Pill!" Yang Kai's face twitched, as if he felt a sting of pain, and he nodded.

"Such an item is one of the best auxiliary pills for a Saint King to break through to the Origin Returning Realm: it steadies the heart and dispels the inner demon. While not as rare as the Origin Condensing Pill, its value is comparable. Are you sure you wish to put this up as collateral?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "Not collateral — consider it the bargaining chip for the trade. If I take Yue'er away, this Demon-Slaying Pill becomes your Hehuan House’s."

The young woman’s face brightened at this and her expression shifted for a while before she bit her lip and said, "Young Master, wait a moment. I'll contact them again and see if they will allow her to be released. To be honest, if this were up to me, the deal would have been done already, but…"

Smiling ruefully and realizing the Demon-Slaying Pill's rarity and value, she hastily retrieved her transmission compass and poured in her divine sense to communicate with the unknown party.

While she was communicating, a sharp glint flashed in Yang Kai's eyes and a thread of his divine sense quietly extended, slipping through Hehuan House. Avoiding the fiercest wards and the rooms where Origin Returning Realm experts sat, he swept through the house in a short time.

Before long he obtained the information he wanted and, as he suspected, smirked inwardly, retracting his wisp of divine sense with an unreadable face.

Across from him, the young woman's negotiation with the unknown party continued, and she argued earnestly, her expression sour — she was clearly reluctant to part with the Demon-Slaying Pill.

Understandable — the Demon-Slaying Pill’s use is not trivial. If a cultivator’s inner demon during a breakthrough is weak, no pill is needed, but if the inner demon is severe and obstructs the ascension, such a pill becomes essential.

It can very well determine the success or failure of a cultivator’s advancement.

The Demon-Slaying Pill in Yang Kai's hand had been casually concocted earlier for Chang Qi and Hao An to aid their break through to the Origin Returning Realm, but they ended up using the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense Yang Kai brought back from Flowing Flame Sandland as their auxiliary and encountered no inner-demon interference.

So the Demon-Slaying Pill was saved and now conveniently served as Yang Kai's bargaining chip.

He still had several Origin Condensing Pills, but he wasn't foolish enough to use them — though similar in value, the Origin Condensing Pill was infinitely rarer.

While the young woman conversed via the transmission compass, Yang Kai's face remained unsettled. He must take Qian Yue away; a peaceful agreement was preferable. If that failed, he could use force to subdue the woman and whisk Qian Yue away at once.

Of course, if things really came to that, he wouldn’t be able to stay in Black Crow City any longer. Unless absolutely forced, he didn’t wish to fall out with Hehuan House — after all, a dragon from afar cannot suppress the local serpent. He was only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, while Hehuan House had three Origin Returning Realm experts in residence, and even enjoyed the support of the city lord. It wasn’t a force that could be provoked lightly.

Having made his plan, Yang Kai's expression grew indifferent; he quietly sent Qian Yue a word to be ready and waited in silence.

After a while the young woman despondently closed her transmission compass and apologetically shook her head at Yang Kai: "I really am powerless; I don't know why they insist on keeping Yue'er. Young Master, please go back."

Yang Kai rose slowly and inclined his head, "Very well, if that is so, I won't trouble you further. You may stay here awhile."

Saying so, he gave the young woman a sly smile.

The woman's heart lurched but before she could react a tremendous pressure suddenly descended upon her Sea of Consciousness, making it churn and leaving her dizzy in an instant.

At the same time she saw the youth before her blur and suddenly appear at her side, his large hand sweeping to cover her. The young woman’s features went pale and though she tried to resist, she could not marshal any Saint Yuan.

She was herself a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet facing Yang Kai of the same rank she could not put up any resistance — terror welled inside her.

In the next moment a scorching force surged from all directions into her body; these forces interlinked in some unfathomable way and formed an ingenious sealing formation within her, locking away her cultivation.

The young woman’s limbs went limp and she had no strength to move a finger, screaming, "What do you mean, Young Master? How dare you act wildly in Hehuan House — you will have no good end!"

Yang Kai grinned and with a flick of his finger the woman's mouth snapped shut and could not open again. He then said leisurely, "I’ll take the person and leave the goods; this trade will not be a loss for your house — rather, you’ll profit. As for those above… once you’re free, you may investigate; perhaps some petty official has overstepped his authority to block this trade. Once you find out, you’ll see you won’t be punished."

The young woman stared at Yang Kai in bewilderment, uncertain what he meant by his words.

She wanted to ask, but could not open her mouth and could only watch helplessly as Yang Kai and Qian Yue's figures vanished from sight. In a panic she forcibly triggered a secret technique and shattered the earring on her earlobe.

At the moment the earring burst, Yang Kai immediately sensed it, his expression flickering as he barked, "Go!"

With that he scooped Qian Yue into his arms and made to leave in haste.

"Thinking to leave?" A cold, clear voice suddenly echoed from the void, "Since you dare act in Hehuan House, then remain!"

At once an invisible force enveloped Yang Kai, causing the air and space around to thicken and congeal; his body, which had just leapt up, suddenly crashed heavily back to the ground.

"Shi!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he had seen this power before and immediately recognized it.

After landing, Yang Kai shielded Qian Yue behind him and peered toward the source. A beautiful middle-aged woman in light blue palace garb appeared, her figure graceful and her curvaceous form accentuated, her face edged with killing intent as she glared coldly at Yang Kai.

At the sight of the woman, Qian Yue's face changed dramatically and she cried out, "Steward Lian!"

Hearing Qian Yue call her, Yang Kai's expression darkened — this was a troublesome development.
