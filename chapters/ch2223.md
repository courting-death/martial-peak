## Chapter 2223 — Mist Valley

In the Divine Roaming world, ancient tales spoke of a special brood of insects. These creatures were the nemesis of all living beings—no matter how powerful, no matter how high their cultivation, none could stand against them. They could not be killed and would ceaselessly devour the bodies of living creatures to grow stronger.

Those creatures were called the Sacred Insects by the denizens of the Divine Roaming world.

When the Sacred Insects first appeared, there was no warning. No one knew where they came from, nor did anyone pay them much mind, for at that time they were still weak.

But as time passed and they continued to devour and grow, the terror of the Sacred Insects gradually became known to all.

Wherever they passed, all living things vanished without a trace. Wherever they built their nests, for a million li around, no one dared approach.

In those legendary days, the Divine Roaming world teemed with experts, many at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm!

When the Sacred Insects became a disaster, these experts could no longer sit idly by. They joined forces, determined to eradicate the Sacred Insects that threatened the entire world.

No one knows what truly happened in that battle.

But from that day on, all the experts in the Divine Roaming world vanished, and the terrifying Sacred Insects that struck fear into all hearts disappeared as well.

Some speculate that the experts perished together with the Sacred Insects—how else to explain the outcome? Others believe the experts wiped out the Sacred Insects and then went into hiding. Still others guess the Sacred Insects devoured all the experts and are now evolving in some unknown place. If the Sacred Insects ever reappear, it will surely be the end of the world!

These are just rumors—no one ever believed them. No one has ever seen the so-called Sacred Insects, nor knows what they look like.

Almost no one takes the Sacred Insects seriously.

But today, Ban Qing understood those rumors were not fabricated. Sacred Insects that could drive one to despair truly existed in this world. These tiny insects were exactly as the legends described: feeding on the energy within living beings, impossible to kill or destroy, growing ever stronger until they swept across the land and turned the world to scorched earth.

The ancient rumors had come to life before his eyes, and Ban Qing completely lost the will to fight Yang Kai.

He simply could not understand how Yang Kai, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, could command the Sacred Insects to fight for him. Was he not afraid they would devour him, leaving not even his bones behind?

A miserable howl echoed out. A furious roar lingered in the air as Ban Qing struggled in agony, as if he had fallen into an abyss of endless torment, suffering unbearable torture. When the Soul-Devouring Worms rampaged through his body, devouring his Divine Soul energy, Ban Qing experienced the terror and despair of having his very soul slowly consumed, bit by bit.

He seemed to go mad, unleashing his power wildly. All sorts of wondrous and mysterious Divine Soul secret arts burst forth from his hands—techniques Yang Kai had never seen or imagined.

Even the surrounding space became unstable.

Yang Kai quickly dodged, watching Ban Qing from afar.

He had not expected that this Emperor Realm expert would go mad after shouting a single phrase.

“Could the Soul-Devouring Worms be connected to this world? Otherwise, why would he call them Sacred Insects…” Yang Kai frowned in thought, unable to figure it out, but this situation was exactly what he hoped for.

Earlier, he had ambushed Ban Qing with the Soul-Severing Blade, exploiting his blind spot, and then attacked again with the Soul-Devouring Worms. Both had succeeded, but if this Emperor Realm expert insisted on fleeing, Yang Kai truly had no good way to stop him.

His power over Spatial Law might not be enough to restrain an Emperor Realm cultivator.

If Ban Qing managed to escape and reveal his secrets to others, Yang Kai’s advantage would be lost.

Now, Ban Qing seemed utterly deranged, trapped in helpless despair, and looked ready to meet his end in this state. For Yang Kai, this was a welcome turn of events.

After all, he was still an Emperor Realm expert. Even though Ban Qing had gone mad, acting without reason, the Soul-Devouring Worms could not devour him completely in a short time.

Yang Kai did not provoke him, only watched from a distance, waiting for an opportunity…

As time passed, Ban Qing’s aura grew weaker and weaker, falling from the Emperor Realm to the Dao Origin Realm, then to the Void King Realm, and finally to the Origin Returning Realm…

After a full hour, Ban Qing suddenly stopped moving, standing there motionless.

Then, with a bang, Ban Qing’s entire body exploded, turning into countless motes of light that scattered into the world.

Emperor, fallen!

In the place where he vanished, a cloud of insects churned and writhed, flying up and down.

After devouring all the energy of an Emperor Realm expert, the Soul-Devouring Worms seemed to have grown greatly. Yang Kai noticed their aura had become much denser.

He released his Divine Sense, trying to recall the Soul-Devouring Worms, but to his unease, they ignored his commands and even seemed intent on leaving.

Yang Kai panicked.

Although the Soul-Devouring Worms had not been of much use to him in recent years, after this, they would surely become a powerful trump card. If he lost control of them now, he would lose a vital means of dealing with enemies in future trials.

What’s more, this was the Divine Roaming world. If Soul-Devouring Worms were allowed to run rampant here, Yang Kai could not imagine what would happen.

Outside, there might be other ways to deal with the Soul-Devouring Worms, but here, all living beings were made of Divine Soul energy—the perfect food for the worms.

They would continue to grow stronger, eventually devouring the entire world.

So no matter what, Yang Kai dared not and would not leave the Soul-Devouring Worms here.

He had already noticed signs that the Soul-Devouring Worms were resisting his commands, and as they grew, this became more obvious. Now, they simply ignored him!

Yang Kai was both anxious and angry.

He kept urging his Divine Sense, sending messages to the Soul-Devouring Worms, but it had little effect.

With no other choice, Yang Kai could only draw upon the power of the Warm Spirit Lotus within him. Instantly, a seven-colored radiance blossomed, spreading in all directions.

This move worked as expected. Perhaps because the Soul-Devouring Worms had always lived on the Warm Spirit Lotus and regarded it as their home, when the seven-colored light shone, they buzzed and gathered into a cloud, flying back to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief, flicked his sleeve, and collected them.

Standing in place, Yang Kai frowned deeply, silently sensing the movements of the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Strangely, after being recalled, the Soul-Devouring Worms suddenly quieted down, no longer as unruly as before.

But this made Yang Kai realize a problem—he really needed to refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the Soul-Devouring Worms grew any stronger, he would lose the means to control them.

The Slave-Insect Bracelet was a Secret Treasure of the Insect Emperor, able to subdue all strange insects and beasts in the world. Naturally, it was the best tool to enslave the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Although this battle was extremely perilous, it did little for Yang Kai’s own growth. His easy victory was entirely due to the power of the Imperial Treasure and the Soul-Devouring Worms—he himself had contributed little.

Still, Ban Qing was the first Emperor Realm expert he had ever killed. Even if it was only a Divine Soul body without flesh and blood, it was not an easy feat.

In the outside world, Yang Kai could never have accomplished such a thing.

Thinking back, Yang Kai could not help but feel a bit of lingering fear. If Ban Qing had used his best assassination techniques from the start, Yang Kai might not have had a chance to resist. Fortunately, Ban Qing’s orders were to capture him alive, which gave Yang Kai this opportunity.

He let out a light breath, frowned in thought for a moment, and wondered where he should go from here…

According to Ban Qing, the outskirts of Heavenly Yao Mountain were now sealed off, with many cultivators under Zhou Dian’s command searching for the so-called Calamity Stars. Yang Kai certainly could not leave Heavenly Yao Mountain now, nor could he stay here. It seemed he could only venture deeper inside and hope to escape disaster.

With this in mind, Yang Kai made up his mind.

Looking around, Yang Kai’s gaze fell on the middle-aged man lying unconscious on the ground. He had no idea what method Ban Qing had used to knock him out, but even now, the man showed no sign of waking.

Yang Kai had no connection or enmity with him, so he could not be bothered to intervene and simply left him there to his fate.

He continued searching, and soon his gaze fixed on a certain direction. Grinning, he waved toward it.

From behind a tree, the Purple Civet peeked out, its little eyes full of intelligence. Once it was sure the coast was clear, it crept out and slowly approached Yang Kai, looking at him with concern, as if asking whether he was hurt.

Yang Kai smiled, bent down, picked it up, placed it on his shoulder, identified his direction, and sped off toward the depths of Heavenly Yao Mountain.

…

Countless tens of thousands of li from Heavenly Yao Mountain lay a valley surrounded on all sides by mountains.

This valley was unimaginably vast, filled with dense mist. The locals all called it Mist Valley.

The mist in the valley never dissipated, thick to the extreme. Once inside, one could not see their own hand in front of their face, making it extremely strange. Although the mist was harmless to living beings, anyone who entered would completely lose their sense of direction.

From time to time, some bold locals would try to explore Mist Valley, hoping to discover its secrets, but regardless of cultivation, anyone who entered would soon lose their way.

No one had ever found a way out.

Yet no one had ever been truly trapped to death inside.

For whenever these people reached the point of despair, an invisible force would send them out.
