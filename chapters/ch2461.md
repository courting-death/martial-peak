## Chapter 2461 — Refining the Mountain and River Bell

Chang Hao and the other two were overjoyed, thinking Yang Kai had given tacit approval, and moved even faster.

At the very instant the three of them passed through the spatial rift, Yang Kai suddenly clenched his hand.

The torn spatial rift snapped shut with lightning speed.

Caught off guard, the other two were instantly sliced in half, blood and viscera spilling out in a torrent. Their auras vanished in an instant, leaving a scene of utter horror.

Only Chang Hao reacted quickly, managing to retreat in time and avoid certain death.

After steadying himself, Chang Hao glanced to the side in lingering fear, then turned to Yang Kai and shouted, "You—you really intend to wipe us all out!"

Yang Kai stared at him coldly and said, "Anyone who crosses this Young Master never meets a good end!"

"Don't be so arrogant! I, Chang Hao, am the Holy Son of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. Don't think I'm afraid of you!" Chang Hao roared, his voice fierce but his heart weak.

Yang Kai looked at him with icy indifference. "Are you finished?"

Chang Hao was startled and cried out in alarm, "What are you going to do!"

"If you're done talking, then get on your way!" As soon as the words fell, he suddenly waved both hands, and the void's dark currents surged as if commanded, wrapping tightly around Chang Hao in an instant, binding him so completely he couldn't move.

Chang Hao's face changed wildly. He desperately pushed his Origin Qi to struggle, but he couldn't break free from the strange currents. The more he struggled, the deeper he sank. His face turned pale as he looked up at Yang Kai, trembling, "Spare me! I'll pay any price—even give you my Soul Brand!"

Handing over his Soul Brand meant he would have to obey Yang Kai's every command, becoming his slave. As the Holy Son of the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, for him to offer such terms showed how truly desperate he was.

But at the brink of life and death, Chang Hao only wanted to survive—nothing else mattered.

"Your strength is too low. What's the point of keeping you?" Yang Kai raised his hand slightly, and under the surge of the Laws of Space, countless tiny spatial rifts appeared around Chang Hao—dense beyond counting.

"Too low..." Chang Hao's expression went blank. For the first time, he felt deeply insulted. Yang Kai was only a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, the same realm as himself, yet he said Chang Hao's cultivation was too low.

Humiliated and furious, Chang Hao screamed hysterically, "I'll fight you to the death!"

As he spoke, his face flushed red, and his Origin Qi suddenly became unstable. A dangerous aura surged from within his body.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's face darkened and he snorted, "Thinking of self-destruction? That depends on whether you get the chance."

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Those countless tiny spatial rifts suddenly seemed to come alive, slicing toward Chang Hao all at once.

After a series of soft, rapid sounds, Chang Hao froze in place, his expression blank and his eyes lifeless. His vitality quickly faded, and the dangerous aura within him vanished as well.

Moments later, with a soft crash, Chang Hao's entire body shattered into countless pieces, scattering across the ground and instantly devoured by the surging void currents.

Just as Chang Xian had demanded before, Chang Hao was now truly torn to pieces.

A Six-Pointed Star Seal shot out from where he had stood, flying straight toward the back of Yang Kai's hand, where it was absorbed by his Seven-Pointed Star Seal as points of starlight.

After finishing off Chang Hao, Yang Kai let out a light breath, his mood slightly improved.

He stood in place, frowning deeply as he recalled the information Yin Lesheng had revealed to him earlier.

Xiaoxiao had actually gone to such a place—something he never could have imagined.

But if Xiaoxiao really had gone there, it was both good and bad. Yang Kai had always worried Xiaoxiao would become a target for others, but if he went there, he wouldn't have to worry, since even cultivators rarely set foot in that place.

Still, that place was full of danger. He didn't know if Xiaoxiao could survive safely there.

It seemed he would have to make a trip to the Eastern Territory.

He secretly decided that once the Shattered Star Sea matter was settled, he would set out to search for Xiaoxiao's whereabouts.

With his mind made up, Yang Kai calmed himself, then turned, his gaze burning as he looked at the Mountain and River Bell.

When the Mountain and River Bell first appeared, dozens of cultivators had eyed it greedily and chased it here. Now, in this Void Passage, only he remained—the rest had left or died. He had plenty of time to try refining the Mountain and River Bell.

Qi Hai had said the Mountain and River Bell was a rare treasure from the Primordial Era, brought out of the ancient wilds by the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor. If he could refine it, this trip to the Shattered Star Sea would be well worth it.

But a treasure like this was never easy to refine.

Yang Kai didn't know how to refine it, so he could only try the method Qi Hai had mentioned before.

Back then, the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor had survived eighty-one strikes from the bell before gaining the Artifact Spirit's approval and taking it from the ancient wilds. Yang Kai could only follow in his footsteps.

Thinking of this, he took a deep breath, brought himself to peak condition, and slowly walked toward the Mountain and River Bell.

For some reason, the Mountain and River Bell's radiance was now subdued, and even the intricate, mysterious patterns on its surface had vanished. It looked like an old, ordinary bell—if tossed before the masses, no one would spare it a glance.

Yet it still gave Yang Kai the feeling of a sleeping dragon, as if once awakened, it would unleash a world-shaking roar.

Soon, Yang Kai arrived before the Mountain and River Bell. To his surprise, even now, the bell showed no reaction.

Holding his breath and focusing all his attention, he carefully reached out and touched the Mountain and River Bell.

The moment Yang Kai's palm touched the bell, it suddenly trembled, and a sound that shook heaven and earth rang out in his mind. That sound carried the aura of the Primordial Era—a destructive force that made Yang Kai dizzy, as if swept away to the ancient wilds by the river of time.

Strange visions flashed one after another in his mind.

In those visions, there were scenes of the sky collapsing and the earth cracking, of tsunamis and sudden storms—like the end of the world, with tides of power surging everywhere.

Mighty giants strode naked, heads touching the sky and feet planted on the earth, moving with pride as all living things fled before them.

The earliest cultivators moved mountains and seas, soared through the sky and burrowed through the earth, wielding great divine powers to battle the disasters of heaven and earth, seeking a sliver of hope.

Countless Divine Spirits fought each other, vying for territory, blood staining the land, shattering the universe and turning heaven and earth upside down.

The world changed in an instant, as if thousands of years passed in a heartbeat.

Yang Kai groaned, as if struck by a mountain, spitting blood and flying backward, sliding ten thousand zhang through the void, his face pale as paper and his breath in chaos.

After a long while, he finally sat cross-legged and began healing himself with his secret arts.

The pain in his mind was unbearable—a wound to the Divine Soul. Anyone else would never recover, only waiting for their soul to wither and die.

Even with the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai found recovery far from easy.

Not only that, but Yang Kai sensed a strange power invading his body with the bell's strike. He couldn't describe it, but it did him no real harm—just gave him a peculiar, hazy feeling.

It took Yang Kai ten days to fully heal his Divine Soul, and he also refined that strange power. He vaguely sensed he had gained something, but it was elusive and hard to grasp.

After opening his eyes, Yang Kai pondered for a while, then got up and approached the Mountain and River Bell again.

Soon, just like the first time, he was blasted away by the bell, spitting blood and nearly losing half his life. He scrambled up and quickly began healing.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai kept repeating this process—blasted away, healing, trying to refine and subdue the bell, then blasted away again, healing...

What he was most grateful for was his powerful physique and the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, a supreme treasure. Without either, he couldn't have kept this up—even if he wasn't killed outright, he'd be left with hidden injuries. But his strong body and the Warm Spirit Lotus let him recover completely.

And as time passed, his recovery grew faster and his injuries lighter each time.

That strange power accumulated, and he gradually realized what kind of power it was.

After two months, Yang Kai could withstand one strike from the bell without harm, though the second would still send him flying.

After three months, he could endure five consecutive strikes.

After half a year, twenty times.

After a year, sixty times! His progress was astonishing.

A year and a half later, one day, Yang Kai looked weathered and worn, his clothes tattered and caked with dried blood, his appearance pitiful—but his aura was stronger and deeper than ever.

Eyes closed, he pressed both hands to the surface of the Mountain and River Bell.

At this moment, the rare treasure from the Primordial Era had returned to how it looked when Yang Kai first saw it, shining brilliantly, with countless intricate patterns swimming across its surface like fish, suffused with the aura of the ancient wilds.

The bell's tolls echoed in Yang Kai's mind, each one enough to make a peak Dao Origin Realm cultivator cough up blood and flee in terror.

Yet Yang Kai's face showed only satisfaction—no pain at all, just the look of someone reaping great rewards.

Boom, boom, boom...

Ten times, twenty times, thirty times... Yang Kai didn't budge.

Fifty times, sixty times, seventy times... His expression finally grew serious, but he was still unharmed.

After seventy strikes, the sound from his Sea of Consciousness made Yang Kai's face turn slightly pale, his Qi and blood surging as if he might collapse at any moment.

But he remained unmoved, enduring the Mountain and River Bell's fierce strikes.

On the eightieth strike, Yang Kai finally groaned, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his body swaying as he nearly flew backward.
