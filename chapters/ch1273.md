## Chapter 1273 — Antidote

After returning, Daiyuan first went to confer with Yang Yan, and once she obtained a token her mood immediately brightened considerably.

Because Yang Yan not only dismantled the natural formation outside her grotto but also altered it, making the formation more complete and usable — its power increased by thirty percent and it gained several additional variations — Daiyuan was overjoyed and secretly astonished at Yang Yan's skill with formations. After this incident their relationship seemed to warm at once, and they began to call each other sisters.

This left Yang Kai greatly puzzled; he could only think that a woman's heart was like a needle at the bottom of the sea — unfathomable and changeable. Previously, the two had been like closed gourds on the road, not speaking for a month, and now, over a single formation, they were inseparable.

Men are not like that.

After she returned, Yang Kai naturally began to ask what she needed his help with, but Daiyuan still hesitated, asking Yang Kai to wait a few more days; she needed to make some preparations and would tell him the truth then.

Hearing this, Yang Kai did not press the matter and quietly waited.

A few hurried days later, Yang Kai was meditating in the stone chamber, cultivating the Demon Blood Threads while projecting his Saint Yuan into a refining furnace. Inside the furnace a scarlet fire bird rolled incessantly, continuously spewing out pure, concentrated fire spiritual qi that scorched and smelted the dragon bone and dragon pearl within.

Although refining the dragon bone and dragon pearl took a long time, whenever he had any spare moment Yang Kai would actively urge the furnace's power to accelerate the process.

He was eager to see what form the dragon bone and dragon pearl would take once they were fused into one.

Just as he was driving his Saint Yuan, a knock suddenly sounded outside. Yang Kai raised his eyelids. After forming another thread of Saint Yuan he took a deep breath, calmed the surge of power, then retrieved the refining furnace and absorbed it back into his body. Only then did he rise, walk to the door, and open the stone gate.

Daiyuan stood there looking charmingly coquettish, inexplicably appearing somewhat anxious and insecure.

When she felt a wave of heat wash from the room she glanced at Yang Kai in surprise, instinctively thinking he was refining pills, but there was no fragrance of pills or medicine in the air, which puzzled her.

Not dwelling on it, Daiyuan asked softly, "May I come in?"

Yang Kai nodded and made room. After Daiyuan entered he closed the door, sat on a stone block in the room, and took the initiative to ask, "Is everything ready?"

"Yes." Daiyuan bit her lip lightly and nodded.

"Then let us begin." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "But before we do, Miss Daiyuan, shouldn't you tell me exactly what you want my help with and how you want me to proceed?"

"That's exactly what I'm here to tell you." Daiyuan glanced at him. Her eyes glistened with moisture, and two faint blushes flushed her cheeks.

This surprised Yang Kai greatly; he couldn't imagine what embarrassing thing she was about to say to show such a reaction.

Daiyuan sat there, uneasy, her small hands twisting together unconsciously. After a long silence she bit her lip and said, "Actually, I asked Junior Brother Yang Kai to come because I need you to remove poison from me."

"Remove the poison?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, astonished. "Daiyuan, you're poisoned? I really didn't notice. What poison have you been afflicted with? If it's convenient, please tell me. Perhaps I really do know how to refine a Pill to counter it.”

"The poison I have cannot be cured by a Pill." Daiyuan heard him and smiled bitterly, shaking her head.

"Oh?" Yang Kai's interest was immediately piqued. When Daiyuan had summoned him to Dragon Lair Mountain before she had indeed said the assistance she needed was related to pill-refining; now that it was detoxification, she had not lied. But Daiyuan saying her poison could not be resolved by a Pill meant the toxin was extraordinary, which naturally drew Yang Kai's attention.

Perhaps because he was an alchemist, Yang Kai wanted to learn more about anything tied to herbs and pills.

“I’m afflicted with the Thousand Illusions Glaze poison!” Daiyuan’s words were shocking. Her expression was grave, without the slightest hint of jest.

"The Thousand Illusions Glaze poison…" Yang Kai was stunned. "Isn't Thousand Illusions Glaze one of your sect's treasures? And I've heard it's an odd material for forging, not something poisonous. How could you have been poisoned by it — how did you come to ingest it?"

Yang Kai was intensely curious, for what Daiyuan said was simply incredible.

Although he did not know much about Thousand Illusions Glaze, he did know that the material itself was not toxic.

"Thousand Illusions Glaze indeed has no toxicity," Daiyuan said with a bitter smile, brushing the hair behind her ear and speaking lowly, "but what if it is swallowed whole?"

Yang Kai's face changed slightly as he stared at Daiyuan, his eyes narrowing.

"Junior Brother, do not doubt me; I truly swallowed the Thousand Illusions Glaze raw, and I've been taking it for many years — ever since I entered the Saint Realm I've continued to take it!" Daiyuan smiled faintly.

"How could this be?" Yang Kai stood dumbfounded. A woman actually ingesting a forging material — wasn't that courting death? Who in their right mind would swallow such a thing?

"I take it for a reason." Daiyuan seemed prepared for Yang Kai's reaction, unsurprised. "The technique I cultivate is called the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique. That technique was created by the founding ancestor of my Liuli Sect based on Glazed Mountain. Almost every generation of Liuli Sect disciples has had someone who cultivates this technique, and in my generation that person is me. Cultivating this technique requires ingesting the Thousand Illusions Glaze."

"Heh, such a strange technique — sounds like nothing good." Yang Kai smirked mockingly.

"Yes, but for the sect it is indispensable, and Qianhuan Peak has always been where those who cultivate this technique reside, hence the name."

"The previous person who lived here also cultivated this technique?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Correct. I grew up beside her; she taught me the technique and should be considered my true master."

"And her fate?" A cold sneer touched Yang Kai's mouth. "It probably wasn't good, was it?"

Yang Kai's question seemed to bring some recollection to Daiyuan, and her expression immediately darkened.

Yang Kai, feeling a bit embarrassed at that, was pondering how to comfort her when Daiyuan suddenly smiled and said, "That was her fate. Since she chose this path, she should not complain. However, when cultivating this technique, until one has achieved a slight success one cannot use the technique's power in combat, otherwise the toxicity will gradually deepen and eventually cannot be expelled, and the path of advancement is fraught with danger — this was the lesson the previous practitioner summed up with her life. If I wish to break through to the Origin Returning Realm, I must rely on Junior Brother Yang Kai's strength to first neutralize the glaze poison that has accumulated in my body over the years; otherwise I will surely die!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly, somewhat understanding why she had traveled so far to Dragon Lair Mountain to beseech his aid.

But Daiyuan's remark that one could not unleash the technique's power in combat before achieving a minor success made him pay attention; it seemed the time he last saw Daiyuan use her skill was by no means her full capability.

Suddenly Yang Kai seemed to recall something and stared at Daiyuan in surprise, "Your cultivation of the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique — surely it involves gathering Thousand Illusions Glaze, doesn't it?"

Such a dangerous technique — Liuli Sect still required someone each generation to cultivate it. Aside from some especially important reasons, they would not do such a thing without cause.

As for what was important to the entire Liuli Sect, Yang Kai could only think of the gathering of Thousand Illusions Glaze!

Hearing Yang Kai's question, Daiyuan's expression changed; she hurriedly waved her hand, "Junior Brother Yang Kai, you can't say that!"

"Uh — I was right?" Yang Kai looked puzzled.

Daiyuan smiled bitterly and did not deny it, nodding, "Indeed. I cultivate the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique precisely because I must go gather Thousand Illusions Glaze. To be frank, since the previous occupant here perished, the sect has had no one able to gather Thousand Illusions Glaze, and I can only collect it once I reach the Origin Returning Realm. This is one of the sect's greatest secrets; you may speak of it before me, but under no circumstances tell anyone else, or trouble will surely follow."

"I understand." Yang Kai hastily nodded, breaking out in a cold sweat at the thought that his offhand words had almost revealed a sect secret.

But... if Daiyuan is so important to Liuli Sect, why was she still neglected here? Shouldn't she be given the best cultivation resources, the finest environment, and the most outstanding seniors to guide her?

It seemed there were still secrets he did not know, Yang Kai guessed inwardly.

"The previous occupant here was a prodigy. She summarized the fates and experiences of many predecessors who cultivated the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique and ultimately devised a very reliable method to resolve the glaze poison. If successful, I will no longer fear the glaze poison and will forever be indebted to her. Unfortunately, when she discovered this method the poison had already penetrated deeply into her body and she could not resolve it herself," Daiyuan explained darkly.

"Does this method require my involvement?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes. It must have an Origin-Grade alchemist assisting at the side, and that alchemist must be supremely skilled, able to control the fusion of various medicinal effects to perfection. I have seen the pills Junior Brother Yang Kai refined before — none were anything but the finest among the finest; a few even nearly developed pill patterns. I believe this requirement is absolutely no problem for you."
