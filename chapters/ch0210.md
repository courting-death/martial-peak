## Chapter 210 — Collision of Mystery-Grade Martial Techniques

In the Separation and Union Realm and the True Essence Realm, although there is only a single stage difference, the distinction is fundamentally significant.

The former contains Primordial Qi, while the latter holds True Essence.

Ten peak Separation and Union Realm warriors might not be able to defeat a single True Essence Realm practitioner of the first layer. The transformation of Primordial Qi into True Essence represents a qualitative leap in a martial artist's strength.

If someone had told this group of Divine Roaming Realm experts before today that a peak Separation and Union Realm warrior could match a first-stage True Essence Realm practitioner, they would have laughed it off. Yet, this scene was unfolding right before their eyes, leaving no room for doubt.

However, it should end here. This group of Divine Roaming Realm experts had sharp eyes and could naturally see that Yang Kai had already exerted all his strength, while Bai Yunfeng still held back some of his power. There was still a noticeable gap between the two.

In the arena, Bai Yunfeng's expression was grim, a cold smile playing on his lips. "Kid, you truly have the capital to be arrogant. I like young talents like you. I’ll give you one last chance—submit to my Bai family and recognize me as your master. I will overlook our previous unpleasantness!"

Yang Kai maintained a serious expression and replied indifferently, "Not interested!"

"Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit, you bring this upon yourself!" Bai Yunfeng lost his patience. As a True Essence Realm expert, he had initially thought he could easily subdue Yang Kai and extract the cultivation method of that martial technique, yet he found himself in such a fierce battle, becoming the laughingstock of others. At this point, he was unwilling to delay any longer.

His True Essence surged, and a layer of milky white light erupted around him as he lunged toward Yang Kai once more, his speed astonishing.

As he charged, the Heavenly Net struck again, countless strands of True Essence forming a massive net that descended upon Yang Kai.

The gap in their realms was too great, and Bai Yunfeng's movement technique was exceptionally outstanding. Yang Kai's self-created footwork gained him no advantage in this battle.

He understood that in this situation, dodging was not the best choice; he could only confront it head-on!

With one hand shaped like a blade, he frantically squeezed the energy within him, Primordial Qi surging forth. He swung his palm-blade toward the Heavenly Net.

The strands of True Essence snapped one by one, unable to approach Yang Kai before being severed.

"Heavenly Net Seal!" Bai Yunfeng remained unfazed, a faint and arrogant smile on his lips. With a push of his hands, a massive palm imprint surged toward Yang Kai's chest.

The change in technique was too rapid; Yang Kai had no time to react before being struck in the chest.

His body flew through the air, and in mid-flight, he spat out a mouthful of blood, staggering as he landed, his complexion pale.

Yet, the onlookers could not help but gasp in astonishment, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. They never expected him to be so resilient. The Bai family's Heavenly Net Seal was a Heaven-Grade martial technique with immense offensive power. This seemingly frail youth had taken the blow without collapsing and still had the strength to continue fighting. How could this not shock them?

Bai Yunfeng, undeterred, did not give Yang Kai any chance to catch his breath and charged forward like the wind.

Yang Kai struggled to resist but was struck again by the Heavenly Net Seal, sending him flying over ten zhang.

To everyone's surprise, Bai Yunfeng also let out a startled cry, quickly retreating. A violent explosion echoed from his chest, and a trickle of bright red blood escaped from the corner of his mouth. The milky white True Essence surrounding him flickered, nearly collapsing.

Bai Yunfeng's face twisted in fury as he growled, "Kid, today you will undoubtedly die!"

The matter of the Mystery-Grade martial technique was no longer relevant. Bai Yunfeng had suffered a setback in front of so many people. His murderous intent surged, wishing to eliminate Yang Kai to vent his frustration.

"Brother Bai, don’t cause a death here!" Dong Qinghan shouted with a frown, "This is someone else's territory, after all."

"Heh heh!" Bai Yunfeng sneered, ignoring Dong Qinghan. He spread his hand, and a chaotic, unstable mass of energy filled with a murderous aura appeared in his palm. Bai Yunfeng frantically infused True Essence into it, causing the energy to swell increasingly.

"Heavenly Net Barrier!" Dong Qinghan's expression changed drastically. He had not expected Bai Yunfeng to have mastered the Bai family's Heavenly Net Barrier. This move was far more powerful than the previous Heavenly Net and Heavenly Net Seal, undoubtedly a secret technique of the Bai family.

Just as he was about to warn Yang Kai to be cautious, he noticed a shimmering starlight erupting from Yang Kai, a violent and unsettling aura radiating from him.

Yang Kai's right hand trembled, as if an uncontrollable force was about to burst forth from him, a dazzling starry sky suddenly appearing in broad daylight.

Star Map!

All eyes turned to Yang Kai, their expressions shifting as they felt the power of the martial technique in his hand.

They had long heard that Yang Kai had severely injured a sixth-tier demon beast with a mysterious martial technique in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. Now, seeing this scene, they understood that this young man was about to unleash it once more.

"Young Master, be careful!" The two Divine Roaming Realm warriors from the Bai family exclaimed, fearing that Bai Yunfeng would suffer losses in this clash, and hurriedly moved to intercept Yang Kai, wanting to eliminate him beforehand.

However, as soon as they moved, two large hands landed on their shoulders, one on each side.

Their bodies froze, and the two Divine Roaming Realm experts found themselves unable to move, as if a towering mountain pressed down upon their shoulders, rendering them incapable of even lifting a finger.

Pale-faced, cold sweat poured down their foreheads, their souls shaken, their hearts racing.

Although these two were only at the fourth or fifth layer of the Divine Roaming Realm, they were still formidable experts. Now, they had been silently subdued, showcasing the strength of the newcomer!

In a small place like Lingxiao Pavilion, how could such terrifying figures appear?

"You young ones are just playing around; us old folks can just watch from the sidelines, no need to intervene," a faint voice came from nearby.

At that moment, the two found they could move again. Startled, they turned to see an old man standing beside them, his face lined with wrinkles, smiling at them.

This person... they recognized him! It was the shopkeeper from the Contribution Hall of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Although they had sensed something unusual about this shopkeeper upon arriving at Lingxiao Pavilion, neither of them had expected his strength to be so formidable!

"What do you think, gentlemen?" Meng Wuya continued to smile.

"Your Excellency speaks... with reason!" The two Bai family experts dared not refute. The overwhelming presence of the other party could take their lives with a snap of the fingers; arguing would be tantamount to seeking death!

This shocking scene unfolded before the eyes of the Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Dong family and Ziwei Valley. These four experts also failed to notice when Meng Wuya had appeared or when he had moved beside the Bai family experts; everything happened so abruptly.

Though the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians of the Dong family were shocked, they remained composed, knowing that their young master was a cousin of Yang Kai and thus had nothing to fear.

On the other hand, the two Divine Roaming Realm experts from Ziwei Valley looked at Meng Wuya with wary eyes, pondering the names of renowned experts in the world, yet they could not match any with Meng Wuya.

"Indeed, this battle is quite intriguing!" Just as the two from Ziwei Valley were puzzled, a strange voice suddenly came from beside them.

Their expressions changed drastically as they turned to look, only to find another old man had appeared beside them without them noticing.

This old man had an ethereal presence, his long beard flowing, dressed in an extremely simple long robe, quietly standing among them.

Another expert!

Though he merely stood there, stroking his beard with a kind smile on his face, the two from Ziwei Valley could still sense that this person had locked onto them with his aura.

Should they make any sudden moves, they would likely face a merciless and frenzied attack!

In this small Lingxiao Pavilion, how could such terrifying figures keep appearing? With these two great experts present, it could be said that the strength of Lingxiao Pavilion was not inferior to that of a first-rate power.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts from Ziwei Valley and the two from the Bai family exchanged glances, both recognizing the shock and helplessness in each other's eyes, sharing a sense of sorrowful understanding.

Swish, swish, swish...

Five more figures descended, the five elders of Lingxiao Pavilion arriving together. They had been alerted by the commotion and intended to investigate, but upon seeing the old man with the goat beard, their faces brightened, and they hurriedly bowed, saying, "We greet the Sect Leader!"

This man was indeed the elusive Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion!

The three major powers had come to visit Lingxiao Pavilion, yet the Sect Leader had never shown his face. For this reason, these experts and several young masters had previously expressed their grievances, speaking ill of the Sect Leader. Now, upon realizing the other's terrifying presence, none of them dared to voice any complaints.

At this level of strength, there was truly no need to regard the young masters of the three major powers, unless the elders from these factions arrived.

Fan Hong, being astute, quickly approached to pay his respects, "Ziwei Valley disciple Fan Hong greets the senior."

The Sect Leader smiled and nodded but did not speak, merely directing his gaze toward the arena.

In this moment of delay, whether it was Yang Kai's Mark of the Stars or Bai Yunfeng's Heavenly Net Barrier, both had reached their peak. The martial techniques of the two bore a striking resemblance, both possessing immense lethality, yet requiring time to build momentum.

In just a few breaths, their momentum had reached its zenith!

"Yang Kai!" Bai Yunfeng roared, his eyes filled with fury as he glared at Yang Kai.

"Come!" Yang Kai remained unafraid, the stars shimmering on his palm as his figure swayed, creating a starry sky around him.

Two terrifyingly powerful energies rapidly converged, then collided.

Such a peak clash of martial techniques made even the Divine Roaming Realm experts feel their eyelids twitch.

It was as if the blazing sun had exploded, the light so bright that one could hardly open their eyes. Yet, under the scrutiny of those Divine Roaming Realm experts' Divine Senses, they could clearly feel that both Yang Kai and Bai Yunfeng's Primordial Qi had suddenly become chaotic, their breaths stalling, a violent noise erupting as they were sent flying in opposite directions.

As the light faded, the two could be heard gasping for breath, a deep pit several zhang in diameter appearing on the ground between them. Yang Kai and Bai Yunfeng stood trembling, each struggling to regain their footing.
