## Chapter 1289 — It Is Her

Speaking of which, Yang Kai had indeed dealt with such things before. Years ago, when he was tempering himself in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave within the Cangyun Evil Land, the evil spirits he encountered were similar to these Yin-Souls. Back then he managed to collect a good number of evil-spirit essences, but sadly the Yin-Soul here left no such traces when it dissipated.

After entering this valley Yang Kai had suspected Yin-Souls might be present, but he had seen nothing along the way and so paid it no mind—he never expected to only encounter one just now.

What made Yang Kai's face grow even grimmer was that the appearance of one Yin-Soul meant there could be a second, a third, even more besides.

Yang Yan's expression showed she had the same thought; her face flickered with unease.

As if to confirm their suspicion, once that Yin-Soul was destroyed wisps of visible yin-cold rose from the earth in all directions, as though startled awake by the soul's shriek.

These streams of yin chill varied in density—some so faint as to be nearly imperceptible, others thick as drifting smoke. Yet regardless of their form, each twisted for a moment before taking shape as a human-like Yin-Soul. Without exception, none possessed clear facial features; some were even missing limbs, making them appear unspeakably eerie.

Seeing this, Yang Yan immediately activated one of her treasure armors and was wrapped in a torrent of scarlet light. Yang Kai said nothing; with a flick of his fingers black Demonic Flame streaked forth, piercing the bodies of those Yin-Souls with deadly precision.

Though the Yin-Souls were many and densely packed, they were fragile. After a single barrage none could withstand it; one by one they were swallowed by Demonic Flame, reduced to ash, and dissipated into the world.

Yang Yan seemed visibly relieved. Her eyes gleamed as she produced a disc-shaped Secret Treasure, poured Saint Yuan into it, and activated its power.

In the next instant a ring of searing red light spread from the disc, rushing outward and driving away the yin-cold wherever it passed. The Yin-Souls that had formed could not resist the blaze; with piercing cries their bodies shattered.

The crimson ring expanded outward for a hundred zhang before gradually losing potency and vanishing. Where the Yin-Souls had once been densely clustered, now they had been entirely wiped out within that ring.

Yang Kai was stunned, staring at Yang Yan in astonishment.

"Hee hee, my newly forged Secret Treasure isn't bad, is it?" Yang Yan said with a proud smile at Yang Kai.

"Mm, it's suited to the present situation, though it's somewhat lacking against a single opponent," Yang Kai replied, his discerning eye immediately spotting the treasure's shortcomings.

Hearing his words, Yang Yan snorted, "I have other Secret Treasures for dealing with a single opponent, I'm just too lazy to fight, humph!"

She seemed displeased that Yang Kai had spoken so plainly.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose and said lightly, "Let's go. Though these Yin-Souls are fragile, there may still be vicious spirits among them—don't be careless."

The two of them continued on their way.

This stretch of sect ruins was truly strange; besides lingering arrays it had spawned so many Yin-Souls. In the days that followed they were attacked several more times by Yin-Souls and hindered by arrays, but these only cost Yang Kai and Yang Yan some effort to overcome—nothing truly dangerous occurred.

They explored the valley for several days. As time passed Yang Yan spent longer each time inspecting the fragment map; as they neared the target it grew increasingly difficult for her to pinpoint the correct location.

One day, while Yang Yan was probing the map, Yang Kai's expression shifted. He extended his Divine Sense outward; after a moment his face turned strange and he frowned, "There are actually people here."

"Who?" Yang Yan asked, startled.

"Not sure, but only four. Two at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and two at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. They seem trapped within some array."

"Want to go take a look? We can ask them what this place actually is," Yang Yan suggested.

Originally Yang Kai did not want to complicate matters—since they were here for treasure he preferred not to meddle. He had no desire to interfere regardless of who those people were or what danger they faced. Yet under his Divine Sense two of the auras felt familiar; he seemed to have met them before.

Curiosity pricked him. After a moment's thought he nodded, "Alright, let's sneak over quietly—just don't reveal our presence."

"Mm," Yang Yan agreed without objection.

They crept toward the spot. Yang Kai's Divine Sense was powerful; by concealing his aura he had no fear of being discovered by cultivators of equal rank.

Yang Yan activated a necklace Secret Treasure she wore and a thin membrane of energy quickly cloaked her, flowing like water. In a blink she seemed to vanish from Yang Kai's sight, leaving only a faint silhouette. Even Yang Kai's Divine Sense couldn't detect her aura unless he stood close enough to see her with the naked eye.

Seeing that, Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

The four were not nearby—some thirty li away—only Yang Kai would dare unleash Divine Sense so freely in a place like this.

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai and Yang Yan arrived beneath an earthen mound and peered out.

On a nearby clearing a semi-circular energy barrier spanned thirty zhang, like a large bowl overturned, and inside four warriors stood at the corners, tense and vigilant. Radiant light flowed about them, Saint Yuan surged; each held a different form of Secret Treasure. Two kept unleashing their treasures' power, striking the semi-circular barrier.

Each blow made the barrier wobble, but the barrier had some trick—it not only confined the four but also reflected their attacks back at them.

After each assault the remaining two had to use defensive Secret Treasures to absorb the reflected energy so their companions would not be injured.

Their cooperation was polished, clearly comrades familiar with one another. No matter how they tried, they could not quickly break the semi-circular barrier, and it was unclear how long they had been trapped; the fluctuations of Saint Yuan within them showed heavy consumption.

"Huh, an array with reflecting properties—this is interesting," Yang Yan brightened, clearly intrigued by the semi-circular array.

Yang Kai frowned, staring at one of the four—a young woman with a pair of almost-speaking peach-blossom eyes—and his expression shifted, "It's her!"

He had sensed two familiar auras earlier and came to investigate, but he had not expected it to be this woman.

That woman was none other than Shen Shitao of the Qiantian Sect. He had no close ties with her, only having met her several times in the Flowing Flame Sandland, but she had seemed convinced he was a man of great fortune and had tried to draw him into acting with her. Before Yang Kai could refuse, Chang Qi, who had been chasing a dragon soul, had shown up; fortune favored her and she followed Yang Kai into an underground Saint Crystal seam.

Later Yang Kai left the underground Saint Crystal seam early, leaving members of the Qiantian Sect and Chang Qi behind to extract Saint Crystal; he did not know how much they ultimately gained.

Judging from Chang Qi's haul they certainly obtained a great deal—at least a hundred million Saint Crystals between them—and they had taken no real risk.

Moreover, Yang Kai had obtained Dragon Bone, Dragon Pearl, and a Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree from that seam; Shen Shitao and the others might likewise have found other valuable treasures.

From a certain angle, she had indeed benefited from Yang Kai's luck and achieved such great gains.

Yang Kai had not expected to encounter Shen Shitao in a place like this. One of the familiar auras belonged to her, and the other came from another delicate-looking woman he had also met—she was at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm and was currently handling defense.

"You know them?" Yang Yan tilted her head and asked softly.

"Barely," Yang Kai nodded.

"So shall we help them?"

"No." Yang Kai shook his head decisively. "This woman is troublesome. It's better they don't discover us. This array doesn't seem overly vicious—it likely can only trap them for a day or two. They'll come out on their own."

"But I want to study it..." Yang Yan's words trailed off as her beautiful eyes suddenly narrowed and she looked toward a spot not far from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai also sensed it and turned his head; his face immediately darkened.

Not far off several Yin-Souls were drifting toward them, seemingly attracted by the commotion, and their path would pass by the very mound where Yang Kai and Yang Yan hid.

Yang Kai was furious; he silently signaled Yang Yan and prepared to withdraw.

Unbeknownst to them, the moment they moved those Yin-Souls seemed to sense it. They all turned toward the mound, howled, and lunged forward with murderous ferocity.

Though Yang Kai and Yang Yan's concealment was near-perfect and would not be detected by Saint King cultivators, to these Yin-Souls any living creature gave off a trace of vitality they could sense.

Seeing this, a cold killing intent flashed in Yang Kai's eyes. He spread his hand to snatch at the nearest Yin-Soul while his other hand spat forth several jets of Demonic Flame that shot out in all directions.
