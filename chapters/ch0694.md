## Chapter 694 — Qixiu Peak

This peak was extraordinarily beautiful. At its summit, waterfalls cascaded like veils of rain, mountain streams surging as though a celestial river had overturned and come crashing down. Mist curled in the air, carrying with it a freshness that washed over them.

Fei Yu led Yang Kai through that slanting waterfall, emerging before a cave halfway up the mountain.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath, his body and mind relaxing as he probed with sensation, only to find there was not a single person inside.

"This is Qixiu Peak, where I live. Among our four great Guardians each has his or her own peak; theirs are always lively, but I dislike the noise, so I live alone. Come on," she said, guiding Yang Kai into the cave.

The cave's interior was exceedingly spacious, dry and neat; within the mountain's belly, a series of stone chambers had been exquisitely hewn, and the stone walls were dotted with strange stones that emitted a faint glow.

Not a trace of any unpleasant smell could be detected here; instead the air was filled with a light, pleasant fragrance.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue in admiration. He had assumed a woman like Fei Yu, who adored drink, would have no delicate airs of femininity, yet her residence proved so refined.

"Little junior nephew, why don't you live here with me from now on? Senior Aunt is alone and it feels lonely," Fei Yu suddenly said, and Yang Kai could not tell if she was joking.

"Me, live here?"

"Yes. Before I had you placed in the valley because we didn't know your background. Since you count as a disciple of Tianxiao Sect, you have the right to choose a peak to live on. And if you refine pills, you'd need a quiet, comfortable environment, right? My place is good; Cang Yan and the others have people coming and going all the time and would certainly disturb you."

"The conditions here are indeed good." Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

"Think it over; Senior Aunt is serious." Fei Yu smiled sweetly, a flush warming her face like a ripe fruit.

Winding through the mountain's interior, they soon arrived, following Fei Yu, at an open courtyard.

Though Fei Yu had mocked Cang Yan and his lot for being only interested in her Thousand Red Flower Wine, here she enthusiastically set things up, arranging tables and chairs, bringing out several jars of her own Thousand Red Flower Wine and producing some treasured spirit fruits.

No sooner had she finished than hurried footsteps sounded nearby, and Cang Yan, Li Wan and another tall, lean man strode in.

"I smell liquor!" Li Wan's thick, heavy brows twitched lecherously as he exaggeratedly sniffed the air.

Cang Yan came proudly forward with a demonic beast on his back that Yang Kai had never seen before.

When they saw the jars on the table they both smiled knowingly and licked their lips, "Fei Yu really is a good girl."

Fei Yu's expression turned cold as she snapped, "One jar each, finish it and get out!"

"Alright, alright!" Li Wan hastened to agree, scooping up a jar and refusing to let go.

Yang Kai quietly evaluated the third man — likely the last of Tianxiao Sect's four Guardians. Also a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm expert, but Yang Kai keenly observed that whereas Cang Yan's presence was oppressive, Fei Yu's was gentle, and Li Wan's sly, this man's aura felt particularly fierce.

The man seemed to be watching him as well, then suddenly grinned, "So this is the new little junior nephew?"

The grin nearly made Yang Kai laugh.

Because this fellow actually had an exaggerated set of buckteeth.

He had thought Li Wan lecherous enough, but compared to this man he felt like a small pest before a greater one.

The two members of Tianxiao Sect's leadership truly had distinctive personalities.

"Yang Kai greets Senior Uncle!" Yang Kai saluted with full seriousness.

Fei Jian nodded slightly, then adopted the posture of drawing a bow and fitting an arrow.

Hummm……

The world seemed to shudder; the surrounding Spiritual Qi stilled.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened instinctively; at that moment he felt the chill of a venomous snake's gaze, an unavoidable threat.

Cang Yan, Fei Yu and Li Wan remained silent, merely smiling as they watched.

Fei Jian forefinger twitched, and with a whoosh an invisible attack shot straight toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's eyes widened. A surging torrent of True Yuan burst out of him as he thundered a fierce punch forward.

Boom……

Energy revolved chaotically, True Yuan buckled, and yet Yang Kai's body did not move.

The four Guardians brightened at once.

Fei Jian, baring his buckteeth, said, "Not bad. Cang Yan told me your strength exceeded that of most in the Divine Roaming Realm; I had my doubts, but now it seems our Tianxiao Sect has another pillar of talent."

"Senior Uncle uses arrows?" Yang Kai's eyes flickered.

Fei Jian nodded slightly, "Yes."

Fei Yu leaned in and whispered in Yang Kai's ear, "He's a treacherous sort — never fights face-to-face, hiding in the dark so no one can avoid his sharp arrows. If you want to learn how to be underhanded, pick his brain."

Yang Kai nodded; he understood Fei Jian's attack had been only a probe, devoid of hostility, yet even such an attack had nearly exceeded what he could endure.

Each of Tianxiao Sect's four Guardians was not to be underestimated.

"Appearance follows the heart," Fei Yu suddenly laughed with mock significance.

"Hey, watch your words." Li Wan immediately took offense.

"Enough, enough, no more talk. I've waited fifty years for this Thousand Red Flower Wine—drink!" Cang Yan strode forward, grabbed a jar, broke the seal and guzzled a mouthful, his face flushing as he praised, "Fine wine."

Seeing his hearty enjoyment, Li Wan and Fei Jian could no longer restrain themselves and joined in at once.

Yang Kai sat to one side, eating a spirit fruit slowly, watching their liberality and felt a warmth well up in his chest.

The Senior Aunt and Uncles must be close; any quarrels and roughhousing were merely catalysts to deepen their bonds.

After several rounds the guests had all lost decorum and no longer looked like Transcendent Realm experts.

Fei Yu's skin flushed; drunk, she glanced at Yang Kai and casually tossed a jar of her wine his way with a coquettish laugh, "Little junior nephew, have a drink."

Yang Kai caught it, looked at her, and, in the spirit of the moment, drained a mouthful.

There was no sharp bite of strong liquor—only soft, mellow fragrance—but before he could praise it a searing heat spread from his lower abdomen like a roaring flame.

Yang Kai's face changed; he felt his flesh and meridians writhe, invisible shocks rampaging within his body. In an instant he lost control; his body stiffened and he fell backward.

Fei Yu's reflexes were swift; she snatched the jar away from Yang Kai.

The four Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm experts looked at one another, then burst into laughter.

They laughed for a while, then resumed drinking without paying Yang Kai any heed.

…………

When Yang Kai woke again, all was quiet; Cang Yan and the others had already gone, leaving a scene of wreckage. Fei Yu lay slouched on a nearby chair, languid, one jade arm propping her head, eyes glassy with drunkenness as she gazed at Yang Kai.

"Awake?" Fei Yu smiled faintly.

Yang Kai's face reddened as he nodded slightly.

He had not expected that Thousand Red Flower Wine to be so potent; though it lacked a strong alcoholic burn, the energy contained within was vast.

"How do you feel?"

"Seems... pretty good." Yang Kai cautiously checked himself and discovered his True Yuan was flowing inside him, swift and fierce; his flesh and meridians were undoubtedly firmer than before.

"Good. As for that jar I gave you, you may drink at most three sips a month—don't overdo it, it's bad for you. I'm going to sleep a bit; you can do as you like." Fei Yu smiled and then added, "Oh, I told Cang Yan and the others; from now on you'll live on Qixiu Peak. They'll send over medicinal materials so you can refine pills."

"Understood." Yang Kai replied.

In the next moment Fei Yu closed her lovely eyes and her breathing grew even; it seemed she had been forcing herself awake to keep an eye on Yang Kai.

After sitting cross-legged for a long time and absorbing the remaining medicinal effects, Yang Kai stood and began tidying the scattered trash.

Two hours later Fei Yu slowly stirred awake and, with no concern for decorum, stretched and yawned in front of Yang Kai, her lithe curves exposed in that languid pose.

"Come with me; I'll find you a suitable place to cultivate." Fei Yu beckoned and strode deeper into the mountain.

The farther into the mountain they went, the denser Yang Kai felt the Spiritual Qi become.

Before long a crystal-bright stone chamber suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

The chamber's walls and floor were entirely paved with Crystal Stone, and within those crystals faint array patterns shimmered; Heaven-and-Earth Energy flowed ceaselessly into the room. Standing inside, Yang Kai felt warm and comfortable as if he needed do nothing at all—the world's energy would continually stream into him and bolster his strength.

This truly was a Sacred Land for cultivation.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe and discovered the chamber's crystal paving was not single-layered—there were at least a dozen layers, with a thickness exceeding one or two zhang.

To expend so much Crystal Stone to fashion such a chamber was no small gesture.

Staring dazedly at the chamber before him, Yang Kai was struck by astonishment.

"Is this all right?" Fei Yu asked.

"Was this where you usually cultivated?" Yang Kai noticed an obvious mark on a spot in the chamber where one might sit for long-term meditation. "If I live here, what will you do?"

"I won't need it for now." Fei Yu smiled at his question. "When I someday comprehend the mysteries of entering the Saint Realm, then I might need this place."

The four Guardians' corporeal cultivations had long since reached the pinnacle of the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, but they were unable to perceive the subtleties of the Saint Realm and thus could not break through the limits of their mentality to ascend.

If the four Guardians could advance into the Saint Realm, Tianxiao Sect's strength would increase substantially!

"Don't feel burdened; the chamber would just stay unused." Fei Yu said with a gentle smile.

Yang Kai nodded, "Then I won't be polite."

"Here you need worry about nothing but cultivation. If you get bored, come find me; I'm usually on Qixiu Peak. If you can't find me, seek out Cang Yan and the others — they should have plenty to teach you." Fei Yu gave him these instructions, then quickly vanished.
