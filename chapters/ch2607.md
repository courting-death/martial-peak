## Chapter 2607 — Ji Yao

Yang Kai's stern shout echoed through the side hall. Tianlong and the other maids exchanged glances, thinking, "Could this really work? That disciple of yours must have lost her mind..."

But to their surprise, as soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, a faint sound came from behind one of the pillars. A dirty head poked out, but the eyes alone were bright and clear.

"Master, why are you here?" the Third Disciple seemed startled, hurriedly running out from behind the pillar.

Yang Kai swept a cold gaze over, putting on a stern expression, but soon couldn't help but grunt awkwardly, not knowing where to look.

What he saw was that the Third Disciple had been stripped completely naked, her body mottled with patches of white and black, making for a striking sight. When she wore that set of tattered clothes, it wasn't obvious, but now, with nothing on, her full and curvy figure was on full display. Some of her snow-white skin nearly blinded Yang Kai!

She, however, seemed completely unaware, coming right up to Yang Kai and standing there, looking uneasy and nervous.

"Uh..." Yang Kai scratched his chin, looking up at the ceiling, and said awkwardly, "I heard you were causing trouble again, so I came to check on you."

Third Disciple said sheepishly, "Master, don't be angry. I was just playing around with them."

"Mm." Yang Kai quickly waved his hand. "If it was just playing around, then hurry up and go wash yourself."

"Yes!" Third Disciple answered, and with a shake of her delicate body, she leapt into the huge hot spring, splashing water everywhere.

Yang Kai secretly breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed the Third Disciple still recognized him as her master, which saved him a lot of trouble.

Tianlong and the other maids stood to the side, their expressions odd. They couldn't figure out what was going on with this strange master and disciple pair. If they were truly master and disciple, why was the disciple so unreserved in front of her master? Could there be some unspeakable relationship between them?

That would be against all propriety. Just thinking about it made the maids' hearts restless.

"Hurry up and help her wash. I'll wait outside!" Yang Kai was so embarrassed he wanted to disappear. He said this and tried to escape the scene.

But Tianlong called out anxiously, "Sir Yang, what if your disciple acts up again after you leave?"

That was exactly what had happened before. When they brought the Third Disciple over from Yang Kai, everything was fine. But in the blink of an eye, she lost her mind, and only returned to normal when Yang Kai arrived.

Tianlong was truly afraid it would happen again. After all, the Third Disciple was a girl. It was one thing for her master to see her like that, but if someone else saw, how could she go on living?

Yang Kai frowned slightly, helplessly asking, "Then what should we do?"

Tianlong smiled and said, "Your disciple seems quite afraid of you, Sir Yang. Why not wait here? With you present, she probably won't act up again."

Yang Kai was silent for a while. He knew it wasn't ideal, but there was no better solution. He could only nod and tell Tianlong and the others to hurry up.

Turning his back to the hot spring, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, holding two Upper-Level Source Crystals in his hands, and began to cultivate.

Soon, the sound of splashing water and the Third Disciple's giggles came from behind, making it hard not to let one's mind wander.

After half an hour had passed, Yang Kai, deep in meditation, was finally roused by a gentle call of "Master." Opening his eyes, he saw before him a radiant young woman, her features delicate and refined, long black hair cascading like a waterfall, lips rosy and teeth gleaming white. She possessed an elegant bearing, and perhaps because she had just bathed, a faint blush lingered on her fair cheeks, giving her an alluring glow.

Her light blue dress fit her perfectly, accentuating her curves. A faint fragrance wafted over, delighting the senses.

The woman looked about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, like a young married lady, but her real age was certainly more. It was just that Ice Heart Valley's techniques were excellent for maintaining youth.

"Third Disciple?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, a bit amazed. He hadn't expected that with a little tidying up, Third Disciple could be so eye-catching, completely unrecognizable from her previous dirty appearance.

"Master!" Third Disciple greeted respectfully.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded slightly, stood up, and with a wave of his sleeve said, "Come with me."

Third Disciple said nothing, obediently following behind.

After what had happened earlier, Yang Kai didn't dare let Third Disciple stay alone anymore, afraid her mind would wander again. With him around, at least she could stay clear-headed.

He brought the Third Disciple back to his own residence, went up to the second floor, and told her to meditate and cultivate. Only then did he take out the Purple Void Cauldron and the various herbs he had collected earlier.

Emperor Yuan circulated, flames rose in the Purple Void Cauldron, and as Divine Sense surged, the Divine Sense Fire poured in as well, adjusting the heat.

Then, Yang Kai methodically added the herbs one by one, refining the medicinal liquid.

The Third Disciple watched from the side, full of questions, but not daring to interrupt.

After a full hour, Yang Kai suddenly formed a series of seals with his hands, sending them into the Purple Void Cauldron.

Moments later, he slapped the cauldron, and as the lid flew off, several Spiritual Pills shot out, which Yang Kai caught and put into a prepared jade bottle.

Examining the quality of the pills he had refined, Yang Kai frowned slightly.

This batch had produced only five pills. Not only were there no Pill Patterns, but even the quality was lacking.

For him, although this batch was a success, it was far from what he had hoped for.

But Yang Kai quickly let it go. After all, these were Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills. Although he had become an Imperial-Grade Alchemist long ago, he had spent the past few years constantly on the move, never having time to settle down and refine pills, so he was a bit rusty.

As long as he had enough materials to practice, Yang Kai believed he could still refine good Spiritual Pills.

Putting away the five pills, Yang Kai cleaned out the residue from the Purple Void Cauldron and started another batch.

Half a day later, after Yang Kai had collected another six Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills. The Third Disciple, who had been watching all along, finally couldn't hold back and exclaimed, "Master, when did you learn to refine pills?"

She looked completely confused and shocked. In her memory, her master had never dabbled in alchemy, but from what she saw now, not only could she refine pills, but they were all Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills!

In other words, her master was actually an Imperial-Grade Alchemist!

How many Imperial-Grade Alchemists were there in the entire Star Realm? Each one was extremely esteemed, and only the top sects might be lucky enough to have one.

Ice Heart Valley had once invited an Imperial Alchemist to serve as a Guest Elder, spending huge resources every year to keep him. Whenever that Guest Elder wanted something, the Ice Heart Valley would always oblige.

But after her master suddenly disappeared, the Ice Heart Valley's strength declined, and that Guest Elder left for greener pastures.

Now, if the Ice Heart Valley wanted Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills, they had to either pay a huge price to buy them or ask an alchemist from another sect to refine them, which was extremely inconvenient and costly.

But now, her master was actually an Imperial Alchemist! How could the Third Disciple not be shocked?

Hearing this, Yang Kai smiled and said, "I've had some opportunities while traveling these years."

"Oh." Third Disciple believed him and nodded quietly.

As Yang Kai tossed herbs into the cauldron, he said, "Third Disciple, cultivate well. When I'm done refining, I'll give you some pills."

"Thank you, Master," Third Disciple said quickly, but then frowned and asked, "Master, why do you keep calling me Third Disciple?"

Yang Kai paused for a moment, then quickly returned to normal and said lightly, "You're my third disciple. What else should I call you?"

Yang Kai thought to himself, "I don't even know your real name. What else can I call you?"

Third Disciple pouted, "Master, you used to call me Yao'er. My full name is Ji Yao."

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh and said, "Maybe I haven't seen you in so long, I forgot what I used to call you. I'll call you Yao'er from now on."

The Third Disciple giggled, "Master, you really know how to joke."

"Alright, keep cultivating. I still have work to do, so don't disturb me."

"Yes!"

As soon as she finished, she obediently closed her eyes and began meditating.

Yang Kai secretly glanced at her, sighing inwardly. He wondered if, when Ji Yao eventually recovered, she would hold this day against him.

Pretending to be Bing Yun to take advantage of her was one thing—there were reasons for it—but seeing her entire body was not something that could be easily resolved. After all, it concerned a woman's reputation.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai shivered, quickly composed himself, and continued refining pills.

Time passed.

Yang Kai stayed in the Fengluo Palace for about ten days, spending the whole time refining pills.

Just as he had expected, with plenty of materials to practice with, the quality and quantity of his Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills steadily improved. During this time, he even produced six or seven pills with Pill Patterns, which surprised him.

He had always had a talent for alchemy, and later, on Shuiyue Star, the main star of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, he triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone and was taught the art of alchemy by the Heavenly Dao, gaining a glimpse of the alchemical path.

He had a unique advantage in alchemy. In this respect, even Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang's Medicinal Spirit Saint Body couldn't compare.

In ten days, he refined a huge pile of Spiritual Pills of all kinds, most of them for cultivation support.

Yang Kai gave some to Third Disciple, secretly hoping that when she recovered, she would let bygones be bygones for the sake of these pills.

Third Disciple was overjoyed at the "reward," repeatedly thanking Yang Kai, which made him feel guilty, though he dared not show it.

Another five days passed, and Yang Kai's success rate with Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills was nearly perfect. Each batch produced almost nine pills, their quality greatly improved, and the number with Pill Patterns multiplied.

With such skill and proficiency, refining a Life Origin Pill would be no problem at all.
