## Chapter 1018 — Be a Beast, Be a Horse?

The mountain interior where the Ghost Ancestor lived had been carved into a number of enormous stone chambers, each occupying a considerable area and piled with a jumble of miscellaneous items; no one knew where the Ghost Ancestor had obtained them.

The air was dry, and the chambers were dotted with strange stones that emitted a soft glow, making the light here bright.

This peak seemed to sit at the very center of the Floating Continent; within the mountain, passageways leading in all directions converged into a grand formation that drew the continent's dense Spiritual Qi toward this place.

The measures Yang Kai had arranged in the cave ten thousand li away looked somewhat childish and laughable compared to the Ghost Ancestor's methods.

A small stream ran through those chambers, its clear spring water flowing slowly; it was no ordinary brook but spiritual water condensed purely from Spiritual Qi—one sip equaled drawing on vast Heaven-and-Earth Energy and greatly benefited one's cultivation.

Yang Kai carried He Zao and He Miao into the mountain's depths; sweeping his Divine Sense around, he was slightly moved—this cultivation environment was simply superb; no wonder the Ghost Ancestor had chosen it as his residence.

He also detected the peculiarity of the stream, clicking his tongue in wonder, and followed its course deeper into the mountain.

Since Yang Kai had hoisted He Zao onto his shoulder, she had not said a word; He Miao, however, trembled in fear—she thought Yang Kai, this shameless scoundrel, really intended to do something disgraceful to her.

Yue Xi's heart-wrenching shouts and curses still echoed in her ears; her voice was hoarse, and no one paid her any heed.

Before long Yang Kai stopped. He picked a random stone chamber, walked in, and set He Zao and He Miao down.

He Miao immediately hopped behind her sister like a rabbit, clutching her lapel with her hand and looking at Yang Kai in terror. In a trembling voice she asked, "What are you going to do? You won't do anything to us, will you?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai smiled wickedly.

He Miao couldn't help shivering and grew even more panicked.

"Stop playing." He Zao looked at Yang Kai calmly, her brows knitting into a line. "Is it amusing? Even if you have a grudge against Master, you shouldn't torment her like this—it's too cruel."

"Cruel?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and sneered. "Someone like your master deserves to be taught a lesson. You've been by her side a long time—surely you know what faults she has, don't you?"

He Zao frowned and sighed softly. "Master can indeed be stubborn and won't admit fault sometimes. Like the other day—she clearly knew she shouldn't have treated you with excessive suspicion and difficulty and should have apologized to you. She was grateful you saved us, but she still couldn't bring herself to humble herself."

"That's because my strength was low and she didn't take me seriously." Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

"Master isn't a bad person, she..."

"Don't defend her; she once intended to kill me and must pay the price! I will judge her life or death based on how she acts."

He Zao's delicate body trembled; she looked at Yang Kai with evident unease. "You mean to kill Master?"

"Judging by her attitude, I will not allow anyone who harbors enmity toward me to live in this world!" Yang Kai's expression turned cold. "Even if she is your master, she will not be spared! If you seek vengeance over this, I will show no mercy."

"Wouldn't that put us in a difficult position?" He Zao forced a bitter smile.

"That's precisely why I brought you in!" Yang Kai said, then used his Divine Sense to communicate with the Ghost Ancestor.

After a moment, the evil energy binding He Zao and He Miao dissipated, and they regained their freedom.

"Find a place to cultivate for now; don't think about going out—you won't be able to!" Yang Kai instructed, then left.

After Yang Kai departed, He Miao peeked out cautiously, drew a deep breath, and patted her chest with her small hand. "That scared me to death—I thought he really was going to..."

He Zao laughed. "What did you imagine he was going to do?"

He Miao's face flushed red and she fell silent, embarrassed.

"He's not that sort of person. He brought us in partly to punish Master, and partly so we'd benefit."

"Benefit?" He Miao exclaimed in astonishment.

"Didn't we put in a good word for him when the Ghost Ancestor wanted to toss him into the Void Passage?" He Zao smiled, and the once barren chamber seemed to brighten. "He's a man who sees favors and grudges clearly; bringing us here must be to let us cultivate."

"Is that so? I still find him terrifying." He Miao wore a lingering look of dread; remembering Yang Kai's appearance filled her with a deep fear—she thought him excessively cruel.

"What about Master?" He Miao asked, still able to hear Yue Xi's shouts and curses; that hoarse, aggrieved voice replayed in her ears, making her anxious.

He Zao smiled mysteriously and produced the communication compass Secret Treasure; the two sisters exchanged a glance and their eyes brightened.

He Zao poured Divine Sense into the Secret Treasure and sent a message to their master to inform her of their current situation.

In another chamber, Yang Kai found a spot to sit cross-legged and ponder his plans.

Although he and the Ghost Ancestor had reached an agreement, he had no certainty he could rip open the void and leave this continent.

When the Ghost Ancestor had pursued him earlier, he had several times used the method of tearing space, but each time he only reappeared somewhere on this continent and did not reach the Starry Sky, which left him helpless.

If that method failed to work, the Ghost Ancestor would surely not spare him; then he would die more miserably than anyone else.

Fortunately he could stall for a while; Yang Kai felt he had to find a solution quickly—at the very least he needed to give the Ghost Ancestor some hope.

Hearing Shen Tu's calls from outside, Yang Kai's expression shifted and he looked up. "Senior, may my friend come in?"

"Bring whoever you want! There are plenty of chambers here," the Ghost Ancestor's voice sounded.

Yang Kai nodded and sent his Divine Sense out to inform Shen Tu.

Shortly after, Shen Tu entered carrying large bundles. He walked through the place in a casual sweep, clicking his tongue in admiration, clearly impressed by the cultivation environment.

He came to Yang Kai's chamber and gently set down the things he carried. "Everything Purple Star's people collected during this time is all here; Lü Guichen left nothing behind."

"And Saint Crystals!" A striking figure appeared behind Shen Tu—beautiful Bi Ya smiled and stepped before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stared at her for a moment, then glanced at Shen Tu.

Shen Tu shrugged. "She insisted on coming along—otherwise I couldn't have moved all this by myself."

"Young man... I came over just to say I'm sorry." Bi Ya put on a pitiable look, her eyes glistening as if about to weep; like a girl who'd done something wrong she bit her soft red lips and pleaded, "Please be magnanimous and don't fuss over past matters, okay?"

Her voice was sweet and pleasant, and her eyes were full of plaintive regret.

There seemed to be deep remorse in those eyes, making people feel she truly repented and stirring a desire to protect and forgive her earlier deeds.

Shen Tu shuddered beside her and rubbed his arm, complaining, "Damn, you give me goosebumps! Can't you speak normally instead of cooing like that?"

Bi Ya glared at him fiercely, then smiled at Yang Kai. "I know I'm a lowly woman, but if you don't despise me, I will obey only you from now on—doing your bidding, serving you as your beast and your horse, with no complaints."

Shen Tu was surprised. "You admit you're lowly too?"

Bi Ya's features twitched; she looked as if she wished she could choke Shen Tu, but restrained herself before Yang Kai and scowled.

"Be a beast and a horse?" A playful smile crept across Yang Kai's mouth.

Bi Ya bowed her head deeply. "I'm sincere."

"What do you want?" Yang Kai asked.

"To live," Bi Ya answered simply.

"Fine. For your honesty, you may follow me from now on!" Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Bi Ya's eyes immediately shone with delight. Overjoyed, she said, "Thank you, young man. I will serve you wholeheartedly and won't let you down... um, what should I call you from now on... Master, is that all right?"

A flush rose on her face, a mixture of bashfulness and sincerity that was somewhat touching.

Shen Tu could not help staring and kept shaking his head. "Woman, you really can act—if I didn't know your background, I might have been fooled."

Anyone who saw her like that would probably feel some pity and lower their guard.

"You two enjoy yourselves; I won't disturb you," Shen Tu said, then asked, "Yang Kai, can I find a place to live here?"

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Thanks!" Shen Tu grinned, and just as he was about to leave Yang Kai tossed him a jade flask which he caught. "What's this?"

"A bottle of Saint Pills! For cultivation."

Shen Tu laughed loudly. "Brother, you're generous. Do as you please—I will seal my Divine Sense to ensure I don't hear any commotion."

He said this with meaning and soon disappeared from sight.

"Master... shall I give you a shoulder rub? You look so tired!" Bi Ya's coquettish gaze fell on Yang Kai; a flush rose at the base of her long, fair neck and even her breathing became warmer.

Saying this, she ignored whether Yang Kai agreed and moved behind him, sitting cross-legged and pressing her body close; her delicate hands rested on his shoulders and began to knead.

Her movements were as gentle as water, like tending a lover; the pressure was just right. A strange energy transmitted through her fingertips stimulated Yang Kai's body, easing his exhaustion from pursuit by the Ghost Ancestor in an instant—he suddenly felt vigorous and spirited.
