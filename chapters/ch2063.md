## Chapter 2063 — Tracking

After a long while, someone snorted in anger and said, “This Yang Kai has truly no regard for others, daring to come to my Jiang Family and make a scene.”

The speaker was none other than Jiang Chuhe, the rising star of the new generation.

When he first saw Yang Kai at the Dragon Ascension Altar on the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, everyone present had been mere practitioners training there; no one expected that upon meeting him again today he would have become a Master Alchemist whose presence even the Family Head and the elders could not ignore.

His status had risen so suddenly that he felt extremely uncomfortable—earlier negotiations had left him no opportunity to interject.

Moreover, Yang Kai had not once glanced his way since arriving at the Jiang Family, plainly showing contempt for him!

“Indeed, he even had the nerve to threaten us in the end; he truly is unbearable,” an elder who had spoken earlier said, his face darkening.

Jiang Lin snorted coldly and said, “This is not a place to discuss matters. Come with me.”

With that, he stood up at once.

The others hurried to follow.

A short while later, in a private chamber of the Jiang Family, everyone gathered. Jiang Lin swept his gaze over them before asking, “Elders, is the person Master Alchemist Yang seeks there?”

One man sighed when he heard this: “Someone at the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm should be around that level. As you know, Family Head, the people we were searching for recently were mostly of that cultivation; it is likely they indeed took Master Alchemist Yang’s friend there.”

Another elder rose, clasped his fist and said, “I do have some recollection of that young girl…”

“Oh?” Jiang Lin glanced at that elder and asked, “So you’re saying she really was brought in?”

"Yes." The elder nodded slightly. "That day two of our clan’s disciples saw the girl alone in the city, standing in one place for a whole month, so they concluded she had no family. After some inquiry they discovered she truly had no background or backing in Fenglin City, so they brought her into the Jiang Family and I had her sent to the mine with the others."

He paused, rubbing his temple. “I wouldn’t have thought she knew Master Alchemist Yang. It seems the person she waited for in the city must have been Yang Kai. Had I known, how could I have sent her to the mine?”

“If she’s indeed with us, what are we to do now?” someone demanded angrily.

“Handing her over is impossible. The mine’s minerals are extraordinarily rare; they are the hope of the Jiang Family’s rise. The mine’s affairs must never be leaked. If we bring her back, the mine’s secret will be exposed. If the City Lord’s Mansion finds out… the Jiang Family will be doomed!”

“If we can’t bring her back, then the only option…” another said in a grim tone.

All eyes turned to Jiang Lin.

Jiang Lin looked utterly vexed. After all, Yang Kai had said that if the Jiang Family could return Zhang Ruoxi safely, he would refine pills for the Jiang Family for a month!

Losing such an opportunity pained Jiang Lin deeply.

“Family Head, you must not hesitate. Yang Kai said he set a restriction on the girl; as long as the distance isn’t too great he can sense it. If Yang Kai detects her position, the mine’s secret cannot remain hidden. Compared to the mine, what is the value of a Void King-Grade Upper-Level alchemist refining pills for a month? Moreover, this matter touches on the City Lord’s interests. If the City Lord’s Mansion learns of it, where could the Jiang Family still stand in Fenglin City?”

“Indeed, Family Head, there can be no more hesitation.”

Faced with their urging, Jiang Lin heaved a sigh, evidently having made a decision. He looked at one of the elders and said, “Fifth Elder, handle this matter. Make sure it is done cleanly.”

The Fifth Elder clasped his fist and replied, “Leave it to me; you can rest assured.”

“Dismissed.” Jiang Lin waved his hand. “For the time being, none of you are to go to the mine’s location. Tell those there to act cautiously so Yang Kai can’t discover any clue.”

“Yes!” the assembled responded in a roar.

……

After leaving the Jiang Family, Yang Kai’s expression was as dark as water.

Mo Xiaoqi said, “I can’t shake the feeling there’s something wrong with those Jiang Family people—Ruoxi might truly be in their hands.”

“That’s likely.” Yang Kai recalled the expression of one Jiang Family elder during their earlier exchange and had already formed a suspicion. “But she definitely isn’t inside the Jiang Family’s inner halls. Where could she be, and why would they hide her?”

Yang Kai could not make sense of it.

While he was pondering, Mo Xiaoqi suddenly clapped her hands as if remembering something and said, “Hey, Eldest Brother Yang, do you have anything that Ruoxi used?”

“Something she used?” Yang Kai frowned. “For what?”

“If you have something she used, I might be able to trace her location.”

“Really?” Yang Kai brightened.

“Yes, but it must carry her scent—something she used frequently, like clothing or hair.” Mo Xiaoqi tilted her head.

“I don’t have such things, but…”

“But what?”

“There is a place that surely has them.” Yang Kai’s mouth quirked and he beckoned, “Come with me!”

With those words, Origin Qi wrapped Mo Xiaoqi up and they streaked off like a gale toward a certain direction.

When Yang Kai exerted his power, Mo Xiaoqi instantly sensed it and looked at him in surprise. “Eldest Brother Yang, have you advanced to the Dao Origin Realm?” she asked.

She had not been paying much attention to Yang Kai’s changes, and with Yang Kai deliberately concealing his aura she had failed to notice his breakthrough.

Yang Kai nodded. “I had some opportunities recently and was fortunate enough to break through.”

“Eldest Brother Yang, you’re amazing!” Mo Xiaoqi admired him sincerely.

Yang Kai waved his hand. “The Dao Origin Realm is nothing. You’ll be able to breakthrough soon as well.”

Mo Xiaoqi giggled, seeming filled with confidence.

Before long, Yang Kai brought Mo Xiaoqi to a manor located three hundred li outside Fenglin City.

It was the Zhang Family’s residence.

Yang Kai did not have any items Ruoxi had used, but the Zhang Family certainly did.

He had Mo Xiaoqi wait outside while he slipped into the Zhang mansion alone.

He did not disturb the Zhang Family’s old housekeeper or the beautiful woman there; since the matter concerned Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai did not wish to cause them worry.

His Divine Sense swept through; he found the Zhang estate tranquil. Although there were many restrictions, how could the measures of a small family stop him? After advancing to the Dao Origin Realm, his Divine Sense was far stronger than before.

He easily avoided the many protections and entered Zhang Ruoxi’s chamber.

Looking around, the room was spotless and neatly kept, clearly cleaned often.

On the perfumed bed a few pieces of clothing were folded neatly.

Those must have been garments Zhang Ruoxi once wore.

Yang Kai did not examine them closely; he grabbed one at random, slipped it into his Spatial Ring, and quickly left the Zhang residence.

Shortly after, he returned outside and handed the garment to Mo Xiaoqi. “See if this will do.”

Mo Xiaoqi took it and shook open the topmost piece.

The next moment her pretty face flushed, and she glared teasingly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded as well. He pulled his gaze back from the garment and said awkwardly, “I just grabbed one at random.”

Only then did he realize it was a snug little brassiere, pink and delicate. The other garments in Mo Xiaoqi’s hand were all intimate wear.

Yang Kai turned crimson and felt extremely awkward.

Mo Xiaoqi stamped her foot shyly, gathered up the other clothes, then turned her back to Yang Kai, reached to her waist and tapped a cloth pouch.

With a faint squeak, the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat that Yang Kai had seen before appeared.

The little Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat circled Mo Xiaoqi once and then settled on her shoulder.

Mo Xiaoqi’s expression turned solemn. She formed a hand sign and muttered words whose meaning Yang Kai could not discern.

After a moment she bit her fingertip and drew a strange array on Zhang Ruoxi’s little brassiere, then pressed the blooded finger to the bat’s brow.

The bat chirped!

The array on the brassiere became a stream of light that shot into the bat’s brow and vanished in the blink of an eye.

The bat sniffed, fluttered its wings, twisted nimbly in the air and shot off in a certain direction.

“Follow it!” Mo Xiaoqi cried coquettishly, stashing the brassiere and hastily following the little bat.

Seeing this, Yang Kai had no hesitation and hurried after them.

Two thousand li from Fenglin City stood a desolate mountain.

The mountain’s surface was bleak and barren, with not a blade of grass, and the Spiritual Qi there was extremely thin.

There were no cultivators living here at all; only a small hamlet stood upon the mountain, and those who dwelled within were merely ordinary folk unable to cultivate.

Because the mountain was so desolate there were neither wild beasts nor demonic beasts, and it was close to Fenglin City, so even ordinary folk could live there in peace.

Inside a hidden cave in the mountain, two practitioners at the First Stage of the Void King Realm were sitting with their eyes closed, conserving their spirits.

After a while, one man in white seemed to sense something. He opened his eyes, flipped his hand and produced a Transmission Compass in his palm. Immersing his spirit into it to read the message, he could not help but make a light sound of surprise.

“What orders from the clan?” the other man asked as he opened his eyes.

The white-robed man’s expression was odd. “Fifth Elder sent word. He told us to deal with the little girl who was brought here a month ago.”

“Little girl?” the other frowned in doubt. “Why would the clan send such an order? Is there something strange about her?”

“Not sure. Fifth Elder didn’t explain.” The white-robed man shook his head.
