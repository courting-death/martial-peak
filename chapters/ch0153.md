## Chapter 153 — The Inheritance's Belonging

At the moment the ice barrier shattered, an enraged and unwilling roar erupted from the endless staircase, echoing through the air.

Jie Hongchen had exerted all his efforts, and now that he was so close to reaching the peak, only a hundred zhang away from the end, he thought victory was within grasp. However, unexpectedly, a gentle breeze swept toward him, and under its influence, he was sent downward, just like the Hu sisters a few days prior.

“No!” Jie Hongchen shouted, stretching out his hands as if trying to grasp that last layer of stairs, wishing to remain there. Yet, in his line of sight, the end of the staircase grew increasingly distant.

“No!” Jie Hongchen howled skyward!

After days of perseverance and struggle, he was on the verge of reaching the destination, only to see it slip away at the last moment. This was not his fault; someone had reached the end before him.

Only one person could obtain the inheritance, and thus, he was marked as a failure, sent down by the gentle breeze.

Who was it! In Jie Hongchen's bloodshot eyes, countless figures flashed by, but in the end, he felt that Su Yan was the most likely candidate.

Was it her? The unwillingness in Jie Hongchen's heart eased slightly, yet it remained strong.

When he regained his senses, Jie Hongchen found himself in an unfamiliar place. Looking up at the sky, he realized he was still within the Inheritance Celestial Cave, but there was not a single figure around. After standing in place for a long time, a cold smile crept onto Jie Hongchen's lips: “Su Yan, if it truly is you who obtained the inheritance here, then I cannot let you go.”

Along with Jie Hongchen, other disciples from the three sects were also sent down by the gentle breeze. However, without exception, all of them were male, just as the female disciples had experienced a few days ago.

Unlike those female disciples, they were scattered throughout various corners of the Inheritance Celestial Cave. Many felt dejected for a moment before rising again, setting off to search for any benefits that could be obtained.

Since they could not acquire the inheritance, they would see what other rewards were available.

Above the clouds, a magnificent palace appeared before Yang Kai. The towering entrance, over ten zhang high, swung open as if welcoming his arrival.

He did not advance but stood still, closing his eyes to reflect on the gains and losses of his journey.

If the endless staircase of the first layer tested a person's character and will, then the hundred stairs of the second layer tested the control over Yang attribute energy.

Only by thoroughly mastering the red line energy among the ninety-nine layers of stairs could one break through the final layer's ice barrier.

After a long while, Yang Kai smiled slightly and stepped forward. At that moment, he distinctly felt a change within his True Yang Yuan Qi.

Passing through the open door, he entered the palace. Suddenly, the Yang Source Seal on his chest reacted violently.

In the past, the Yang Source Seal would react to the presence of Yang attribute energy, responding with varying degrees of intensity depending on the strength of the energy. However, it had never been as intense as today, to the point where Yang Kai felt a burning sensation in his chest.

His expression grew serious as he followed the direction indicated by the Yang Source Seal.

Before long, Yang Kai saw a massive energy sphere, red and white intertwined, suspended about ten zhang above the ground.

It was this energy sphere, with a diameter of over three feet, that caused the Yang Source Seal to react.

However, what puzzled Yang Kai was that this energy sphere contained not only scorching Yang attribute energy but also a bone-chilling cold attribute energy.

The two completely different energies mixed together yet harmonized perfectly, without conflict.

Within the energy sphere, vague patterns flickered from time to time. Upon closer inspection, Yang Kai's expression changed.

Those were the images of a dragon soaring through the skies and a phoenix singing in the clouds. The dragon and phoenix seal flashed by, resembling the scene when the Inheritance Celestial Cave first appeared.

Is this the inheritance? Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

Just as he was carefully observing, he caught a glimpse of a flash of white in his peripheral vision, and the next moment, two gazes fell upon him.

Yang Kai quickly turned to look at the white figure, stunned in place.

As their eyes met, both displayed an expression of disbelief.

“Su Yan?” Yang Kai never expected that aside from himself, there would be another person here, and that person was actually Su Yan.

At this moment, she was sitting cross-legged beneath the energy sphere, dressed in pure white, exuding an aura of icy purity.

“It’s you?” Su Yan's beautiful eyes also held a hint of surprise, along with a sense of relief, as if a question that had puzzled her for a long time suddenly became clear upon Yang Kai's arrival.

With a slight smile, encountering this senior sister here unexpectedly made Yang Kai feel both surprised and warm. He stepped forward, standing before Su Yan, glancing up at the energy sphere above, then back at her, asking, “How long have you been here?”

“About four or five days,” Su Yan replied lightly, her voice still cold, but lacking the initial distance that had been so apparent.

Four or five days! Yang Kai inwardly gasped, realizing that the proud daughter of Lingxiao Pavilion had indeed made remarkable progress. Just four or five days ago, he had only just parted ways with the Hu sisters, and at that time, he had only ascended halfway up the endless staircase. Yet she had already arrived here.

Her speed was significantly faster than his.

What Yang Kai did not know was that it was precisely because Su Yan had passed the test and entered this great hall that the other women were sent down by the gentle breeze. By the time he arrived here, the men on the endless staircase were also sent down.

One could say that only the two of them remained now.

“Let’s sit and talk,” Su Yan suggested.

Yang Kai nodded and sat cross-legged opposite her.

Sitting a bit too close made Su Yan's face flash with a hint of awkwardness, but it quickly faded.

The two exchanged silent glances, and Yang Kai suddenly smiled, saying, “I climbed the endless staircase and then the hundred stairs to get here. On the endless staircase, the five hundred layers alternated between cold and heat, obstructing my progress. On the hundred stairs, I absorbed ninety-nine Yang attribute energies to break through an ice barrier.”

Su Yan smiled back: “I also climbed the endless staircase, and like you, I ascended the hundred stairs. However, there, I absorbed ninety-nine cold attribute energies, freezing a sea of fire.”

Her smile was truly captivating, like a spring breeze blowing through a frozen land, instantly bringing life and warmth to the snowy world.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, feeling a wave of comfort wash over him.

Su Yan's long eyelashes fluttered as she averted her gaze.

“I never knew you looked so beautiful when you smile,” Yang Kai praised without reservation.

“We're not that familiar,” Su Yan replied, her icy face slightly flushed, though her demeanor remained calm.

“Familiarity comes with time,” Yang Kai teased, unperturbed by the awe that the three sects' disciples held for her.

Su Yan clearly did not wish to continue this playful banter. With a breath like orchids, she said, “Let me share my thoughts; you listen and let me know if you find anything inappropriate.”

“Understood.” Yang Kai nodded seriously, knowing that Su Yan would surely discuss the matter of the inheritance here. After all, she had been here for four or five days and knew more than he did.

Organizing her thoughts, Su Yan spoke softly: “We have all been mistaken. The disciples of the three sects believe that only one person can obtain the inheritance here. But from the current situation, this is an inheritance meant for two people. The fusion of cold and heat on the endless staircase is the best evidence; it is not only a test of a person's character and will but also a selection process for the inheritors.”

Yang Kai nodded; he had thought of this as well, but it had only been a guess, and he had not dared to be too certain.

“As for the second test, although you and I experienced different paths, they are fundamentally similar. It tests our control over our respective attribute energies. Only by passing through these two layers of tests can we reach this place.” Su Yan brushed her hair back, slightly lowering her head, revealing her long, fair neck. She spoke softly, “Before you arrived, I was unsure, but after seeing you here, I realized some key points. Did you see the thing above our heads?”

Yang Kai responded with an “Mm.”

“For the past four or five days, I have been trying to absorb it, but I have had no success. It repels me greatly. If I’m not mistaken, it must be that we need to channel our energies simultaneously to draw it down and obtain the inheritance here!”

Su Yan's words were simple yet hit the nail on the head.

“What do you want to do?” Yang Kai asked after listening.

The inheritance here was no longer a matter for one person but involved both him and Su Yan. Therefore, neither of them had the authority to decide.

No one knew what their relationship would become after obtaining the inheritance, but since it was meant for two, they would surely not remain as distant as before.

For Yang Kai, he was naturally happy to share this inheritance with Su Yan. This cold senior sister was warm-hearted beneath her icy exterior, and Yang Kai certainly did not reject her.

Now, it all depended on her opinion.

If Su Yan was unwilling to obtain the inheritance together, Yang Kai would not force her.

Su Yan clearly considered this aspect as well, her expression revealing a hint of hesitation and struggle. She did not know what would happen between her and Yang Kai after obtaining the inheritance, but recalling how he had risked his life to save her from the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast a few days ago, her struggle and hesitation began to waver.

After a long while, as Yang Kai waited in silence, Su Yan slowly raised her head, fixing her gaze on him as if she wanted to capture every nuance of his expression. With a resolute tone, she said, “If I say that I do not want to be bound to someone I am not very familiar with because of some external force, even if it is for the inheritance, would you be disappointed?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and nodded, “A little.”

Su Yan's expression dimmed.

“But I will respect your choice. You have your freedom, and I have mine! If you do not want to, then do not!” Yang Kai's expression was calm as he slowly stood up, saying to Su Yan, “If you truly do not want to, then let’s leave.”

“Where to?” Su Yan looked up, her neck arched in a way that was amusing, less cold and more curious.

“Out,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “If you don’t want this inheritance, why are we still here?”

“Who said I don’t want it? Since we’ve come this far, how can we leave empty-handed?” Su Yan revealed a faint smile, one that carried a hint of cunning.

“Are you playing with me?” Yang Kai's expression darkened as he said angrily, “You deceive me after I trusted you so much?”

“It was just a little test; no need to be so angry, right? Aren’t you men always claiming to be magnanimous? How can you not even handle a woman’s joke?” Su Yan said lightly, biting her lip, her gaze calm as she looked at Yang Kai.
