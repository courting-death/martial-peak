## Chapter 146 — The Death of Nie Yong

Hu Jiao’er sneered repeatedly, “You’ve already called me a woman; what does it matter if it’s an unfair fight? Besides, since you believe men are inherently superior, why do you want to compete with me? That itself is quite problematic.”

Fang Ziqi was left speechless by her rebuttal, sighing repeatedly, “Indeed, it is difficult to nurture both a petty person and a woman!”

The fate of the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast was already half decided the moment the disciples from the three sects moved in unison. Su Yan’s subsequent strike completely buried its last chance of survival.

At this moment, facing the attacks from the three sects’ disciples, it had no power to fight back; death was merely a matter of time.

The root of all this, however, lay in Yang Kai’s overwhelming punch. It was that very punch that ignited the fighting spirit of the three sects’ disciples, giving them the courage to battle such a colossal creature.

Hu Mei’er was currently helping him bandage his wounds; his right arm had burst blood vessels and was trembling uncontrollably.

Yang Kai never expected the power unleashed by the Mark of the Stars to be so formidable, so powerful that he could not control it at all. After that punch, his body went completely numb, rendering him unable to move.

Otherwise, why would he be standing here like a javelin? It was only at this moment that the numbness began to ease, and the immense pain throughout his body surged forth.

As he watched the battle of the hundreds of disciples, Yang Kai did not notice the sinister expression on Jie Hongchen’s face.

Since Yang Kai’s punch erupted, Jie Hongchen had remained suspended in the air, seemingly losing his wits. It was only a short while ago that he finally regained his senses.

He understood that Yang Kai must have obtained some incredible opportunity within this Inheritance Celestial Cave; otherwise, with his strength, he would not have been able to unleash such a punch.

That was a punch capable of severely injuring a peak Sixth-Order Demon Beast!

He could not allow Yang Kai to grow any further. If he continued to grow, not only would he lose Su Yan, but he might even face a crisis himself!

With this thought, a glint of ruthlessness flashed in Jie Hongchen’s eyes as he signaled to a person below.

That person was Nie Yong!

Like Lan Chudie, he had been injured in the earlier battle and was currently recovering not far behind Yang Kai.

Nie Yong was now filled with mixed emotions, unable to articulate what he felt. He had spent several days with Yang Kai, always speaking harshly to him and making things difficult for him. Later, he even led people to hunt him down.

However, he had never found Yang Kai’s hiding place, and the matter had ended without resolution. Yet, Yang Kai’s existence still pricked at him like a thorn in his throat.

He remembered the words Yang Kai had said when he fled over ten days ago.

In just over ten days, Yang Kai had become so powerful! Nie Yong was nearly stunned; if that punch landed on him, he would surely be crushed to pieces.

What to do? What to do? Everyone’s attention was currently focused on the demon beast, leaving no time to spare for him. Once the demon beast was dead, how would he face Yang Kai’s wrath?

In his anxious state, Nie Yong noticed Jie Hongchen in the sky signaling him.

He understood his senior brother’s intention and couldn’t help but shiver.

But soon, Nie Yong’s gaze turned cold. Yes, if he wanted to live, he could only kill Yang Kai! Otherwise, he would definitely seek revenge! Moreover, Senior Brother Jie wanted him to do this; even if he killed Yang Kai, with Jie Hongchen’s protection, he would surely be safe.

The intimidation brought by Yang Kai’s punch made it impossible for Nie Yong to think calmly; he could only place his hopes on Jie Hongchen.

Slowly standing up, Nie Yong took slow steps toward Yang Kai.

Faced with such a crisis, Yang Kai seemed completely unaware, still standing in place without moving.

Nie Yong quickened his pace. Now, there was only Hu Mei’er, a Blood Battle Gang disciple, beside Yang Kai. As long as he acted quickly, he would surely be able to kill him.

As for what would happen after killing him, it was no longer within Nie Yong’s considerations.

At this moment, nearly everyone’s attention and focus were drawn to the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast; no one noticed Nie Yong’s movements, except for one person.

That was Lan Chudie.

Since Yang Kai had burst forth to save Su Yan and then severely injured the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast with a punch, Lan Chudie’s heart was filled with a mix of bitterness and regret.

She hadn’t expected that the junior brother who had followed her and obeyed her orders just over ten days ago could now display such prowess. If she had known earlier, if she had known earlier…

It felt as if she had once possessed a beautiful jade but had discarded it as a mere stone. The disparity between gain and loss made Lan Chudie feel immense regret.

While others were watching the battle between the three sects’ disciples and the demon beast, she had been fixated on Yang Kai’s back, a back that dazzled and captivated. Compared to Jie Hongchen and the others, it was like comparing clouds to mud.

This calamity could be said to have been instigated by Jie Hongchen, yet in the end, it was this person who resolved it; in comparison, the difference was stark.

Nie Yong’s actions quickly caught Lan Chudie’s attention. Initially, she didn’t think much of it, assuming he was about to join the battle since he had nearly recovered. But after watching for a while, she realized that was not the case; Nie Yong’s target was actually Yang Kai, who was standing there. Moreover, as he walked, a faint fluctuation of Primordial Qi emanated from him.

Lan Chudie was a clever woman and immediately understood Nie Yong’s intentions. Just as she was about to warn Yang Kai, before she could even call out, she suddenly saw Yang Kai, who was standing there, abruptly turn his head, looking at Nie Yong with a mocking gaze.

He was smiling, a wicked smile that revealed a few white teeth.

Nie Yong abruptly froze, fear gripping his heart as he stared at Yang Kai. He didn’t know how Yang Kai had sensed his movements, but being looked at with such eyes made him feel a chill run down his spine.

Yang Kai was looking at him as if he were a dead man.

“Senior Brother Nie!” Yang Kai slowly turned around, smiling at him.

“Junior Brother Yang.” Nie Yong swallowed hard, his steps showing signs of retreat.

“Are you here to kill me?”

This question directly exposed Nie Yong’s thoughts, startling him. In a panic, he waved his hands and forced a smile, saying, “What are you talking about, Junior Brother Yang? How could I do such a thing? We are fellow disciples, brothers; how could I, haha…”

Nie Yong felt his face twitching. It wasn’t because he was embarrassed to lie, but out of fear.

Facing someone capable of severely injuring a peak Sixth-Order Demon Beast, how could he not be afraid? Moreover, this person was his mortal enemy.

As he spoke, Nie Yong took steps back, raising his hands in a nervous laugh, indicating he meant no harm, his legs trembling.

“Nie Yong!” Yang Kai’s face was filled with a murderous aura. He suddenly shouted angrily.

Nie Yong, feeling guilty, dared not respond and immediately turned to flee. Before he could run a few steps, a wailing whistle suddenly came from behind.

In a panic, he turned his head and saw a pitch-black spike about a foot long flying toward him from Yang Kai, accompanied by a series of eerie, sinister laughs.

The laughter was strange and elusive, filled with malevolence, echoing in his mind and causing Nie Yong to panic even more.

In just over ten zhang, the spike arrived in an instant. Nie Yong, unwilling to sit back and wait for death, quickly turned to defend himself. In the hurried clash, he was pleasantly surprised to find that the spike’s power was not as terrifying as he had imagined. Although it was difficult for him to resist, he wouldn’t be killed immediately.

Nie Yong was overjoyed, knowing that Yang Kai’s current situation was not as calm as it appeared; he was definitely at the end of his rope.

In his excitement, Nie Yong fought while retreating, trying to evade the spike’s attack, but that strange black spike relentlessly pursued him, the sinister laughter never ceasing.

What on earth is this thing? Even if it’s a treasure, it should be controlled by someone, right? Yang Kai was clearly standing there without moving; why is it still attacking me?

Just as he was in a panic, he suddenly heard footsteps behind him. Turning around, he saw Lan Chudie, injured but rushing over, her expression calm yet resolute.

Nie Yong was overjoyed, “Sister Lan, save me!”

Lan Chudie glanced at him indifferently, her gaze causing Nie Yong’s heart to skip a beat. Just as he was puzzled by her expression, Lan Chudie suddenly struck him on the back.

“Ah!” Nie Yong let out a miserable cry, stumbling forward, and the black spike’s laughter grew even more arrogant and delighted, with a hint of surprise, as it pierced through Nie Yong’s chest in a split second.

“Sister Lan, why…” Nie Yong’s body began to tremble violently, and before he could finish his words, his eyes suddenly dimmed, and he collapsed weakly.

Lan Chudie gasped heavily, staring at Nie Yong, only to find that there was no injury on his chest; the spike that had penetrated him had vanished without a trace.

But soon, that spike shot out again.

In a daze, Lan Chudie heard Nie Yong’s wailing voice, which made her scalp tingle, and her face instantly lost all color.

Looking up toward Yang Kai, she saw him gazing at her with a cold expression.

Lan Chudie’s heart sank, and she bit her lip, saying, “He wants to kill you!”

Yang Kai said nothing, merely extending his hand, and the spike transformed into a wisp of black light, coiling around his fingertip before vanishing from sight.

The two exchanged glances for a long time before Yang Kai slowly turned his gaze away, remaining silent throughout. Lan Chudie let out a desolate smile, collapsing onto the ground, drenched in cold sweat.

“Hahaha!” The Earth Demon’s wild laughter echoed from within Yang Kai, a mad and bloody laugh. Accompanied by the laughter, it seemed he was still chewing on something.

Yang Kai knew what he was chewing on; it was Nie Yong’s soul! However, he had not anticipated that the Soul-Breaking Spike would have such a bizarre effect.

“Still want to kill? Still want to kill?” The Earth Demon shouted excitedly while chewing on Nie Yong’s soul, “It’s been a long time since I’ve heard such a delightful sound! It’s been a long time since I’ve tasted such a tender flavor. Young Master, do you still want to kill? I can move at any time!”

Yang Kai’s thoughts stirred, and the Earth Demon’s laughter instantly turned into a wail, begging for mercy.

After a long while, the Earth Demon finally regained some composure, but he no longer had the previous arrogance. Breathing heavily, he cautiously said, “Young Master, why?”

“Why didn’t you tell me the true effect of the Soul-Breaking Spike?”

“Young Master, you didn’t ask.” The Earth Demon felt wronged and answered cautiously, “Moreover, this thing is too evil; I was afraid you wouldn’t like it if you knew!”

“I don’t like it now either!” Yang Kai added, “I really don’t like it!”

The Earth Demon trembled immediately.

After waiting for a moment, Yang Kai finally said, “But you did well this time. Remember, only this once. If you dare to hide anything again next time, you know the consequences.”
