## Chapter 1158 — Hot-Headed Ge Xiong

When Yang Kai's spirits soared, the beautiful auctioneer on the high dais had already begun presiding over the sale of the first Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure...

Because of the Flowing Flame Sandland and the scarcity of Origin-Grade Secret Treasures, even though Jubao Tower displayed all twelve treasures at once, it still couldn’t quell the fervor of the experts in the private rooms—on the contrary, it only further inflamed their determination to win them at any cost.

There were only twelve Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures—once sold, they were gone.

Yang Kai heard the low, steady voice of Fang Tianzhong from the Leitai Sect making his bids, the confident and carefree tone of Qu Changfeng from the Battle Sky Alliance raising the price with pride, and the melodious, silver-bell-like voice of Yin Sudie from the Liuli Gate joining in as well. There were also the shouts of other young elites from various sects competing fiercely—each of these rising stars seemingly intent on acquiring a Lower-Level Origin-Grade Secret Treasure for protection, preparing in advance for their entry into the Flowing Flame Sandland.

The lot that started at one hundred thousand Saint Crystal was immediately driven up to six hundred thousand, and the calls for higher bids still never ceased.

Yang Kai suddenly realized he had underestimated the purchasing power of the great financiers of Dark Star, and even more so the preciousness of Origin-Grade Secret Treasures here; he had assumed that if a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level item fetched thirty to fifty thousand Saint Crystal, an Origin-Grade Lower-Level would sell for only two to three hundred thousand.

But reality was nothing like that.

Although Origin-Grade Lower-Level and Saint King-Grade Upper-Level were only one rank apart, their prices differed by a world.

Thinking it over, Yang Kai understood — these great forces weren’t lacking in purchasing power. After years of accumulation, they possessed enormous reserves of Saint Crystals. What they truly lacked were opportunities to encounter good items. Once such treasures appeared, they wouldn’t hesitate to spend however many Saint Crystals it took.

Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures were precisely that kind of treasure. On Dark Star, the highest rank artificers could reach was exactly Origin-Grade Lower-Level, but they could not guarantee success on every forging like Yang Yan.

Like pill refinement, when an artificer forged a Secret Treasure there was a high chance of failure; when a failure occurred, not only would no treasure be produced, the raw materials would be lost as well.

The high probability of raw material loss naturally drove the price of Origin-Grade Secret Treasures ever higher.

The first Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure quickly broke the one million Saint Crystal mark; although the number of bidders thinned, some still hesitated and considered making another offer.

Yang Kai had meant to see how high the treasure would sell for, but suddenly his expression shifted and he murmured to Yang Yan and Wu Yi, "I'm stepping out for a moment—I'll be right back."

The two women looked at him in surprise but asked nothing, merely nodding gently.

Yang Kai swiftly left Room C-13 and walked out of Jubao Tower, loitered for a moment in a shop across from the tower, then slipped unobtrusively into the crowd to his left.

Though he had been watching the auction's progress, he had not relaxed his attention on the warrior who had earlier obtained the partial map. The arrival of the twelve Origin-Grade Secret Treasures had charged the auction hall's atmosphere; while most people's attention was absorbed by the Origin-Grade items, the First Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior who had the partial map quietly left the hall.

Obviously he thought this was a good chance to slip away!

Earlier he had spent one hundred thousand Saint Crystal and resolutely snatched that partial map, which had already drawn many eyes—if he hadn't feared attracting more attention, he would have left long before.

But now it was already too late; a warrior like him should never have grabbed that partial map.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense was on par with an Origin Returning Realm expert, so watching such a person was effortless; he would never allow him to leave his sight. Yang Kai also noticed many others with the same idea—after he left Jubao Tower, one by one warriors slipped out and quietly trailed the partial map's owner.

Yang Kai was left speechless for a while; he had thought few besides himself would pay attention to that warrior, yet now he saw it wasn't that people didn't care, it was that everyone was secretly watching.

The forces behind these people clearly believed that the owner of that fragmentary map possessed more than one piece. If they could obtain two fragments, they might just uncover a useful clue.

Yang Kai's face darkened. Although he had no good way to seize the partial map, he couldn't simply give up; after all, Yang Yan definitely had one fragment. For now he could only take things step by step and follow them outside Tianyun City.

Although the map’s owner had been deliberately concealing his aura along the way and trying hard to appear calm, as a mere First-Stage Saint King, there was no way he could evade the eyes of so many experts.

After the time of a single incense stick, he left Tianyun City, and one after another figures followed.

Yang Kai brought up the rear. Although many people's Divine Sense swept over him—some even Origin Returning Realm—no one paid him any attention; he was just a small player in their eyes.

Fifty li west of Tianyun City lay Luoma Slope.

The place was desolate, hills and grotesque stones standing everywhere; beyond lay a chaotic stone forest—the perfect place for murder and robbery.

Ge Xiong was not unaware that someone was tracking him, but even if he noticed he had no way to escape, for he knew exactly why these people had their eyes on him.

His legs trembled, his face turned pale; he wished he could slap himself hard.

For this auction in Tianyun City, he had spent a fortune to buy an entry pass from a friend and brought all the Saint Crystal he had accumulated over the years, planning to purchase something good at the auction to raise his strength.

But he bought no good item and, as if possessed, purchased a shabby partial map—God only knew how his head got hot enough to shout a price of one hundred thousand Saint Crystal.

That was his entire savings, the accumulation of several generations of his family.

If he had another chance, Ge Xiong swore he would never wade into such murky waters again; let whoever wanted that shabby partial map have it—he certainly wouldn't buy it.

But alas, no amount of regret could change things now. Walking on Luoma Slope, Ge Xiong felt a chill at his back, as if countless pairs of eyes watched him from all directions.

He didn't dare even think of using his Star Shuttle to flee—he was certain that if he produced the Star Shuttle, he'd die the next moment.

Looking up, he saw the chaotic stone forest ten li away and halted; he dared not go on—going there would be death as well!

A gust of wind ruffled his clothes, his frayed nerves finally snapped, and with a thud he sank to his knees and howled into the gale, crying out, "Sirs, spare this junior a life! I was momentarily confused—I shouldn't have bought that partial map, please spare me! I just broke through the Saint King Realm and don't want to die!"

The wind's howl warped Ge Xiong's cries, lending the bleak place an added air of sinister eeriness.

Silence came from all directions; Ge Xiong knew those men were not afraid of him, but were wary of each other.

Unable to endure any longer, he took the partial map from his Spatial Ring, held it high so the wind whipped it, and shouted, "The partial map is right here—if any of you elders want it, come and take it! Just don't take my life!"

Though still no one appeared, Ge Xiong clearly felt invisible pressures lash out from all sides; each pressure swept across the partial map in his hand and then withdrew.

Ge Xiong continued to howl and beg. After a long while he shouted again, "Sirs, I'll leave the partial map here—whoever wants it can take it. May I step back now?"

Still no answer.

After calling out three times he deluded himself into saying, "Since you have no objections, I'll be leaving."

Saying so, he placed the partial map on the ground, weighed it with a stone, and slowly stood.

Turning, he suddenly saw a youth standing behind him and dropped to his knees again, terrified. The youth wore a radiant treasure armor that made clear he was no ordinary person; most frightening to Ge Xiong were the two stern-faced masters standing behind the youth—by their auras they were both Origin Returning Realm experts.

"Do you think this is an auction where three shouts mean it's sold?" the youth sneered.

Ge Xiong hastily waved his hands. "No, no—Young Master, you jest. I shouted here for a long time and no one paid me any mind. Young Master, the partial map is here—if you want it, just take it, just please don't kill me."

"You have no right to bargain with me!" The youth was unmoved and gestured to the experts behind him to pick up the partial map.

He hadn't intended to come out so early, for at least thirty had ambushed this slope, but seeing the trembling Saint King Realm warrior truly preparing to leave, he couldn't hold himself back and stepped out first.

One of the Origin Returning Realm experts stepped forward, picked up the partial map, inspected it, and nodded, "It's the one from the auction."

Saying that, he handed the partial map to the youth.

The youth took it and tossed it into his Spatial Ring, then looked at Ge Xiong and said, "Let me see your Spatial Ring."

"Ah?" Ge Xiong froze—this seemed his first encounter with robbery. Though unwilling, he dared not resist and obediently took off his Spatial Ring and handed it to the youth.

The youth scanned the Spatial Ring with his Divine Sense; his face instantly darkened and he barked, "You have no other partial maps?"

"I never said I did..." Ge Xiong weakly protested.

"Bastard!" The youth flew into a rage and kicked Ge Xiong in the stomach, sending him sprawling. Through clenched teeth he demanded, "If you have no other partial maps, why did you bid?"

"Didn't that beautiful woman say the partial map held earth-shattering riches, top-tier techniques and Secret Treasures?" Ge Xiong wailed, feeling wronged—he had been taken in by the auctioneer's words and, his head hot, shouted a price of one hundred thousand.

"She said it and you believed?" The youth's expression turned grim as he growled, "And you really think you can find clues from such a one fragment?"

Ge Xiong nodded meekly, as if it were only natural.
