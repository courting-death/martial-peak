## Chapter 1575 — It Turns Out He's Just a Pretty Face

Ba He was dragged away! The outcome left Yang Kai dumbfounded, but seeing Ba He wear a look of calm assurance, Yang Kai guessed he would likely not be in any real danger.

Mi Tian was also warmly received to the side, while Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang were led by a yao woman up Half Moon Mountain, following the neat mountain path upward.

The yao woman leading them must bear the bloodline of some Demonic Beast; small in stature yet extremely nimble, she possessed cultivation at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Her two ears were not human—rather like short, delicate cat ears.

Yang Kai was not surprised in the least as he walked along, taking in the sacred scenery of Red Moon Domain on all sides.

The surrounding Spiritual Qi was thick. There must be an excellent Earth Vein beneath Half Moon Mountain; otherwise it could not meet the cultivation needs of so many yao warriors.

"Miss, are we going to meet Lady Chi Yue now?" After walking for a while, Yang Kai finally asked.

"The Lady has urgent matters and will not receive you for now, but someone else will receive the two of you." The yao woman ahead did not look back as she replied calmly.

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded and did not press the matter.

Although Xia Ningshang's display in Huiyue City had been shocking, Chi Yue was after all one of the Ten Lords and a Void King Realm expert; it was reasonable that she would not personally receive Xia Ningshang.

Still, she would not treat Xia Ningshang lightly and should assign a capable person to receive her to show respect.

Yang Kai had come merely to see the that enchantress Shan Qingluo; whether he met Chi Yue mattered little to him. Not meeting Chi Yue might even be preferable—after all, facing a Void King Realm expert would put him under some pressure.

Hearing the yao woman say someone else would receive them suited his inclinations perfectly.

Walking behind her, Yang Kai was already mulling over how to find Shan Qingluo.

In such a place he dared not recklessly use his Divine Sense to search; doing so could very likely stir up trouble.

After walking for about half an hour, the yao woman finally led Yang Kai and his Senior Sister to a magnificent, gold-and-jade palace, then proceeded straight inside.

Inside the palace was spacious and bright, with many yao warriors lined up on both sides, all curiously peering toward the entrance.

They had heard the news that a human in Huiyue City had refined a Spiritual Pill that bore a Pill Cloud, and that Huiyue City Lord Magna would soon escort her to the palace to serve the Lady.

Naturally they were curious what kind of human could possess such extraordinary pill-refining skill.

Above the assembled yao sat two experts at the forefront whose strength reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

On the left stood a burly figure, towering like an iron fortress, with a visage fierce and terrifying.

The one on the right was tall and lithe, her brows and eyes exquisite; there seemed to be a thousand kinds of charm within her gaze. She was already supremely beautiful, and beside that hideous hulking man she looked all the more ethereal.

Among the yao cultivators waiting below, many couldn’t help but steal glances at the woman from time to time—but they quickly averted their eyes again, as though afraid that lingering too long would cause them to sink into her bewitching allure.

At this moment the iron fortress man's face twitched with impatience; he shifted restlessly in his seat, looking very uneasy.

The woman on the right, by contrast, furrowed her delicate brows with an expression of puzzlement as her beautiful eyes gazed outward, as if trying to peer through the obstruction of space to somewhere far away.

As time passed, her expression began to change, gradually growing joyful and excited; her previously languid posture straightened, and her slender body trembled slightly.

Her beautiful eyes shot forth astonishing radiance; she lightly bit her red lips, and an expectant expression bloomed across her pretty face as a smile played at the corner of her mouth.

The many yao experts below took in the scene and felt their chests pound violently, their mouths dry.

They had never seen this Lady display such a smile capable of overturning the hearts of men; for a moment they could not free themselves from the temptation of that smile, longing to immerse their minds in it and be lost—even if bound by darkness and never to see the light again.

A chorus of muffled groans rang out as many powerful yao experts sensed something amiss. They hastily circulated their Saint Yuan to strike at their own minds, preferring to harm themselves rather than remain entranced.

If they sank any deeper, they might truly be irretrievably damned!

A disaster indeed! The Lord's adopted daughter was truly a calamity! Even among the most famed fox-clan women of the yao, she outshone them by three parts in bewitching charm.

How could a mere human possess such allure? The many yao experts scratched their heads and could not fathom it.

Such an existence, even the best yao disciples would scarcely be worthy of her.

"Why still not here? I'm dying of impatience!" A voice like muffled thunder boomed through the palace, jolting the yao warriors awake as they turned their heads to the iron fortress man.

The big man sat on pins and needles, scratching his scalp with a large hand, turning to the alluring woman and adopting a flattering air, wearing an unpleasant smile as he buzzed, "Little Sister, why don't you wait here while I go take care of my business?"

The alluring woman glanced at him and pursed her lips with a light laugh, saying, "Yu Xiong, this is an order from our adoptive mother. The guest is a pill-refinement grandmaster and must be treated with ceremony. If you flee now and adoptive mother finds out, I won't put in a good word for you."

"Ahem..." Yu Xiong forced an awkward smile at the thought of their adoptive mother's terror and shivered; his tall, broad frame seemed suddenly to shrink. "I was only joking, don't take it seriously, don't take it seriously!"

As soon as Yu Xiong’s words fell, a yao woman walked in from outside. She strolled gracefully to the center of the hall, offered a delicate bow, and softly said, “My Lord, my Lady, the people have arrived”

"At last!" Yu Xiong snorted coldly, his face full of displeasure. "I'll see if that pill-refinement grandmaster actually has the skill. If she's like those others—mere charlatans—don't blame me for tearing her to pieces."

Because Chi Yue valued humans with special talents, many humans on her territory dreamed of winning the Lady's favor and settling on Half Moon Mountain.

Yet some unskilled people bragged of great ability to fraudulently fill a role; without exception they were cruelly slaughtered by Yu Xiong.

So Yu Xiong hardly trusted that any human could refine an Origin-Grade pill bearing a Pill Cloud; he assumed it was likely Huiyue City Lord's flattery to profit from the affair.

"Bring them in quickly!" The alluring woman controlled her giddy heart and cried out in a trembling, coquettish voice.

"Yes!" The yao woman replied, turned and looked back, beckoning toward the rear.

A man and a woman came walking side by side: the man broad and imposing, the woman small and exquisite. Their gazes swept the hall and then fixed on the alluring woman.

Yang Kai bared a grin. Xia Ningshang pursed her lips and smiled lightly.

The alluring woman's body trembled faintly and a mist of dazed longing appeared in her eyes, yet she maintained her composure in public and did not overstep.

Taking a few deep breaths to steady her excitement, she lifted her smooth chin. Her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai, love and hate entwined in them; no one noticed her silver teeth lightly bite, producing a faint sound.

"My Lord, my Lady, the people have arrived." The yao woman reported respectfully.

"Eh, wasn't the pill-refinement grandmaster said to be a woman? What is that man doing here?" Yu Xiong looked curiously at Yang Kai.

The yao woman replied, "These two seem to be fellow sect Senior Sister and Junior Brother who came together."

"So it turns out he's just a pretty face!" Yu Xiong sneered. "I despise people like that the most."

He instinctively took Yang Kai for someone living off Xia Ningshang's favor.

Yang Kai paid no mind to the insult, continuing to lock eyes with the alluring woman, a playful smile on his face. It seemed she could not withstand Yang Kai's aggressive, unflinching stare—she glowered at him viciously, her eyes full of petulant reproach.

In this public setting...

"How dare you, human! In the presence of the Lord and the Lady, why do you not bow?" An angry shout rose from among the yao at both sides.

Red Moon Domain had mobilized so many hands, and the esteemed Lord and the Lady personally received them—this alone was enough to grant face to that pill-refinement master. By etiquette and reason, these two humans should not be standing there foolishly; they must at least display humility.

Yet they stood motionless, as if holding themselves too high.

Without the Lady's favor, humans were nothing! Merely accessories under the yao's power.

What made the yao even more unable to endure was that, since entering the hall, the pretty face had fixed his gaze on the Lady without blinking, as if he wished to devour the Lady alive.

Too insolent!

Even if the Lady's charm was boundless, a mere human should not be so presumptuous; how could such a Lady be desecrated by a human?

Many yao directed furious stares at Yang Kai in that instant.

"You pretty face, what are you staring at!" Yu Xiong sprang up, his gaze boring into Yang Kai as he snarled, "You believe I'll gouge out your eyeballs?"

"Human, some people are not for you to look at—be content to be the pretty face!" A yao expert taunted from the side.

That human was far too ungrateful. The woman beside him, though her true features were unclear, by her figure and complexion was certainly a rare beauty. If he was not satisfied that's one thing, but to cast lustful eyes at the Lady is utterly ridiculous.

That human woman must be blind to be with such a man. So outstanding an Alchemy Grandmaster should only be matched with elite yao disciples.
