## Chapter 1079 — In the Name of Xue Yue

A round of verbal sparring left neither side convinced.

In the room, Yang Kai looked at Xue Yue helplessly. Xue Yue kept drinking tea to calm the anger in her chest; the cup was long emptied, only air remained.

The atmosphere was so stifling it drove one mad.

"So heartless and ungrateful?" Xue Yue suddenly spoke, her gaze icy as she stared at Yang Kai; the man’s stubbornness had wounded her.

Yang Kai shook his head. "Say what you will, I'm leaving. I suffered big losses this time and I won't tie my life to others again—especially not to you. There are too many secrets about you; once exposed, even the Hengluo Commerce Guild might not be able to protect you. If you die, I'll be dragged down with you."

Xue Yue’s Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body was an unusual constitution; calling her the Commerce Guild’s most outstanding Moon Slave was not an exaggeration.

Those Moon Slaves, when possessed by men, only granted subtle benefits to their owners.

But Xue Yue was different; with her present strength she could elevate Yang Kai directly to the Saint King Realm. As her power rose, her constitution would bring even greater benefits to the first man who possessed her.

And that elevation wasn't merely a simple boost in strength, it also included realm!

The world was full of experts; many struggled for hundreds or thousands of years only to fail to breakthrough a single Stage. Xue Yue’s body was the best tool for them to shatter those shackles.

Chairman Ai Ou had seen far ahead; when Xue Yue was three years old he raised her as a man out of fear that such things might happen—because if that day came, Xue Yue would bring nothing but disaster to the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

"How long can you bind me?" Yang Kai met Xue Yue’s gaze coolly, showing no intention of yielding. "A forced union never tastes sweet. And we both know much of this is the Soul Chain at work; another part is your woman’s heart. You've lived as a man so long that only before me can you let go and be yourself without worry. A big part of why you want to keep me is for that freedom, isn't it?"

Xue Yue fell silent.

Yang Kai’s words cut to the bone; she had nothing to retort.

Yang Kai’s expression grew grave, then proud, his voice lowering: "You may think of me as a petty martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, someone you can command, but have you considered this? I was the first from our home continent to step into the Star Domain. That makes me the best warrior from there—I am its sovereign!"

Xue Yue blinked, thoughtful in her beautiful eyes.

"You’ve hunted demonic beasts, haven’t you? Have you ever captured a king among beasts?" Yang Kai sneered. "Those kings you captured—what fate did they meet? Could you truly tame their wild natures?"

A memory involuntarily surfaced in Xue Yue’s mind: the capture of a pack’s king. The beast’s wildness resisted taming; it rose and mauled people. No matter how she tried, it would not obey her commands, and in the end she had to slay it.

"I..." Xue Yue opened her mouth but found herself at a loss for words.

"Think it over carefully. I'll wait three days; give me your answer after that. I don't want to make things irreparable." Yang Kai glanced at her indifferently, then turned and left.

In that gaze, Xue Yue saw resolution: whatever choice she made, Yang Kai would not stay as her guard—this man would leave.

Without the Soul Chain undone, once he left her situation would be perilous.

Xue Yue knew better than anyone how risky it was for a Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior to roam outside; how could she entrust her life to someone so weak to wander the Star Domain on her behalf?

Mind in turmoil, Xue Yue snatched up the cup on the table and smashed it to the floor, grinding her teeth for a long while before spitting out a few words: "Wolf-hearted and dog-livered!"

Since childhood she had never been on the losing side in confrontations; she always seized the initiative. Whoever fell into her hands—male or female, old or young—could only be moulded by her.

The elders of the Commerce Guild all said that she was the best successor — the most outstanding one among them.

She accepted such praise without qualms.

But when facing Yang Kai she found herself constrained at every turn; in their conversation she had no room even to retort, which enraged and humiliated her.

She hid away in her room, vexed. Sitting cross-legged on the bed, she circulated profound arts to steady her scattered mind. Gradually her breathing steadied and she began to consider her relationship with Yang Kai from another perspective— weighing the pros and cons of keeping him or letting him go.

After leaving Xue Yue’s room, Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

He had given Xue Yue three days; no matter what she chose afterward he would distance himself from her. Perhaps because of the Soul Chain, this decision stirred a touch of reluctance in him.

A few heads peeking around to watch only made Yang Kai more displeased.

If they wanted to gawk, at least find a better place; every face held scandalous curiosity, wanting to ask but hesitating to speak.

"Old Ha!" Yang Kai waved over.

Halika’s face flushed as he and Lin Mufeng and the others strode over, pretending to discuss something with grave expressions.

"Old Ha!" Yang Kai called again as they drew near.

"Young Brother..." Halika looked displeased. "Others calling me Old Ha is one thing, but you shouldn't—it's a bit disrespectful. I don't mind, but if outsiders hear it'd look bad."

"Lady Xue needs some materials for cultivation; take me to the storeroom." Yang Kai ignored his protest.

"Lady Xue?" Halika blinked but didn't ask more, turning to lead: "Come with me. There's some good stuff in the storeroom; I just don't know if it'll meet Xue Lord's taste."

"Lady Xue isn't picky." Yang Kai sniffed.

After all, he was leaving in three days. Having risked half his life to awaken Xue Yue and endured fears on Rainfall Star, he felt he deserved some profit before departing.

Especially Saint Crystals—Yang Kai didn't have a single one left.

Riding on Xue Yue's name wouldn't matter; by the time Xue Yue discovered it he'd be long gone.

In front of the storeroom Halika and Lin Mufeng each bore a key and opened the heavy door.

Old Ha was straightforward; he stood at the storeroom entrance and said, "Go in and look for yourself. Don't be shy—take whatever you see. We'll wait out here."

Yang Kai nodded and swaggered in carelessly.

In an instant, the brilliant colors nearly blinded him.

This was the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch’s storeroom, its hoarded wealth astonishing. All manner of cultivation materials, secret treasures, and pills were neatly arranged on raised shelves. Five Element ores were everywhere; even Ethereal Crystals used to craft Spatial Rings were stored here.

Standing before the dazzling array, Yang Kai strode straight to a pile of Saint Crystals.

The Saint Crystals were piled like small hills—Lower-Level, Middle-Level, Upper-Level Saint Crystals...

Yang Kai only took Upper-Level Saint Crystals, collecting nearly fifty thousand before stopping. With so many, he'd be supplied for a while. After roaming the Star Domain these days he’d come to understand the value of Saint Crystals, no longer as clueless as at first.

Fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals could buy an Origin-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure!

After stuffing the crystals he moved to the section holding medicinal materials.

Yang Kai already possessed many Origin-Grade and Void King-Grade herbs, but he didn't need them just yet—his alchemy still left much to be desired.

Saint King-Grade materials, however, were scarce, and his current alchemist rank had just reached Middle-Level among the Saint King-Grade. With effort he might even concoct Saint King-Grade Upper-Level pills.

The more Saint King-Grade materials he had the better—to refine pills and improve his alchemical skills.

He didn't go overboard; taking benefits required subtlety—take enough to be satisfied without making bitter enemies. There was a limit.

Yang Kai judged well, stopping when his ring was full of Saint King-Grade herbs.

He also needed Five Element ores—those two jet-black spheres in Black Book Space seemed bottomless; the ores he bought on Shuiyue Star had been consumed by them. This trip would replenish supplies.

As expected of a Commerce Guild branch storeroom, their ores were decent. Yang Kai closed his eyes as he gathered them until he felt it was enough and stopped.

He then came to the area storing secret treasures, filled with expectation.

He'd hoped to find a handy secret treasure there, preferably defensive. He'd always been indifferent to offensive secret treasures—he trusted his own strength more than objects.

Defensive secret treasures were different: the more the better, the easier it was to survive.

But after searching all around he left disappointed.

There were many secret treasures, yet none suited his taste.

The best was only a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level item: a long halberd-shaped treasure.

Yang Kai had never cared for such clumsy weapons; only men proud of their muscles favored them. If he wielded it it would look wrong, and tempering it would take time.

After a long search he gave up and left the storeroom in a huff.

Halika and Lin Mufeng, waiting outside, didn't ask what he'd taken nor inspect any loss; they simply shut the storeroom door.

They hoped that when people from the main star arrived, Lady Xue would put in a good word and spare them punishment. Now that Lady Xue wanted something, they readily opened the storeroom.

Yang Kai couldn't help worrying for the Hengluo Commerce Guild—if every star's steward was as irresponsible as Old Ha, wouldn't the guild bleed itself dry?
