## Chapter 1883 — A Group Of Yao

Yang Kai's screams did not cease until, at the end, his voice was hoarse.

It was a kind of tormenting pain that was unbearable.

Every upward shift of the dragon scale made him feel as if a thousand knives were tearing him apart. Everywhere it passed, flesh and meridians alike were reduced to mush. Even with Yang Kai’s formidable physique, he simply could not withstand the corrosive onslaught of that Dragon Might. Fortunately his vitality was exceptionally tenacious, and his Qi and blood were surging enough that his own recovery speed fully kept pace with the damage.

Eventually, the golden light formed by the dragon scale flowed into Yang Kai's cardiac chamber.

Bang bang… two strong heartbeats sounded; Yang Kai froze, and in the next moment the heart in his chest stopped completely, wrapped in golden light, and he collapsed straight to the ground.

Watching from afar, the worried Fire Bird Liu Yan and Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao were greatly alarmed and rushed over at once; Liu Yan helped Yang Kai up, her face grave as she tested his breath and pulse, while Xiaoxiao hopped about anxiously at the side but was powerless to help.

When they discovered that Yang Kai not only had no heartbeat but had even stopped breathing, Liu Yan's eyes darkened and she looked at Stone Puppet, slowly shaking her head.

Xiaoxiao whimpered, constantly wailing, pointing first at Liu Yan and then at Yang Kai, gesturing with both hands as if urging her to hurry and find a way.

Liu Yan was at a loss for words.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai—who moments ago seemed utterly lifeless—snapped his eyes open and drew in a violent breath, as though his soul had just returned to his body. He sprang up from the ground, both hands clutching his chest, his pupils trembling uncontrollably.

Thud thud…

A heartbeat stronger than at any other time sounded from his cardiac chamber, one after another, like war drums beating, deafening.

As time passed, the abnormal heartbeat slowly steadied until it was no different from normal.

Only then did Yang Kai fully recover; he slowly straightened his body, his eyes full of lingering fear.

Liu Yan frowned at him; after confirming he was out of danger she quietly exhaled. Xiaoxiao, being simpler, jumped around Yang Kai's feet with a joyful expression.

"I almost had an accident, sorry for making you worry," Yang Kai said with a slight smile, wiping the cold sweat from his brow.

He had not expected it; merely merging a single dragon scale proved so perilous. Everything before had proceeded extremely smoothly— even fusing the dragon scale into his body had not been arduous— but when the dragon scale entered his cardiac chamber, Yang Kai suddenly felt as if he were about to die.

Fortunately his body was different from ordinary people's; it was only by relying on his tremendous vitality that he held on, otherwise it truly might have gone wrong.

With his formidable cultivation at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, fusing with even a single Secret Treasure like a Dragon Scale had nearly gone awry; one could imagine how difficult the rest would be.

That had only been the first Secret Treasure; to fuse with a second or third in a short time would be impossible, unless he became stronger—only then could he set his sights on the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Pearl.

Seeing that he was fine, Liu Yan nodded slightly; her delicate form shimmered as she transformed back into a Fire Bird and flew to some place in the Small Xuan Realm to continue secluding herself.

Stone Puppet stood at Yang Kai's feet, patted his calf, then patted its own chest, forcing its hunched back straight as if to tell Yang Kai that next time he need not worry—everything would be handled by it.

It looked extremely reliable!

Yang Kai reached out and patted its head, his face full of quiet satisfaction.

At that moment Yang Kai suddenly frowned, released his Divine Sense, and his expression turned strange; he said to Xiaoxiao, "You go cultivate too—something's happened outside, I'll go take a look."

Xiaoxiao seemed half to understand; Yang Kai then vanished.

In the starry sky, the warship that should have been sailing toward Shuiyue Star had at some point stopped, and outside the warship a fierce battle was erupting.

On this Hengluo Commerce Guild warship the martial artists aboard were generally not weak; besides Yang Kai there was another Void King Realm expert, Chun Yi of the Tongtian Auction House, though she was only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm.

Beneath her, whether Li Nuo or Hua Youmeng or several other warriors of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, they were all experts of the Origin Returning Realm, some even at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Such a combat force was not insignificant.

Yet even so, the Hengluo Commerce Guild side was being pressed and lamenting their plight.

Chun Yi was entangled by an enemy of the First Stage of the Void King Realm and could not spare attention; Li Nuo, Hua Youmeng and the other Third Stage experts were each being interfered with by their opponents, forced to break formation and fight separately.

The original members of the Five Directions Commerce Guild — Xia Jingwu, Haitang, Yao Qing, and the others — were all pale-faced, clearly unable to hold on much longer.

On the other hand the enemy numbers were many; quite a few enemies were scattered about and did not hurry to strike, but watched leisurely as if looking for the right opportunity.

It was evident this battle had not just begun but had been going on for a long time; even the likes of Chun Yi and that other Void King Realm expert showed signs of Saint Yuan depletion.

Also because both sides had Void King Realm experts, no one dared to strike a killing blow.

Otherwise, if a Void King Realm master were truly driven to anger, neither side would come out unscathed.

“Why hasn’t Brother Yang come out yet?” Shen Tu asked, forcing back an opponent while turning to the panting Yao Qing beside him.

"How would I know? I went to call in front of his door earlier, but he never responded—I don't know what he was doing," Yao Qing said, looking sullen.

"Perhaps he's in seclusion; otherwise he wouldn't ignore us," Shen Tu said anxiously. With Chun Yi present they needn't worry too much, but if something went wrong they would all become prisoners.

Shen Tu felt that his trip had been cursed with bad luck.

Normally, when the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship moved through the Star Domain it could act with impunity; warriors who recognized the guild's mark would keep their distance. Yet this time, first being drawn into the Purple Star's power struggle and being detained, they barely escaped, and on the return journey they had run into this; it was simply the worst luck.

Looking around, Shen Tu's heart sank; he found the others were likewise in poor condition, and if Yang Kai did not appear soon their side would inevitably suffer casualties or be captured alive.

At the moment he was filled with anxiety, a familiar voice suddenly rang out nearby: "We're all on the same side—stop fighting, everyone, stand down!"

The Hengluo Commerce Guild people were overjoyed and all looked toward the source of the voice, finding a familiar figure standing in the void; instantly their hearts calmed and the weariness vanished.

Yang Kai's appearance seemed to give them boundless confidence.

This change slightly surprised the Hengluo Commerce Guild's enemies.

The Void King Realm warrior who was fighting Chun Yi sneered, "You're talking nonsense—who's on your side?"

Yang Kai looked that way and chuckled: "What? It's only been a few years and the Elder has already forgotten this Junior?"

The enemy Void King was startled and then exclaimed in surprise, "That voice…"

He finally glanced at Yang Kai, and at the sight his eyes nearly popped out; pointing at Yang Kai he stammered, "You… you…"

"Senior Ba He, long time no see!" Yang Kai said with a smile, cupping his fist toward him.

Ba He still stared blankly for a moment, rubbed his eyes hard to make sure he was not mistaken, and then exclaimed oddly, "Yang Kai! So it's really you!"

Beside him a deep, booming voice rang out: "Hey, brother-in-law, hello!" The speaker was a hulking man with a shaggy beard and massive build like an iron tower, his appearance resembling a bear and chilling to behold.

"Yu Xiong, you're here too," Yang Kai smiled at him.

"Call me brother-in-law!" Yu Xiong snorted.

Yang Kai smiled without replying.

Yu Xiong could not help rolling his eyes.

With Yang Kai's interruption the fighting on both sides abruptly ceased, and everyone looked at him strangely, though they did not drop their guard.

"Brother Yang…" Shen Tu flew to Yang Kai's side and asked softly, "Do you know this group of yao?"

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “We know each other.”

When he discovered that the ones fighting Shen Tu and the others were warriors from the Red Moon Domain on Di Chen Star, he was at a loss to understand how these fellows had come into the Star Domain.

Ba He having advanced to the First Stage of the Void King Realm was within expectation.

When Yang Kai had first seen Ba He he had already been at the same level as Ye Xijun, and since Ye Xijun could ascend to the Void King Realm, Ba He naturally could too—especially since he had been to the Blood Prison Trial and gained benefits there.

As for Yu Xiong, he still remained at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, though his aura had grown much more condensed.

"You know their background?" Shen Tu asked in surprise. "As far as I know, they are the yao of the Red Moon Domain on Di Chen Star—do you know them too?"

"I know," Yang Kai chuckled, then asked, "How did you end up fighting them?"

Shen Tu sneered, "Those bastards couldn't pick a better trade—imitating the star-robbers of the Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest to try and seize our warship; perhaps they think there's something valuable onboard."

Yang Kai's expression darkened.

Yu Xiong shouted, "We are not star-robbers; it is you humans who intruded into our Di Chen Star's territory, so we came to lightly punish you!"

"Di Chen Star nearby?" Yang Kai was astonished. Turning his head to look, he saw in the distance a familiar star, spanning the sky like a giant demon and exuding thick yao qi.

"Five million li away!" Yu Xiong answered with righteous certainty.

"You just said it yourself — five million li away, aren't you yao a bit overreaching?" Shen Tu said with displeasure.

“I don’t care,” Yu Xiong snorted. “If I say this falls within Di Chen Star’s borders, then it falls within Di Chen Star’s borders. You humans stepped over the line — naturally you’ll get taught a lesson.”
