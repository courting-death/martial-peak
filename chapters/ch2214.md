## Chapter 2214 — Acting Separately

“Is it because of the Spirit Body...” Murong Xiaoxiao interjected, lost in thought.

“That’s probably it.” Shen Muji nodded in agreement.

Because they were now Spirit Bodies, they couldn’t use many of the techniques and secret arts they were accustomed to, nor could they wield their usual Secret Treasures. Naturally, this left everyone feeling out of sorts in battle.

Moreover, battles involving the spirit had always been something all cultivators tried their best to avoid.

Normally, if two cultivators of similar strength encountered each other, they wouldn’t choose to fight using Divine Sense, because such battles were far too dangerous. A single misstep could result in total loss of consciousness, turning one into a cripple.

But in this Divine Roaming Mirror world, everyone had no choice but to use their spirits as their main body. As a result, many new problems arose.

For example, when an attack came at you, in the outside world you might be able to counter it easily, or even redirect its force.

But here, when a fierce move came at you, everyone’s first reaction was to dodge... to avoid injury to the spirit.

“It seems there’s still a lot we need to learn.” Xia Sheng gave a wry smile, then continued, “Let’s not dwell on it for now. This Divine Soul Origin...” His gaze swept over everyone, finally resting on Shen Muji. He said, “Junior Brother Shen, you absorb it first.” With that, he looked at Yang Kai to confirm, “Brother Yang, you have no objections, right?”

“None!” Yang Kai shook his head.

Xia Sheng nodded slightly.

Shen Muji didn’t refuse either. After expressing his thanks, he reached out and grasped the Divine Soul Origin, silently circulating his cultivation art to absorb it.

In just a short while, the Divine Soul Origin was completely absorbed.

Although the change wasn’t very obvious, Shen Muji’s spirit was undoubtedly a bit stronger. This could be seen from the joy on his face.

After all, it was a peak Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beast. The boost it gave to one’s soul was something the person absorbing it could clearly feel.

“Let’s continue...” Xia Sheng said, then once again took the lead, searching for prey.

Two days passed in a flash.

During those two days, Yang Kai’s group supported each other as they moved through the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, encountering many Demonic Beasts. Each time, they managed to kill them with little danger. The Divine Soul Origins obtained from the slain Demonic Beasts were, under Xia Sheng’s arrangement, distributed almost evenly.

Yang Kai absorbed the Divine Soul Origins of nine Ninth-Tier Demonic Beasts, five Tenth-Tier, and two Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beasts in total...

His spirit was clearly more solid than when he first entered this place.

The others naturally also gained a lot.

Even Shen Muji, whose spirit was the weakest, had made remarkable progress.

In the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, there were indeed countless Demonic Beasts rampaging about. The group didn’t even need to search deliberately; they would often run into them.

They didn’t bother killing Demonic Beasts that were too weak, because even if they did, there wouldn’t be much benefit. All the ones they killed were Ninth-Tier and above.

However, perhaps because they were still in the outer area, they hadn’t encountered any Twelfth-Tier ones yet.

Of course, if they really did run into a Twelfth-Tier, all they could do was flee for their lives.

After two days of intense fighting, everyone’s condition was very different from before. They had clearly grown a lot. If they were to encounter that Xuan Earth Turtle again, with the five of them as they were now, it would probably only take the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea to kill it.

In other words, they had completely adapted to this place, to their current bodies, and even to the current style of fighting.

During a break, Xia Sheng suddenly said, “Everyone, I have a suggestion. I’m not sure if I should say it.”

“Act separately?” Xiao Baiyi looked at him with an expression that said, ‘I know exactly what you’re thinking.’

Xia Sheng grinned, “Xiao Bai gets me!” He continued, “With all five of us together, it’s certainly very safe, but it’s just too inefficient. Elder Gao also said that we only have a month in this world. After a month, a restriction on the token will activate and forcibly bring us back. Who knows when we’ll get another chance to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror? With such a great opportunity, if we don’t make the most of it, how could we face ourselves?”

“Compared to moving together safely, I’d rather split up. There will be some danger, but isn’t our potential only forced out in dangerous situations?” His eyes shone with a strange excitement and confidence. “If you always grow in a safe environment, when real danger comes, it’ll be too late.”

“Actually...” Xiao Baiyi slowly added, “I was thinking the same thing.”

It implied he had concerns he hadn’t voiced.

“Split up?” Murong Xiaoxiao hesitated for a moment, but quickly firmed up and nodded, “No problem.”

Seeing her agree, Xia Sheng turned his gaze to Shen Muji.

The latter smiled and said, “Senior Brothers and Senior Sister, you don’t need to worry about me. Although my spirit cultivation is the lowest here, I’ll act within my limits. After all, I’m still a disciple of the Shrine!”

“Good!” Xia Sheng looked at him with satisfaction, then turned to Yang Kai and grinned, “Brother Yang definitely has no objections.”

“I’m fine with anything,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

This entry into the Divine Roaming Mirror was a chance opportunity, so he didn’t have any strong demands. If Xia Sheng and the others insisted on staying together, he would go along. Since they wanted to split up, he was happy to see it.

In fact, he preferred the latter.

Acting together with Xia Sheng and the others, there were many methods he didn’t dare use, always feeling unable to go all out.

“Then, let me wish everyone...” Xia Sheng looked over the group, his expression solemn, “Safe travels, and may you all return alive!”

“I’ll go first.” Xiao Baiyi was decisive. After agreeing to act separately, he immediately set off, leaping away in one direction.

“Take care, Senior Brother!” Murong Xiaoxiao said to Xia Sheng, then looked at Yang Kai and Shen Muji, “You two as well.”

“You too, Miss Murong!” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

Murong Xiaoxiao nodded, her graceful figure flickering as she shot off in another direction.

“I’ll go too,” Shen Muji said as he stood up. After nodding to Xia Sheng and Yang Kai, he used his movement skill and disappeared.

Soon, only Xia Sheng and Yang Kai were left.

Xia Sheng looked at Yang Kai with a smile and asked, “Brother Yang, which direction will you go?”

“This way!” Yang Kai pointed to a direction different from the others.

Xia Sheng’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re heading deeper in... Brother Yang, be careful. Elder Gao said there are many beings in the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range even she wouldn’t dare provoke.”

“I’ll act within my limits. I won’t be reckless.” Yang Kai smiled.

“That’s for the best.” Xia Sheng nodded, “Well then... I’ll take my leave. See you when we get out!”

With that, Xia Sheng rose lightly and flew off in one direction. Judging by his path, he was also heading deeper into the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, just not the same way as Yang Kai.

Soon, Xia Sheng’s figure disappeared.

Only then did Yang Kai slowly stand up. He turned to look toward the depths of the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range and murmured, “It’s time to let loose and go all out.”

...

Meanwhile, at the foot of the mountain range, a force of several hundred people arrived in grand fashion, stopping in the open space at the mountain’s base.

This was clearly a well-trained army. Even with several hundred people gathered together, their formation was unbroken and their movements orderly. Standing there, not a sound could be heard. Only a solemn, chilling aura lingered around them, coiling above their heads like a hidden dragon, stirring the clouds in the sky...

Among the ranks, great banners fluttered in the wind.

On the back of the banners was a vivid image of a fierce tiger descending a mountain, its bared fangs and imposing presence seeming to burst from the cloth, making it hard to breathe.

On the front, a large character “Zhou” was clearly visible, written in bold, powerful strokes.

This was the Divine Roaming Nation’s national army, the elite troops under Zhou Dian’s command.

At this moment, Zhou Dian sat astride a snow-white Nine-Resonance Kui Dragon Beast, wearing no armor, just ordinary clothes. Yet the murderous aura around him was enough to make anyone shiver.

Staring at the nearby Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, Zhou Dian sneered, “How nostalgic... The last time I came here was over two thousand years ago. I never thought I’d return in this life!”

He muttered to himself, and none of his soldiers dared respond.

A moment later, Zhou Dian suddenly shouted, “Lian Yan, Ban Qing, Yu Man, Yuan Qing!”

Four people stepped forward and cupped their fists, “At your command!”

All four possessed the powerful cultivation of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. They were Zhou Dian’s most capable generals, brought along on this mission to the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range to capture the Calamity Star on the monarch’s orders.

Of the four, Yu Man was the only female expert; the rest were male.

Lian Yan had long red hair down to his waist, looking extremely flamboyant. From the faint red glow around him, it seemed his spirit power had some special quality.

Ban Qing was short and looked very ordinary, but was highly skilled in stealth and assassination. Even someone as strong as Zhou Dian could be caught off guard if he wasn’t careful.

Yu Man looked about thirty, with a voluptuous figure and a mature charm in every gesture. Her high nose was elegantly curved, her alluring red lips inviting endless imagination, her ample chest and round hips captivating.

The last, Yuan Qing, was a mystery—no one knew what secret arts or cultivation methods he practiced, but his entire presence radiated an almost ethereal androgyny. His features were so exquisitely beautiful that even many women would pale in comparison when standing before him.
