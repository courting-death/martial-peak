## Chapter 555 — The Decision to Leave

Although Di Mo’s words gave the impression of a blatant denial, everyone knew he was speaking the truth.

Just now, when the square-faced elder from the Ye Family was struck down and could not rise, Meng Wuya, Ling Taixu, and the other two truly were engaged in battle high above the heavens, only descending after sensing the disturbance below.

Those three indeed had neither the time, opportunity, nor means to do such a thing.

The sudden death of a figure beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was an event that shocked the entire world. None of the experts from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families had any appetite left to trouble Yang Kai.

No one felt secure with the mystery surrounding the death of the Ye Family expert unresolved.

A killer lurking silently in the shadows, who could eliminate even a peak Divine Roaming Realm master, could undoubtedly dispatch all the others.

“Tonight’s affairs have troubled you all,” Yang Liting said faintly to Meng Wuya and the others. “We shall come back another day to learn from you masters’ superior skills.”

With that, he lifted the corpse of the Ye Family expert and hurried off with six others toward Fengshen Hall.

Meng Wuya and the others showed no intention of stopping them; their display of power this time had merely been to stand up for Yang Kai.

“Clean up the bodies; let’s go as well,” Ye Xinrou ordered, looking rather disheartened.

Though all Seven Great Families suffered losses this night, no doubt her Ye Family endured the greatest.

For an expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm to die so mysteriously was a heavy blow to the Ye Family.

Soon, the intruding foes retreated entirely.

“What exactly happened?” Meng Wuya was baffled, unable to understand how the person had died so suddenly. As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai as if meaning to imply something.

“Why’re you looking at me?” Yang Kai protested, “It wasn’t me.”

His words made many want to laugh, yet they couldn’t.

Indeed, although the young master’s abilities were extraordinary and his potential astonishing—creating countless miraculous feats—killing someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was still far beyond reach.

“I didn’t say it was you, why take it so sensitively?” Meng Wuya rolled his eyes, suddenly realizing something.

Had Yang Kai not defended himself, he might not have connected the incident to him. Yet now that Yang Kai had done so, suspicion arose.

Could this really have something to do with this boy? Meng Wuya was confused.

“We should also tidy up the battlefield,” Yang Kai said solemnly, looking upon the wreckage.

The major factions quickly moved to retrieve the bodies of the fallen warriors.

Dawn broke; the fierce night of battle ended. Although somewhat anticlimactic, such momentous events were beyond human control.

But after this night’s battle, everyone in Yang Kai’s residence knew one thing:

The current situation was even more severe than Yang Kai had previously warned. His earlier warnings were not alarmism, but possibly underestimated just how dire things had become.

They were truly at odds with the Zhongdu Eight Great Families!

Moreover, the involvement of those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm had been stirred into this conflict.

By what merit had Yang Kai provoked such superpowers in Zhongdu? And why did the Yang Family remain silent and neglect him?

They did not know, but they fully realized the gravity of the problem.

After a day of rest, many were more fatigued than refreshed. Last night’s battle had inflicted injuries on every faction. The death of a peak Divine Roaming Realm warrior was a huge loss for all.

Each faction was deeply troubled.

In a room, Yang Kai, Meng Wuya, Ling Taixu, and Di Mo gathered to discuss matters.

“Little Yang Kai, what do you plan to do now?” Meng Wuya asked in a deep voice, having restored his peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivation.

He had sustained few wounds in the fight last night, but Di Mo appeared somewhat weakened today.

“Leave here,” Yang Kai said with a bitter smile. “There’s no place here for me anymore.”

Meng Wuya nodded slightly: “You should have left long ago. If you never intended to become the Yang Family head, you shouldn't have involved yourself in the Succession War and stirred up this mess.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. “My reason for joining the Succession War was merely to vindicate the sect’s name. It seems now, given my position, I cannot accomplish this.”

Ling Taixu comforted him: “Do not feel guilty; whether the sect gains recognition or not, it remains the same sect. There is no need to concern yourself with the world’s opinions.”

Yang Kai nodded softly. “I understand.”

Di Mo chuckled: “Leaving isn’t bad. From now on, the sky is vast for the birds to fly, the sea wide for fish to leap. With this old servant assisting you, Young Master’s future achievements will be infinitely greater than leading the Yang Family—by hundreds of times. When your strength matures, returning will leave all those Zhongdu Eight Great Families begging at your feet.”

“You speak so disgustingly,” Yang Kai glared.

Meng Wuya shook his head: “Though distasteful, what he says is your best path forward. We all believe with your talent and potential you can achieve this. You are better suited to wandering and cultivating alone than being shackled by sect and family. Those chains will limit your future achievements if not broken.”

Yang Kai was stunned, looking at the three of them. They all regarded him with a firm, believing gaze. His heart stirred, and he chuckled, “Then I shall strive not to disappoint you.”

“Good,” Ling Taixu smiled. “Regarding the sect, fear not. As long as I live, I will guard it. As for your family, your parents are safe. Despite the Yang Family’s arrogance and injustice toward you, misfortune will not befall your parents.”

“That I know,” Yang Kai breathed lightly.

“Young Master, when do you plan to leave?” Di Mo inquired.

“As soon as possible,” Yang Kai’s expression dulled a bit. After so long of hard work, it felt regretful to decide to give up so quickly.

“I need several days to recover, and so does this Demon Master,” Meng Wuya coughed lightly. “Take advantage of these days to talk well with those in the residence; after all, they have sacrificed much for you.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly then suddenly asked curiously, “Shopkeeper Meng, how exactly did you and Di Mo raise your cultivation to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?”

Everyone was curious about the shocking techniques they used last night, Yang Kai included.

Upon hearing this, Meng Wuya and Di Mo exchanged glances and laughed softly.

“If it’s convenient, I’d also like to hear,” Ling Taixu showed interest.

Meng Wuya pondered a moment, then nodded faintly before waving his hand. An invisible energy wrapped the room, isolating all external probing.

“I know many have been drawn to covet our methods,” Meng Wuya said with a humph. “But they are shortsighted if they think simply obtaining them would allow them to mimic us. It’s laughable.”

Yang Kai was astonished. “So knowing the method alone won’t do?”

Di Mo nodded firmly: “No. It’s clear that Old Meng’s technique cannot be replicated. As for this old servant’s method—though they might learn it—reaching beyond the Divine Roaming Realm would be impossible.”

“Why?”

“Because beyond the Divine Roaming Realm is a realm unlike any before. Without laying that foundation, without ever reaching that stage, it’s impossible to do,” Di Mo answered but realized his explanation was incomplete and awkwardly added, “Old Meng should explain.”

Meng Wuya smiled lightly: “Simply put, Di Mo was once beyond the Divine Roaming Realm but lost his own body and took over another’s. Now, he only possesses peak Divine Roaming cultivation, but has the foundation and understanding of the realm above. So, he can employ the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art to ascend temporarily.”

Yang Kai suddenly understood.

The top peak Divine Roaming experts of the Eight Great Families had sought that higher level all their lives but could not break through its limitations. Naturally, they could not comprehend its secrets. Even if they knew the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art, they still couldn’t surpass the Divine Roaming Realm.

“As for me, hehe...” Meng Wuya laughed, “My cultivation was merely sealed. Last night, I had to reluctantly break one seal.”

Yang Kai’s complexion shifted.

Though he had his suspicions, hearing Meng Wuya confirm it still made him uneasy.

Meng Wuya’s strength was sealed!

Was it self-imposed? Or inflicted by someone else?

If self-imposed, why? If by others, who could have such supreme skill?

No wonder Shopkeeper Meng always shrouded himself in mystery and was reluctant to intervene in the Succession War.

Top experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm rarely made trouble in such conflicts, relying on their status.

“But regardless, whether it’s me or the Demon Master, though we reached beyond the Divine Roaming Realm through different means, it has taken a toll. You can see Demon Master’s current state. If you are to leave, wait until we have recovered first.”

No one knew if the Eight Great Families would allow Yang Kai to leave unhindered. To be safe, Meng Wuya and Di Mo must remain at full strength.

“Waiting a few days is fine. I suppose the Eight Great Families are busy panicking over the Ye Family expert’s death,” Yang Kai grinned. “Although someday you must tell me more about the secrets beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.”

“That’s natural. With this old servant by your side, Young Master, you shall come to understand in time,” Di Mo replied.

After thinking, Yang Kai took out some Wan Yao Ling Paste and handed it to Meng Wuya and Di Mo. “This should help you recover.”

Ling Taixu’s eyes brightened. “Is it that stuff?”

Yang Kai nodded.

“What is it that moves you so much?” Meng Wuya curiously glanced at Ling Taixu.

“Brother Meng, it was precisely with that that I ascended beyond the Divine Roaming Realm,” Ling Taixu said lightly.

Meng Wuya’s expression changed. He quickly released his Divine Sense to examine the Wan Yao Ling Paste. After a long moment, he exclaimed, “This kind of high-level item actually exists here?”
