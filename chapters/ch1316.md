## Chapter 1316 — Haggling

From the way the young woman spoke, it sounded like if he took Qian Yue's Yuan Yin now, redeeming her later would certainly cost far less — just as Yang Kai and Qian Yue had worried before — but how could Yang Kai possibly do such a thing?

This dumb loss — he could only swallow it and accept it! Yang Kai felt a bellyful of frustration.

With a cold expression, he said, “Miss’s proposal — I cannot accept it. Let’s just say what you said makes sense.”

The young woman brightened at his concession and burst into a pleased smile, then added, "Not to speak of the resources consumed in raising Yue'er up to now — the Dual Cultivation Technique Yue'er practices is our Hehuan House’s secret. Since you, Young Master, intend to redeem her, have you considered how you’ll handle the technique Yue'er has cultivated? Could it be that you plan to buy that Dual Cultivation Technique as well?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly as he suddenly realized he'd overlooked that question, but his thoughts turned fast and he immediately countered, "You must be joking, Miss. Your house’s Dual Cultivation Technique is indeed formidable, but as far as I know, it likely carries many hidden dangers, does it not?"

The young woman heard this and cast a cold glance at Qian Yue, as if she suspected Qian Yue had revealed something.

Yang Kai said lightly, "Rest assured, Yue'er never spoke to me about any details of the Dual Cultivation Technique, but I know there are no such convenient techniques in the world; while your house’s Dual Cultivation Technique may have unique merits, it must also carry risks."

The young woman's color shifted several times, and she did not deny it; instead she nodded and said, "You’re more perceptive than you look, Young Master. Indeed, our Hehuan House’s Dual Cultivation Technique has its dangers, but that’s not a secret. Many know it well, and even guests who come here are aware."

"Oh?" This time Yang Kai was surprised, "Would the lady be so kind as to tell me?"

"Telling you won't change much — you can ask around outside and learn it for yourself. The danger is that if someone uses Dual Cultivation here to break through a bottleneck, their cultivation may never be able to advance further afterward; they will be stuck there."

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded gently. "If there’s a risk, then why come here to attempt a breakthrough?"

"Because those guests believe they have no hope of ever breaking through otherwise, so they no longer care about risks. Coming here might let them progress one more Stage and fulfill their wish. If you, Young Master, were stalled at a bottleneck for decades or centuries with no progress, and learned our Hehuan House could help you advance, what would you choose?"

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and then said seriously, "I might not be able to resist the temptation either."

"Exactly. Even if this Dual Cultivation Technique has risks, it’s still a rare and valuable method. If you want to redeem Yue'er, and Yue'er has practiced it, who’s to say the Young Master isn’t after that very technique?"

"You know my thoughts, so why use that to extort me?" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "I’m not foolish enough to ruin my bright future by relying on a single Dual Cultivation session."

The young woman laughed lightly. "It’s not extortion — I merely have the duty to remind you. But if you insist on taking Yue'er, there is room to negotiate."

"I’m all ears!" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"If Yue'er had cultivated that Dual Cultivation Technique to its deepest levels, even if you paid any price you wished, I would not dare release her. Fortunately, Yue'er hasn’t practiced long and hasn’t touched the later formulas, so there’s room for accommodation. I have two proposals here — I’m not sure which the Young Master will choose."

She looked at Yang Kai, and after he signaled her to continue, she said casually, "The first proposal is simple: just destroy Yue'er’s Dual Cultivation Technique."

At that, Qian Yue turned pale and her delicate body trembled.

Yang Kai couldn’t help frowning. Although Qian Yue had been forced to cultivate the Dual Cultivation Technique after arriving at Hehuan House, she had already practiced it; if it were truly destroyed, it would certainly affect her foundation. If fortune smiled, it would only injure some Yuan Qi and could be recovered with rest; if not, who knew what consequences would follow.

Yang Kai immediately shook his head, "That won't do. Tell me the second."

The young woman seemed to have expected this and smiled as she continued, "The second is that the Young Master must pay an even greater price."

"So you mean I should buy the earlier layers of the Dual Cultivation Technique Yue'er has learned?" Yang Kai said, pondering.

"You could put it that way. I'm a reasonable person; I trust the Young Master won’t make things difficult."

"That proposal is fair and reasonable; I have no objection." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The young woman’s face lit with joy. "You’re truly straightforward, Young Master, but that means the price you pay will not be small."

"Then what price does your house demand?" Yang Kai asked, watching her coolly.

The young woman’s brows knitted as she thought carefully for a moment, then she gave a number.

Qian Yue trembled behind Yang Kai, and a trace of despair flashed through her eyes. The figure the woman named was something she had never dared imagine; from the little she knew of Dark Star, she understood that such an amount of Saint Crystals could buy an excellent Origin-Grade secret treasure. Even spending a lifetime might not be enough to gather such wealth.

Yang Kai also looked troubled, no longer as frank as before, stroking his chin as he pondered.

The young woman smiled slightly and said, "Don’t try to haggle. If I quoted that price, it’s our Hehuan House’s rule and not something I can change at will. If you cannot pay, then please go back from whence you came."

Her last words were blunt, as if she’d decided Yang Kai was all bark and no bite and wasn’t going to waste any more time on him.

Yang Kai sighed softly, "Such a vast sum of Saint Crystals does put me in a difficult position."

The young woman sneered but said nothing further.

Yang Kai shifted tack and asked, "Does your house accept goods as collateral?"

"Goods as collateral?" The young woman arched an eyebrow.

"Yes — secret treasures, pills, materials and such," Yang Kai replied. "But these items are important to me, so I’ll only leave them as collateral; when I return with the Saint Crystals to redeem them, I’ll take them back. After all, no one travels about carrying such a vast sum of Saint Crystals."

"You have a point, but it depends on what you pledge. If you just drop a few items here and never come back, wouldn’t our Hehuan House suffer a loss?"

"You have my word. If I pledge them, I’ll stake only my most important items and won’t fail to reclaim them." Saying this, Yang Kai strained and gestured; in the next moment two jade bottles, two secret treasures, and a spatial ring appeared on the table. He pushed them toward the young woman and said calmly, "Please inspect them and see if they are sufficient."

The young woman eyed Yang Kai suspiciously but made no fuss; she picked up the spatial ring and probed it with her divine sense. When she detected Saint Crystals within, she laid it down again without showing it. The Saint Crystals inside were numerous but far short of the sum she'd named.

She then opened one jade bottle and sniffed its mouth. Her features shifted slightly and, without thinking, she poured out a pill, examined it in her palm, and after a moment revealed a trace of astonishment: "An Origin-Grade Lower-Level Fire Cloud Pill, and of rather fine quality — it must be the handiwork of a master alchemist."

Yang Kai made no comment and gave no answer.

Yet the young woman’s expression had grown noticeably more serious; to obtain such an Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill would indicate ties to master alchemists and a high-status background, so she no longer dared underestimate Yang Kai.

After all, behind the Hehuan House stood the Quehe Sect, which was only a middling sect; there were no such masters stationed within.

She inspected the other jade bottle and found it also contained an Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill, which only confirmed her suspicions. Those two pills alone were worth a great deal and couldn’t simply be bought with Saint Crystals.

The two secret treasures weren’t especially precious — both Saint King-Grade Upper-Level treasures — but they could still account for a fair amount of Saint Crystals.

"Those two pills were hard for me to obtain and will be of great use for my future cultivation, so I can’t part with them easily. You won’t doubt me now, will you?" Yang Kai smiled at the young woman.

The young woman slowly nodded, her doubts dispelled. Truth be told, even ordinary Origin Returning Realm experts might not have such pills; someone at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm could attain them, indicating exceptional connections and means.

Little did she know, those two pills had actually been concocted by Yang Kai himself.

While she pondered, Yang Kai kept silent, but he cast a reassuring glance at Qian Yue. He saw the young woman had evidently been swayed by his offer and likely wouldn’t press for excessive demands; once the deal was done, he would immediately take Qian Yue away from Black Crow City and never return.

As for the pills and treasures he’d handed over, Yang Kai hardly cared.

He hadn’t used all Saint Crystals because he was cautious; not that he lacked them, but revealing such a fortune at once might attract covetous eyes.

Qian Yue couldn’t help but smile a little.

After some time, the young woman seemed to have reached a decision. She raised her delicate head and smiled at Yang Kai, about to speak, then her expression shifted and she hurriedly produced a transmission compass, apologizing, "Excuse me, Young Master, please wait a moment."

Yang Kai nodded with a smile, indicating it was fine.

The young woman poured her divine sense into the transmission compass before Yang Kai, as if communicating with someone; her countenance changed with the exchange.

A moment later she put away the transmission compass with a baffled look and an embarrassed expression toward Yang Kai.

Seeing this, Yang Kai felt a jolt in his chest and a sense of foreboding rose.
