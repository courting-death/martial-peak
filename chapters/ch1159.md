## Chapter 1159 — Next Time, Don't Buy Things Recklessly

The youth was left speechless; a murderous intent filled his eyes, as if he wanted to kill the fool Ge Xiong under his palm this instant. Because that idiot had arbitrarily hiked the price, he had been made to run out here in vain to gawk, and in the end the idiot didn't even have another remnant map. A feeling of having been toyed with surged through the youth; his killing intent swelled. He slowly raised a hand, Saint Yuan flowing there forming, gradually condensing into the shape of a razor-sharp sword.

Ge Xiong wept bitterly, kowtowing until his head hit the ground like someone pounding garlic, begging incessantly.

Before the youth could strike, an Origin Returning Realm standing behind him suddenly spoke in a low voice: "Young Master, don't kill him."

The youth paused in surprise and asked, "Why?"

"If you kill him, there won't be proof. Others might think we've obtained two remnant maps. One remnant map is acceptable, but two would be a big problem!"

The youth thought for a moment, then finally understood, cursed under his breath, and kicked Ge Xiong hard, sending his Spatial Ring flying onto his face before striding away.

Surprisingly, not a single person stopped him.

Not long after the youth and the two Origin Returning Realm left, another person stepped out from a hidden spot and approached the collapsed, soiled Ge Xiong, frowning as he asked a few questions.

Ge Xiong answered truthfully.

The man picked up the Spatial Ring from the ground and examined it, then slowly shook his head in disappointment, tossed it down, and left quickly.

A third person emerged and did exactly the same, followed by a fourth, a fifth...

Having experienced such a drastic fall from life to near death, Ge Xiong's emotions had somewhat settled, but being continuously interrogated by one expert after another—each far superior to him in status and strength—left him shaken. Fortunately, these people only asked a few questions and inspected the Spatial Ring before letting him go; none intended to take his life, and no one tried to seize the contents of his ring.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai was the last to step out.

Ge Xiong was already well accustomed to situations like this. Before Yang Kai could even ask, he rattled off like a rapid-fire cannon, “I don’t have a second map fragment! I only bought it because I believed that pretty woman’s words — she said with the fragment, one could seek unimaginable riches, top-tier cultivation arts, and martial skills! The Spatial Ring is right there on the ground — check it yourself if you want. Just don’t kill me!”

Yang Kai sighed and had no interest in examining the Spatial Ring.

So many people had already looked through it; if there were truly a second remnant map inside, it would have been discovered.

"Next time, don't buy things recklessly," Yang Kai said, half annoyed and half amused.

All those who had followed him were schemers, yet each of them had been fooled by Ge Xiong—not because Ge Xiong's acting was brilliant, but because no one expected the man to be such an oaf who'd so easily believe the auctioneer's words.

Ge Xiong kept nodding rapidly: "I will never buy anything at an auction again."

"Go on," Yang Kai waved him off. "You're alive this time—it's luck. Next time, who knows."

"Yes, yes, yes!" Ge Xiong said gratefully, snatched up his Spatial Ring, and scrambled away. He had been so terrified that he hadn't realized Yang Kai was a warrior of the same realm; otherwise he wouldn't have been so deferential.

Only after running a long distance did Ge Xiong finally produce his Star Shuttle and shakily fly away. Faintly, Yang Kai could still hear his terrified, wailing sobs.

The remnant map that had appeared at the auction was twirled away and taken by the first youth to appear, which vexed Yang Kai. With his current weak strength he naturally couldn't snatch the remnant map.

The others didn't seize it because everyone knew a single remnant map was of little use; otherwise someone would have moved on it during the auction, and it wouldn't have been snatched by Ge Xiong. Besides, that youth likely had some background—no one wanted to offend the forces behind him for the sake of a useless remnant map.

As it stood, the remnant map was no longer with Ge Xiong but with that youth; Yang Kai figured he wouldn't be able to retrieve it in the short term. Fortunately he had memorized the youth's face and could look for other means later.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai returned to Tianyun City and headed straight for Jubao Tower.

In Room C-13, Yang Kai pushed open the door, sat in his chair, and took a sip of spirit tea. Seeing Wu Yi and Yang Flame both flushed with excitement, he couldn't help asking, "How is the Secret Treasure auction going?"

"You're back?" Wu Yi and Yang Flame only then noticed him. Wu Yi beamed: "The prices exceeded expectations—every Secret Treasure sold for over a million. They're currently auctioning that pair of twin forks!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked down and indeed saw that beside the beautiful auctioneer sat the final twin forks, yet to his surprise no one was bidding on them.

"What's the current price?" Yang Kai thought to himself—such a Secret Treasure shouldn't go unsold.

"Two million one hundred thousand!" Wu Yi replied, thrilled, and hurried to explain before Yang Kai could ask more: "The twin forks are nearly Origin-Grade Middle-Level in quality; they're much better than the previous eleven items, hence the much higher price. It seems the people here really know their stuff."

At that moment the beautiful auctioneer cried out: "Two million one hundred thousand once! Two million one hundred thousand twice! Two million one hundred thousand thrice—sold! Congratulations to the friend in room B-3 on winning the Exquisite Twin Forks. I wish the friend great success in Flowing Flame Sandland and a bountiful return."

The auctioneer offered a few polished phrases, and a palace-attired girl from Jubao Tower carried the Exquisite Twin Forks on a jade tray to room B-3.

“Huh? Box B-3? That’s not the Liuli Gate?” Yang Kai was startled. He had thought that the Exquisite Twin Forks would be bought by Yin Sudie of the Liuli Gate — after all, it was a Secret Treasure suited for women. But if he remembered correctly, the Liuli Gate’s room was in one of the A-Class rooms.

"Why would it be Liuli Gate?" Wu Yi asked in puzzlement.

"It's nothing," Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

Yang Kai went out for a quick walk; this round of twelve Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures had been auctioned off, and now they were selling pills—also Origin-Grade Lower-Level pills.

Jubao Tower had obviously made full preparations for this auction and believed the Flowing Flame Sandland was about to open, so the great powers wouldn't spare expense. As long as there were good items, they wouldn't worry about fetching steep prices. Thus, after the Secret Treasures the Origin-Grade Lower-Level pills were brought out, reigniting the hall's fiery atmosphere.

Yang Kai had gained a deep understanding of just how expensive Origin-Grade pills were here. A single bottle of Restoration Pills, ten pills in total, had been sold for a staggering six hundred thousand Saint Crystals — averaging sixty thousand per pill.

A bottle of ten Rose Pills, effective for healing, sold for an even higher price—seven hundred thirty thousand per bottle.

A bottle of five Meridian Pills that repaired the meridians sold for eight hundred thousand.

The most expensive were the ice-snow pills that could help warriors dispel heat: a single bottle brought one million hundred thousand!

The Flowing Flame Sandland was filled with blazing heat; the ice-snow pills would be invaluable there, so once they appeared they were franticly seized by the great powers—five bottles in total—and each sold for progressively higher prices.

Pills are unlike Secret Treasures: treasures can be used repeatedly if not damaged, whereas pills are consumed. These major powers, intent on entering the Flowing Flame Sandland, were willing to spend lavishly; under normal circumstances these Origin-Grade pills, though precious, wouldn't fetch such astronomical prices.

But with the timing and location on Jubao Tower's side, they managed to sell these pills for three to four times the usual price.

The beautiful auctioneer stood on stage smiling radiantly, her face flushed.

It took over an hour, but finally the Origin-Grade Lower-Level pills were all sold. Every force in the private rooms had more or less made gains, and all were pleased.

Just as many assumed the auction would draw to a close, the auctioneer coquettishly said, "Everyone, please quiet down. Next up for auction is the grand finale item prepared by our Jubao Tower..."

The moment the words "grand finale" were spoken, the entire hall fell silent, broken only by heavy breaths; countless gazes fixed on the auctioneer, and a few sharp-eyed warriors even noticed a slight tremor in her voice, immediately understanding that the finale must be extraordinary.

"Because this concerns great matters, the finale will be presided over personally by our Jubao Tower steward Yan Pei. Please welcome Steward Yan Pei!" the auctioneer said, stepping aside and smiling toward a particular direction.

Yan Pei strode over from that direction, his face dark, expression stern.

"Yan Pei is hosting personally!" murmurs and whispers erupted not only in the hall but in the private rooms as well.

Yan Pei was known for his grim face and ruthless methods, famed as the most heartless and merciless auctioneer of Jubao Tower. In his earlier days whenever he presided over auctions he would cut the bidders to the bone. In recent years, as he'd grown older and risen in status, he had rarely appeared at auctions.

None expected that after so many years away, Yan Pei would show up personally this time.

Everyone knew his presence meant the auction floor would be a bloodbath. Pale-faced people in the private rooms discreetly checked their Spatial Rings and sighed, secretly worrying about the Saint Crystals stored within.

"That thing can really be the finale!" In C-13, Wu Yi and Yang Flame exchanged a look, nearly leaping with excitement.

Regardless of the item's actual grade, being labelled the finale alone had already inflated its value greatly; the two women could almost picture themselves becoming very wealthy after this auction.

Yang Flame was already calculating how many expensive materials she should buy.

Room A-5 belonged to Yingyue Hall; at present, besides Qian Tong, five or six young talents sat within, all rising stars of Yingyue Hall.

But only one man and one woman were privileged to sit beside Qian Tong: the man was broad-shouldered and heroic-looking, his eyes restrained with inner light—clearly a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm—while the woman was slender and exquisitely pretty, also a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; her aura was less restrained and more showy, evidently someone who had broken through only recently.
