## Chapter 84 — The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body

Even among those in the Medicine King Valley who claimed to live by alchemy, none could match the profound attainments of Xia Ningshang.

“What kind of constitution does Senior Sister have?” Yang Kai turned to ask.

Meng Wuya’s voice was grave as he replied, “The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body.”

“Is it related to alchemy?”

“Indeed.” Meng Wuya nodded. “This constitution is extremely rare—one might not appear even once in a thousand years. Those who possess the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body suffer no side effects from consuming any pill. You should know that medicine is three parts poison. Although many pills today can aid cultivation or even greatly enhance one’s strength, there is always a limit to how many pills a person can take. But the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body is different. It can be said that it is the best pill furnace under heaven. Once a pill enters the body, any harmful elements are refined away. Your Senior Sister has only cultivated for five years, yet she has already reached the peak of the Separation and Union Realm. Were it not for my deliberate suppression of her cultivation, she would have ascended to the True Essence Realm long ago.”

Yang Kai was stunned. Five years to reach the peak of Separation and Union Realm—he had cultivated for over a decade and was still only at that stage. Moreover, this was after being suppressed. Without that, she would be stronger than Su Yan?

Yang Kai felt ashamed. Compared to this Senior Sister, his own talent was like heaven and earth apart.

This Senior Sister was truly the greatest genius of Lingxiao Pavilion!

Yet Xia Ningshang’s rapid growth was inseparable from the vast quantities of miraculous pills she consumed.

Meng Wuya continued, “The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body is not only beneficial in these ways. If one cultivates a compatible divine technique, all things under heaven that contain energy can be refined into pills. Even the spiritual energy of the world itself can be condensed into pills, should the disciple so desire.”

All things under heaven, as long as they contain energy, can be refined into pills! If even the spiritual energy of the world can be refined, then the Three Yang Fruit would naturally be no problem.

Yang Kai could almost foresee that this Senior Sister would become the greatest alchemist in the world. With such a unique constitution alone, no one could compare.

“This time, Ningshang is to ascend to the True Essence Realm, but before that, she must refine something into her body—something she cannot obtain alone,” Meng Wuya said seriously to Yang Kai.

“So you need my help?” Yang Kai asked.

Meng Wuya nodded.

“What kind of thing?”

“Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. This substance greatly aids in condensing True Essence. If I did not want Ningshang to refine it, I would not have suppressed her cultivation.”

The transition from Separation and Union Realm to True Essence Realm involves the transformation of one’s primordial qi into True Essence, raising its quality by countless degrees. Every martial artist must undergo this process. However, with the aid of certain rare treasures, the quality of the resulting True Essence can be greatly improved.

This Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was clearly such a treasure—undoubtedly the finest of its kind.

“Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew itself possesses spiritual awareness and is very difficult to obtain. If touched by someone unqualified, it will immediately dissolve into spiritual energy and vanish. Only those who cultivate Yang-type primordial qi can control it, and their Yang qi must be refined to a certain purity. That is why I seek you.”

“How exactly do we proceed?” Yang Kai asked.

Meng Wuya’s patience wore thin. “Why so many questions? You will know when the time comes.”

Yang Kai pinched his nose, wondering why the old man was so irritable.

“Where is this thing? When do we set out?”

“It lies within Black Wind Mountain, at a place where the Nine Yin energies converge. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Yin energy gathers, and only then will the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew appear, absorbing the Yin energy of heaven and earth.”

“That’s not many days away.” Yang Kai calculated and found there were only a dozen or so days until the seventh day of the seventh month. Traveling deep into Black Wind Mountain would take considerable time.

“Therefore, if you have no other matters, I wish to depart as soon as possible. Missing this opportunity means waiting another year,” Meng Wuya said solemnly.

“I am ready at any time,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Then come to the Contribution Hall to find me in two days. I still need to prepare some materials,” Meng Wuya reminded him.

“Very well, it’s settled.”

They agreed to meet at the Contribution Hall two days later, and only then did Yang Kai leave.

Watching his retreating figure, Meng Wuya sighed softly, his expression strange. After a long moment, he spoke, “Disciple, are you certain you wish to do this?”

Xia Ningshang’s robes fluttered as she nodded gently. “Yes.”

Meng Wuya said, “Actually, you could ascend to the True Essence Realm without refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, but your future strength would be slightly weaker.”

Xia Ningshang smiled lightly. “But to help Master, isn’t purer True Essence better? Master saved and raised me; I wish to help Master in return.”

“But… well, perhaps you should reconsider?”

Meng Wuya had left two days before the meeting precisely to give Xia Ningshang time to think it over.

Xia Ningshang blushed. “It’s nothing. I do not dislike him.”

Meng Wuya sighed deeply. “That boy is getting off easy.”

Thinking of Yang Kai’s indifferent expression, Meng Wuya’s teeth itched with frustration. He thought he was just coming to help, but little did he realize how much advantage he would gain.

Just don’t let sparks fly between them! This small place is ultimately not the disciple’s true home. Meng Wuya was full of worry and anxiety.

Yang Kai did not return to Su Yan’s small pavilion but went back to the small wooden hut he had been away from for several days. Despite his absence, the hut was still as clean as ever, not a speck of dust to be found. He did not know who had been tidying it for him.

Although Shopkeeper Meng had been vague, Yang Kai basically understood where he was going and what he needed to do.

Since it was a place where the Nine Yin energies converged, the Yin energy there would be very strong. His True Yang Yuan Qi was the natural counter to Yin energy, so he was not afraid. However, his current strength was somewhat low, and without storing some Yang Liquid, he might not be able to endure for long.

Fortunately, Senior Sister Xia had helped him refine all the Three Yang Fruits into pills, which was a good way to replenish his Yang Liquid reserves.

Four Three Yang Fruit trees, each bearing three fruits, had been refined into twelve bright red pills. If each pill could condense three drops of Yang Liquid, then he could obtain thirty-six drops in total.

This Yang Liquid was invaluable both in battle and for resisting Yin energy—it was his lifeline.

Yang Kai spent an entire day absorbing the effects of all twelve pills.

To his surprise, he obtained not just thirty-six drops, but a full forty drops of Yang Liquid. Counting the few drops already stored in his dantian, his reserves were now quite substantial.

This journey, at last, he had some capital to rely on.

Not only had he gained so much Yang Liquid, but after refining the last fruit, Yang Kai found that his realm had broken through to the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm.

This breakthrough came without any warning or preparation, smooth and effortless.

Reflecting on it, Yang Kai thought it was related to the pills he had consumed over the past few days—first the dozen or so pills from Su Yan, then the twelve Three Yang Pills. Such a massive influx of energy made the breakthrough unsurprising.
