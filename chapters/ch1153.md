## Chapter 1153 — The Fragment

The beautiful woman stood gracefully atop the high platform, offering a light bow. With a faint smile on her lips, she gently parted them, and a melodious voice flowed out: “Thank you all for attending this auction held by my Jubao Tower. I am deeply grateful that everyone has come from afar, and I offer my thanks here and now. I must also express special gratitude to Elder Qian Tong of Yingyue Hall — this auction could not have proceeded so smoothly without his great support and contribution.”

As soon as those words left her mouth, low curses immediately rose from dozens of private first-class and second-class rooms. The people inside had just received messages from their subordinates, learning that Qian Tong had extorted five hundred thousand Saint Crystals from each of them for a single use of Tianyun City’s Space Array. Who in their right mind would thank him now? The fact that they hadn’t shouted outright insults was already out of consideration for their own status — and to give Qian Tong a shred of face. Thank him? Thank his damned grandmother!

Yang Kai watched the beauty from Private Room C-13 with keen interest. Although he'd never been to an auction before, that didn't mean he was ignorant of such affairs.

An auctioneer is a crucial element; a good auctioneer knows how to stir the atmosphere and turn the room into a blazing furnace of excitement. Once that mood is lit, the prices of the lots climb straight up.

The beauty on stage was stunning enough that even if she had remained silent her presence alone would have raised the hall's temperature several degrees — Jubao Tower had chosen their presenter with malicious care.

The woman gave her name, courteously apologized for any shortcomings in Jubao Tower's hospitality, and spoke with such propriety that there was nothing to fault; the ever-present, springlike smile on her face made every guest feel warmly welcomed. Her watery, radiant eyes swept across the audience so that everyone felt as if she were looking right at them, waiting for them to display their wealth.

After a few words she shifted tone, laughing softly: "I'll spare the small talk. The auction now begins. The first lot today is a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level suit of armor!"

As she spoke, a woman dressed in elegant palace robes slowly walked in from the back, holding a jade tray in her hands. On the tray rested a Saint King–Grade, Upper-Level set of armor, shimmering with five-colored light and emanating strong energy fluctuations — clearly a fine defensive Secret Treasure.

The beautiful woman waited a moment, and after everyone had finished admiring the armor, she continued, “This Five-Colored Ruyi Armor is a recent creation of our Jubao Tower’s master artificer, Master Gong Taihong. Master Gong’s reputation precedes him, so I won’t elaborate on his craftsmanship. This armor not only possesses excellent defensive power but can also adjust its size at will—hence the name Ruyi—‘As You Wish’. It can be worn by both men and women. The starting bid is thirty thousand Saint Crystals, with each increase no less than two thousand. Everyone, please begin!”

Hearing that opening price, Yang Kai frowned and glanced at Yang Flame.

He remembered that when Yang Flame had forged his first batch of Secret Treasures for him, she had once produced a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level piece: a pair of auxiliary Secret Treasures crafted from the wings of an Illusory Cloud Butterfly. According to Yang Flame, those wings could sell for thirty thousand Saint Crystal.

Although both were Saint King-Grade Upper-Level, Yang Kai felt Yang Flame's crafted wings were far superior to this so-called prismatic Ruyi Armor — rarer, more beautiful, and more practical.

If those wings were worth thirty thousand Saint Crystal, does this prismatic Ruyi Armor really deserve the same? And that's only the opening price?

While he was thinking this, someone downstairs began to bid, and the announced figure made the corner of Yang Kai's eye twitch.

"Fifty thousand!"

The bidder had actually skipped past the opening and raised it by twenty thousand Saint Crystal.

The beauty on stage smiled sweetly: "Friend number one-six-nine truly knows good things — the prismatic Ruyi Armor is now at fifty thousand. Any more bids…"

Before she finished, another voice cried: "Fifty-two thousand!"

"Fifty-five thousand!"

"Fifty-eight thousand!"

The beauty no longer spoke, merely smiling on the dais; she knew that for this Secret Treasure she need say no more — those who wanted the armor would push the price themselves.

Prices climbed step by step as the martial cultivators in the hall vied to outbid one another, each unwilling to show weakness, while those in the private rooms made no move, not even a sound.

Those who sat in the private rooms belonged to well-known forces on Dark Star; while the armor was decent, it was not worth them lowering their status to compete with the crowd in the hall.

In Room C-13, Wu Yi looked on with envy at the prismatic Ruyi Armor, her beautiful eyes full of longing, but that opening price of thirty thousand left her feeling hopeless.

Yang Flame snorted coldly with disdain: "Something like this can fetch such a high price? There are really too many people who don't know how to recognize quality."

Yang Kai agreed. Resources on Dark Star were scarce, and Saint Crystal here was worth far more than outside. For a defensive Secret Treasure to climb to such a price, he wondered at the buyers' thinking.

One of the Yingyue Hall female disciples attending nearby laughed: "They're bidding because of Master Gong's reputation. If someone unknown had forged this, it wouldn't fetch such a high price."

Yang Kai nodded slightly in understanding. Celebrity effect exists everywhere; Gong Taihong was undoubtedly an Origin-Grade artificer, and even if his work had flaws people would still scramble for it, driving the price above what other artificers' creations would fetch.

After the prismatic Ruyi Armor reached eighty thousand, the bids grew scarce; it seemed these bidders weren't so recklessly flush with Saint Crystal after all and had some restraint.

Soon the prismatic Ruyi Armor sold for eighty-four thousand Saint Crystal to a young man in the hall.

The Jubao Tower female disciple who had held the armor stepped down and handed it to the youth, receiving Saint Crystal in exchange; goods and payment were settled.

The moment the youth had the armor he presented it to the beautiful woman leaning at his side; she kissed his cheek, and he laughed loudly as if he were the greatest winner in the world.

The second lot was a vial containing ten King Transformation Pills, opening bid ten thousand Saint Crystal, and it finally sold for twenty-seven thousand, also bought by someone in the hall. Judging by his appearance he seemed to be from a minor family buying the pills to elevate his household disciples to the Saint King Realm.

The following lots were a motley of items — pills, Secret Treasures, manuals, Martial Skills, and even some precious raw materials — with opening prices high and low.

The auction's atmosphere gradually grew more frenzied; once rare items were produced they drew a scramble of bids. The most expensive lot even fetched two hundred thousand Saint Crystal, causing Yang Kai to silently gape.

He realized he had underestimated the financial might of the forces on Dark Star. His knowledge of Dark Star came mostly from Wu Yi's descriptions; she was of humble birth and ignorant of the holdings of those great forces, so she naturally didn't know what others possessed.

It turned out there were quite a few wealthy people on Dark Star.

Immersed in the scene, Yang Kai felt the contagion of the atmosphere; sometimes, even knowing a lot of the lots were of no use to him, he still felt an urge to bid.

Fortunately he was practically penniless and incapable of taking part; even if he could, he had the self-control to refrain.

He inwardly mused that it was no wonder auctions were so hot — an item worth ten thousand Saint Crystal could sell for several times its value, making auctions the finest way to gather wealth.

Yang Kai retained some rationality, but Yang Flame and Wu Yi were carried away; though they weren't in a position to bid, that didn't stop them from gesturing and cheering within the private room. If someone they backed failed to win a lot, they'd sigh and fret.

There was nothing ladylike about them now.

Yang Kai's face reddened at the sight; he grabbed two spirit fruits and stuffed one into each of their hands, finally silencing their chattering.

The two Yingyue Hall female disciples behind them covered their mouths to hide smiles; their delicate shoulders trembled as they tried to keep from laughing.

The auction proceeded in full swing. As time passed, the quality of Jubao Tower's items increased. During the first hour or two, most lots were bid for by the cultivators seated in the hall while the private room forces barely intervened; after two hours, however, more and more bids began to come from the private rooms.

The beauty on stage had stood for a long time with a smile on her face, showing no fatigue; her words remained crisp and pleasing, and at just the right moments she stoked the bidders' enthusiasm so that every lot fetched an ideal price — nothing went unsold.

"Next is a very special item…" the beauty parted her vermilion lips, her seductive voice seeming to reach into every pocket to draw out Saint Crystal, "I call it special because its value can range from nothing to enormous."

As she spoke, another palace-attired woman stepped up with a jade tray; nearly everyone's eyes fixed upon that tray, eager to see what could be so ambiguously described.

On reaching the dais, the palace-attired woman lifted the object from the tray by one corner and slowly rotated it a full three hundred and sixty degrees. Countless Divine Senses swept over it. When everyone had seen it clearly she returned the lot to the jade tray.

The beautiful auctioneer chuckled softly and said, “Everyone should be able to see clearly—this is a fragment of a map. Its origin is rather peculiar. One of our Jubao Tower disciples acquired it while collecting auction items outside; he happened to save someone’s life, and in gratitude, that person, having nothing else of value, presented this map fragment as a gift. It is said to be a family heirloom passed down for generations. According to the research of several experts from our Jubao Tower, this fragment likely represents only a small portion of the complete map — exactly how small, we cannot determine. What we do know is that it’s extremely old, at least several thousand years in age. The location indicated on the fragment is unclear, and what lies there is entirely unknown. Perhaps it leads to nothing at all… or perhaps—to unimaginable riches, coveted inheritances, or supreme Secret Treasures and cultivation arts!”
