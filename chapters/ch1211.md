## Chapter 1211 — Is This Your Last Resort?

In the canyon, Yang Kai and the middle-aged man stared at one another; Yang Kai's eyes were icy, while the other wore a face of utter despair.

"Heh heh..." The middle-aged man, blocked by Yang Kai, gave a light laugh that was all bitterness and unwillingness. He knew this time escape was unlikely, and waves of regret crashed over him.

The Flowing Flame Sandland was vast — why had his four senior-brothers chosen this particular ravine to travel? And why had they plunged so deep only to run into such a calamity? Had it gone otherwise, the four comrades would have been living comfortably; with the spoils from this trip, so long as they walked out alive, they would have reaped great rewards.

But now it was too late for regrets: three of the four were dead, both his arms were crippled, and it seemed only a matter of moments before he would follow his fellows to the grave. His heart overflowed with remorse. Looking back on the scenes when he first met that youth, he could only laugh at how foolish he and his three comrades had been.

If that man didn’t have something to rely on, how could he have remained so calm after seeing the four of them, without even thinking of running? And if he wasn’t trying to bait them into making a move, who would be foolish enough to display all the treasures in his ring so openly before others?

Now thinking it over, the youth's expressions and conduct certainly had many suspicious points, but when profit is at the forefront, even the most cautious and shrewd can be driven mad.

"Friend..." The middle-aged man's Adam's apple rolled; he suddenly spoke, "Can you tell me what kind of power you're using? If I could know that, I would die without regret."

Yang Kai watched him with a face of indifference and shook his head. "There's no need for the dead to know."

“Indeed.” The middle-aged man let out a desolate laugh, standing tall and straight as he took the posture of one ready to meet his end. “Go ahead. I know I’m no match for you, and I’ve no wish to struggle pointlessly. So, please — make it quick. It would be best if I didn’t feel any pain.”

As soon as his words fell, Yang Kai flicked his wrist, and a jet-black sword light slashed toward him, its momentum soaring like a rainbow.

The instant the black blade appeared, the man who had been resigned to die suddenly had a glint flash in his eyes and spat a spray of blood. The spray was viscous, reeking of iron — clearly his Essence-Blood. Within the blood mist, a cone-shaped Secret Treasure about a chi long emerged. It shone with an earthen yellow light. Spinning like a top, it drew in the surrounding Spiritual Qi and lunged brutally at Yang Kai.

The conical Secret Treasure seemed intent on drilling a hole through the very fabric of space. Everything in its path was pulverized; even Yang Kai's black sword radiance was blasted into chaotic fragments.

At the same time, the middle-aged man's face went white as he retreated rapidly, eyes wide as he stared through the blood mist at Yang Kai.

He no longer looked like a man waiting to die; instead his face was stamped with a ferocious will to live. Only now did he waver, uncertain whether the strike he had prepared with such care would produce the hoped-for result.

This was the strike he had placed all his hopes on. To make this sneak attack succeed, he had deliberately spoken those words earlier to distract Yang Kai’s attention. He had expected that, at the very least, his display of unyielding defiance might move the other party for a moment — just long enough to exploit a small opening. But to his shock, this man was utterly ruthless and cold-blooded. Even after such an act, Yang Kai remained completely unmoved — striking to kill without hesitation.

There was no flaw to exploit; he could only hope his Secret Treasure would not betray him.

Under his anxious gaze, the cone-shaped Secret Treasure, hidden within the blood mist, shattered the black sword radiance without difficulty and in an instant closed in on Yang Kai, who still stood motionless as if unaware.

The middle-aged man's face lit with joy at the sight, a smile just beginning to form — but it froze instantly.

Because he saw Yang Kai casually extend a finger, and that same pitch-black, crack-like attack he had witnessed before appeared once more. The fissure swept across his cone-shaped Secret Treasure, and in an instant, the killing intent it had gathered along with the swirling Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth vanished — as if devoured whole by some invisible beast. What’s more, after the rift passed through his Secret Treasure, a portion of it bizarrely disappeared, while the remaining half lost all its spirituality and fell lifelessly to the ground.

The middle-aged man's eyes bulged, horror written across his face as he stared at Yang Kai. He blurted, "Is that really a space rift?"

Before, he had only suspected it; seeing it again, he was certain. The method Yang Kai had used really had torn a movable space rift — otherwise how could his conical Secret Treasure vanish without a sound?

It had clearly been consumed into the void by that rift!

"Is this your last resort?" Yang Kai asked mockingly as he looked at him.

The other was cautious by nature, a fact Yang Kai had already experienced, so whatever the man said Yang Kai treated as nonsense. He had resolved to kill him and would not be deceived by such small tricks; Yang Kai did not have the habit of underestimating opponents.

"Impossible! With your low realm, how could you be adept in spatial power? Even Elder Mo couldn't produce such a space rift!" the middle-aged man shouted hysterically, as if witnessing the most unbelievable thing.

"Elder Mo? He understands spatial power?" Yang Kai raised a brow.

Until now, apart from himself, Yang Kai had never encountered another martial cultivator versed in spatial power. Even someone as talented as the Ghost Ancestor, with Void King Realm cultivation, could not penetrate the mysteries of space. Hearing from this man that an Elder Mo understood spatial power surprised Yang Kai.

It was startling news.

"Elder Mo is the chief elder of the Elder Hall. A thousand years ago he had already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, a top expert whose power ranks above the whole Dark Star. I am his..." The middle-aged man, thinking Yang Kai feared him, brightened and hurried to state his connection to Elder Mo to give Yang Kai pause.

"If I have the chance I'll go to the Battle Sky Alliance to spar with him and study the true essence of spatial power, but you won't get the chance to meet him." Before the man could finish, Yang Kai idly produced a Space Blade.

That windknife-like Space Blade sliced through the middle-aged man’s body as he watched in horror, cutting like tofu. The defensive sacred armor he wore and his Saint Yuan did nothing to stop it; everything from his chest downward was severed.

He felt his body drop; the upper half of his torso slid down an inch or so and struck the lower half. When he looked down, the gushing blood lifted his upper portion once more. His scream had barely begun when a swirl of pitch-black Demonic Flame engulfed him; his voice was extinguished in the rolling fire. In mere breaths he was reduced to a smear of black ash.

Yang Kai stared at the spot where the man had vanished, brow slightly furrowed, his expression a mix of satisfaction and worry.

He was pleased that, after more than a month of tempering, his Space Blade had finally proven useful in battle — it could be truly wielded against foes with excellent effect. Its killing power was enormous, and its use was exceptionally secretive; it produced no Saint Yuan fluctuations and was hard to detect.

His worry was that the thing seemed easy to evade and rather uncontrollable; no matter how focused he was, he couldn't precisely direct its course while tearing space.

Earlier, when the middle-aged man had produced the Communication Compass, Yang Kai knew he planned to send a message. He intended to kill him in one blow but ended up only severing one arm. Fortunately, the Communication Compass had fallen when the arm was cut off, otherwise he might have transmitted successfully.

The second strike went the same way, by coincidence severing the other arm.

This wasn't deliberate on Yang Kai's part, just two chance outcomes. If killing could be done in a single move, Yang Kai wouldn't waste time or energy.

The third strike was better, but still a little off from Yang Kai's intended target.

Even so, it did not obscure the Space Blade's terrifying lethality; anything it touched along its path could be sent into the void rift. If it could be stabilized, then in theory even a Void King Realm expert's body could not withstand a single strike.

Yang Kai was satisfied to have verified the Space Blade's power in actual combat. As for its accuracy and stability, he trusted they would improve with his strength; one day the move might become his greatest trump card.

Bending, he picked up the middle-aged man's Spatial Ring and returned to tidy the battlefield, dealing with the bodies. Looking at that strange space stretching ten-plus zhang, he sighed and passed through it, heading straight for the far side of the ravine.

There was no need to linger here any longer. In Yang Kai's original plan he would have left in two or three days; the interference from the four Battle Sky Alliance members had simply accelerated his departure.

......

Half a day later, Yang Kai stopped beneath a massive boulder.

Baked by the Flowing Flame Sandland's heat for countless years, the rock took on a fiery red hue; its impurities had long been burned away. It would make excellent refining material — at least good enough to forge a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai had no interest in such things; he merely used it to shelter from the heat.

Beneath the rock was a recessed pit barely large enough for one. Yang Kai slipped inside solely to examine the Battle Sky Alliance members' rings — they were, after all, his spoils.

One inspection left Yang Kai silently alarmed.

It wasn't that the four had obtained anything miraculous, but each of their Spatial Rings contained many Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine native to the Flowing Flame Sandland, Crystal Stones, and various minerals.

The quantities were enormous! Each person's ring held at least the equivalent of seven or eight people's usual haul.

They could not have been so lucky to acquire all this on their own; who knew how many lives they'd taken and treasures they'd seized to amass such stores — but in any case, it had all become Yang Kai's gain.

Each item was fairly common in the Flowing Flame Sandland, not as precious as the massive Crystal Stones and Fire-Glow Crystal Cores Yang Kai had found, yet their sheer volume made them a considerable haul.
