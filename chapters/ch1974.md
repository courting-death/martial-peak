## Chapter 1974 — Contest

Putting aside the old adage that an innocent man is blamed for bearing a treasure, actually getting hold of a Luan Feng would only invite endless trouble. Besides, this was a Divine Spirit — where there are young, there must be elders — and Yang Kai had no desire to be hunted down day and night by a fully mature Luan Feng.

This little Luan Feng was clearly a hot potato; it was laughable that so many people had their eyes blinded by future prospects and actually wanted to claim it for themselves.

Faced with this foolish, clumsy girl, what could Yang Kai possibly say?

Arguing with her would, Yang Kai guessed, only get him so worked up he would vomit blood.

While the two of them were exchanging words in secret, Elder Jiu suddenly asked, “What kind of Secret Treasure is this that can bind a Divine Spirit infant? It seems not so simple.”

His gaze burned as he stared at the water-blue orb, a look of greed plain on his face.

Chen Shiqi and the Hall Master looked the same.

Even though the Luan Feng before them was a hatchling, it still carried the bloodline of a Divine Spirit; it was not something an ordinary Secret Treasure could simply bind. At first glance the water-blue orb did not seem remarkable, but upon careful sensing it caused one to shudder.

The three Dao Origin Realm experts could not, for a time, determine its true quality.

“This thing… was brought by that young lady.” Xu Qing smiled faintly, for reasons Yang Kai could not fathom, and when Elder Jiu asked he pointed at Mo Xiaoqi.

Yang Kai’s face turned sullen, and deep in his heart he sent his ancestors a litany of curt curses.

Xu Qing was clearly trying to kill with a borrowed knife; he had already offended Mo Xiaoqi and feared being pursued by the force behind her, unable to handle it himself, so he set his sights on Elder Jiu.

Sure enough, upon hearing this Elder Jiu and the others all brightened and looked over at Mo Xiaoqi.

The Hall Master chuckled and said, “Little lass, not bad. Do you want to join my Blazing Fire Hall? I can provide you with excellent cultivation resources.”

He openly tried to win Mo Xiaoqi over — if he could bring her into his fold, she would work for him, and the Luan Feng bound by her Secret Treasure would fall into his hands.

Ordinary fighters might refuse without much notice, but Mo Xiaoqi — that scatterbrained girl — was hardly so tactful; she decisively shook her head. “Aunt Feng said the outside forces are like grass and chaff, not worth mentioning. I will not join any Blazing Fire Hall.”

The Hall Master’s forehead veins stood out and his gaze turned ice-cold. Elder Jiu and Chen Shiqi, on the other hand, laughed with malicious delight.

Yang Kai felt a wave of exasperation, twitched at the corner of his mouth, and cupped his fists, “Hall Master, please do not mind; this lass has some kind of neurosis!”

“Did I say something wrong?” Mo Xiaoqi looked at Yang Kai blankly.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai ground out.

“Oh.”

“Hmph. How dare you insult my Blazing Fire Hall — little lass, you are bold. If today you agree to do one thing for me, I will spare you; otherwise…” The Hall Master paid no heed to Yang Kai’s plea. Mo Xiaoqi’s reply had thoroughly shamed him; murderous intent had already bloomed in his eyes. If not for his desire to use her Secret Treasure to subdue the Luan Feng, he would have struck long ago.

“Hall Master, you must not rashly move against her. This lass’s Secret Treasures possess many autonomous defensive functions. One of my companions was careless and suffered her deadly skill, his soul ruined and turned to idiocy, and I myself nearly fell prey to her path,” Xu Qing shouted loudly so that everyone could hear.

“Secret Treasures with autonomous defense?” The Hall Master exclaimed, “Secret Treasures with Artifact Spirits?”

A Secret Treasure was ordinarily an inanimate thing; if it could defend itself that meant it had an Artifact Spirit — such a Secret Treasure would be of high rank and enormous value.

“This is interesting.” Elder Jiu’s eyes also glittered as he watched Mo Xiaoqi; his gaze swept over her earrings, hairpin, pendant, and bracelets, his Divine Sense probing. As Xu Qing had said, the trinkets she wore were all Secret Treasures and of respectable rank.

Chen Shiqi likewise betrayed a flicker of greed in his expression.

“Damn you, Xu Qing, I hope you rot!” Yang Kai cursed and grabbed Mo Xiaoqi, “Run!”

No sooner had he spoken than Yang Kai released Mo Xiaoqi as if electrocuted; the moment he touched her he felt as if pricked by needles, his palm stinging.

“Sorry, on my hand there is…”

“Don’t say anything — save yourself first!” Yang Kai had no patience to argue and wrapped his power around her, rushing out at speed.

“My Weak Water Pearl and the little Luan Feng!” Mo Xiaoqi cried, making hand seals as if to recall the Weak Water Pearl and the bound Luan Feng.

But the three Dao Origin Realm experts were not about to watch idly. With a mere wave they repressed the Weak Water Pearl and the Luan Feng, which had just begun to fly, back into place.

“Quickly retract the Weak Water Pearl!” Yang Kai cried urgently.

Mo Xiaoqi, unusually obedient, did not bother with the Luan Feng and with a thought recalled the Weak Water Pearl.

Freed from the Weak Water Pearl’s restraint, the Luan Feng hatchling immediately recovered its freedom. It spread its wings and unleashed countless pitch-black fire orbs in all directions, throwing the surrounding fighters into chaos, while its main body shot skyward as if trying to flee this place of trouble.

“Where do you think you’re going!” The three Dao Origin Realm experts struck in unison, sealing off the hatchling’s escape path; yet none dared draw too close, for the black flames were terrifyingly overwhelming and hard to extinguish once they touched someone.

After stopping the Luan Feng, the Hall Master still had leisure and struck a palm through the void toward the fleeing Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi.

“Think you can run away so easily? Too naive!” the Hall Master snorted.

A casual strike from a Second Stage Dao Origin expert, though done carelessly, stirred the surrounding laws of heaven and earth. Yang Kai’s sense of crisis surged and he immediately used the Nothingness Secret Technique, his form vanishing from sight.

The palm’s force arrived as expected and passed through where Yang Kai’s body had been, striking empty air; meanwhile Mo Xiaoqi’s body shimmered with an oval energy shield that absorbed the Hall Master’s attack entirely, leaving her unscathed.

When Yang Kai reappeared, he stared at Mo Xiaoqi as though she were a monster.

He had avoided the Hall Master’s blow by using a spatial secret art; Mo Xiaoqi’s survival was plainly due to the array of Secret Treasures she wore.

This girl’s foundation ran deeper than he had expected.

Their speed was tremendous, and in the blink of an eye they fled far away.

Behind them, the Hall Master and the others were embroiled in fighting over the Luan Feng; sounds of battle filled the air, energy surged chaotically, and Secret Treasures flared — they would not be troubling Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi any time soon.

After running for dozens of li, Yang Kai suddenly halted.

Mo Xiaoqi stopped as well and, puzzled, asked Yang Kai, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Kai looked at her coldly and let out a feral laugh.

Mo Xiaoqi’s face drained of color; she stumbled back a few steps and, fierce but inwardly timid, said, “What are you trying to do? I’m not someone to be trifled with.”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes, “You think I want anything? I just want to observe a little more here.”

Mo Xiaoqi furrowed her brow, thought for a moment, then suddenly brightened, “You mean the mantis stalks the cicada while the oriole waits behind?”

She was extremely excited, as if she had found something amusing.

“I’m just going to set an ambush and see if Xu Qing will come. Those who dare scheme against me are bound for a bad end,” Yang Kai sneered.

“I’ll help you — that guy seems no good,” Mo Xiaoqi volunteered eagerly.

Yang Kai was completely speechless — hadn’t she seen through him earlier? He could only stare.

The two concealed themselves and suppressed their auras.

Mo Xiaoqi kept her distance from Yang Kai, not because she had suddenly become shrewd or feared him, but because Yang Kai was the one who feared her.

The girl was bristling with stings; earlier an inadvertent touch had left his hands soaked in blood. Heaven knew what might happen if he got too close.

At Yang Kai’s insistence, Mo Xiaoqi took up an ambush position a full hundred zhang away from him.

She now sat there pouting, clearly displeased, muttering under her breath.

Though it was thirty li away, Yang Kai could still perceive the situation there clearly with his powerful Divine Sense.

More and more fighters converged on that location and were drawn into the fray, including Dao Origin Realm experts.

These fighters gathered in small groups of three to five or seven to eight and fought with abandon.

Men fell from time to time, blood flowing and screams of death ringing out, but rather than sobering them these scenes only stirred their brutality; almost everyone fought with murderous eyes.

The Dao Origin Realm experts were much calmer. While contending with others, they also blocked the Luan Feng’s escape paths, forcing it to remain in place.

Yang Kai spotted Xu Qing in the crowd; that man once again used the Beast-Soul Symbiosis secret art, turning into the form of a Golden-Mane Giant Ape and trailing behind Elder Jiu, slaughtering all before him.

Of the several hundred fighters who had entered Yuqing Mountain, within only four hours at least eighty percent had been drawn to the battlefield; blood flowed like rivers and the scene was in utter chaos.

And as time wore on, even the Dao Origin Realm experts began to suffer injuries. At this point, nearly everyone had been driven into true fury—it was no longer merely a matter of seizing the Luan Feng, but a chance to settle old grudges and repay old enmities.

Most of them were fighters from near Fenglin City who already had many unresolved grievances; now was the perfect time to settle scores.

More and more fighters fell.

The Dao Origin Realm experts finally sensed something amiss, and though no one knew who suggested it, the fighting eventually subsided. Yet only about half of the original fighters remained.

The Luan Feng hatchling still lay in the center surrounded by fighters; it was no longer as ferocious as before, but weak and sprawled on the ground, drops of blood staining its beautiful feathers, and the burning flames visible on its body seemed on the verge of extinguishing.

This battle seemed to have wounded its very root.
