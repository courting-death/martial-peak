## Chapter 1148 — Jubao Tower

Yang Kai's question came out of nowhere, and Wu Yi, without thinking much, immediately began to list them off as if they were treasured possessions.

“The Sky Cloud Pill, which can repair meridians; the Soul Restoration Pill, which heals the Divine Soul; and even the Rose Pill that Elder Qian Tong brought out last time—they’re all quite valuable. But if we’re talking about the most precious, that would be the Origin Condensing Pill and the Void Ascension Pill. The latter can practically be called priceless, since it helps experts of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm break through to the Void King Realm, increasing their chances of success. There may not be anyone of that level yet on Dark Star, but there are plenty at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If one could obtain even a single Void Ascension Pill, it wouldn’t be difficult to trade it with those great powers for several prosperous cities,” Wu Yi said, her breathing growing heavier as she spoke.

“Don't even think about that,” Yang Kai shook his head decisively.

A Void Ascension Pill is a Void King-Grade Lower-Level pill; never mind that Yang Kai lacks the materials now, even with full materials he could not refine one. Origin Condensing Pill, however, could be refined, since it is only an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Pill — a whole Grade below the Void Ascension Pill.

“Eldest Brother Yang, why are you asking about these things?” Wu Yi looked at Yang Kai curiously.

“It's nothing. Wait here a moment, I'll be out in a bit.” Yang Kai said, then turned and stepped back into the stone chamber.

Yang Yan and Wu Yi, though puzzled, obediently waited outside. About half an hour later Yang Kai came back out and called, “Let's go.”

The three of them set off for Tianyun City in high spirits.

After what happened when Qian Tong came and made a great show of force, Yang Kai believed no one would now dare cause trouble for him at Dragon Lair Mountain, so he could leave in peace.

On the other hand, he wasn't comfortable letting Wu Yi and Yang Yan take two Origin-Grade secret treasures to the auction alone, so naturally he intended to accompany them and provide protection.

He was eager to see what price those two secret treasures might fetch. Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures were worth thirty to fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals; Origin-Grade Lower-Level secret treasures might fetch two to three hundred thousand, he estimated vaguely. Selling the two treasures would allow him to buy many materials to set up arrays.

Along the way, listening to Wu Yi and Yang Yan chattering nonstop, Yang Kai learned that Jubao Tower was not, in fact, the property of Yingyue Hall.

Jubao Tower was a force even stronger than Yingyue Hall!

This force was somewhat like the Hengluo Commerce Guild, spreading its business across the entire Dark Star, but it was different in that it collected treasures from everywhere and held grand auctions at intervals.

The auction locations were not fixed. The branch towers across the Dark Star took turns hosting them, and this time it happened to be the branch in Tianyun City.

Jubao Tower's auctions were a spectacle for the whole Dark Star; before each auction they would publicize heavily, producing exquisite catalogs depicting rare items and sending them to the great powers to entice them to attend.

In short, Jubao Tower's auctions gathered all the major forces across the Dark Star to compete with wealth, resources, and pedigree — a grand clash every time, often lively. More than once astonishing items appeared, and on one occasion even a Void King-Grade defensive secret treasure showed up!

It was said that treasure sold for an astronomical price of five hundred million Upper-Level Saint Crystals plus fifteen prosperous cities!

Even Yang Kai, with his even temperament, was stunned by that number. The Dark Star was still too backward. Origin-Grade lower-level and above secret treasures were too scarce, which is what created such ridiculous prices.

Yang Kai believed that on other cultivation stars, even if Void King-Grade treasures were expensive, they would never reach such extremes.

“A Void Ascension Pill once appeared as well—I think it was bought by a lord from the Leitai Sect. Unfortunately, after taking it, that person still couldn’t break through to the Void King Realm, and their cultivation supposedly even declined afterward. Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know,” Wu Yi sighed softly.

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent. Although he didn't speak, he was basically convinced that what Wu Yi said was true.

Pills are, after all, only auxiliary means. Those alchemical medicines that increase the chance of breaking a major boundary are expensive and difficult to refine, but they are not omnipotent — taking a pill does not guarantee advancement. If a cultivator's comprehension of the Martial Dao hasn't reached the required level, no amount of pills will help.

Conversely, if one's understanding of the Martial Dao exceeds the bottleneck, even without pills one will advance when the time comes.

Yang Kai himself was like that: his comprehension of the Martial Dao always far exceeded his current Stage, so he never relied on pills he refined to ascend, saving himself a large expense.

That lord from the Leitai Sect clearly had not perfected his use and comprehension of Shi; if he had, he would not have wasted a Void Ascension Pill.

Such precious items were beyond the refining ability of most in the star domain, and were likely obtained through other means.

A cultivator who fails to break through a bottleneck may suffer backlash to varying degrees: at minimum serious injury, at worst, like that Leitai Sect lord, a drop in strength, and in more severe cases death.

Therefore, if a cultivator lacks sufficient confidence and certainty, even when at a bottleneck they dare not rashly attempt to force advancement.

This phenomenon is not apparent when a cultivator is weak, so on Tongxuan Continent such cases are basically unseen; if they occur at all they're rare and the backlash weak. But once strength rises, such situations become likely.

Yang Kai only gradually learned these truths after coming to the Star Domain.

The three chatted and laughed as they walked, and before long they arrived at Jubao Tower in Tianyun City.

Standing before that towering palace, Yang Kai finally understood what extravagance meant. This Jubao Tower occupied Tianyun City's most prosperous district, spanning almost half a street; people flowed before it constantly, and the three gilded characters on the plaque shimmered brilliantly.

Strong, indistinct auras leaked from within Jubao Tower, making Yang Kai feel a cold awe.

There were at least a hundred Origin Returning Realm experts inside the tower. Fortunately those people were there to attend the auction and had no intent to target anyone specifically, so Yang Kai felt not too uneasy.

Before Jubao Tower, two First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm guards stood with hands at their sides, their eyes sharp like hawks, scanning the crowd. As the three only steadied themselves, one guard in a pale blue robe stepped forward and raised a hand to signal, “Guests stop. The tower is about to hold an auction and is temporarily closed to the public. If you wish to purchase items, please come back tomorrow!”

“We're here to attend the auction,” Yang Kai said calmly, then glanced at Wu Yi.

He knew auctions of this caliber required invitations, and the invitation Qian Tong gave him last time should serve as entry to Jubao Tower; it was currently in Wu Yi's hand.

Wu Yi, immersed in Jubao Tower's grandeur and excited at the chance to attend such an auction, blushed and only remembered the invitation when Yang Kai looked at her; flustered, she hurriedly rummaged through her spatial ring.

“Ha! Since when can any rag or stray attend Jubao Tower's auctions?” A laugh rang from the side, the contempt plain in the voice.

Yang Kai frowned and turned toward the source, wanting to see who dared sneer at people as if they were dogs and cats; of course he didn't like it.

A young man with the look of a white-robed gentleman stepped forward. He had sharp phoenix-like eyes, hidden brilliance in them; though smiling, his disdain was obvious. Young and tall with handsome features and those penetrating eyes, he was the sort to turn thousands of women' heads.

Yang Kai's heart tightened: he detected that this youth possessed the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and carried a faint oppressive aura; his presence was no less formidable than Xue Yue of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Behind the young man followed two masters with deep, restrained auras—their cultivation seemed higher than that of Hong Zhen and his senior brother. Both wore identical black combat robes, with a single large character embroidered on their chests in bold, sweeping strokes — "Battle!".

“Battle Sky Alliance!” Wu Yi cried out in alarm and hurriedly stepped aside.

It turned out they were people of the Battle Sky Alliance. No wonder the youth, though young, was so powerful. Yang Kai had been on the Dark Star some time and knew Battle Sky Alliance was one of the few great forces here.

Among Battle Sky Alliance's younger generation was a prodigy named Qu Changfeng, famed for having phoenix-like eyes.

If Yang Kai guessed correctly, the youth before him should be the renowned Qu Changfeng.

Indeed, the guard who had blocked Yang Kai's way immediately cupped his fist respectfully upon seeing the youth: “Young Master Qu, please enter!”

“Hm.” Qu Changfeng nodded lightly, his gaze sweeping over Wu Yi and Yang Yan. He paused with a soft sound and smiled: “Two young ladies wish to enter Jubao Tower?”

Both Wu Yi and Yang Yan remained silent.

Qu Changfeng went on without waiting for them: “You can't enter now; the auction is starting and without invitations these two guards won't let you in. But if you truly wish to go in, you may come with me. How about it?”

He smiled, appearing harmless, but Wu Yi and Yang Yan were not the mushy sort and knew exactly what he meant.

“Qu Changfeng, after all these years, you still enjoy showing off your superiority before those weaker than you, huh? Think attending an auction makes you special—or is it your Battle Sky Alliance that’s so impressive?” A deep voice rang out. The moment Qu Changfeng—who had just been inviting Wu Yi and Yang Yan—heard that voice, his expression twisted as though he had swallowed a fly. The springlike smile on his face vanished in an instant, and he turned his head toward the source of the sound.

From behind, a youth in plain grey clothes strode forward. His attire was not ostentatious like Qu Changfeng's but rather simple and laughable, like a mere peasant, yet Qu Changfeng showed no sign of belittling him — his phoenix eyes revealed profound dread and seriousness.
