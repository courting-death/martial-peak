## Chapter 2442 — Fire Elemental Origin

After Yang Kai’s reminder, Yu Ying finally snapped out of her daze. She didn't hesitate and immediately began to undress. In no time at all she stripped herself bare, leaving only a single undergarment—even that as thin as a cicada’s wing, nearly transparent.

Yang Kai’s face darkened with exasperation. “Junior Sister, what are you doing?” he couldn’t help but ask.

Yu Ying replied, “I can’t sense where the mark is at all. Hopefully, it’s on my clothes.”

Yang Kai was speechless. “It’s on your shoulder. Focus your mind and sense it!”

This Soul-Scattering Mark was indeed extremely well hidden. If not for Yang Kai’s extraordinary Divine Soul strength, he likely wouldn’t have noticed it so easily. Now, with Yang Kai’s guidance, Yu Ying hurriedly gathered her Divine Sense to probe her delicate shoulder.

A moment later, her expression brightened with joy—she had clearly found it.

No one knew what secret technique she used, but as the two of them fled, Yang Kai could feel the Soul-Scattering Mark gradually fading until it finally vanished.

Only then did Yu Ying let out a breath of relief and retrieve a fresh set of clothes from her Spatial Ring to put on.

Now that the Soul-Scattering Mark was gone, as long as they ran a bit faster, they could shake off the people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land behind them and be safe.

With her mind at ease, Yu Ying said, “I must thank Senior Brother Feng for what just happened.”

Yang Kai replied indifferently, “No need for thanks.”

Sensing his coldness, Yu Ying’s expression dimmed. She wondered if Senior Brother Feng would hold a grudge against her for what just happened. After all, what she did was indeed a bit much—anyone would be angry in his place.

They fled for another half an hour. By then, Yu Ying’s face was pale and she was gasping for breath. Although her secret technique was effective, it consumed a lot of energy. It was already remarkable she’d lasted this long.

Seeing her slow down, Yang Kai had no choice but to summon his wooden boat. “Get on, I’ll take you with me!”

Yu Ying nodded and leapt onto the boat, sitting cross-legged. As she popped a Spiritual Pill into her mouth to recover, she also took out a Transmission Compass, sending messages into it, apparently trying to contact disciples of Netherworld Sect.

Watching her, Yang Kai secretly hoped Yu Ying would contact Yin Lesheng right away.

The people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land seemed to have been left far behind. Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense but sensed no trace of them.

A day later, Yu Ying’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up and she called out, “Senior Brother Feng, I’ve found someone from our sect!”

Yang Kai was overjoyed. “Who?”

Yu Ying said, “It’s Senior Brother Zhong Zhenyong. I wonder if you’ve heard of him.”

It wasn’t Yin Lesheng. Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed, but he still replied, “I don’t know much about the Eastern Territory, nor have I ever been there, so I haven’t heard of Senior Brother Zhong.”

Yu Ying smiled. “Senior Brother Zhong ranks among the top three in Dao Origin Realm strength in our sect. With his protection, we won’t have to fear the people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. Let’s go find him.”

“Alright, just point the way!” Yang Kai nodded.

Although Yu Ying hadn’t contacted Yin Lesheng, Yang Kai thought he might still be able to get some information about him from Zhong Zhenyong. Maybe Zhong knew something.

With Yu Ying’s directions, Yang Kai changed course and sped toward the location.

An hour later, a figure standing in the void came into Yang Kai’s view. Yang Kai steered the wooden boat up to the man. Before the boat had even stopped, Yu Ying leapt off and ran over, calling out sweetly, “Senior Brother Zhong!”

“Junior Sister Yu.” Zhong Zhenyong smiled at her, then lifted his gaze and swept a glance over Yang Kai. “So this is Brother Feng you mentioned?”

He immediately revealed the surname of the person Yang Kai was impersonating. It seemed Yu Ying had already told him about Yang Kai before coming here.

Yu Ying nodded. “Yes, Senior Brother Zhong. I was able to arrive safely all thanks to Senior Brother Feng.”

Zhong Zhenyong was quite handsome and carried himself with an approachable air, not putting on any airs. He looked Yang Kai up and down and said, “I heard from Junior Sister Yu that you and Junior Brother Yin are both from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, and you’re a Star Lord?”

Yang Kai cupped his fists politely. “Indeed, like Senior Brother Yin, I come from the Great Wilderness Star Domain and am also a Star Lord. I haven’t seen Senior Brother Yin in many years and have missed him, so I took the liberty of coming with Junior Sister Yu. I hope Senior Brother Zhong won’t mind.”

Zhong Zhenyong laughed heartily. “No problem at all! Since you wish to join our Netherworld Sect, perhaps we’ll be fellow disciples in the future. No need to be so polite.”

Yu Ying said, “Senior Brother Zhong, this isn’t the place to talk. Earlier, Senior Brother Feng and I were chased by Chang Hao and Chang Xian from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. I don’t know if they’re still after us. Let’s talk as we go.”

“Chang Hao and Chang Xian!” Zhong Zhenyong’s eyes turned cold. “They dared to chase you? What are they trying to do?”

Yu Ying said a little sheepishly, “I lost control for a moment and killed Deng Yong…”

Zhong Zhenyong gave her a look. “He died from having his yang essence drained, didn’t he? How many times have I told you not to improve your strength that way? It’ll destabilize your foundation and lead to disaster sooner or later…”

“Alright, alright.” Yu Ying quickly interrupted, embarrassed that Zhong was exposing her faults in front of Yang Kai. She pouted, “Let’s get going. If not for Senior Brother Feng, I wouldn’t have made it out safely. He’s my savior.”

“Then you’d better treat him well from now on.” Zhong Zhenyong smiled.

Perhaps because Yu Ying had told him a lot about Yang Kai, Zhong Zhenyong’s attitude toward him was quite friendly, clearly wanting to befriend him.

Urged on by Yu Ying, the three of them set off at once.

Zhong Zhenyong seemed to have a destination in mind and led the way in silence, with Yang Kai and Yu Ying following behind.

After flying for a while, Yu Ying couldn’t help but ask, “Senior Brother Zhong, where are we going?”

“To find the others. They seem to have discovered something very interesting.”

“Something interesting?” Yu Ying’s eyes lit up. “What’s so interesting about it?”

“You’ll know when we get there.” Zhong Zhenyong kept it a secret.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. “Is Senior Brother Yin there too?”

Zhong Zhenyong said, “I’m not sure yet. I received a message from another fellow disciple and was on my way over when I got your message and stopped to wait for you.” As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai and smiled. “Brother Feng, you and Junior Brother Yin must be close, for you to be so concerned about him.”

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat, realizing he was being too eager, but he kept his composure. “Back in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, Senior Brother Yin did me many favors. I’ve never had a chance to repay him, so of course I’m concerned.”

“Grateful and loyal—our Netherworld Sect welcomes people like you.” Zhong Zhenyong laughed.

Yang Kai said, “It’s my honor to join Netherworld Sect. I just wonder how high your sect’s standards are.”

Zhong Zhenyong patted Yang Kai’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’ll have no problem.”

“Then I’ll take that as a good omen from Senior Brother Zhong.”

The three of them chatted as they traveled onward.

After two full days, a massive dark red star suddenly appeared before their eyes.

Upon seeing this star, all three—Zhong Zhenyong, Yu Ying, and Yang Kai—were stunned.

Ever since entering the Shattered Star Sea, every Cultivation Star they’d encountered was broken and ruined. They’d never seen a complete star, but now, one appeared before them.

The star was enormous, spanning the Starry Sky for who knows how many tens of thousands of years. From a distance, it looked like a giant eye coldly watching everything around it, sending chills down their spines and filling them with inexplicable pressure.

Not only that, but this Cultivation Star was radiating terrifying heat. The surrounding void was distorted, and countless black holes of all sizes dotted the area. Looking into those black holes, it felt as if everything was being devoured.

“Senior Brother Zhong…” Yu Ying’s face turned a little pale as she moved closer to Zhong Zhenyong. “Is this the interesting place you mentioned?”

Zhong Zhenyong grinned. “Exactly!”

Yang Kai was moved. “Such dense Origin Power… and it seems a bit different from ordinary Origin Power.”

Zhong Zhenyong nodded. “That’s because it’s Fire Elemental Origin, not Stellar Origin. If a cultivator who practices fire techniques or secret arts obtains the Origin here, they’ll soar to the heavens!”

“Fire Elemental Origin!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he immediately thought of Liu Yan.

This would be of great use to Liu Yan! But ever since they parted days ago, he hadn’t seen her. He wondered if she’d sensed the Fire Elemental Origin here.

But she was still with Zhang Ruoxi. This Cultivation Star looked extremely dangerous. Even if Liu Yan sensed the Fire Elemental Origin, she might not enter with Zhang Ruoxi, since Zhang Ruoxi’s strength was still too low.

As for himself, he could go seek out the Fire Elemental Origin and set it aside for Liu Yan.

Yang Kai made up his mind and grew interested in this strange star.

Just as he was lost in thought, a sudden sense of danger arose. The next instant, a powerful force rushed at him head-on.

His expression changed as he saw a giant ghostly claw reaching for his chest.

He’d seen this ghost claw before—when he first met Yu Ying, she and Guan Qi had used this secret technique in battle. It was a signature move of Netherworld Sect.

In an instant, Yang Kai knew who was ambushing him.

The distance was too close, and the attack came without warning. An ordinary person would have been helpless, but Yang Kai possessed Spatial Force and wasn’t so easy to catch.

At the critical moment, he used the Nothingness secret technique, causing his body to become ethereal.

Yang Kai’s body reformed, his expression icy as he fixed Zhong Zhenyong with a cold, piercing gaze. His eyes were as frigid as winter frost.
