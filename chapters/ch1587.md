## Chapter 1587 — The Yao Transformation Technique

This brat really is hard to deal with, Chi Yue muttered angrily in her heart.

Still, she had not expected Yang Kai to agree so readily; with his cunning, how could he not probe and understand the full situation?

“Very well.” Chi Yue sighed. “The reason I want you to fetch it is because only you are capable. Although our yao expert has perished, its Void Mind Crystal is not something easily seized; any attempt to meddle with it will provoke its resistance, and it is very likely to self-destruct—leaving nothing behind.”

“It has intelligence?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

“No—only a trace of that yao expert’s remnant soul is attached to it.” Chi Yue slowly shook her head. “I need it to comprehend the mysteries of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and only you can use the Golden Sacred Dragon’s might to suppress it for a single instant and seize it. Do you understand what I mean?”

“I understand…” Yang Kai nodded. “But junior still doesn't quite get it: if senior so desperately wants it, why not fetch it personally? With your methods, suppressing it would be a breeze, right?”

“What are you joking about!” Chi Yue’s anger flared. “Do you not know there is a Star Lord on Cuiwei Star? Sneaking a few yao rookies into the Blood Prison might be forgiven, but if I personally went to Cuiwei Star, do you think he would let it go? To pick a fight on his turf—I'm not that stupid!”

“Uh—there’s actually a Star Lord on Cuiwei Star?” Yang Kai was greatly surprised. “Wasn’t it said that Cuiwei Star had no experts of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm?”

“Who knows where that fellow’s luck came from? With only the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, he dared refine a Stellar Origin—and, maddeningly, he succeeded!” Chi Yue’s pretty face twisted; she seemed to recall the Star Lord’s face.

Yang Kai nodded lightly; if that was the case, everything made sense.

With a Star Lord stationed on Cuiwei Star, Chi Yue dared not go there lightly; both she and that Star Lord were Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts—if they fought elsewhere it might be even, but on Cuiwei Star she would not stand a chance.

As for the Inner Core left behind by that yao expert—also called the Void Mind Crystal—it was extremely sensitive. Any attempt to touch it would produce unpredictable consequences, but the Golden Sacred Dragon’s draconic might did exert some suppressive effect on it.

Just like before, when it suppressed Xue Lian.

“That is my proposal. Whether you accept or not, you can think it over for a few days. There’s still some time before the Blood Prison Trial opens! I can wait.” Chi Yue smiled at Yang Kai, as if she had him right where she wanted him.

“There’s nothing to consider. I accept.” To Chi Yue’s surprise, Yang Kai agreed with startling promptness.

“But I have a condition!” Yang Kai grinned.

“What?”

“First, tell me the method to draw out the Sacred Dragon Origin’s power.”

“Do you take me for a three-year-old?” Chi Yue laughed angrily. “That is the reward after success! Do you think I would hand it to you now?”

Yang Kai shook his head faintly. “Senior, you’re thinking about this the wrong way. As you said before, success depends on that single instant of suppression by the Golden Sacred Dragon. I know nothing of the Golden Sacred Dragon’s origin power nor how to use it—if something goes wrong and the Void Mind Crystal self-destructs, what then? I’m sure you wouldn’t want that result, either?”

Chi Yue’s pretty face darkened; her brows knitted tight.

Admittedly, even if she saw Yang Kai as somewhat glib, his words struck at her worry—no matter how much one hoped for success, one always feared the what-if.

“So, to be safe, I think you should first teach me the method. Rest assured, since I’ve agreed I won’t break my word; I will do everything in my power to obtain that Void Mind Crystal for you!”

One would really have to be a fool to trust him! Chi Yue snorted coldly in her heart.

After pausing with an unreadable expression, Chi Yue suddenly smiled lightly. “Giving you part of it first is not impossible. I can even personally instruct you and pass on some insights.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “I gratefully accept senior’s kindness.”

“However, I will only teach you half; the other half you’ll receive after you succeed.”

“That will do.” Yang Kai nodded, then seemed to recall something and added, “Then, senior, you teach me half and entrust the other half to Yu Xiong for safekeeping—he’s going to Cuiwei Star anyway. When I obtain the Void Mind Crystal, I’ll exchange it with Yu Xiong for the remaining half.”

Chi Yue’s brows slightly furrowed as she eyed Yang Kai with suspicion.

“Heh, such a fine technique—this junior can’t wait to get it.” Yang Kai put on an innocent smile.

Chi Yue stared at him a long moment before nodding lightly. “Very well! But heed me: do not entertain any crooked thoughts, or don’t blame me for not considering Qingluo’s feelings.”

“Of course not; I’m an honest man.” Yang Kai beat his chest in promise.

With the matter settled, Chi Yue led Yang Kai to a private chamber and taught him half of the method for unearthing the Golden Sacred Dragon’s origin power—the Yao Transformation Technique.

To ensure Yang Kai’s chance of obtaining the Void Mind Crystal, Chi Yue revealed everything she knew, holding nothing back.

This Yao Transformation Technique was specifically designed to draw out origin power hidden in the bloodline, especially effective for origins of the Divine Spirit level.

Since obtaining that golden dragon pattern, Yang Kai had hardly developed its potential; here with Chi Yue, he finally learned the terrifying promise and bright prospects of the Golden Sacred Dragon.

His cultivation rank would not increase, but if he used the Golden Sacred Dragon’s origin power his combat strength could rise markedly.

Time flew; half a month passed.

Yang Kai strode out of Chi Yue’s bedchamber with an elated face, wearing an expression of lingering satisfaction.

He had now realized the value of the origin power in his bloodline; it was a pity Chi Yue had only taught half the method, and he could not study it fully—undeniably regrettable.

“What on earth is this brat scheming?” Chi Yue pondered in her bedchamber, baffled. Though she was wary that Yang Kai wanted her to hand the second half to Yu Xiong, she could not figure out his motive.

Was he not planning to return to Di Chen? Otherwise why would he propose such a thing?

But as long as his Little Senior Sister stayed in the palace, where could he run off to? From his demeanor he didn’t seem the type to disregard his Senior Sister’s safety—if he truly did so, Qingluo would surely resent him and their bond would sour.

That outcome was precisely what Chi Yue hoped for.

After thinking for a while, Chi Yue could not determine his plan and could only watch how things unfolded.

As long as Xia Ningshang remained in her hands, she need not fear Yang Kai making trouble.

In Xia Ningshang’s pavilion, Shan Qingluo and Xia Ningshang anxiously waited together.

It had been half a month since Yang Kai’s clash with Xue Lian and his being taken by Chi Yue; he still had not returned, and the two women were naturally extremely worried.

Shan Qingluo had repeatedly gone to Chi Yue’s bedchamber to request an audience, but received no reply.

“Ningshang, don’t worry; foster mother would not harm him.” Shan Qingluo fretted like an ant on a hot pan, yet she still tried to comfort Xia Ningshang.

“Sister Qingluo, are you sure Lady Chi Yue won’t do my Junior Brother any harm?” Xia Ningshang looked at her with hopeful eyes, as if placing all hope on her.

The pressure on Shan Qingluo was immense; though she could not guarantee anything, she quickly nodded and gave her assurance.

At that moment, light footsteps sounded outside; both women released their Divine Sense, and a moment later their faces brightened as they hurried to their feet.

A moment later, Yang Kai walked in from outside, unharmed and looking quite well.

“You were waiting for me?” Yang Kai glanced at the two women, went to the table, poured a cup of water, and took a sip.

“Are you alright?” Shan Qingluo asked anxiously.

“Me? I’m fine.” Yang Kai chuckled. “Don’t worry—Senior Chi Yue didn’t do anything to me; we just made a deal.”

“A deal?” Shan Qingluo’s brows knitted. “What kind of deal?”

“Well, I can’t say all the specifics, but I’m going with you to Cuiwei Star.”

“You’re going to Cuiwei Star too? You’re going to take part in the Blood Prison Trial?” Shan Qingluo covered her mouth.

“Yes!”

“But you’re only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!” Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes trembled; “Only Third Stage cultivators go there.”

“What’s the problem?” Yang Kai smiled. “No one said Second Stage cultivators absolutely can’t go. Besides, I already promised Chi Yue; it’s too late to back out.”

“Even so, but—”

“There’s no ‘but’.” Yang Kai shook his head. “But I am curious: counting the days, the Blood Prison Trial will open in a month or two. If you don’t depart now, will you make it in time?”

Shan Qingluo smiled and pursed her lips. “There’s no rush. The palace has a Space Array that can send us directly into the Blood Prison, so we only need to wait until the Blood Prison opens.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. “There’s a Space Array here?”

“Mm.” Shan Qingluo nodded. “It’s said to be something left behind from tens of thousands of years ago. The Blood Prison Trial is such a grand event—naturally, the yao of Di Chen would want to take part as well. But it’s not easy for us to travel to Cuiwei Star, so tens of thousands of years ago, the previous generation’s Lady gathered a group of array masters and artifact refiners to construct a Great Space Array. Basically, every time the Blood Prison Trial opens, Di Chen secretly sends a group of young elites through it.”

“I see!” Yang Kai was enlightened. “No wonder Chi Yue seemed so unhurried—so that’s why.”

“Exactly. Otherwise why do you think Mi Tian and the others gathered at the palace? They’re all leaving from here to the Blood Prison.” Shan Qingluo explained with a smile.
