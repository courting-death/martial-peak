## Chapter 2129 — You Have No Say

At the same time, the aura around Xue Yi surged ever higher. Though he was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the force he radiated matched that of a Third Stage cultivator!

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, studying the transformed Xue Yi, and smiled slightly. "Body Tempering Technique, huh!"

As he spoke, he flicked his fingers and sent two streams of Origin Qi toward Xue Yi.

It was merely a probe; Xue Yi saw through it and made no move to dodge.

Thud, thud...

Two sharp sounds rang out as the attack landed on Xue Yi, as if striking steel, producing a crisp clang. Not only that, sparks flew in all directions.

"Useless! In front of my Diamond Heavenly King Body, all your attacks are nothing but futile!" Xue Yi lifted his chin, looking down at Yang Kai from above with a condescending posture.

"You'll know soon enough if it's futile!" Yang Kai didn't bother to argue, his figure flickered and vanished from where he stood.

Xue Yi's eyes narrowed, his brows furrowing tightly.

In that instant, he actually lost track of Yang Kai's movements—the opponent's speed was beyond imagination.

But as an elite disciple of Qingyang Shrine, he remained calm, instinctively reaching out a fan-like hand behind him.

Sure enough, Yang Kai's figure appeared there, seemingly throwing himself into Xue Yi's grasp.

A sinister smile curled at Xue Yi's lips as he stomped his foot hard on the ground.

Instantly, the earth shook and mountains trembled.

With a muffled roar, an earthen dragon burst from underground, whipping its head and tail as it lunged at Yang Kai.

Law Power swirled around the beast—a secret technique Xue Yi had cultivated.

The earthen dragon moved with incredible speed, reaching Yang Kai in a single breath. At that moment Yang Kai hovered in midair, ready to ambush Xue Yi. There was no time or space to evade—the dragon opened its mouth and bit down, snapping the shadowy body in two.

"Hmm?" Xue Yi felt no joy or relief at his apparent success; instead, his expression froze.

In that instant, he hadn't felt the sensation of striking a real body. Looking around, sure enough, the severed body faded into a wisp of green smoke and vanished—it was just a remnant shadow.

"Not good!" Xue Yi growled, quickly looking ahead.

Yang Kai had somehow appeared right in front of him, crouched low, eyes sharp and resolute, aiming at Xue Yi's abdomen. His fists blurred into countless afterimages...

Bang, bang, bang...

Xue Yi's towering body reeled from the heavy blows, forced backward again and again. From his abdomen, bursts of power flared out, accompanied by violent sounds.

"Diamond... Barrier!" Xue Yi suddenly roared, and a layer of earthy yellow light enveloped him like a cylinder, wrapping his whole body. After unleashing this defensive secret technique, he clasped his fists together and smashed them down hard.

Boom...

Dust flew everywhere. A huge pit appeared in the ground, but Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen.

Over ten zhang away, Yang Kai stood quietly, a thoughtful look on his face.

"After refining True Dragon blood, Dragon Bone, and Dragon Pearl, my strength and reflexes have improved a lot. Maybe the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup is still working as I continue to refine it. After all, I drank it back then but haven't fully refined it—it's still stored in my flesh for now," he mused.

In the past he couldn't have hurt an enemy like Xue Yi this way. But now...

Opposite him, Xue Yi looked unscathed, but his aura was a bit chaotic, and even a trace of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.

"How could this be?" Deep inside, Xiao Baiyi was shaken. Three months ago, during the Sect's martial contest, he had faced Xue Yi head-on and knew well the power of his Diamond Heavenly King Body.

That defense was like a fortress—even he had struggled to break it. He remembered that fight clearly: it took a full hour and all his tricks to finally overcome Xue Yi.

Yet now, Yang Kai had injured Xue Yi with brute force alone.

So did he hold back in their previous fight?

The thought nearly made Xiao Baiyi lose his composure.

This man is definitely not as simple as he appears! Either he's hiding his true cultivation, or his background is extraordinary! Xiao Baiyi speculated inwardly.

"Not bad, Brother Xue! You've really mastered taking a beating!" Yang Kai called from nearby.

Xue Yi had long lost his previous arrogance and carelessness. After being injured he realized something was wrong. He had refined his Diamond Heavenly King Body to the Sixth Stage; his physical strength had been praised even by Emperor Realm experts in the Sect. Yet now he had been wounded by an unknown First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

If someone had told him this would happen, he would have just laughed it off.

But the facts were right in front of him.

"However..." Yang Kai's eyes sharpened again. "Just being able to take a beating won't let you win against me!"

"Stop boasting!" Xue Yi, shamed and furious, twitched at the corners of his eyes, his face twisting with rage as he shouted, "If you die in a moment, don't blame me!"

As he spoke, he quickly formed hand seals.

A mysterious power erupted from within him, and his already burly frame grew even larger. Muscles bulged, and the metallic sheen on his body shone even brighter, radiating dazzling white light.

He stomped his feet, and light flashed on his fists as he summoned a secret treasure shaped like a pair of knuckle-dusters, exuding a deadly aura as he charged at Yang Kai.

In that instant, layers of white light spread from his body, swirling around the mountaintop, making the whole world seem to turn into a white haze.

"Not good, he's really going all out!" Wen Zishan squinted down, ready to intervene if things went wrong. After all, Xue Yi was an elite disciple of the Sect, and Yang Kai was a guest—he didn't want either to die in this fight.

"That Yang kid actually forced Xue Yi to this extent—quite unexpected!" Chen Qian said in surprise. "He's got talent. I wonder if the Hall Master is considering recruiting him into the Sect."

"Recruiting him wouldn't be a bad idea, but..."

"But what?"

"I just feel like I've seen this Yang kid somewhere before, and... he's dangerous!"

Chen Qian looked at Gao Xueting in confusion, not understanding what she meant.

Just then, in that white world, a burst of multicolored light suddenly flared, dazzling and sharp as a blade, slicing open the white haze.

"Five Elements Power?" Gao Xueting's brows rose in surprise.

She sensed the power of the Five Elements in that multicolored light—mutually restraining and generating, cycling endlessly, flowing without end...

The whole world seemed to be reduced to a contest between the multicolored light and the white haze.

The opening widened, and from within came Xue Yi's unwilling roar and Yang Kai's muffled groans—their battle had clearly reached a fever pitch.

Below, Xiao Baiyi had to use a secret technique to shield himself from the terrifying shockwaves.

"In just three months, to grow to this level?" Xiao Baiyi was utterly shocked. "Seems Xue Yi has been working hard as well!"

He was sure that Xue Yi was much stronger now than three months ago. If he'd had this strength back then, he might have made it into the top ten!

But even so... that Yang Kai kid could still fight him head-on!

Suddenly, a low chant rang out: "A million sword lights, chasing the moon and swallowing the wolf!"

As the words fell, countless dazzling sword lights shot out from the sky, all shining with multicolored brilliance, filled with the power of the Five Elements—unstoppable!

At the same time, an extraordinary energy ripple spread out.

A sharp, sizzling hiss filled the air…

The white world shattered, leaving only a mass of multicolored light suspended in midair.

Xue Yi was covered in wounds, his face full of unwillingness and helplessness as he fell from the sky. His face was deathly pale, and the metallic sheen of his body had faded away.

The knuckle-duster secret treasure on his hands was also dull and lifeless.

Seeing Xue Yi about to crash to the ground, Xiao Baiyi quickly moved to catch him.

He quickly inspected Xue Yi’s injuries and found no serious harm—only that his strength was greatly overdrawn. With that, his worry eased.

Looking up again, Xiao Baiyi stared coldly at Yang Kai in the sky, his gaze fixed on the broad sword in Yang Kai's hand. He snorted, "Imperial Treasure?"

Yang Kai grinned.

"Relying on the suppressive power of an Imperial Treasure—what kind of skill is that?" Xiao Baiyi sneered.

Yang Kai asked curiously, "He can use a secret treasure, but I can't?"

"If you have the guts, fight Brother Xue on equal terms!" Xiao Baiyi's contempt grew even stronger.

In his view, Yang Kai only won by relying on the power of the Imperial Treasure. If it came down to real ability, he might not beat Xue Yi.

"If you've got the guts, have him fetch an Imperial Treasure of his own and fight me with it!" Yang Kai said, not the least bit ashamed—if anything, positively proud.

"Fine!" Xiao Baiyi, clearly infuriated, glared coldly at Yang Kai. "This fight counts as your win. I hope you make it back alive from the Four Seasons Land!"

With that, he ignored Yang Kai, picked up Xue Yi, and flew away.

After he left, Yang Kai looked up at the void and said, "Is that enough?"

In the void, Wen Zishan appeared, staring curiously at the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai's hand. "Kid, where did you get that Imperial Treasure? That's not something you find on every street."

"That's none of your concern!"

Wen Zishan was left speechless, rolling his eyes. Soon, his expression turned serious as he said, "You were quite clever, realizing that the longer Xue Yi stayed in that state, the more dangerous it became—he might lose his mind. So you used the Imperial Treasure to end it quickly. Too bad... you were misunderstood."

"I just like the thrill of dominating people with an Imperial Treasure," Yang Kai snorted.

"Heh, Xiao Baiyi isn't as easy to deal with as Xue Yi. The words he left behind are worrying—he might target you in the Four Seasons Land. Want me to go explain things to him?"
