## Chapter 2224 — Yuan Fei

No one knew what that power truly was. When it arrived, those who had been trapped suddenly found themselves outside the Mist Valley, no longer within its bounds.

Some speculated that a reclusive master lived in the Mist Valley, hiding their name and identity. The thick mist shrouding the valley was said to be a result of this master’s earth-shattering methods, meant to keep others from disturbing their life.

Although this master’s cultivation was unfathomable, their heart was kind and benevolent. So, whenever someone was trapped in the Mist Valley, they would lend a helping hand, unwilling to create needless slaughter.

Of course, this was only the guess of those living nearby. As for what truly lay within the Mist Valley, no one had ever known.

At this very moment, in the heart of the Mist Valley, there was a plot of land about an acre in size, untouched by the thick mist. This was the only place in the entire Mist Valley where one could see clearly.

Within this acre, there were more than twenty graves of varying sizes, each about the height of a person.

These graves were scattered across the land like stars in the sky. In front of each grave stood a wooden tablet, each inscribed with a different name.

Judging by the craftsmanship and handwriting, it was clear that all these tablets had been made by the same person.

In the Divine Roaming World, when any living being died, they would turn into energy and dissipate into the world, leaving no corpse behind. Naturally, these graves were empty, but someone still erected tablets for them, clearly to honor and remember them.

If one looked closely at the names on those wooden tablets, they would find that every name belonged to a once-renowned figure in the Divine Roaming World.

Of course, that was a long time ago.

Now, these great figures had long since vanished. The world no longer knew whether they were alive or dead, but in truth, they had already passed away.

If word got out that the tablets of all these great figures were gathered here, it would surely shake the world.

The Mist Valley was utterly silent, as if nothing existed there but the graves of the departed.

About ten zhang away from the graves stood a simple wooden hut. Inside, an elderly man with white hair and beard sat cross-legged. Though he appeared aged, his face was radiant, exuding an extraordinary aura of an immortal.

On the surface, this old man showed no trace of cultivation, nor did he emit the slightest fluctuation of power—he seemed no different from an ordinary person. Yet with every breath he took, he stirred the very forces of heaven and earth.

Clearly, this man’s cultivation had reached its peak, attaining the legendary realm of unity between man and heaven.

Suddenly, the old man opened his eyes. Divine light burst forth, and in his gaze, sun, moon, and stars flickered, myriad beasts and living things flashed by in an instant.

Without moving his body, he simply swayed slightly and vanished without a trace.

When he reappeared, the old man was in another part of the Mist Valley. With a wave of his sleeve, a fierce wind arose, dispersing the thick mist ahead.

Before him suddenly appeared a strange, pitch-black altar arranged in a mysterious formation.

The old man stared at the altar with a grave expression, listening intently.

Buzz... buzz...

A faint, almost imperceptible sound suddenly came from within the altar.

The old man’s face changed abruptly. He seemed unable to believe what he was hearing. He checked again, but the result was the same.

His expression grew ugly, tinged with a faint sorrow.

“So many years have passed... Have you all awakened again?” he murmured to the altar, as if speaking to an old friend.

“What power has awakened you?” the old man said, turning to look in a certain direction. After a moment’s gaze, his figure flickered and disappeared.

Shortly after, a streak of rainbow light shot across the sky, leaving the Mist Valley and heading toward Heavenly Yao Mountain.

......

Deep within Heavenly Yao Mountain, Yang Kai stood frozen, his gaze cold as he looked around.

He had left the place where he fought Ban Qing and ventured deeper into Heavenly Yao Mountain, hoping to find a safe place to hide.

But things did not go as he wished. People kept finding him. Although none were as strong as Ban Qing and posed no real threat—he dispatched them all with his Soul-Devouring Worm and Soul-Severing Blade—the constant trouble kept Yang Kai on high alert.

He believed he had been careful enough, yet his whereabouts kept being exposed, as if those people knew exactly where he was.

This made him suspect that something had been done to him, allowing others to track him down.

But upon careful inspection, he found nothing unusual.

Moreover, among all the people he encountered, only Ban Qing at the very beginning had the ability to do such a thing. If it really was Ban Qing, when did he do it?

After much thought, Yang Kai could only guess that Ban Qing had done something to him during their direct confrontation.

And this unknown method was precisely what was drawing people to him.

Realizing this, he could no longer worry about danger and could only head deeper into Heavenly Yao Mountain.

Who would have thought that, after half a day, he would be blocked by two Demonic Beasts.

These two Demonic Beasts were not ordinary. When Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, he sensed that both had the aura of the Twelfth-Tier—in other words, they were as powerful as Emperor Realm cultivators!

Just one Ban Qing had given him plenty of trouble. Now, with two Demonic Beasts as strong as Ban Qing appearing at once, Yang Kai could not help but feel bitter.

Gao Xueting had said that there were many beings in Heavenly Yao Mountain that even she dared not provoke. Clearly, she was not exaggerating. There truly were many high-level beings here. Yang Kai had just never encountered them before because he had stayed on the outskirts.

Each of the two Demonic Beasts was extraordinary. The one on the left resembled an ape, with iron-like shoulders, long arms, and coarse, bristling hair like steel needles. Its eyes, larger than a baby’s fist, glared at Yang Kai with hostility, hot air snorting from its nostrils, clearly ill-intentioned.

The one on the right was a divine deer, pure white as if carved from jade, without a single blemish. It radiated a faint halo, dazzling to behold. Two short antlers adorned its forehead, adding a touch of beauty.

Though clearly different species, the two Demonic Beasts coexisted peacefully. They leapt before Yang Kai, blocking his path and sealing his retreat, leaving him both amazed and pressured.

Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beasts had a high chance of developing their own intelligence. In other words, at this level, they could think and perceive like humans.

Of course, some special Demonic Beasts, no matter how strong, always remained beastly and never gained intelligence.

Yang Kai did not know whether these two had gained intelligence, but he hoped they had. Otherwise, he would have no choice but to flee.

As soon as the two Demonic Beasts appeared, the Purple Civet was terrified, scurrying behind Yang Kai to hide.

As a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast, it was naturally suppressed by such powerful Twelfth-Tier beings.

As they faced off, the ape-like Demonic Beast suddenly snorted heavily from its nostrils, releasing a visible wave of hot air. Instantly, the temperature in the area plummeted, and Yang Kai instinctively circulated his power.

“Had enough fun yet?” the ape suddenly spoke in human language.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He immediately realized that this Demonic Beast had indeed gained intelligence—and a high level at that.

This meant he could try to negotiate.

With that in mind, he quickly cupped his fists and said, “Esteemed senior...”

Addressing a Demonic Beast as ‘senior’ felt odd, but Yang Kai could think of no better title.

Before he could finish, the ape glared coldly at him. Emperor Realm pressure crashed down, forcing Yang Kai to his knees. “Shut up!” it snapped.

“Uh...” Yang Kai was left speechless, unsure what it meant. Thinking back, the ape’s earlier question was also baffling.

At that moment, the divine deer on the right suddenly intervened.

A gentle force emanated from the deer, dispersing the ape’s Imperial Might that was pressing down on Yang Kai.

At the same time, the deer’s body shone with light. In a swirl of transformation, it became a tall, snow-skinned, breathtakingly beautiful woman in a white dress.

The woman she became appeared to be in her early twenties. Her beauty was not seductive, flirtatious, or dignified, but pure—untouched by the world, transcendent and holy.

Unstained by dust, untainted by the mundane, she seemed like a fairy descended from the heavens.

“Yuan Fei, be careful. What if you hurt the Young Master?” After transforming, the divine deer glared at the ape, chiding him gently.

“Hmph, if he gets hurt, he deserves it!” The Demonic Beast called Yuan Fei snorted, his thick fur retracting as he stood upright.

As he straightened, his body transformed. When he was fully upright, he had become a middle-aged man of about forty, with a fierce face and plain clothes.

Compared to the divine deer’s transformation, his was unimpressive and lacked any beauty, but it was simple and practical.

With both Demonic Beasts now in human form, Yang Kai was not too surprised. He looked at them suspiciously and blurted, “Young Master?”

In that moment, he seemed to understand something.
