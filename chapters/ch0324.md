## Chapter 324 — What to Eat?

Alright, I admit it’s a bit embarrassing...

Today's update is late, mainly because as a seasoned homebody, going out is quite a torment, and I even get carsick. Although I returned home the night before last, I still haven't adjusted, and I estimate it will take a few more days to get back to normal.

***********************

Yunli smiled subtly, stepping forward with her delicate hand poised to knock on the door, when suddenly a series of noises erupted from inside.

The sounds were peculiar and strange, not small at all. It seemed that a man was roaring while a woman was whimpering softly, though the man's cries were exuberant, the woman's voice was somewhat unclear, as if something had clogged her mouth.

The noise reached the ears of the three women outside, leaving them all stunned.

However, soon after, the lovely woman Yunli's pristine neck flushed pink, and her raised jade hand trembled slightly. Her eyes grew misty, sparkling like water, and she instinctively retracted her hand as if shocked, lightly biting her red lip, unsure of what to do.

Qiu Yimeng was also momentarily taken aback, but then she appeared to recall something, her face suddenly turning bright red as she gritted her teeth and cursed softly, "Bastard!"

Luo Xiaoman blinked her large eyes, tilting her head to listen, her pretty brow knitting in confusion as she asked, "Sister Qiu, what’s that sound inside?"

"Um…" Qiu Yimeng was caught off guard by the question and didn't know how to respond for a moment, "They… they might be Cultivation..."

Having said that, Qiu Yimeng blushed and couldn't continue.

Luo Xiaoman viewed her suspiciously, then glanced at Yunli, and whispered, "Cultivation? It sounds more like a fight. Why are both of you blushing?"

"Not at all!" Qiu Yimeng exclaimed, her eyes wide as she lied, feeling her face burning like fire.

At that moment, the noise from inside suddenly grew louder and more ferocious, the man's roars and the woman's muffled moans intertwining into an overwhelming surge that flooded the ears of the three women.

This sound seemed to possess a magical power, causing involuntary weakness in their legs and a flush on their faces.

"Ah…" Luo Xiaoman gasped softly, her face pale with fright: "Sister Qiu, is that bastard man…"

"What?" Qiu Yimeng's eyes flickered, her heart in a jumble.

"Is he killing the woman inside?" Luo Xiaoman shouted in alarm, her beautiful eyes trembling violently as she pleaded softly, "Sister Qiu, let's leave quickly, I feel so uncomfortable..."

"What's wrong?" Qiu Yimeng was startled and hurriedly asked.

Luo Xiaoman stammered for a moment before softly saying, "I need to go to the bathroom… let’s hurry and leave."

"Oh." Qiu Yimeng's face flushed almost to the point of bleeding. She too felt it wasn't suitable to linger here for long. Just as she intended to tell Yunli and leave, the door in front of them suddenly swung open.

Immediately, an enchanting young girl appeared before the three of them. They all exchanged blushing glances. The enchanting girl had disheveled hair and her clothes were in disarray. She was almost naked, touched by a rosy glow, clutching several pieces of clothing, looking flustered and panicked.

Looking down at the girl’s pure white body, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman clearly saw several fingerprints on her skin, especially on her two round breasts, where deep finger marks were evident as if seared by a branding iron, seemingly imprinted into her flesh, looking quite striking.

Between her long, fair legs, it was **white**, with shimmering threads sliding down her thighs.

On her lips, there remained a smear of milky liquid…

"Ah..." Bilo was suddenly taken aback, staring blankly at the three women before her, then gritting her teeth, her face flushed, she dashed past them and disappeared in a flash.

Although she hadn't managed to dress properly, there were only women in the palace, so she had no particular need to be shy, yet she didn’t want to stay there a moment longer near Yang Kai.

After Bilo left for quite a while, the three women remained engulfed in a peculiar silence.

Finally, Luo Xiaoman snapped back to reality and gently asked, "Sister Qiu, what did that girl eat?"

Qiu Yimeng was just as confused, slowly shaking her head.

What did she eat? Why was there still a mess left?

Yunli slowly turned around, her voice quivering slightly as she hesitantly asked, "Ladies, do you still wish to meet Young Master Yang?"

Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath and nodded slightly.

Now that they were here, they couldn’t just turn back.

Yunli responded, then stood at the door and called out softly: "Young Master, Miss Qiu and Miss Luo have come to see you."

"Come in."

Yunli was taken aback, then looked at Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, saying, "Please, both of you!"

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman adjusted their expressions, then stepped inside. As soon as they entered the room, Yunli hurriedly scampered downstairs.

Inside, Yang Kai sat boldly in a grand chair embedded with gold and jade, his clothes neat, smiling as he looked at the two girls who had entered.

Upon meeting his gaze, Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but recall the earlier commotion, her pretty face blushing slightly as she quickly averted her eyes.

Luo Xiaoman timidly followed Qiu Yimeng, gritting her teeth at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, however, paid no mind as he merely observed them.

Caught under his unrestrained gaze, Qiu Yimeng momentarily forgot her purpose for coming and stood there stupidly without saying a word.

Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed from downstairs again, and soon after, Bilo reappeared in a bright red outfit.

At this moment, she had already put on her clothes, her face still bearing a blush, but it lacked the previous embarrassment, returning to her usual enchanting demeanor.

Without a shred of consideration for Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman in the room, Bilo called out to Yang Kai, "Hey you bastard, let me warn you, I just wanted to try what it's like to be with a man, not to get involved with you. Today's matter isn’t on either of us, so don’t come seeking me in the future, got it?"

Yang Kai was taken aback, nodding with a wry smile, "Understood."

Bilo huffed, shaking her small fist, asserting, "If you dare pursue me, watch out, I’ll make you look good, hmph!"

Seeing her so dismissive of Yang Kai, Luo Xiaoman couldn’t help but feel a sense of camaraderie, smiling as she regarded Bilo, seemingly hoping she would scold Yang Kai some more to relieve her own dissatisfaction.

However, to her surprise, Bilo only spoke a word, turned, and was ready to leave.

"This sister…" Luo Xiaoman couldn’t bear to see it any longer and hurriedly called out to her.

"What is it?" Bilo smiled playfully at Luo Xiaoman, her gaze lingering between her ample bosom.

"You didn’t wipe your face clean after eating; there's still…" Luo Xiaoman smiled and gestured to the side of her mouth.

"Uh…" Bilo was taken aback, rubbing her mouth and discovering the truth, glaring at Yang Kai with frustration, then smiled sweetly at Luo Xiaoman, "Thank you. I’ll invite you out to play another day."

"Sure." Luo Xiaoman responded, happily.

Unexpectedly, women in this palace were rather easygoing.

Qiu Yimeng observed silently, sensing something amiss, even though she couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. Frowning in thought, she was left with nothing.

Bilo whooshed away like a whirlwind.

With her diversion, Qiu Yimeng managed to steady her mind, smiling at Yang Kai, "I didn’t expect you to be living so comfortably here, with a lovely environment and beautiful women waiting on you. You must be quite reluctant to leave, huh?"

Yang Kai grinned, staring at Qiu Yimeng unabashedly, raising an eyebrow, "Miss Qiu came to find me today, it isn’t to envy my lifestyle, is it? Speak openly; I don’t like women playing tricks in front of me."

Qiu Yimeng paused, smiling lightly as she nodded, "Being straightforward is fine. Here’s the situation: I want you to help us leave this place."

As expected.

Yang Kai remained calm, replying flatly, "Do I look like the kind of person with that sort of ability?"

Qiu Yimeng smiled gently, "At least, you’re not restricted in power. How would you know unless you try? *Sigh* You and I, unlike Xiaoman, have our True Essence sealed. It’s impossible for us to fight. Do you really want to stay here for the rest of your life?"

As she said this, she covered her mouth and chuckled, "That’s right; here you have no worries about food and clothing, with the Enchantress Queen as your support, ample Cultivation resources, and beautiful women serving you. Any man would be unwilling to leave."

"Stop trying to provoke me." Yang Kai scoffed, "Do you think that would be effective?"

Qiu Yimeng frowned, noticing Yang Kai's obstinacy; she sighed, "Alright then, let’s be straightforward. What do you want from me in exchange for helping me and Xiaoman leave?"

"On what grounds do you think I can let you go?" Yang Kai frowned, displeased. This woman was too presumptuous.

"Because of your special relationship with the Enchantress Queen. As long as you say a good word in front of her, that’s all it takes. Xiaoman and I are of little value to her; what benefit is there in keeping us here? The Qiu Family and Ziwei Valley can compensate her losses with resources."

Seeing Yang Kai deep in thought, Qiu Yimeng hurriedly said, "You only need to send a message; Xiaoman and I can’t meet her; otherwise, we wouldn’t have come to ask you for help."

"I can’t see her either!" Yang Kai retorted coldly.

"That’s impossible! She treated you so well before." Qiu Yimeng expressed disbelief.

"Believe it or not, that’s your choice. I won’t hide this from you; Shan Qingluo isn’t in Piaoxiang City right now, she seems to have gone to the territory of the Thunder Beast King with the experts in the city."

Yang Kai learned this information when he was fighting Le Yu that day, having unintentionally overheard the Divine Roaming Realm experts discussing it.

Though he battled with Le Yu that day, he had been attentive to his surroundings.

"Ah…" Qiu Yimeng was taken aback, her beautiful eyes shining with excitement and eagerness as she asked, "Since she’s not here, why don’t you leave? Can it be that you really want to stay here for the rest of your life?"

"Where can I go?" Yang Kai shot her a cold look, his eyes brimming with hostility and disdain.

"To…" Qiu Yimeng faltered.

Indeed, where could he go? The Lingxiao Pavilion was probably deserted now, with no trace of elders, senior brothers, or junior sisters; where could he go?

Seemingly, he had nowhere to go!

Yang Kai's words instantly made Qiu Yimeng realize the difficulties he faced.

Moreover, what Qiu Yimeng did not know was that a Soul Pursuit Seal left by Shan Qingluo still resided within Yang Kai. With this, no matter where he fled, Shan Qingluo would be able to find him, making it more prudent to stay put.
