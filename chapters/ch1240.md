## Chapter 1240 — Fierce Battle

However, once a Secret Treasure is equipped with an Artifact Spirit, the power that treasure can unleash jumps up several tiers.

Because of that, some brilliant and ruthless warriors developed an astonishing method: using the spiritual essence of demonic beasts to create Artifact Spirits. After slaying a demonic beast, they use secret rites to extract its spirit, seal it into a Secret Treasure, and spend time refining it—artificially forging an Artifact Spirit.

The method is bloodthirsty and cruel to the extreme; the refining process is inhuman. The demonic beast spirits sealed into the Secret Treasure undergo unspeakable torment while being refined, so if it succeeds, the resulting treasure becomes utterly malignant. Still, such artificially made Artifact Spirits are far inferior to authentic Artifact Spirits: they can boost a treasure’s might, but aren’t quite as terrifying.

The success rate is extremely low and the time cost high, so only those who cultivate dark arts and possess tremendous patience ever use it. Those forbidden techniques are rarely mastered by anyone.

The Artifact Spirit Yang Kai encountered this time, however, was genuine—an authentic birth, not one manufactured by human hands. It carried no trace of evil; it had clearly arisen from the refining furnace through some fortuitous chance.

Although the refining furnace wasn’t crafted for battle, its grade wasn’t low, and for a time the might the strange bird Artifact Spirit exuded made Yang Kai’s heart pound.

As it lunged at him, Yang Kai’s vision filled with a sheet of blazing red, as if the whole stone chamber were suffused with that pure, incomparable fire Spiritual Qi, obscuring everything else.

He fervently hoped this thing had been born only recently and hadn’t yet awakened intelligence. Yang Kai prayed silently.

Retreating fast, he simultaneously raised the Purple Shield, pouring Saint Yuan into it. A violent sandstorm suddenly manifested, swirling around Yang Kai as a barrier.

But no sooner had the sandstorm formed than the crimson firebird spread its wings, whipping up an even fiercer gale. Flames like blades rode the wind, and in a single breath they tore through the sandstorm’s defense.

Wind fanned the flames; fire rode the gale. The firebird’s might surged like a tide. Yang Kai’s breath caught; sensing danger, a Demonic Flame longsword flashed into his hand. Dark sword light cleaved outward in torrents, his momentum arching like a rainbow.

Boom, boom, boom...

Violent impacts rang out. The red flame-blades and the sword light met and clashed to mutual destruction, yet the flame-blades came in endless waves. No matter how many sword lights Yang Kai unleashed, they could not fully cancel them all.

The strike of this crimson firebird was unbelievably powerful!

Yang Kai gestured and the Hundred Mountains Painting appeared. Illusory mountain peaks sprang forth from the painting and flew to intercept the flame-blades.

A sneer and mockery flashed through the firebird’s eyes. With an elegant beat of its wings, the remaining flame-blades, as if sentient, transformed into writhing fire-serpents that slipped past the Hundred Mountains Painting’s peaks and headed straight for Yang Kai himself.

Seeing that almost human expression, Yang Kai’s heart stumbled and he inwardly cursed.

This Artifact Spirit not only had intelligence but a higher degree of wit—otherwise how could it display such an expression?

What’s more, since it was born from the refining furnace, it should be intrinsically versed in fire doctrines and arts. Fighting it inside this cramped stone chamber was hardly wise.

Yang Kai instantly felt the urge to retreat.

As black fireballs were hurled outward, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense shifted and his Yuan Control Art unfolded, transforming into black fire-serpent attacks that surged toward the firebird.

The two kinds of serpents collided—one red, one black—gnawing and devouring each other, locked in a tense stalemate.

Taking advantage of the moment, Yang Kai tried to withdraw; he didn’t want to fight this sort of Artifact Spirit here.

Who would’ve thought that the Firebird’s mind would be so quick and agile—just one glance at Yang Kai’s movement, and it instantly understood his intent. Tilting its head, it spat out a basin-sized fireball from its beak. The fireball brimmed with violent, ferocious fire-attributed Spiritual Qi, and at the sight of it, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be startled.

If struck, he would either die or be gravely wounded. He hurriedly flashed aside to dodge.

The bird seemed to anticipate Yang Kai’s reaction and its eyes shone with derision. The fireball shot into the passage Yang Kai had backed into and detonated. The fire Spiritual Qi didn’t dissipate but formed a crimson curtain that sealed the entrance.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened!

This crimson firebird intended to trap him here, unwilling to let him leave.

Ordinarily such a simple barrier wouldn’t stop Yang Kai—he could break through with a little effort. But with an Artifact Spirit glaring at him, did he have the time to force his way through the red curtain?

Doing so would only give the Artifact Spirit an opening.

“Stupid bird, you’re courting death!” Yang Kai’s face turned grim. He stopped thinking of retreating. Demonic Flame roiled about him; he became like a burning black orb, that darkness seeming to consume everything, even sight itself, so that no one could clearly see Yang Kai’s true features.

Seeing Yang Kai angered, the firebird’s mocking expression vanished. It seemed to realize it had misjudged; this opponent wasn’t a pushover, and forcing him to stay wasn’t wise.

But it was still only an Artifact Spirit. Though its intelligence had awakened, it didn’t ponder too long. With a shrill cry it unleashed an invisible shock that tore at the defenses of Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness and slammed into his spirit.

Inside his Sea of Consciousness chaos churned. Yang Kai snorted coldly and suppressed the disturbance. As he moved, black light rose throughout the chamber; torrents of energy formed from Demonic Flame spewed from him, quickly taking up half the room and matching the firebird’s pure fire Spiritual Qi.

The stone chamber’s interior turned bizarre: one side by the entrance was pitch black, not a finger’s breadth visible, while the other half was molten crimson, a seething sea of fire.

The two energies, driven by Yang Kai and the crimson firebird respectively, violently collided.

The entire chamber shook as aftershocks from the ferocious clash surged outward. At the stone walls, seal lights flashed, intercepting the ripples.

Luckily this place was the foremost artificer’s refining spot for that great Sect, already layered with sealing arrays; otherwise such a chamber couldn’t withstand the fight between Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit.

Black light and red glow continued to strike each other, neither yielding, gradually eroding one another.

Yang Kai’s face was grave. The firebird’s elegant body twisted and it let out perpetual cries—no longer as relaxed and carefree as before.

After the clash lasted the span of a burning incense stick, the chamber returned to its original appearance. Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit stared at one another from a distance, both having expended true fire; in that hard clash, neither had managed to overwhelm the other.

Yang Kai couldn’t have imagined that a mere Artifact Spirit could fight him to a standstill! He knew his own combat strength better than anyone: even against a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, if the opponent slipped, he could grievously wound them; whether he could kill them depended on their methods.

Yet this Artifact Spirit was in no way inferior to him.

And it was only an ownerless Artifact Spirit, unable to release an Artifact Spirit’s full might. If someone claimed and controlled it, he would surely be no match.

Artifact Spirits are not corporeal; their existence merely amplifies a Secret Treasure’s power.

All his struggle had been against the shadow of that treasure; if...

As Yang Kai was thinking this, his expression shifted drastically. Without hesitation he produced hundreds of Vast Heaven Shields and cast forth the Purple Shield at the same time.

Because the Artifact Spirit seemed wildly agitated, the refining furnace that had been quietly placed in the chamber’s center began to hum from its frenzy. Suddenly the furnace flew into the air and spun. Clusters of lively flames shot out and dove into the firebird’s body.

In an instant the firebird’s might surged. A weighty aura spread out.

Yang Kai’s face lit up and he cried out: “Shi!”

To think that an Artifact Spirit like this would actually know how to wield the power of Shi—something that only experts of the Origin Returning Realm could comprehend.

Qian Tong wasn’t wrong—within the Flowing Flame Sandland Shi should not exist; the moment anyone with an understanding of Shi entered, they would be wiped out. For that reason, Origin Returning Realm experts could not enter Flowing Flame Sandland; in all past openings of that forbidden place only Saint King Realm warriors entered.

Yet this strange bird had used Shi and nothing happened to it.

Very quickly Yang Kai realized something was wrong: this force resembled Shi but wasn’t true Shi. Rather, the bird was catalyzing the dense fire Spiritual Qi in the chamber, borrowing the world’s Spiritual Qi for its own use through a wondrous method.

No wonder a fire-type Artifact Spirit would be innately versed in such heavenly laws; Yang Kai was secretly alarmed.

This was the second time Yang Kai had been enveloped by such a power. The first had been outside the cave at Dragon Lair Mountain, when he fought one of the Origin Returning Realm experts who accompanied Xie Hongwen.

But that person’s Shi was nothing compared to the present. Though Yang Kai had been constrained before, it hadn’t been dire.

Now he felt heavy all over, his bones creaking as if dislocated, his body swaying; even moving a finger became painfully difficult.

Around him an invisible restraint seemed to coil like chains, locking him in place so he couldn’t move.

Even his Divine Sense and Saint Yuan were compressed into his Sea of Consciousness and body, unable to be expended in the slightest.
