## Chapter 1381 — What the Hell!

After all, Yang Kai was only a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, while this bucktoothed warrior himself, though merely at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, was—without exaggeration—more than a match even for an ordinary Second Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator. It was only natural, then, that he felt some measure of disdain.

He shifted his gaze inconspicuously, then stole another glance at Yang Yan.

Unexpectedly, at that glance the bucktoothed warrior's face changed dramatically, as if he had seen some horrifying sight. He involuntarily took several hurried steps backward, his body striking the door with a thud. Immediately his expression turned to incredulity; his narrow eyes flew wide, his pupils trembled, and he pointed a trembling finger at Yang Yan: "You, you, you..."

"Nephew Ge, what's the matter?" Yan Pei looked at him in astonishment, then at Yang Yan, not understanding why the man wore the expression of someone who'd seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Yang Kai's doubts multiplied as well; he quietly sent a voice transmission to Yang Yan: "Do you know him?"

Yang Yan shook her head in bafflement and replied, "Never seen him."

“You’ve got the wrong person?” Yang Kai grew even more confused. Though Yang Yan’s skill in artifact refining and formations was outstanding, her temperament had always been mild—she shouldn’t have made enemies outside. Yet judging from the bucktoothed warrior’s reaction, he was clearly terrified of her, as if he had once suffered a crushing defeat at Yang Yan’s hands—one so bitter it had been carved into his very bones.

"Nephew Ge!" Yan Pei barked, and an invisible surge of Divine Sense struck the bucktoothed warrior, finally rousing him from his stupefaction.

The warrior surnamed Ge shuddered, much of the fear in his eyes fading away—but in the next instant, fine beads of sweat seeped densely across his forehead, plainly visible to the eye. His complexion began to turn bluish, and even his lips grew pale and white.

What on earth was this? Yang Kai looked displeased. Even if the man had suffered some humiliation at Yang Yan's hands in the past, seeing her now shouldn't render him so helpless. Besides, Yang Yan said she didn't know him at all, so it seemed more likely he had mistaken her for someone else.

Yet to be so utterly shaken by a mere mistake—this fellow was clearly a weakling, Yang Kai snorted coldly, feeling somewhat contemptuous.

Coming to his senses, the warrior surnamed Ge kept wiping the sweat from his brow, but as soon as he wiped one patch another would form; he could not get dry and soon his sleeve was soaked through.

Wiping his sweat, he kept glancing at Yang Yan, but whenever their eyes met he immediately averted his gaze, looking utterly frightened.

Seeing this, Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled; she suddenly found him amusing. Her mouth quirked and she fixed him with a sharp, beautiful stare. Under her gaze Ge's legs trembled, and his eyes darted about as if he wished to find a hole to crawl into or flee the place at once.

The sight both exasperated and amused Yan Pei, who called out in a loud voice, "Nephew Ge, speak plainly."

Ge's mouth twitched as if he wanted to laugh, but he forced out a look more pitiable than crying. Extremely awkward, he clasped his fist and bowed to Yang Yan, asking in a quivering voice, "May I ask this young lady's honorable family name?"

That question seemed to drain him of every ounce of courage; when he'd finished he waited anxiously, the sound of his swallowing painfully loud.

Yan Pei put a hand to his brow, speechless.

To be frank, he knew something of that old friend's offspring: the young man had lived secluded under that elder's care and lacked worldly experience, yet his cultivation talent was astonishing—so remarkable that even with only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm he could fight above his rank, an elite among elites.

This time he had been forced to come out at the old friend's behest and had run into some troubles along the way, all of which he'd resolved with thunderous measures.

He was not a timid man. Though his bearing and looks were somewhat seedy, his spirit was heroic, which earned Yan Pei's regard; Yan Pei had even intended to inform that old friend to let this warrior surnamed Ge take an important post in the Jubao Tower.

Yet today's scene left Yan Pei incredulous. No matter how formidable this young woman might be, she should not reduce Nephew Ge to such a pathetic state at a single meeting—especially when, by all appearances, this girl looked perfectly harmless.

Yang Yan smiled faintly, her delicate beauty blooming, making the warrior surnamed Ge unable to meet her gaze. "My name is Yang Yan," she said. "What business do you have with me?"

"Yang Yan..." The warrior surnamed Ge shuddered, nearly falling to his rear. Muttering a few words, he bent his waist and continued bowing, "I dare not, I dare not—my name is Ge Qi. Call me Xiao Qi."

As he spoke he wore a fawning smile; the sight of his buckteeth made him look all the more sleazy.

"Xiao Qi," Yang Yan nodded lightly, suppressing a smile. With an air of dignified nobility she parted her lips and said, "Xiao Qi, then."

"At your service!" Ge Qi hurriedly replied, nearly bowing so low his head brushed his groin, extremely deferential.

"Am I very ugly?" Yang Yan asked casually.

Those words struck like a bolt from the blue. Ge Qi's face changed drastically and he hastily waved his hands, "No, no, no—your beauty outshines the moon and shames the flowers; you are a peerless beauty, nothing to do with the word 'ugly'."

"Is that so?" Yang Yan's brows lifted and she snapped, "If that's the case, why are you acting like you've seen a ghost? I was beginning to think I'm hideous."

Ge Qi looked even more terrified, wearing a mournful expression as he cried, "I am wronged, miss, truly I am..."

"Wronged how?" Yang Yan pressed, and somehow a trace of authority showed through her demeanor.

Yang Kai and Yan Pei stared in surprise; that authority did not seem feigned but carried a presence that commanded obedience. In that instant even Yan Pei felt a faint impression of Yang Yan standing lofty above others.

Ge Qi could not bear it and his knees buckled; he went down to his knees. Fortunately Yan Pei reacted in time, sweeping his hand to support the man's body, then cleared his throat and turned to Yang Kai, "Young friend Yang, you see..."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and shot Yang Yan a glare. "Stop the nonsense!"

After all, Ge Qi was at least First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Although no one knew why he was so terrified of Yang Yan, it was a bit much for her to continue toying with him.

Yang Yan stuck out her tongue and pouted. "Who told him to be so cowardly?"

Cowardly... Yan Pei gave a bitter smile. This young man of his old friend's clan was not a coward, yet today's events were truly baffling; he could not fathom the reason.

“Brother Ge, is it?” Yang Kai rose to his feet, clasped his fists slightly toward Ge Qi, and offered a conciliatory smile. “My Senior Sister here can be a bit mischievous—just now she was merely joking around. I hope Brother Ge won’t take it to heart.”

"Senior Sister?" Ge Qi froze, and his expression shifted—no longer dismissive or contemptuous. He bowed even more, "No, no, you flatter me, brother, you're too polite."

Yang Kai rubbed his nose, feeling helpless. He had the sense that Ge Qi regarded Yang Yan as a cat and himself as a mouse. After a moment he said, "Yang Yan, you should step outside. I have some matters to discuss with Brother Ge."

"Oh." Yang Yan, displeased, pouted.

"No need, no need!" Ge Qi hurriedly waved his hands, as if the idea of Yang Yan waiting outside on his account would be an unpayable debt.

Yang Yan felt a little embarrassed—she had only been in a playful mood and had teased him, but never expected it to go this far.

Seeing Ge Qi look at her with such earnestness, Yang Kai gave her a hint with his eyes. Yang Yan understood and pulled the hood of the black robe over her head and sat quietly to one side.

Only then did Ge Qi draw a heavy breath.

"Brother Ge, please sit." Yang Kai smiled and gestured.

Ge Qi cast a beseeching look at Yan Pei; seeing him nod, he apologized as he sat, assuming the deference of a junior meeting elders—so much so that he perched on only half the chair.

Yang Kai and Yan Pei watched all of this clearly but said nothing.

"It is like this: Elder Yan said that the Star Emperor Token was brought by Brother Ge to exchange," Yang Kai said, looking at Ge Qi.

"That is correct." Ge Qi's face soured as he furtively glanced at Yang Yan. He then explained, "If not for sheer necessity, my family's patriarch would never have used a Star Emperor Token to barter. But now there is truly no other way. I beg Brother Yang and Miss Yang Yan to judge with understanding."

Yang Kai inwardly wondered what understanding he was supposed to offer, but since meeting Ge Qi his manner had been inexplicably odd, so he was not overly surprised.

"And the thing Brother Ge seeks in exchange is the whereabouts of Flowing Flame Fireblaze or the Soul Cleansing Divine Water?" Yang Kai asked further.

"Yes!" Ge Qi nodded nervously.

"Although I had Elder Yan summon Brother Ge here, let me make it clear up front: I do not possess the whereabouts of Flowing Flame Fireblaze or the Soul Cleansing Divine Water."

“No, no, it’s quite all right.” Ge Qi waved it off as though unconcerned. “If Brother Yang wishes to have this Star Emperor Token, allow me to return and report to my family’s patriarch. Should the patriarch agree, presenting it to Brother Yang… and to Lady Yang Yan as well, would be no problem.”

"Er..." Yang Kai looked astonished, then waved his hand, "That is not what I meant. This Star Emperor Token, though the seal's power has been activated, was forged by a Great Emperor and its value is exceptional. I would not accept it for nothing. May I boldly ask whether Patriarch Ge's Sea of Consciousness has some problem?"

Yan Pei's eyes flashed at Yang Kai's question; he was secretly surprised that Yang Kai could guess so much. As someone familiar with that reclusive elder, Yan Pei naturally knew why the token had been brought out in exchange.

To Yan Pei's further surprise, Ge Qi readily admitted without avoidance, nodding, "What Brother Yang said is correct. Six months ago my family's patriarch was treacherously ambushed, and his Sea of Consciousness was poisoned, so he requires Flowing Flame Fireblaze and the Soul Cleansing Divine Water—according to the patriarch, only these two things can remove the Divine Sense poison afflicting him."
