## Chapter 1778 — Reencounter with Luo Lan

"Does it work?" Yang Kai asked; although he believed his idea should be correct — using the undulations of Spatial Force to sense the presence of rifts — since it was a secret technique imposed on someone else, he did not have absolute confidence.

"It works, it works splendidly!" the Ghost Ancestor nodded heavily. "I can now sense all the rifts. There are three hidden rifts nearby, right?"

"Correct!" Yang Kai nodded and smiled. "It seems my idea was not wrong."

“Mm, now that this old man’s problem is resolved… but are you sure you’ll be fine on your own?” the Ghost Ancestor asked again with concern. Most of those who had entered this place were Void King Realm experts. Though Xue Yue and Zi Donglai were only at the Origin Returning Realm, they were certainly accompanying Ni Guang and Zi Long. For Yang Kai to act alone here was undoubtedly risky—should he encounter a powerful expert, he would almost certainly be attacked.

That made the Ghost Ancestor somewhat uneasy.

"No problem." Yang Kai grinned. "Grand Elder, don’t forget what force I’m proficient in. With so many spatial rifts here, this place is practically tailor-made for me. If some blind fool shows up and I can’t beat him, do you think I can’t run?"

Hearing him, the Ghost Ancestor agreed and nodded. "Very well, then we’ll split up, but don’t be careless. I’ll leave something on you — as long as we remain within a thousand li, you can trigger it and I will sense your location and come to you at once."

As he spoke, the Ghost Ancestor waved and summoned his Ten Thousand Souls Banner, then plunged his hand into it and snatched out something.

The next moment, a ferocious, roaring Yin-Soul was pulled out by the Ghost Ancestor.

The Yin-Soul looked terrifying and even had distinct facial features; it emitted an exceedingly powerful aura, one not weaker than a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artist.

"This is an auxiliary soul from my Ten Thousand Souls Banner. It is linked to my mind; I’ll hand it to you for now!" the Ghost Ancestor said, patting the auxiliary soul onto Yang Kai’s shoulder.

In the next instant, Yang Kai felt a chill press against his shoulder, though it had little effect on him.

After silently sensing and confirming that the auxiliary soul had indeed entered his body, Yang Kai lightly nodded to indicate all was well.

Next, they naturally waited for the Seven Luminaries Divine Light to withdraw before moving.

While the divine light covered the valley, no one could act; everyone could only rely on the existence of spatial rifts to hide.

Yang Kai privately calculated the time.

Finally, at a certain moment, a shocking inhalation came from the depths of the valley. With the valley trembling slightly, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light covering Medicine Valley receded like a tide toward the depths.

"Sect Master, be careful," the Ghost Ancestor warned.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, then dashed off in a different direction from the Ghost Ancestor.

Once separated from the Ghost Ancestor, Yang Kai’s speed increased considerably. When they moved together before, the Ghost Ancestor had been safe but needed constant direction changes at Yang Kai’s reminder, which caused slight delays; alone, Yang Kai no longer had to consider that.

In Medicine Valley, a medicinal fragrance filled the air everywhere. Finding heaven-and-earth treasures and medicines was actually quite simple: follow the source of the scent and you would gain something.

The only concerns were the spatial rifts and the lingering Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

Yang Kai estimated the recently withdrawn Seven Luminaries Divine Light would not return immediately, so he began to move boldly.

After the time it took an incense stick to burn, he happily squatted under the root of a towering tree and pocketed a spiritual medicine that looked like a ginseng.

That spiritual medicine looked much like ordinary ginseng; the difference was that its surface was speckled with phosphorescence, as if countless tiny stars had been miniaturized across it.

"This is Red Star Ginseng; this truly is a good place," Yang Kai breathed. The medicines he had obtained were all Void King-Grade treasures, long since extinct items; used to refine Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills, they would surely make Void King Realm experts jealous and fight over them.

His own realm was close to breaking through; he would need such pills and rare medicines for future cultivation.

This Lost Realm trip had thus provided a valuable opportunity to gather materials, and he spared no effort.

Another half incense stick later, Yang Kai was already three hundred li away, frowning at a spiritual herb ahead and the disturbed soil around it, cursing that he had arrived too late.

The spiritual medicines that had grown here had already been taken by someone who had moved faster.

The only remaining herb was a newly sprouted seedling, not yet mature; even if collected, it would be of little use.

It seemed the previous martial artist who came here did not act recklessly; they had taken the mature medicines and left a sapling behind, leaving others a chance.

Who that person was, Yang Kai could not tell. He shrugged and didn’t ponder further, continuing to follow the medicinal scent in search of more.

Time passed, and after another incense stick he finally had more gains. Though the medicines he collected could not compare to a Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit or a Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi, they were still priceless items.

"The time should be near, right?" Yang Kai muttered to himself.

According to his earlier estimate, each breath of the Seven Luminaries Peacock occurred at intervals of about half an hour; if that calculation was correct, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light would soon cover the valley again.

Whether his guess was correct remained to be verified.

To be cautious, Yang Kai did not act recklessly; he kept track of the spatial rifts’ locations while continuing to search.

At that moment, he suddenly felt something and turned to look. Thirty li away, a life aura was rapidly approaching him. On closer sensing, the aura felt familiar, and he wondered aloud, "Huh? It’s her!"

Thinking that, Yang Kai did not try to avoid her; instead he walked out to meet the approaching figure.

After a short time, he saw a figure not far ahead.

Yang Kai called out loudly, "Elder Luo!"

Luo Lan had already detected Yang Kai’s trace, which was why she had been coming straight this way; she continually released Divine Sense to detect the surrounding spatial rifts.

Luo Lan smiled faintly and increased her speed.

"Wait!" Yang Kai suddenly shouted.

Luo Lan immediately stopped in her tracks and, startled, asked, "What is it? Is there a spatial rift ahead of me?"

Yang Kai nodded. "Yes. Five steps further and you’d have touched it."

Luo Lan’s pretty face went pale; she cast her gaze toward a spot in the void and said, "It’s here, right?"

"Mm, go around from the side and you’ll be fine," Yang Kai instructed.

Luo Lan then cautiously skirted around, taking a wide circle before coming to Yang Kai’s side. She said, "Thank you. If you hadn’t warned me just now, I’d probably have been in pieces."

"It was nothing; no need for you to mention it, Elder," Yang Kai smiled slightly.

"By the way, why are you alone here?" Luo Lan looked at Yang Kai curiously. She had clearly seen him enter Medicine Valley with the Ghost Ancestor, but the Ghost Ancestor was nowhere to be found now.

"That’s what I wanted to ask," Yang Kai laughed. "I split up with the Ghost Ancestor so that we both could gather more. But Senior Luo, why didn’t you follow Senior Ni?"

"Same reason," Luo Lan said with a smile. "Trailing behind him I wouldn’t get good things either, so I decided to take a risk. I did get some gains, and it seems my luck held out so nothing happened to me."

Had Yang Kai not warned her earlier, she would certainly have run headlong into a spatial rift, with dire consequences.

The thought that she might have passed by countless rifts without detecting them made Luo Lan break out in a cold sweat.

While they spoke, the valley’s depths again emitted the exhalation sound. Having experienced the same thing before, Yang Kai and Luo Lan both knew what to do next.

The timing proved him right; Yang Kai quietly thought, his earlier deduction correct — each breath of the divine bird indeed came roughly every half hour.

While he pondered, Luo Lan looked around for a place to hide, but within sight there was not a visible rift; helpless, she turned to Yang Kai.

She did not show panic; after all, there was a hidden spatial rift here they could use, she simply could not find it.

"Come over here, Elder!" Yang Kai said without hesitation, waving to Luo Lan. He stood behind the spatial rift, but then his expression changed oddly. "Uh…"

"What’s wrong?" Luo Lan, standing before him, saw his strange look and asked quickly.

"This rift…" Yang Kai looked embarrassed. "Seems a bit small."

"Small?" Luo Lan was startled, then quickly understood what he meant.

If the rift was small, the space for hiding would be tight; with a man and a woman squeezed together, some unavoidable physical contact might occur.

Thinking of that, Luo Lan’s face grew slightly embarrassed.

Although she was older than Yang Kai by who knew how many times, she was still a woman — her appearance looked only about thirty.

"It’s fine; we’re only hiding for a little while," Luo Lan calmed herself, moving closer to Yang Kai until they were less than a chi apart. She glanced left and right, then pointed beside Yang Kai and asked, "Can I stand here?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

Luo Lan let out an awkward laugh, realizing the rift must truly be very small.

At that moment, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light once again swept in swiftly, covering Medicine Valley.

In the blink of an eye, it had rushed behind Yang Kai, passing over that narrow spatial rift and surged forward like a mad horse.
