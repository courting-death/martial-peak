## Chapter 1 — The Sweeper

It was just before dawn when Yang Kai woke; after a quick wash he picked up the broom leaning in the corner and stepped out of his solitary little room.

He stretched at the doorway, cast a glance at the pale strip of dawn whitening the horizon, closed his eyes to savor a brief moment of calm, then opened them and set the broom in motion, bending to sweep dust and fallen leaves from the ground.

He wore a plain, clean cyan robe whose mature, unadorned hue made the youth appear a few years older. Yang Kai held his back as straight as a javelin; even while doing the lowliest work his expression remained meticulous. His movements were steady—his hands gripped the broom without exerting much force, his body scarcely swayed, and with nothing more than the rotation of his wrists the broom obeyed as if it were an extension of his arm. The dust and debris on the ground seemed to stir and follow along, as if by magic they had sprouted two legs.

Yang Kai was a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. He had entered the Sect three years ago to cultivate, yet even now had only reached the Third Stage of Body Tempering Realm. His fellow disciples who had entered with him had long since surpassed that stage, seized opportunities, become disciples under masters and risen to prominence; he could only watch with envy.

Three years and only the Third Stage of Body Tempering—such talent could not be called merely ordinary; it was, in truth, supremely mediocre.

With no other choice, Yang Kai had taken on the sect’s sweeping work to sustain himself while he continued to cultivate.

Lingxiao Pavilion was a peculiar sect, peculiar chiefly for the brutality of the competition among its disciples. In this sect the capable rose, the incapable were discarded; the law of the jungle was practiced to its fullest.

Other Sects might still have comradeship or bonds among disciples, but there was none of that in Lingxiao Pavilion. If you wanted to climb, you had to step on the shoulders of those so-called Senior Brothers and walk over their blood—only then did you have a right to advance.

Lingxiao Pavilion was strict and renowned throughout the Great Han Dynasty; it might not be a supreme Grand Sect, but the savagery of its disciples’ struggles was unmatched. Because of this, the disciples were each fierce in their bearing, and few dared to provoke them on the roads.

Lingxiao Pavilion had a rule: any disciple under fourteen, regardless of background, entered a three-year trial period upon joining. During those three years the Sect provided food, lodging, and clothing; the disciple need only focus on cultivation. If one could break through the Body Tempering Stage within those three years, one qualified to become a Personal Disciple under a Sect master and receive proper instruction. Of course one could refuse to take a master and continue alone, but the path of cultivation with a good teacher was fundamentally different from unguided trial-and-error. In that sense, the Pavilion’s rule offered a measure of freedom.

Those who failed to break through the Body Tempering Stage within three years either left the Sect or were demoted to Trial Disciple.

Trial Disciple—that was Yang Kai’s present status, and a humiliation within Lingxiao Pavilion.

Unlike Ordinary Disciples, Trial Disciples endured far harsher conditions; having fallen to that level, they were left to fend for food, clothing, and housing themselves. The Sect would no longer waste a single cultivation resource on them. Once demoted to Trial Disciple, a person’s prospects were essentially closed unless their strength rose dramatically in a short time and the Sect deemed them worth investing in.

Lingxiao Pavilion had three thousand disciples, yet how many Trial Disciples were there? No more than the fingers on both hands. Yang Kai counted himself lucky to be one of them.

To survive as a Trial Disciple was nearly impossible. Take Yang Kai’s little hut for example—it was built plank by plank by himself; the roof had several holes that he had no time to fix, and when it rained the water would pool inside. His clothes were self-bought, his food self-procured; everything was his own responsibility.

Even the hut’s location was the most remote and neglected corner of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Such wretched treatment was hard for most to bear, which explained why there were so few Trial Disciples. Typically those who failed the trial and could not break through the Body Tempering Stage chose to leave Lingxiao Pavilion—but Yang Kai had remained.

He had already been kicked out once before; how could he allow it to happen again?

A few months after being demoted to Trial Disciple, Yang Kai took on the sweeping work within the Sect to keep himself alive.

In a sense Yang Kai was both a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion and its sweeper. But even the sweeping could not always sustain his meals; he went hungry some days and barely ate on others, with no one to care if he caught a cold. His life was bleak and solitary. Even so, he never considered quitting—one lived only a few decades, and having chosen this path he would see it through; turning back halfway was not the way of a man.

Yang Kai possessed a tenacious stubbornness—he would not turn back until he had smashed into a wall.

The dawn brightened, and after sweeping for a while Yang Kai left the path spotless, every speck of dust and debris cleared away.

Sweeping was not particularly taxing, but having worked hard from dawn on an empty stomach Yang Kai was bathed in a cold sweat—this had nothing to do with strength; it was simply his poor constitution.

With two out of three meals missed, anyone living in Yang Kai’s circumstances would have poor health.

A group of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples gradually gathered around him. They had all risen early, not to cultivate but to crowd around Yang Kai; many watched him with keen interest, and some looked on greedily, as if Yang Kai were a completely naked beauty—a highly desirable prize.

Among the gathered disciples a tense, competitive air spread; they watched one another warily, each wearing a sour expression.

Someone in the crowd could not help but sympathize, speaking softly, “This many people—this is a bit much, isn’t it?”

Immediately someone shot back, “If you think it’s too crowded you can leave. No one’s stopping you from going.”

The single retort silenced the speaker. Everyone knew why they had gathered and why they were eying Yang Kai; they were waiting for that moment. The time limit was nearly up—leaving now would be a waste. If someone could seize the first chance, today would be another gain.

Yang Kai, of course, was aware of the surrounding commotion, yet his expression never changed. He had to endure this scene every five days—six times a month—so there was nothing to make a fuss about. Besides, the crowd seemed a bit thinner than usual; perhaps not everyone had arrived.

So he continued sweeping, ignoring those around him and moving along as he worked.

As time passed the number of onlookers swelled; roughly thirty or forty people now stood there.

Yang Kai suddenly stopped and sat down in the middle of the road, taking a slow breath to recover the energy he had expended in the early morning.

At once the gathered disciples closed in and formed a ring around him, and the competitive atmosphere surged to a new pitch as if even the air had ceased to move.

None of them looked kindly on another, yet every face watched Yang Kai with intense expectation.

To someone unaware of the situation, the scene might suggest the man at the center was an incomparable expert—otherwise why would so many people move against him? In fact, Yang Kai was merely a Trial Disciple at the Third Stage of Body Tempering; every person present was stronger than he.

“Yang Kai, don’t bother trying,” someone sneered. “When the time comes just beg us to knock you flat and save everyone’s time, won’t you?”

What was the point of a mere Third Stage of Body Tempering getting up again? They were going to lose anyway—better to end it quickly than drag it out.

“Yeah, yeah, Yang Kai, at least consider our feelings,” another chimed in. “We’re not you; we have to get back to cultivating after this.”

The implication was clear: Yang Kai ought to be quickly defeated, and merely regaining his strength now was an insult.

Yang Kai paid them no mind, sitting as serenely as a monk in meditation.

Time drifted on, then suddenly a clear, hollow bell pealed—the morning bell of Lingxiao Pavilion. The sound entered everyone’s ears and the gathered disciples all started, their spirits lifted.

The bell tolled nine times, the eastern sun rose, and another day began.

Breathes held, the onlookers stared hungrily at the man in the center. Yang Kai rose slowly, broom in hand, and cast a faint glance around the circle of people.

“Pick me, Senior Brother Yang!” someone called loudly. “I’ll be gentle—promise I won’t hurt you!”

“Bullshit! Pick me and I’ll give you a good one; one punch and it’s over. I won’t waste everyone’s time.”

“Pick me—”

“Pick me—”

The place was a chaotic din, like vegetable sellers hawking the freshness of their produce in the market, each one boasting they were the best.

“Yang Kai, don’t break your own rule!” someone reminded.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and tossed the broom into the air. Dozens of eyes turned up to follow it, full of eager expectation as each silently prayed, “Choose me, choose me.”

Time seemed to slow. The broom spun a few times in midair, then fell, bounced on the ground, and came to rest.

The head of the broom pointed toward a burly youth in the crowd.

A chorus of disappointment and resentment rose, full of grievance. The burly youth, however, laughed and stepped forward from the crowd, cupped his fists, and addressed the others with a grin: “Fellow Senior Brothers, I will take this match today. I hope you won’t mind.”

“Damn, rotten luck!” someone muttered with envy.

“How does it never pick me? I come every five days—been here a whole month—Yang Kai, you’re doing this on purpose, right?”

“Don’t mention it. I’ve been coming for three months and never once got picked!”

“Senior Brother, you’ve got it worse than I do.”

“Not so bad—sit back and enjoy the show.” Two brothers exchanged a look and smiled knowingly.

The crowd dispersed, leaving only Yang Kai and the burly youth facing one another.

“Trial Disciple Yang Kai—Third Stage of Body Tempering!” Yang Kai announced, fixing his gaze on his opponent.

“Ordinary Disciple Zhou Dingjun—Fifth Stage of Body Tempering!” the burly youth declared his name.

The disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion were arranged in ranks: from the bottom up they were Trial Disciple, Ordinary Disciple, Personal Disciple, Elite Disciple, and Core Disciple. Zhou Dingjun’s claim to be an Ordinary Disciple meant he had not yet been accepted as a Personal Disciple under a master; breaking through the Body Tempering Stage and becoming a Personal Disciple brought one into the next tier. Above that, Elite Disciples were the outstanding few selected from the Personal Disciples.

The Core Disciples were the hope of the Pavilion’s next generation—those whom the Sect treated as future successors.

The cold, hierarchical system of ranks may have seemed heartless, but it well spurred the young to valor and competition; it was the foundation on which Lingxiao Pavilion’s brutality rested.

The deeper reason so many were jostling for Yang Kai, however, was another of Lingxiao Pavilion’s rules—the rule of challenges.
