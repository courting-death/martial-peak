## Chapter 1 – The Sweeper Boy

Gray dawn had barely broken when Yang Kai awoke. After a quick wash, he picked up the broom in the corner and stepped out of his lonely little hut.

At the doorway he stretched, glanced at the faint fish-belly white on the horizon, then closed his eyes to savor a moment of peace. Opening them again, he began to sweep, head down, clearing dust and fallen leaves from the ground.

His plain blue robe was neat and clean; the subdued color made the youth seem several years older. Yang Kai’s back was straight as a spear. Even while doing the lowest task, his expression remained meticulous. His movements were steady; his hands applied little force, and his body barely moved. With only a twist of his wrists, the broom obeyed like an extension of his arm. As he advanced, dust and debris flowed aside as though sprouting legs of their own.

Yang Kai was a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Three years ago he had entered the Sect to cultivate, yet even now he was only at the Body Tempering – Third Stage. The brothers who entered with him had long surpassed this realm, each finding fortune and taking seats under powerful elders, soaring ahead. He could only gaze from afar in frustration.

Three years and still Third Stage—such aptitude could no longer be called ordinary; it was painfully mediocre.

With no other recourse, Yang Kai had accepted sweeping duties within the Sect, eking out a living while continuing his hard cultivation.

Lingxiao Pavilion was a peculiar sect, its peculiarity lying in the cruelty of disciple competition. Here, the capable rose and the incapable were cast out; the law of the jungle was displayed to perfection.

Other sects might still speak of brotherhood; Lingxiao Pavilion did not. If one wished to climb, one stepped on a fellow disciple’s shoulders—treading through their blood to qualify.

Strict rules had made the Pavilion famous across the Han Dynasty. Though not a top-tier power, its internal rivalries were unmatched, forging disciples fierce and wild; few dared provoke them in the wider world.

The Pavilion decreed that any disciple under fourteen entered a three-year Trial Period. During those three years the Sect provided food, clothing, and shelter; the disciple had only to focus on cultivation. Break through Body Tempering within that time, and one could apprentice under a master; decline a master and one might self-study, but the difference was vast. By this rule the Pavilion was, in a sense, generous.

Those who failed, however, either left the Sect or were demoted to Trial Disciple.

That was Yang Kai’s fate—and the Sect’s shame.

Trial Disciples faced harsher lives than even Outer Disciples. From that point on they bore all costs themselves; the Sect would spare no more resources. Demotion meant near-certain obscurity, unless one improved rapidly enough to prove worth another investment.

Of Lingxiao Pavilion’s three thousand disciples, fewer than ten were Trial Disciples. Yang Kai was unlucky—or stubborn—enough to be among them.

Living as a Trial Disciple was like climbing to heaven. His hut, pieced together plank by plank, leaked through holes he lacked time to mend; rain pooled on the floor. Clothes were self-bought, food self-prepared—everything self-supplied.

The hut itself stood in the Pavilion’s remotest, most neglected corner.

Such misery would break most people. That was why so few Trial Disciples remained; anyone who failed the Trial Period usually chose exile. Yet Yang Kai stayed.

Expelled once already, he refused to face it again.

Demoted months ago, he had taken sweeping work to live. Thus he was both Trial Disciple and Pavilion sweeper. Even so, the job could not guarantee meals; hunger and cold were everyday companions. Still, Yang Kai never wavered. Life was short: having chosen this road, he would walk it to the end. Quitting halfway was not a man’s way.

He possessed an unyielding resilience—the kind that never turned back until smashing through a wall.

As daylight grew, Yang Kai’s broom left every path spotless.

Though sweeping cost little strength, working from dawn without food left him soaked in sweat—due not to cultivation but poor health. Two missed meals of three would weaken anyone.

More disciples soon gathered. They rose early not to cultivate but to encircle Yang Kai, eyes bright with interest—some even greedy, as though he were a fragrant delicacy.

Tension spread; each disciple watched the others warily.

“Isn’t this too many people?” someone muttered.

“Then leave. No one asked you to stay,” another snapped.

Everyone knew why they were here: waiting for the moment to come. The time limit was almost up; leaving now would be foolish. First pick meant easy profit.

Yang Kai knew the commotion but his expression never changed. Every five days he faced such a scene—six times a month. Today’s crowd was even smaller than usual; some had yet to arrive.

So he kept sweeping, ignoring them, step after step.

Numbers grew—three or four dozen at least.

Suddenly Yang Kai stopped, sat cross-legged in the road, and drew a slow breath to recover the stamina spent since dawn.

Instantly the onlookers spread out, enclosing him in a tight ring. Competition thickened till even the air seemed to freeze.

They glared at one another, yet all fixed hopeful eyes on Yang Kai.

To an outsider it might look like a grand expert surrounded by foes, but Yang Kai was only Body Tempering Third Stage; everyone present outmatched him.

“Yang Kai, quit pretending,” a disciple sneered. “Just lie down and let us beat you. Saves time, right?”

“Yeah,” another chimed in. “We’ve training to do after this.”

They spoke as though he owed them an easy victory.

Yang Kai ignored them, calm as a meditating monk.

Time passed.

A deep, resonant bell rang—the Pavilion’s morning bell. All disciples stiffened.

Nine chimes.  
The sun broke the horizon.  
A new day began.

Breaths stilled. Yang Kai stood, broom in hand, sweeping his gaze around.

“Pick me, Brother Yang!” someone yelled. “I’ll be gentle—no pain!”

“Nonsense! Pick me—one punch, done. Won’t waste anyone’s time!”

“Pick me!”  
“Pick me!”

The ring turned into a noisy marketplace.

“Yang Kai, don’t break your own rule!” a voice warned.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and tossed the broom skyward. Dozens of eyes followed its flight, hearts praying: *Pick me, pick me…*

Time slowed.  
The broom spun, fell, bounced, and settled—its bristles pointing at a burly youth.

Groans of regret rose. The chosen youth laughed, stepping forward with a fist salute.

“Brothers, today’s bout is mine. Forgive me.”

“Damn, dog-shit luck!” someone cursed.

“I’ve come every five days for a month and never get picked!”

“Try three months!”

The crowd dispersed, leaving Yang Kai and the youth facing each other.

“Trial Disciple Yang Kai, Body Tempering Third Stage,” Yang Kai announced.

“Outer Disciple Zhou Dingjun, Body Tempering Fifth Stage,” the youth replied.

Disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion ranked—bottom to top—as Trial, Outer, Personal, Elite, and Core. Zhou Dingjun, an Outer Disciple, had yet to be accepted by a master. Break through Body Tempering and he might become a Personal Disciple; the best among them became Elite. Core Disciples were the Pavilion’s hope—their future successors.

The rigid hierarchy might seem heartless, yet it ignited young blood and rivalry. It was the root of the Pavilion’s harsh system.

As for why so many vied to face Yang Kai—that was because of another rule: the Challenge System.
