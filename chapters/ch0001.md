## Chapter 1 — The Sweeper

Before dawn had fully broken, Yang Kai awoke; after a quick wash he took the broom leaning against the corner of his room and stepped out of his solitary hut.

He stretched at the doorway, glanced at the thin wash of dawn along the horizon, closed his eyes and savored a moment of peace, then opened them and set the broom in motion, lowering his head to clear the dust and fallen leaves from the ground.

His simple, clean robe was a muted green; its weathered, plain hue made the youth appear a few years older. Yang Kai held himself as straight as a javelin—though he tended the lowest work, his expression betrayed nothing unseemly. His movements were steady; his hands gripping the broom used little force, his body hardly swayed. With only the flick of his wrists, the broom obeyed him as if it were an extension of his arm, sweeping here and there; as he walked the accumulated dust and debris on the ground seemed to stir and follow, as if they had suddenly sprouted legs.

Yang Kai was a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion; he had entered the Sect three years ago to begin cultivation, yet even now had only advanced to the Third Stage of Body Tempering. The senior brothers who had entered with him long ago surpassed that level, each given chances to serve under the Sect’s masters and rise, while he could only look on in envy.

Three years and only Third Stage of Body Tempering—such a talent could not be described as merely average; it was truly abjectly mediocre.

With no choice, Yang Kai had taken a job sweeping within the Sect, maintaining his livelihood while grinding away at his cultivation.

Lingxiao Pavilion was a peculiar Sect, its peculiarity lying in the brutality of the competition among its disciples. Within this Sect, the capable rose, the incapable were culled; the law of the jungle—survival of the fittest—was practiced to the fullest.

Other Sects might preserve comradeship among brethren, but not in Lingxiao Pavilion. To climb, one had to tread upon the shoulders of those called senior brothers and juniors, to cross their blood—only then would one earn the right to ascend.

Lingxiao Pavilion’s strictness was renowned throughout the Great Han Dynasty; it was not the greatest of the great Sects, but the ferocity of its internal strife was unmatched. For that reason, its disciples were all fierce in martial bearing, and few dared provoke them when they travelled the Martial World.

Lingxiao Pavilion had a rule: disciples under fourteen, no matter who they were, were considered on trial for three years from their entry. During these three years their food, lodging, and clothing were provided by the Sect; disciples needed only to cultivate. If one broke through the Body Tempering Stage within those three years, one earned the right to become a Personal Disciple under a master in the Sect for instruction. Of course, one could also decline apprenticeship and cultivate alone, but self-study and proper mentorship were entirely different paths. In a sense, this rule was somewhat lenient.

Those who failed to break through the Body Tempering Stage within three years either left the Sect or were demoted to Trial Disciple.

Trial Disciple—that was Yang Kai’s current status, and a disgrace in Lingxiao Pavilion!

Unlike Ordinary Disciples, Trial Disciples endured harsher conditions: at that point one must fend for one’s own food, clothing, and lodging; the Sect would no longer waste any cultivation resources on you. Once demoted to Trial Disciple, one’s prospects were almost extinguished for life, unless one could rapidly increase in strength and convince the Sect one was worth investing in.

Lingxiao Pavilion had three thousand disciples; how many Trial Disciples were there? Only a handful—counted on less than two hands. Yang Kai had the misfortune of becoming one of them.

To survive as a Trial Disciple in Lingxiao Pavilion was nearly impossible. Take the small hut Yang Kai lived in: he had built it plank by plank himself; several holes in its roof lay unrepaired for lack of time, so when it rained the water pooled inside and could not be drained. His clothes he’d bought himself; his food he prepared himself—everything was his responsibility.

Even the hut’s location was in the most remote, most neglected area of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Such miserable treatment was difficult for most to endure, which explained why so few remained Trial Disciples in Lingxiao Pavilion; most who failed to break through the Body Tempering Stage during the trial period chose to leave the Pavilion—yet Yang Kai had stayed.

He had already once been swept out of the door; how could he allow it to happen again?

A few months after being demoted to Trial Disciple, Yang Kai had taken the sweeping job within the Sect to sustain himself.

So Yang Kai was both a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion and the Pavilion’s sweeper. Still, the sweeping job sometimes could not keep his belly full; he often went from hunger to satiety and back, suffered from colds with no one to care, his days lonely and wretched. Even so, Yang Kai did not back down—life was but a few decades, and having chosen this path he would see it through; to give up halfway was not befitting of a man.

Yang Kai possessed a stubborn resilience—he would not turn back until he struck the southern wall.

The day brightened gradually. After sweeping for a while, Yang Kai left the path immaculate, every scrap of dust cleared.

Sweeping required little strength, but having worked like this from early morning with no food or drink, Yang Kai broke into a weak sweat; this had nothing to do with cultivation, but with his poor constitution.

Of the three daily meals, two went hungry; anyone living in Yang Kai’s conditions would turn out weak.

Gradually a cluster of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples gathered around him. These lads had risen early not to cultivate but to circle Yang Kai; many appraised him with keen interest, and some cast greedy looks as if Yang Kai were a naked beauty, a fragrant delicacy.

A tense competitive atmosphere spread among those surrounding Yang Kai; they watched one another warily, each face sour.

Someone in the crowd, unable to bear it, murmured pityingly, “So many—this is a bit much.”

Another replied, “If you think it’s too many, leave—no one’s stopping you.”

The retort silenced the pitying one. Everyone knew why they were gathered, why all eyes were on Yang Kai; they were waiting for that moment to come. The time limit was about to arrive; to leave now would be a waste. If one could seize the first chance, today would be another gain.

Yang Kai was of course aware of the surrounding commotion, yet his expression never changed. He faced this scene every five days—six times a month—so it no longer surprised him, and judging by the crowd he noted it seemed a little thin today, perhaps not everyone had arrived.

So he kept sweeping, paying the onlookers no mind as he walked and swept.

As time passed, more people pressed in around him; by rough count at least thirty or forty had gathered.

Yang Kai suddenly stopped and sat down right in the middle of the path, inhaling slowly to recover the strength he had spent earlier.

At once the noisy crowd fell back and enclosed him, forming a tight ring; the tense competitive air rose to a new pitch, as if the very air had stopped moving.

No one liked one another, yet all looked at Yang Kai with eager expectation.

A stranger seeing this might think the youth at the center was a supreme expert to be surrounded by so many, but Yang Kai was only a Third Stage of Body Tempering Trial Disciple—every person present was stronger than him.

“Yang Kai, don’t bother resisting,” someone sneered. “Just call out and let us knock you flat; everyone saves time that way, right?”

A mere Third Stage of Body Tempering—what was the point of recovery? Since he was destined to lose anyway, why would he go on prolonging the agony?

“Exactly—Yang Kai, have some consideration for your senior brothers. We’re not like you; after this scrap we still need to go cultivate.”

The remark carried as if Yang Kai owed them a quick defeat, as though regaining his strength was an affront.

Yang Kai ignored them, sitting as calmly as a meditating monk.

Time slipped by, and suddenly a clear, hollow bell rang—the morning bell of Lingxiao Pavilion—its sound entering everyone’s ears and jolting the gathered disciples.

The bell tolled nine times; the eastern sun rose—another day had begun.

The crowd’s breathing fell still. They stared hungrily at the young man in the middle. Yang Kai rose slowly, lifting his broom, and cast a faint glance at the ring of people around him.

“Choose me, Senior Brother Yang!” someone shouted, “I strike lightly—I promise it won’t hurt!”

“Nonsense! Choose me; I’ll give you a proper one. One punch and it’s over—no time wasted.”

“Choose me…”

“Choose me…”

The scene burst into clamour, like vegetable sellers at a market hawking whose produce was freshest.

“Yang Kai, don’t break the rules you set!” a voice reminded.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, tossed the broom up into the air, and dozens of eyes turned skyward, all eager for the broom’s fall, hearts praying, “Choose me, choose me!”

Time seemed to slow. The broom spun a few times in midair, then fell, bounced, and came to rest.

The broom’s head pointed at a burly youth in the crowd.

A chorus of disappointment rose, full of grievance and reluctance. The burly youth laughed, stepped from the crowd, cupped his fist and bowed to the others with a grin: “Senior brothers, this bout is mine today. Please do not take offense.”

“Damn, bloody luck!” someone muttered with jealousy.

“Why doesn’t it ever pick me? I come every five days—been a whole month—Yang Kai, you’re doing this on purpose, right?”

“Don’t mention it—I’ve been coming three months and haven’t been picked once!”

“Senior Brother, you’ve got it worse than I do.”

“Not worse; better to watch and see,” the two exchanged a look and smiled in mutual understanding.

The crowd dispersed, leaving only Yang Kai and the hulking youth facing one another.

“Trial Disciple Yang Kai, Third Stage of Body Tempering,” Yang Kai announced as he eyed his opponent.

“Ordinary Disciple Zhou Dingjun, Fifth Stage of Body Tempering!” the burly youth declared his name.

Lingxiao Pavilion’s disciples were ranked: from lowest to highest, Trial Disciple, Ordinary Disciple, Personal Disciple, Elite Disciple, and Core Disciple. Zhou Dingjun saying he was an Ordinary Disciple meant he had not yet found a master in the Sect to take him as a Personal Disciple. Breaking through the Body Tempering Stage and gaining a master’s favor would elevate one to Personal Disciple. Above that were Elite Disciples, outstanding individuals selected from Personal Disciples.

Core Disciples were Lingxiao Pavilion’s hope for the next generation, treated as future successors by the Sect.

The strict hierarchy of disciples seemed cold, but it incited youthful blood and competitive spirit; this was the foundation of Lingxiao Pavilion’s ruthless system.

The real reason so many clamored over Yang Kai, however, was another of Lingxiao Pavilion’s rules—the rule of challenge.
