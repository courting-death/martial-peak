## Chapter 1 — The Sweeper Boy

At the break of dawn, Yang Kai was already awake. After a brief wash-up, he picked up a broom from the corner of the wall and stepped out of his solitary hut.

Standing at the door, he stretched lazily and glanced at the faint fish-belly white light appearing on the horizon. Closing his eyes, he savored a moment of tranquility before opening them again. Then, he began swinging the broom, bending over to sweep away the dust and fallen leaves on the ground.

Clad in simple and clean azure robes, the plain dull color made the youth look several years older. Yang Kai’s back was as straight as a spear, and even while performing the most menial chores, his expression remained solemn and meticulous. His movements were steady and calm; the hands holding the broom did not exert much force, and his body hardly swayed. With only the rotation of his wrists, the broom became like an extension of his arms, moving back and forth smoothly. As he walked, the accumulated dust and debris on the ground seemed to come alive, as if sprouting legs of their own.

Yang Kai was a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. He had entered the sect three years ago to begin cultivation, but even now, he had only reached the Third Stage of Body Tempering Realm. His fellow Senior Brothers and Junior Brothers who had started together had long since surpassed this stage. They had all received fortunate opportunities to study under powerful masters within the sect and soared to prominence. He could only look on in despair.

Three years and only the Third Stage of Body Tempering—that sort of talent could not be described as merely average; it was mediocre to an extreme.

With no other choice, Yang Kai had taken on the menial task of sweeping the sect in order to support himself while continuing his cultivation in hardship.

Lingxiao Pavilion was a rather unique sect, its uniqueness manifesting in the brutal competition among its disciples. In this sect, the capable rose to power, and the incapable were eliminated. The law of the jungle was implemented to its fullest degree within Lingxiao Pavilion.

Other sects might have some bonds of camaraderie and brotherhood among disciples, but none existed within Lingxiao Pavilion. To climb higher, one had to step on the shoulders of so-called Senior Brothers and Junior Brothers and trample their blood. Only then could one earn the right to advance.

Lingxiao Pavilion’s strict discipline was renowned throughout the Great Han Dynasty. Although not the greatest sect, its disciple conflicts were unmatched in ferocity. Because of this, every disciple was fierce in cultivation and demeanor, and few dared provoke them when they traveled the martial world.

There was one rule in Lingxiao Pavilion: disciples under fourteen years old, regardless of status, underwent a three-year trial period from entry. During this period, the sect took care of their food, clothing, and accommodation, and the disciples only needed to focus on cultivation. If a disciple could break through the Body Tempering Stage within three years, they qualified to apprentice under an elder master, gaining proper guidance. Of course, they could still choose to cultivate alone, but the difference between having a good teacher and relying on oneself was vast. In some respects, this rule afforded disciples more freedom.

Those who failed to break through Body Tempering within the three years either left the sect or were demoted to Trial Disciple.

Trial Disciple—this was what Yang Kai was now. It was a disgrace within Lingxiao Pavilion!

Unlike for Ordinary Disciples, the survival environment for Trial Disciples was harsher. Once demoted, they had to fend for themselves in all aspects of life—food, clothing, shelter—with no more resources from the sect. Being a Trial Disciple was basically a sentence to lifelong obscurity unless one drastically improved their strength in a short time and proved worthy of reinvestment by the sect.

Of Lingxiao Pavilion’s three thousand disciples, fewer than ten were Trial Disciples. Yang Kai was unlucky—or stubborn—enough to be among them.

For a Trial Disciple, surviving within Lingxiao Pavilion was akin to scaling heaven. Take the hut where Yang Kai lived, for example: every single piece of wood had been gathered and nailed together by himself. Holes in the roof remained unrepaired, and when the rain came, water drenched inside with no way to drain. His clothes were bought by himself; his food was obtained by himself—everything was his responsibility.

Even the hut was located in the most remote, neglected corner of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Such treatment was unbearable for most, which explained the scarcity of Trial Disciples. Ordinarily, those who failed to break through Body Tempering after the trial period would choose to leave the sect, but Yang Kai remained.

He had already been cast out once—how could he allow it to happen again?

After being demoted to Trial Disciple months ago, Yang Kai took on sweeping duties within the sect to make ends meet.

He was effectively both a Trial Disciple and the sect’s sweeper. But even this humble job sometimes could not guarantee enough food, and he often experienced days of feast and famine, facing wind and cold, neglected by all. Life was truly harsh and lonely. Despite all this, Yang Kai had never thought of retreating. Life was short: having chosen this road, he would walk it to the end. Quitting halfway was not a man’s way.

He possessed an unyielding resilience—the kind that never turned back until smashing through a wall.

The morning light grew stronger, and after some sweeping, the place along his path was immaculate—dust and debris all cleared.

Sweeping wasn’t physically demanding, but after moving this long on an empty stomach, Yang Kai was sweating from exhaustion. This had nothing to do with strength but was entirely because of his poor constitution.

With two out of every three meals missed, anyone in Yang Kai’s living conditions would be weak.

Slowly, some Lingxiao Pavilion disciples began to gather around him. Each had gotten up early, yet instead of training, they circled him curiously. Many looked him over with evident interest; some gazes even held greed, as if Yang Kai were a scantily clad beauty exuding irresistible fragrance.

Between the gathered Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, a tension of fierce competition simmered, with wary glances exchanged. Each looked upon his Senior Brothers and Junior Brothers with ill intent.

Among them, one voiced pity softly, “So many people, isn’t this a bit too much?”

Immediately someone retorted, “If you think there are too many, you can leave; no one is forcing you to stay.”

That single retort silenced the pitying voice. Everyone understood why they were gathered here, and why they watched Yang Kai so closely. The moment they awaited was near. The deadline was almost up. Leaving now would be a waste. First pick meant easy profit.

Yang Kai sensed the surrounding activity but showed no change in expression. He endured this scene once every five days, six times a month—nothing worth fussing over. Moreover, the current crowd was somewhat smaller than usual—likely because not all had arrived yet.

He continued sweeping, ignoring those around him, sweeping as he walked.

As time passed, the crowd swelled to around thirty or forty.

Yang Kai suddenly stopped and sat down in the middle of the road, slowly drawing a deep breath to restore his stamina spent since dawn.

Seeing this, those surrounding him immediately parted and formed a tight circle around him. The already tense competitive atmosphere surged to a new level, as if even the very air ceased to move.

Nobody liked each other, yet all stared at Yang Kai with intense expectation.

An uninformed observer might think the one captured in the center was a formidable master, given the number of people surrounding him. But in reality, Yang Kai was merely a Third Stage Body Tempering Trial Disciple, and every person present was stronger than him.

“Yang Kai, don’t waste your breath. Just call out whose fist you want to receive and be done with it. It’ll save us all some time,” someone sneered contemptuously.

Just a Third Stage in Body Tempering—why bother recovering? It was all a loss anyway; better to finish quickly than to cling desperately.

“Yeah, yeah, Yang Kai, have some consideration for your Senior Brothers, will you? Unlike you, we need to train after this fight,” another said.

Those words were as if Yang Kai should be quickly defeated, and that his recovering energy was a sign of disrespect.

Yang Kai ignored them completely, sitting still like a meditating monk.

Time passed until suddenly, a resonant, spacious bell chimed. It was the morning bell of Lingxiao Pavilion, its sound entering everyone’s ears, causing the gathered disciples to sharpen their spirits.

The bell tolled nine times as the eastern sun rose—another new day had begun.

The crowd’s breaths quietly stilled, all eyes eagerly fixed on the trapped Yang Kai in the center. Yang Kai slowly rose, holding his broom, and glanced calmly at the circle around him.

“Senior Brother Yang Kai! Pick me!” someone shouted loudly. “I’m gentle, I promise to hit you without causing pain!”

“Bullshit! Pick me! I’ll end it with a single punch, won’t waste anyone’s time,” another called out.

“Pick me…”

“Pick me…”

The scene erupted into chaotic clamor, like vegetable vendors in a market competing to sell the freshest produce.

“Yang Kai! Don’t mess with the rules you set!” someone reminded.

Yang Kai chuckled softly and casually tossed his broom into the air. Dozens of eyes followed the broom’s flight, their faces full of anticipation, praying: “Pick me, pick me!”

Time seemed to slow down. The broom twirled several times midair before falling and bouncing on the ground, coming to rest pointed at a burly teenager in the crowd.

A chorus of disappointed sighs arose, full of grievance and unwillingness. Yet the burly youth laughed heartily as he stepped forward and cupped his fists toward the others, smiling broadly.

“Fellow Senior and Junior Brothers, I shall take this battle today. Please forgive me if I offend any of you.”

“Damn, what rotten luck!” someone muttered enviously.

“Why does it never pick me? I come every five days, for a full month now, Yang Kai, you’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?”

“Don’t mention it—I’ve been here three months without being chosen once!”

“Senior Brother, you’re worse off than me.”

“Not worse, just here for the show.” The two Senior Brothers exchanged knowing smiles.

As the others dispersed, only Yang Kai and the burly youth remained facing each other.

“Trial Disciple Yang Kai, Third Stage of Body Tempering!” Yang Kai said, looking at him.

“Ordinary Disciple Zhou Dingjun, Fifth Stage of Body Tempering!” The burly youth introduced himself.

Disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion were divided into hierarchical levels: from lowest to highest, Trial Disciple, Ordinary Disciple, Personal Disciple, Elite Disciple, and Core Disciple. Zhou Dingjun was an Ordinary Disciple, meaning he had not yet apprenticed under a master in the sect and lacked refined guidance. Breaking through Body Tempering and becoming a Personal Disciple under a master was the next step. Above Personal Disciples stood Elite Disciples—outstanding talents selected from Personal Disciples. Core Disciples were the future hope of Lingxiao Pavilion, treated as the sect’s heirs.

This strict disciple hierarchy, though harsh, effectively spurred the youth’s fighting spirit and competitive nature, the foundation of Lingxiao Pavilion’s brutal system.

The reason why Yang Kai was so fiercely contested was yet another rule within Lingxiao Pavilion: the challenge rule.
