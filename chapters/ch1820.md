## Chapter 1820 — Give Him a Chance

It was too late for regret; many disciples loyal to Tianmu Palace had risen from the formation, glaring angrily at the place where the youth stood.

"Who allowed you to stand up? Get back to work!" the youth snorted coldly. A surging pressure rolled off him, and the next moment all the warriors who had stood up let out muffled groans and fell back into their seats.

There had not been a single cultivator of the Saint Realm among those fighters — how could they possibly resist the youth's Saint King Realm pressure?

"It is your honor that this Young Master has chosen you; tonight you will serve this Young Master! Don't pull that face — believe it or not, I'll tear your clothes off right now!" the youth said.

The woman's delicate body trembled; her eyes instantly filled with horror and despair.

If she were truly humiliated by this youth in front of a thousand people from her sect, there would be no point in living.

At that thought the woman was filled with bitter indignation and an immediate impulse to die.

She would rather be shattered like jade than live on as a broken tile.

"If you dare kill yourself, I'll slaughter a thousand from your Tianmu Palace! This godforsaken place's Spiritual Qi is thin, yet it is not short of warriors — do you think that without your Tianmu Palace this Young Master will have no one to maintain the formation?" the youth said coldly.

"Bastard!" the woman ground out, cursing; faced with such a threat she truly did not dare act rashly.

"Ha! Keep cursing — this Young Master loves watching women make that furious face; the angrier you get, the happier I am," the youth laughed crazily.

"You devil — one day someone will come to deal with you."

"Hmph! With you trash? You lot will never have that ability," the youth sneered.

The woman said coldly, "We truly do not have that power, but someone does."

In that instant she seemed to remember something; on her frightened, furious face a trace of proud defiance appeared.

"Is that so?" the youth said, studying her with interest. "Tell me — who in this godforsaken place can deal with this Young Master? I'm very curious."

He had already scouted the Tongxuan Continent; the Spiritual Qi there was thin and cultivators' levels were generally poor. Otherwise they would not dare behave so wantonly. What they were doing now was siphoning Spiritual Qi from the Cultivation Star — a perversity against the natural way.

If they were discovered, the whole Star Domain might pursue and trap them.

"The Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!" the woman grit her teeth, her eyes brightening. "One day he will return and make you pay for everything!"

"The Nine Heavens Sacred Land?" the youth frowned and asked a black-clad man beside him, "Is there such a sect here?"

The black-clad man thought for a moment and replied, "There seems to have been. But many years ago the entire sect emptied out — nobody knows where they went; people here say they went to the Star Domain."

The youth nodded indifferently. "They went to the Star Domain — it seems the Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had some way to leave this place. But... so what? Does he think Star Domain is easy to roam? Perhaps they have already perished somewhere."

"The Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was a brilliant man who once united the human, yao and demon races — he is not someone you could fathom," the woman said with contempt.

"You seem to worship that Lord a great deal," the youth tilted his head, smiling faintly. "I want to see whether, when you are being humiliated, that so-called Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land will come to save you..."

With those words the youth suddenly swept out his hand.

A burst of force struck the woman, instantly cutting open the wide robe she wore.

The woman cried out and retreated repeatedly.

The youth's eyes glinted evilly as he stared forward. Though other garments remained beneath the robe, the woman's exquisite figure could not be fully concealed; those proud peaks rose like towering mountains, straining at the cloth. His finger twitched; licking his lips, he said, "Not bad — truly top quality. It seems this Young Master did not look wrong."

"What do you want to do?" the woman asked, panic written on her face as she watched him warily.

The youth sneered, "Since you so worship the Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, this Young Master will give you a chance — and give him a chance to play hero and save a beauty!"

A black-clad man beside him laughed loudly, "A frog in a well who thinks the sky small — this girl probably doesn't know how strong the Young Master is and merely thinks that Lord is the greatest in the world. She has no idea that such a man isn't even worthy to carry the Young Master's shoes!"

"That's right!" someone chimed in in agreement.

A smile played on the youth's face; he looked thoroughly pleased.

At that moment the youth's brow furrowed and he looked up; the next instant he shot up from his chair and stared fixedly above.

In the sky a meteor-like light fell at arrow speed, crashing into the six-pointed star formation.

Boom... the earth shook violently, the formation's light was instantly extinguished, and all those maintaining it were shoved back by a great force.

In an instant people were thrown into chaos; the scene was a complete shambles.

"Young Master, be careful!" two Origin Returning Realm experts among the black-clad men cried, their faces changing as they rushed before the youth, vigilantly watching ahead and sending out their Divine Sense to probe the newcomer's strength.

To their horror their Divine Sense received no feedback at all, as if there were no one there.

This discovery made the two Origin Returning Realm cultivators’ hearts sink, as a faint sense of foreboding arose within them.

"Who are you?" the youth shouted in fury.

They had spent great effort arranging that six-pointed star formation — it was about to bear fruit when someone destroyed it at the critical moment, and the youth was enraged.

“Heh heh…” A strange laugh echoed from the center of the formation, sending a chill down the young man’s spine. His expression darkened as he said, “Sneaking around like that — since you’re here, friend, why not give your name?”

"You already know, so why ask?" came the reply.

"Know what?" the youth frowned.

“Just a moment ago, you said you’d give me a chance to play the hero saving the beauty — well, I’ve seized that chance now…”

"A hero to save a beauty?" the youth blinked, then opened his mouth in astonishment. "You don't mean to say you're the Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, do you?"

"Ah?" even the captured woman was stunned, her beautiful eyes widening as she looked toward the center of the formation.

As the dust cleared, a figure stood there quietly, a mocking smile at his mouth as he surveyed the scene.

The woman's heart leaped and joy suddenly flooded her face.

"It actually... really is him!" she cried.

She had never met Yang Kai before, but when the human, yao and demon three races had once joined to resist the Bone Race's revival, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had then risen to fame, and Yang Kai, as its Lord, had naturally grown famous.

Yang Kai had been promising in his youth and was rumored to be handsome; many maidens dreamed of him, keeping portraits of Yang Kai in their boudoirs to gaze upon each night as they fell asleep.

One could say Yang Kai's portraits were everywhere on the Tongxuan Continent.

The woman was the daughter of Tianmu Palace's Palace Master, and many female disciples in Tianmu Palace worshipped Yang Kai; she had certainly seen his portrait.

Now the man himself stood before her, hardly differing from the portrait; she recognized him at once and an unusual light filled her eyes.

"This formation... is a bit overbearing," Yang Kai said, his Divine Sense sweeping the six-pointed star array as his brow furrowed and a cold severity crossed his face. "Elder, what do you make of it?"

He seemed to speak to the void, but the next moment a figure shrouded in black gas appeared at his side.

The apparition had come with no warning, startling the youth. He cast a puzzled, wary look at the Ghost Ancestor, while the two Origin Returning Realm men guarding him trembled like leaves, their faces drained white.

“Overbearing is putting it lightly — this technique is even more sinister than the arts I’ve cultivated! Hmph, these people must be siphoning the Spiritual Qi of your homeland to refine this thing.” Ghost Ancestor reached out his hand, and a six-sided crystal from the center of the formation flew into his grasp.

"The Spiritual Qi contained within is very rich. If one used it for cultivation it would be of great benefit — tsk, it can be absorbed directly without conversion. A fine thing," the Ghost Ancestor remarked, tossing the hexagonal crystal to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, frowned as he examined it, then nodded. "It can indeed be absorbed directly."

He silently measured the energy stored in the crystal and estimated that as few as ten such crystals would be enough to allow a Saint King Realm cultivator to advance a Stage.

The conclusion puzzled Yang Kai as well.

Cultivators had to slash through thorns and tread a path of hardship, yet these hexagonal crystals clearly provided a shortcut.

With a sufficient quantity of such crystals one could rapidly raise a cultivator's strength — provided their comprehension of the Martial Dao could keep up.

"How dare you destroy my Spirit-Devouring Array and steal my Spirit-Devouring Crystal?" the youth thundered in fury.

Before he could finish, an Origin Returning Realm cultivator quickly clapped a hand over his mouth.

The youth grew even angrier and was about to scold, but that Origin Returning Realm man broke into a cold sweat and whispered, "Young Master, these two are unfathomable — do not offend them!"

"Unfathomable?" the youth paused, suddenly realizing the gravity of the situation. He had failed to gauge Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor and had not taken them seriously, after all he still had two Origin Returning Realm men at his side.

But now, seeing both of those Origin Returning Realm men go pale, he understood at once that Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor were not to be trifled with.

He could not help but break out in a cold sweat.
