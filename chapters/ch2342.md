## Chapter 2342 — Die Early, Reincarnate Early

Yang Kai's expression was grave as he also stepped forward, withstanding the overwhelming force of Imperial Might. He said in a deep voice, "Liu Yan, take them into the secret realm. I'll deal with this old man!"

Qiu Ze was merely a newly advanced Emperor, his cultivation not yet stabilized. Yang Kai truly did not fear him.

Earlier, in the Chiyue Sect's secret realm, he had even encountered a Corpse Puppet at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm and fought a fierce battle with it. Though he had used all his trump cards and had the Incarnation's help, he had at least gained experience. How could he now fear a mere First Stage Emperor?

Now that he possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, it was the perfect opportunity to test his strength against Qiu Ze.

The surging Imperial Might was almost tangible, sweeping over them madly, making one feel as if drowning—unable even to draw a full breath.

Ye Hen and the others were already in poor condition. If Yang Kai hadn't stood before them, they would likely have fainted on the spot.

"Master, if you trust me, delay them for a while, then leave the rest to me. How about it?" Liu Yan suddenly said softly from behind.

Yang Kai was taken aback, not knowing where Liu Yan's confidence came from. Although she had just taken a blow from Qiu Ze without injury, proving the toughness of her puppet body, there were so many experts here, and Qiu Ze himself was an Emperor Realm master—not so easy to handle.

Even Yang Kai himself was not sure he could defeat them all. He had planned to capture the ringleader first—if he could kill Qiu Ze, that would be best; at the very least, he needed to seriously injure him. As long as Qiu Ze was defeated, the rest would scatter and pose no threat.

Yet Liu Yan's calm and confident tone made Yang Kai extremely curious.

He had no idea what trump card Liu Yan possessed with her puppet body, that she dared disregard so many experts.

But now was clearly not the time to ask. Yang Kai simply said lightly, "How confident are you?"

Liu Yan gave a cold smile. "One hundred percent!"

Yang Kai turned to look at her in astonishment, seeing she was not joking at all. Only then did he nod. "Good, then I'll be waiting to see."

"The time it takes to burn a stick of incense!" Liu Yan said, then suddenly sat down cross-legged, eyes tightly shut.

None of them knew what she was about to do. Ye Hen was even more anxious, constantly signaling Yang Kai to escape. Seeing this, Hua Qingsi thought for a moment, then comforted him, "Sect Master Ye, don't worry. Young Master Yang has his own plans. He won't let anything happen to you."

Yang Kai was proficient in space powers, and this was the Formation Foundation platform. Even if they were defeated, everyone could use the array to teleport into the secret realm, so there was nothing to fear.

She was instead curious about Liu Yan's actions, not knowing what she intended.

Hearing this, Ye Hen could only compromise helplessly, inwardly hoping for a miracle.

"Sister Hua, look after them. If things go wrong, activate this Space Array and enter the secret realm." After Yang Kai gave this instruction, his aura suddenly soared. Threads of clearly discernible Law Power swirled around him, and he ignored Qiu Ze's suppression as if it were nothing, slicing through it like a sharp sword.

"You do have some skill. No wonder you dare act so arrogantly!" Qiu Ze's expression turned grim as he exclaimed in surprise.

He had already advanced to the Emperor Realm and naturally knew the vast gulf between Emperor and Dao Origin Realms. After his breakthrough, his strength had increased more than tenfold. He was confident he could defeat any Dao Origin Realm cultivator in three moves.

He had thought that under his Imperial Might, no one here could move freely, that all would be at his mercy. But the moment Yang Kai moved, he realized he was wrong—there was actually a Dao Origin Realm cultivator who could break through his Imperial Might.

The Law Power swirling around the other party was also pure and mysterious, impossible to grasp.

Qiu Ze instantly realized Yang Kai was no ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Coupled with Hua Qingsi's earlier display, he was even more convinced these two must come from some great sect, possessing a foundation others lacked.

As he spoke, Qiu Ze became both angry and embarrassed. He quickly formed seals with his hands, and his Imperial Might suddenly rose to a new level.

As an Emperor Realm expert, it would be a joke to let a Dao Origin Realm cultivator like Yang Kai get close, so Qiu Ze went all out from the start.

It was immediately effective. As his seals formed, Yang Kai's body abruptly halted, his previously calm expression turning strained, his movements suddenly as slow as a crawling ghost.

At that moment, a figure suddenly shot into the sky. Luo Jin, filled with boundless rage and a twisted expression, gripped a Jade Scepter-like Secret Treasure, pouring Origin Qi into it as he shouted, "Die, brat!"

As he spoke, he swung it down hard at Yang Kai.

He had come with Qiu Ze precisely to take revenge on Yang Kai. He knew that with his own ability, he had little chance of killing Yang Kai. Back at the City Lord’s mansion, Yang Kai, at only the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, had beaten him so badly he couldn't fight back. Now that Yang Kai had advanced to the Third Stage, the gap was even wider—he was even less of a match.

If he wanted revenge, he could only rely on Qiu Ze's power.

This was undoubtedly the best opportunity. Yang Kai was suppressed by Qiu Ze's Imperial Might, unable to use even half his strength. If struck by his Secret Treasure, he would surely die.

Qiu Ze didn't care whether Yang Kai lived or died. As long as he brought the corpse back to be boiled into medicine, it was fine. So Luo Jin felt this move wouldn't offend him.

At this moment, Luo Jin attacked without hesitation, all the shame and humiliation he had suffered at Yang Kai's hands erupting at once.

With a single blow, the void collapsed. The Jade Scepter seemed to contain world-destroying power, its destructive aura rushing toward Yang Kai.

Luo Jin's smile grew even more twisted, his blood-red eyes filled with the thrill of revenge, as if he could already see Yang Kai being killed by his strike.

Even Qiu Ze cooperated with Luo Jin at that instant, secretly condensing his Imperial Might into binding force to restrain Yang Kai's movements.

Boom—

The Jade Scepter smashed down, and a black hole appeared where Yang Kai had stood, a ten-zhang-wide area left utterly empty.

Luo Jin landed, staring at the gaping, beast-like black hole that seemed to devour everything, and couldn't help but burst into wild laughter.

"Not good!" Qiu Ze suddenly shouted, his face changing. He had been binding Yang Kai with Imperial Might, but just before the Jade Scepter struck, he felt Yang Kai vanish mysteriously. He had no idea how Yang Kai disappeared—one moment of inattention, and he could no longer sense any trace of him.

"There’s a road to heaven, yet you refuse to walk it; there’s no door to hell, yet you insist on barging in!" An eerie, soul-reaping voice suddenly sounded behind Luo Jin, making his hair stand on end, his blood run cold, and even his feet cramp.

"City Lord Luo, watch out!"

"Behind you!"

Ruan Hongbo, Mu Zheng, and the others all shouted in unison, their eyes wide with terror as they stared at Luo Jin's back, as if witnessing something unimaginable.

A bead of cold sweat slid down Luo Jin's forehead. In that instant, his senses were heightened, and he clearly felt the chilling intent and murderous aura coming from behind.

Almost without hesitation, he tried to flee, but before he could move, a sharp pain pierced his chest. His whole body froze, and the surging blood and Origin Qi within him instantly solidified.

He stared in terror, lowering his head to look at his chest, only to see a broad sword tip piercing through it, the blade drenched in glaring, crimson blood.

"I spared you once before, but you failed to cherish it, City Lord Luo. In that case, die early and reincarnate early!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, twisting the Myriad Sword in his hand and channeling Origin Qi.

Luo Jin didn't even have time to scream before he exploded into a cloud of blood mist, scattering to the ground.

Luo Jin was an ungrateful wretch. Last time, Yang Kai had spared him for Luo Bing's sake, but not only did he not restrain himself, he even repaid kindness with enmity, following Qiu Ze and the others into the Chiyue Sect. Naturally, Yang Kai would show no mercy this time.

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed Luo Jin's ring and the Jade Scepter-like Secret Treasure, storing them in the Small Xuan Realm.

A cold wind blew. Yang Kai, holding the Myriad Sword, his robes fluttering, exuded murderous intent, as if no one else existed.

The sound of people sucking in cold breaths rang out. Mu Zheng, Ruan Hongbo, and the others involuntarily retreated several steps, their faces filled with shock, completely stunned.

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed Luo Jin could die so easily.

Luo Jin was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, on par with their own strength. In a one-on-one fight, none of them were confident they could absolutely defeat him. Yet now, he had been killed by Yang Kai in a single exchange.

And that was even with Qiu Ze suppressing him. Without Qiu Ze's suppression, wouldn't he have died even faster?

Who was this young man? Could he be an Emperor Realm expert concealing his cultivation to toy with them? Mu Zheng and the others all looked grim, feeling that coming to the Chiyue Sect with Qiu Ze to cause trouble might not have been a wise decision.

Yang Kai could achieve this with just Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation. If he ever advanced to the Emperor Realm, would any of them have a chance to survive? For a moment, the experts of several sects were all anxious and uneasy.

On the other side, Ye Hen was also shocked, but even more so, he was excited.

Although he had long heard from Ye Qinghan about Yang Kai's strength, hearing was one thing, seeing was another. The Chiyue Sect... perhaps there was still hope!

The dim light in Ye Hen's eyes rekindled. He gently patted Ye Qinghan's hand and said weakly, "Qinghan, you have good judgment. If we survive this calamity, you must keep in touch with Young Master Yang."

If Ye Qinghan and Du Xian weren't childhood sweethearts, already deeply in love, he would have wanted to marry his daughter to Yang Kai.

If such a promising young man could join the Chiyue Sect, it would be a tremendous boon.

"Yes, Father!" Ye Qinghan's beautiful eyes shone with joy. Just days ago at the City Lord’s mansion, Yang Kai had created a miracle, suppressing so many experts single-handedly and swaggering out of the city with the bride. Now, at the Chiyue Sect, with Emperor Realm expert present, could he create another miracle?
