## Chapter 730 — Who Is the Master

Outside the ice mountain, Yang Kai's expression was likewise grim; he closed his eyes and probed with his divine sense. From Su Yan's steady breath he judged she was not in mortal danger, yet he had no idea what had happened. His summons of spirit met no response, as if she had sunk into a deep sleep.

Several fairly strong life energies suddenly and strangely appeared within Yang Kai's perception, rushing this way with alarming speed.

Yang Kai opened his eyes; a cold light spilled from his pupils as he fixed his gaze on the Ice Sect disciples who had abruptly appeared.

After a moment, those few men had gathered before Yang Kai.

"So it really is you, brat!" Ni Ren barked. The youth before him wore a sullen face and exuded murderous intent—clearly not someone to be trifled with.

Ni Ren felt no fondness at all for such a person.

"You dared follow me? You've got some nerve." Ni Ren snorted with displeasure. "I'll go ask the Water Divine Hall about this — is your Water Divine Hall the place that breeds such treacherous little men?"

He had seen Yang Kai acting earlier alongside those from the Water Divine Hall and assumed Yang Kai came from that place.

"The Water Divine Hall doesn't control me!" Yang Kai snorted heavily.

Ni Ren frowned and gave Yang Kai a sidelong glance, speaking calmly, "I don't care which power you're from. This place belongs to my Ice Sect. Go back where you came from; otherwise don't blame us for being ungracious."

"I won't go anywhere until I see the person I came to see." Yang Kai looked at Ni Ren, annoyance welling in his heart; this man clearly knew Su Yan, yet previously hadn't even given him a chance to ask. Now that Yang Kai had found this place, Ni Ren still wanted to drive him off.

His arrogance had reached its limit!

Yang Kai's anger flared, but he restrained himself from striking. After all, the Ice Sect's Sect Master had some connection to Meng Wuya; Meng Wuya had entrusted Su Yan here out of goodwill. If the Ice Sect could offer a reasonable, acceptable explanation, Yang Kai did not wish to make a scene.

All he wanted now was to know what had happened to Su Yan.

It was not Yang Kai who lost his temper, but Ni Ren. He roared, "You brat, spurning a courtesy only to seek punishment? You're the first to speak to me like that on my Ice Sect's turf. Provoke me again and you'll regret it!"

"By all means, try me!" Yang Kai sneered coldly.

Ni Ren inclined his head slightly. "I didn't want to hurt you, but you brought this on yourself. A junior who dares be so wantonly insolent before me is simply shameless. Today I'll teach you who the master here is!"

As he spoke, Ni Ren's eyes suddenly flared; a pure white radiance burst forth from his pupils. In that white world, detecting such light was exceedingly difficult.

The chill-laced radiance struck like a sharpened sword, darting into Yang Kai's mind and ripping apart the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness as if to shatter him in one stroke.

"A Divine Sense attack…"

A cold smile tugged at Yang Kai's lips as he slowly shook his head. "I thought the Ice Sect had something formidable, but it seems otherwise. If that's all you have, you'll be disappointed."

Ni Ren's Divine Sense strike had easily pierced Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, yet within that torrid sea it was soon burned to nothing.

Ni Ren's face changed; the Ice Sect disciples beside him all stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.

Ni Ren was at least a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm expert. Though not specialized in Divine Sense, his perception was considerable; to be thrown back without effect by a junior, while the other remained unscathed and calm, was hard for them to accept.

"Junior Brother, this kid is odd!" a nearby Transcendent Realm cultivator said in a low voice.

Ni Ren nodded gravely. Earlier Elder Qian Yue had told him to bring extra men to drive this brat away; he had thought that excessive, but now he was glad he had the help of several senior brethren—had he come alone, he might have suffered a grave loss.

Thinking that, his expression grew heavier as he regarded Yang Kai. In a grave voice he said, "Kid, you have some ability; I won't press you. Leave."

"I told you, I won't leave until I see the person I came to see," Yang Kai said slowly, resolute. His expression suddenly turned cold and cruel: "If you don't let me see her, I will flatten your Three Thousand Ice Mountain World!"

"Arrogant! The Ice Sect is not a place for you to run rampant!" Ni Ren thundered in fury.

"Seems words are useless; your standing in the Ice Sect isn't high, is it? In that case I'll go find someone worth talking to!" Yang Kai's words had barely fallen when he launched himself toward an ice mountain. From within that peak a fierce Divine Sense faintly emanated, as if someone were spying on the commotion.

"Delusion!" Ni Ren shouted, True Yuan bursting out, "Ice Seals the Heavens and Earth!"

The bitter wind in an instant grew even colder. Around Yang Kai a strange energy coalesced, enveloping him; from that ring of power countless ice prongs swiftly took shape and blasted outward from all directions, each shard as sharp as a blade and overwhelming in force.

In an instant they swamped him.

Ni Ren's face did not ease; if anything, it grew grimmer.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

The ice prongs kept firing, but at the very heart of that ice energy a blazing fire erupted, spreading at an incomprehensible speed. Soon that crimson blaze became as blinding as the sun.

Boom…

The "Ice Seals the Heavens and Earth" collapsed; Yang Kai stood in midair wreathed in scarlet radiance, searing heat issuing from him as he stared coldly at Ni Ren.

"Transcendent Realm!" Ni Ren's complexion went white and his gaze lost focus.

Sensing the fluctuations of Yang Kai's True Yuan, he immediately understood the other's cultivation.

This young man, though not old, was the same as him—a First Stage Transcendent Realm expert. Moreover, his True Yuan was purer and far more powerful than Ni Ren's. Even more disquieting was that their True Yuan attributes were mutually antagonistic.

"Junior Brother, be careful!" As Ni Ren was momentarily stunned, a senior brother beside him suddenly shouted and hastily tugged him aside.

Whoosh…

A fiery-red spear grazed past his body and drove into the ground, blasting a vast hole in that ancient ice world, plunging hundreds of zhang deep.

Feeling the might of that spear, condensed purely from True Yuan, everyone paled.

They were all Transcendent Realm experts, yet none of them had confidence they could take such an attack with their bodies; to be struck would likely mean instant death.

A scorching, unbearable True Yuan radiance spread outward, covering a radius of several hundred zhang. Within that range their ice cultivation methods were suppressed to varying degrees—True Yuan flowed within their bodies as if slowed.

Yang Kai stepped down from the void, his eyes carrying a chilling frost as he said flatly, "One last question: what happened to Su Yan?"

"Kid, if you want to fight then fight. We don't know any Su Yan; we don't know who she is!" Ni Ren barked, forcing out the words.

"Fine." Yang Kai nodded once and stopped wasting words. A drop of Yang Liquid seeped from his fingertip; with a flick it shot forth.

The Yang Liquid in midair suddenly fractured into millions of tiny droplets, filling the sky as they streaked toward the others.

"Ice Veil!"

"Ice Chain!"

"Ice Crystal Battle-Beasts!"

Ni Ren and the Transcendent Realm cultivators attacked in unison; all manner of ice martial techniques bloomed with radiance.

A barrier brimming with icy energy rose before them, and at the same time a white energy chain coiled toward Yang Kai. Accompanied by beastlike howls, gigantic, ferocious battle-beasts suddenly appeared across the glacier.

These battle-beasts were formed entirely from energy, like exquisitely carved ice sculptures come to life—running on the ground, flying in the sky, all manner swarming viciously at Yang Kai.

Hissss…

Transformed into ten million droplets, the Yang Liquid pierced the layer of icy defense effortlessly. Ni Ren and the others turned ashen and simultaneously activated their defensive Secret Treasures, holding them up.

The white ice chain bound Yang Kai tightly, but before the caster could rejoice they discovered that the binding, which should have entrapped any First or Second Stage Transcendent Realm cultivator, was directly melted by Yang Kai's True Yang Yuan Qi. It had no effect—not even slowing his step.

Yang Kai strode forward like a charging blade, cleaving into the ice crystal battle-beasts.

Unused for some time, his Beast Soul Seal was unleashed again: the bellows and roars of beasts shook the heavens, and the Heaven-Shaking White Tiger and Earth-Splitting Divine Ox answered the call, appearing with golden, massive bodies like burning suns at Yang Kai's flanks.

Crack, crack, crack…

Every ice crystal battle-beast that charged was smashed by the combined might of Yang Kai and those two beast-souls, shattering into scintillant light and vanishing.

In mere moments Yang Kai had reached the few men standing before him; his roaring True Yuan and overwhelming momentum made their hearts tremble. They had never imagined that among cultivators of the same rank there could be one who, singlehanded, could contend with several of them—yet Yang Kai showed no sign of faltering and instead fought with effortless skill.

Feeling the power surging through his body, Yang Kai felt exhilarated.

The Ice Sect men were far stronger in combat than average cultivators of the same rank—the two First Stage Transcendent Realm members of the Cheng Family Yang Kai had dealt with in Shuilan City were not in the same class as these.

Though their realms matched, the degree to which one comprehended the Dao and martial path differed; the ability to convert one's realm into battlefield power naturally varied greatly.

In that regard Yang Kai had achieved the utmost. The Ice Sect cultivators were competent, yet nowhere near as profound.

Blow after blow struck true, each lethal, and with those attacks much of his rage was released. Yang Kai's mind grew steadily calmer.

He had not come to the Ice Sect to brawl or kill; he had come to find Su Yan.

With that thought, his killing intent subsided somewhat, yet his strikes remained merciless. Ni Ren and the others poured out all their strength but failed to stop him; instead they retreated step by step, showing clear signs of collapse.

This scene filled them with dread, and their attitude toward Yang Kai quietly began to change.
