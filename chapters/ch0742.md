## Chapter 742 — Saintess

"Don't worry, I'll pay you well." Yang Kai added after speaking.

The warriors standing on the deck laughed as if they'd heard a good joke; one after another they grinned with dark amusement, their gazes toward Yang Kai tinged with peculiarity.

Even the Transcendent Realm expert standing there couldn't help but smirk and nodded slightly. "Kid, what kind of payment can you offer?"

"Would ten Crystal Stones do? That's the most I can afford." Yang Kai cocked his head and put on the simple, rustic act. He could see that the owner of this ship was either rich or noble and would hardly care about such a sum.

Their laughter grew louder.

The Transcendent Realm warrior nodded faintly. "Didn't expect you'd have some spare money. But keep those ten Crystal Stones for yourself."

Saying that, he waved to a nearby fighter and ordered, "Give him a small boat. Send him packing!"

Yang Kai's earlier nonanswer had made him wary. Although Yang Kai's strength wasn't high, he didn't intend to keep him on the main ship and only wanted to get rid of him as soon as possible.

"That's fine." Yang Kai didn't object. "But could you at least point me in the direction of land? Anywhere that gets me to shore the fastest!"

"Point you the way? What use would that be?" the man snorted. "With your cultivation, you won't reach land. Pray for yourself out at sea. You should consider yourself lucky to have run into my Nine Heavens Sacred Land; had this been another faction's ship, you'd have long since been chopped up and tossed into the sea."

"Nine Heavens Sacred Land?" Yang Kai's expression stiffened.

Anyone who dared to call themselves a Sacred Land was no ordinary force. Since arriving on the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai had seen all manner of factions large and small — the Duao Alliance, the Water Divine Hall, the Leiguang Divine Cult, the Tianxiao Sect, and so on.

Of these, the Duao Alliance and the Leiguang Divine Cult were relatively weak, the Water Divine Hall middling, the Tianxiao Sect the strongest — and this Nine Heavens Sacred Land should be even more formidable than the Tianxiao Sect!

As they spoke, a small boat capable of holding several people had already been set down, and a warrior by the side called out, "Uncle Qian, the small boat is ready."

The Transcendent Realm warrior addressed as Uncle Qian was about to reply, but he frowned, turned, and hurriedly bowed, "Miss, why are you out here?"

The other warriors on the deck quickly saluted in return, their demeanors unusually respectful.

Yang Kai followed their gazes and couldn't help brightening.

A young woman in a moon-white long dress walked out from the cabin. She was very young and exceptionally beautiful, skin fair as mutton fat, eyebrows arched like ink, eyes bright with a lively charm, a figure slender and graceful, upright in carriage, her buttocks rounded and firm — every inch of her exuded the refined air of a highborn maiden that pleased the eye.

Seemingly sensing Yang Kai's unduly bold stare, the woman knitted her brow slightly and gave him a casual glance.

Uncle Qian turned back and shot Yang Kai a cold, low laugh that carried a clear warning.

Yang Kai met it calmly.

"It was a bit stuffy in there; I heard some noise outside and came to see." The woman parted her crimson lips; her voice was clear and pleasant as she swept her gaze around and asked, "What's going on here?"

Uncle Qian immediately reported everything that had happened in full detail.

The woman looked at Yang Kai with slight surprise and nodded to indicate she understood.

"I didn't think such a trivial matter would disturb Miss; my guilt is great!" Uncle Qian acted extremely repentant.

"Uncle Qian, that's exaggerated." The woman shook her head slowly, then fixed Yang Kai with a deep look and smiled faintly, saying something astonishing: "But I think he's lying!"

Yang Kai was taken aback and glanced at the woman curiously, wondering why she was so certain.

"Yes, I have my suspicions too, so I was going to have him sent away." Uncle Qian shot Yang Kai a sinister look.

"Don't drive him out. He's only a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator; if you throw him off, he won't live to reach shore. Though he lied, he bears no ill will toward us. He may have some hardships best not spoken of. Let him stay and travel with us for now; when we reach land, we can make him leave."

"As Miss commands, I'll follow orders!" Uncle Qian replied respectfully.

"I'll return inside now. Be careful." The woman issued one command, then turned and walked away.

After she left, Uncle Qian came up to Yang Kai and said coldly, "Miss has shown mercy and does not want you cast out. You'd better behave. If you dare scheme, I'll make you wish you'd never lived."

Yang Kai grinned. "Don't worry, I'll be very quiet. I just want to get back to land."

"Good!" Uncle Qian nodded heavily, then called to a Divine Roaming Realm peak cultivator, "Cheng Fei, keep an eye on him. Don't give him any chance to cause trouble!"

"Yes!" a burly man hurriedly answered.

With the orders given, Uncle Qian busied himself with other matters.

The man called Cheng Fei came up to Yang Kai and sized him up, his gaze full of contempt.

Yang Kai was currently showing only the cultivation of the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage; unless a Saint Realm expert probed, no one could discern his true strength.

With such a cultivation and at that age he was very common on the Tongxuan Continent and would not arouse suspicion.

Cheng Fei held cultivation at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm and naturally looked down on others.

"Kid, you'd better behave. I don't have time to babysit you. If you make me angry, I'll make your life hell."

"Mm, mm, I'll be very obedient." Yang Kai nodded quickly.

Everyone from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land carried an innate arrogance, likely tied to the exalted position their faction held on the continent.

It was like the disciples of the Eight Great Families from Zhongdu who, when they traveled, always bore themselves with a superior air, convinced no one in the world was their equal.

Yang Kai had seen enough of such attitudes and paid them no mind.

"Come with me; I'll arrange a place for you to stay." Cheng Fei sneered and beckoned Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hastened to follow, asking as they walked, "Friend, who was that young lady just now? Why are you all so respectful to her?"

"You've got a bit too much curiosity, kid!" Cheng Fei shot Yang Kai a contemptuous look and snorted. "Why are you asking about that?"

"Nothing, I just thought she was beautiful." Yang Kai put on an expression of one admiring a fair lady.

"Heh heh, Her Highness the Saintess is naturally beautiful." A feverish look appeared on Cheng Fei's face, as if he were quite infatuated with the Saintess, but then he straightened up and scolded, "You little stinker, if you dare look at the Saintess again, I'll gouge your eyes out. A toad dreaming of swan meat? Don't you know your place? The Saintess is gentle and kind; the one worthy of her hasn't even been born yet. As for you — to glance at her is a blessing left over from your past life!"

The big man poured contempt on Yang Kai until he was speechless.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes inwardly; although he wasn't as pretty as Zhai Yao, he still thought of himself as somewhat distinguished — how had this man painted him as some furtive, mean fellow?

He lost interest in talking and trailed sullenly behind Cheng Fei.

That the woman was actually the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's Saintess surprised Yang Kai.

It was said Saintesses were sacred and noble beings who generally did not show themselves. For some reason this Nine Heavens Sacred Land Saintess was aboard a ship drifting at sea.

Before long, Cheng Fei led Yang Kai to a small room at the very bottom of the hold.

"Get in. You stay here until we reach our destination. You'll be fed three meals a day; do not leave without permission. If you dare step out, we'll throw you into the sea without a second thought!"

Yang Kai looked at the cramped space where one couldn't even turn without bumping into something and frowned.

But he wasn't asking for much. He walked in without complaint, and Cheng Fei, pleased with his obedience, immediately shut the door behind him.

This 'room' wasn't a room at all — merely a small storage closet, barely covering a circular area of two zhang, and it smelled odd.

With no other choice, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the floor and opened the small window behind him, letting the clear sea breeze blow in.

That felt much better.

The great ship continued to sail safely across the sea. Wishing to avoid trouble, Yang Kai didn't pry into the crew's affairs, spending his days meditating and cultivating in the hold, simply waiting for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's ship to make landfall so he could leave.

During that time Cheng Fei brought his three meals daily, all sea fish, which tasted dull to Yang Kai.

The Transcendent Realm cultivator Uncle Qian had come by several times to inquire about Yang Kai's situation and was quite satisfied to find him honest and well-behaved.

Occasionally sea beasts caused a ruckus, but the ship's experts quickly slew them.

After several battles, Yang Kai quietly felt astonished at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's resources.

The ship had at least six Transcendent Realm experts aboard; two of them were Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, one of whom was Uncle Qian, while the other four were all Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

What puzzled Yang Kai slightly was the absence of a Saint Realm expert. Given the Saintess's importance, someone of Saint Realm caliber should have been present while she drifted at sea, to guard against the unpredictable.

Unable to understand it, Yang Kai let it drop.

In a huge cabin, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's Saintess sat with her chin propped on her hand, lost in thought and seeming detached from the world.

That room was a million times better than the closet Yang Kai had been given; the finest incense was burning, filling the space with a warm, pleasant fragrance, and the furnishings were exquisitely arranged, every detail exuding a noble air.
