## Chapter 975 — A Fight to the Death

The Great Demon God's World-Ending Demon Eye had long since been fused into Yang Kai's left eye, and he could call it forth or withdraw it at will.

Within the World-Ending Demon Eye lay one of the Great Demon God's divine abilities, the Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light.

Yang Kai did not know the full profundity of that Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light, nor whether the Great Demon God of old had truly been able to shoot golden light from his gaze to purify evil spirits.

Yet when the demon eye manifested in the frame of his left eye, the whole world suddenly felt different.

Heaven and earth trembled, the blood sea roiled as if struck by an enormous shock, and from within that turbulent sea a silhouette gradually resolved from the void into a clear form.

It was the figure of Ke Luo.

That figure had no flesh and blood; it was formed purely from converging spirit energy — Ke Luo's Spirit Body.

His flesh had long since burst, forming this Blood Pool Flesh Forest; his bones were scattered throughout the blood sea, turned into instruments for slaughter.

Now Ke Luo's Spirit Body stood before Yang Kai, clutching a bone spike that had pierced Yang Kai's abdomen; golden blood flowed from the wound into the blood sea, refusing to mix, standing apart from the crimson water and parting it to make a path wherever it went.

Ke Luo's eyes trembled violently as he stared inches away at Yang Kai's left eye; within that majestic golden pupil he seemed to perceive the invincible expert from thousands of years past.

Back then, when that expert had charged at him, with a casual strike he had sent Ke Luo crashing to the ground.

From beginning to end, that expert had never once looked at Ke Luo; the other party had seemingly never regarded him as worthy of notice.

That scene had carved an indelible scar into Ke Luo's heart, leaving him restless even in slumber, terrified that the expert might discover his traces and wipe him out completely.

He hid for thousands of years, only daring to awaken once the expert's aura had vanished from the world.

But now that terrifying presence that had burrowed into his bones had reappeared.

Right before him was the same lofty, imperious eye as from thousands of years ago.

Mystical power emanated from that eye and coalesced into a whirlpool that could swallow heaven and earth; Ke Luo felt his Spirit Body being pinched by an invisible giant hand and dragged toward that vortex, as if being cast into an eternal, sunless hell.

"Impossible!" Ke Luo roared, forcing himself backward as his spirit energy erupted in full to resist the pull of the golden eye.

"Ke Luo. Your time is up. Submit to death obediently!" Yang Kai pressed forward step by step, paying no heed to the wound in his abdomen, using words to unsettle Ke Luo's mind and tighten his fear.

"You are not him!" Ke Luo screamed in terror. "Even if you have one of his eyes, you cannot be him — he has long since died!"

He hid his Spirit Body within the blood sea while barking orders and manipulating the countless bone spikes scattered in the pool, sending them all hurtling at Yang Kai.

He marked Yang Kai as his most dangerous foe, determined to kill him swiftly.

The three tribes' experts dispersed through the blood sea suddenly felt the pressure ease; when they probed with their minds they could now discern each other's positions.

Ke Luo had focused all his attention on Yang Kai and could no longer control others; the blood sea's potency dropped by several grades.

“Ice Crystal Shield!” Han Fei cried sharply, her longsword weaving as it carved out currents of ice-sealing power within the sea of blood. Before Yang Kai, a massive ice shield condensed, as she strove with all her strength to protect him.  

Li Rong rushed over and delicately reached out to seize one of the bone spikes aimed at Yang Kai; Demon Yuan wrapped the spike and kept it from moving an inch.

Changyuan, Meng Wuya, Chu Lingxiao, and Lei Long hurried up one after another, each employing their methods to intercept spike after spike.

Before Yang Kai, ten experts together repelled Ke Luo's frenzied barrage; Yang Kai did not move an inch and yet remained unscathed.

It seemed that the appearance of the World-Ending Demon Eye had pierced the illusions woven within the blood sea, clearing everyone's sight considerably — they could see beyond ten zhang.

Ke Luo still lurked deep in the blood sea, far from Yang Kai, not daring to show his face.

He had shattered his flesh and bones and used the Bone Clan's forbidden technique, leaving only his Spirit Body to operate within the blood sea; he had thought himself its master, but he was sorely disappointed.

The World-Ending Demon Eye was the bane of Spirit Bodies; without a physical shell he dared not reveal himself.

Ssssh—

Bone spikes filled the sky, razor-sharp and terrifying in their momentum, while crimson water coalesced into blood dragons that bared fangs and roared at the others as they launched rampant assaults.

The ten experts tussled with them, no longer bewildered and helpless as before; standing beside Yang Kai, they would no longer lose themselves in the blood sea — each wore a relaxed expression and saw hope of victory.

"Over there — attack with Divine Sense! He only has a Spirit Body left!" Yang Kai ordered in a low voice, pointing to a direction.

"Only a Spirit Body?" Changyuan blinked, then laughed savagely. "Good, that makes it easy. Let’s see how long he can cling to life!"

As he spoke, the ten poured their spirit energies toward that direction; Yang Kai concurrently strengthened the World-Ending Demon Eye's power to restrain Ke Luo's movements.

A silent, uncanny assault burst forth, and heart-stopping spirit ripples blossomed over there.

Ke Luo gave a miserable cry, his voice short and sharp.

He was wounded at last.

Even as an expert nearing the Saint King Realm, he could not withstand the combined spirit attacks of ten top masters in an instant.

"Here!" Yang Kai pointed another way, and the ten redistributed their spirit energies, hammering that direction fiercely.

The blood sea convulsed again and grew unstable; the bone spikes and blood dragons that had been wielded against the ten experts under Ke Luo's control lost their menace, the blood dragons scattered and dissolved back into the sea, and the bone spikes were withdrawn by Ke Luo, vanishing from sight.

Ke Luo clearly had little energy to spare; evading the converging spirit attacks of ten experts was already the limit of his capability.

"Here!" Yang Kai pointed yet another direction.

The ten experts' strikes were like the spears and blades in his hand — unfailingly precise, delivering Ke Luo pulse-stopping shocks again and again.

After the length of half a teacup of time, the blood sea that had enveloped them all withdrew.

Everyone's vision cleared, and when they recovered, the Bone Clan's forbidden Blood Pool Flesh Forest had finally vanished.

Not far away, the bone spikes and flesh recombined, and Ke Luo's figure gradually reformed.

He was somehow able to restore himself again.

"Without that wicked forbidden technique, let's see what you can do against us!" Changyuan's eyes shone as he roared.

The others looked at Ke Luo with ill intent; earlier, they had been toyed with in that blood sea. Each here was a top master with pride, and they considered the prior humiliation intolerable.

Now that they had broken free of the blood sea, it was only natural to settle scores.

Before Ke Luo's form had finished rematerializing, the ten had already dispersed and surrounded him, leaving him with nowhere to flee.

Ke Luo finally panicked; his face drained of color, and terror and regret welled within his green eyes.

He felt he should never have awakened at this time — he should have slept another few thousand years.

"Ke Luo, did you forget something?" Yang Kai asked coolly, his gaze fixed on him.

Ke Luo's eyes snapped to Yang Kai, his eyelids shrinking.

He saw the bone spike lodged in Yang Kai's abdomen.

The spike was crystalline like white jade, carved as though from the finest crystal stone, carrying an immensely surging energy; it had pierced Yang Kai clean through and remained lodged in him.

At the sight of that spike Ke Luo's face changed dramatically, his panic deepening — it was part of his body and contained a vast portion of his life essence; losing a spike would greatly diminish his strength.

Yang Kai's face twisted, and he reached out to grasp the spike, slowly drawing it free from his abdomen.

His gaze was resolute, fixed on Ke Luo, not wavering an inch despite the tearing pain.

A spray of golden blood was drawn out; the moment the spike left, Yang Kai's wound began to heal on its own.

Ke Luo's eyes clung to that spike like a leech; his lips trembled as if to speak, yet no words came.

Yang Kai half-smiled, looking at him at leisure. "For your Bone Clan, your bones are your very basis for survival, aren't they?"

"So what if they are?" Ke Luo hissed through his teeth.

"That's good then!" Yang Kai inclined his head slightly. A destructive Demon Yuan welled up from his palm and wrapped the spike; in an instant the spike seemed engulfed in a pitch-black flame, melting rapidly into a puddle of bone liquid that slid from Yang Kai's fingertips, dripped into the ground, and vanished.

Before his eyes, Yang Kai incinerated the bone spike.

Ke Luo's expression contorted wildly, as if Yang Kai had destroyed the most precious thing in his life; his face instantly became hideous and he roared, "You destroyed my bone body — I'll make you pay!"

"You won't get the chance!" Meng Wuya howled, his hands tearing at the void with savage gestures.

From the sky it seemed Meng Wuya plucked meteors and threw them down — brilliance steeped with terrifying might plummeted fiercely toward Ke Luo, as if intent on tearing the heavens and earth apart.

“You dared slay my Demon Generals—today I’ll grind your bones to dust!” Darkness that devoured all light burst forth from the halberd in Changyuan’s hand. With a shake, the weapon shot forward like a dragon bursting from its cave, thrusting straight at Ke Luo.

Meng Ge and Xueli followed close behind Changyuan, hatred written on their faces as they unleashed their full strength.

The three Great Lords of the yao ignored everything and revealed their true forms, pouring their power into attacking Ke Luo.

Chu Lingxiao shook the Locking Demon Chain, wrapping it around Ke Luo to restrain his movements.

Bone shields condensed at Ke Luo's sides; he felt the crushing crisis and knew that if he could not hold, death was certain — he hoped the Bone Shields might buy him a sliver of time.

He still had some strength left to fight on!
