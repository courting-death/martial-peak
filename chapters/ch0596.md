## Chapter 596 — The Girl Who Cares for the Peacock

At dawn, Gu Yun Island.

Gu Yun Island is one of the few first-rate forces overseas. The sect governs a dozen or so islands of varying sizes, abundant in Spiritual Qi, blessed with countless heaven-and-earth treasures, and its disciples are diligent and conscientious in their cultivation, with a promising future ahead.

Although Gu Yun Island's strength does not match that of the Tai Yi Sect, the only thing lacking are Transcendent Realm masters.

A few years ago, after Gu Yun Island discovered the sect’s lost secret scripture, the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, missing for over three hundred years, the Island Lord Gu Feng devoted himself to vigorously nurturing the cultivation of his disciples, hoping that one day, a few outstanding disciples could ascend to the Transcendent Realm and stand on equal footing with the Tai Yi Sect.

Though this goal was lofty and required time, Gu Feng believed that with the aid of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, those disciples had hope to realize this expectation.

The sea breeze blew gently and naturally.

Elite Disciple Zhong Miaoke of Gu Yun Island woke from a night of closed-door meditation. She leapt lightly from the bed, washed up a little, then opened the door and stepped out.

She came to a humble room next door, lightly knocked on the door, and called sweetly, "Junior Brother, Junior Brother, get up!"

The door opened in response, revealing a young face.

Looking into those deep, seemingly weathered eyes, Zhong Miaoke momentarily spaced out.

She couldn’t understand why her Junior Brother, who was not yet twenty, looked as if he’d endured many hardships. Whether it was his expression or mannerisms, they did not fit a young man’s; even some of his occasional words were thought-provoking.

"Good morning, Senior Sister," he greeted with a smile.

Zhong Miaoke nodded gently. Her chest rose and fell subtly, stirring imaginations. She smiled softly, "I thought you were still asleep. Hurry up and get ready. Today, Elder Han Zhao will come to see the peacocks. We have to clean those little ones properly, or else the Elder will punish us."

"Oh." Yang Kai nodded and went back inside to prepare.

This was a secluded corner of Gu Yun Island, where Zhong Miaoke’s duty was to look after a few noble peacocks.

These peacocks were not rare beasts but ordinary peacocks owned by an elder named Han Zhao of Gu Yun Island.

Han Zhao cultivated to the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, neither too high nor too low, but he was famous in Gu Yun Island for being a sentimental lover.

Because these peacocks had been raised by his late wife, after she passed away, Han Zhao treated them like treasures and specially arranged personnel to take care of them.

Together with Zhong Miaoke, Yang Kai arrived at the place where the peacocks were. He carried water to wash the dirt off their proud, noble feathers.

Looking at this familiar island, this somewhat recognizable place, Yang Kai smiled wryly.

He never expected to be transported here by a shattered Void Passage.

Half a year ago, Zhong Miaoke had actually pulled him out of the sea near Gu Yun Island.

The destructive power of the fractured void had almost sliced his body into countless pieces; if not for the protection of his Bone Shield, he would have long been dead.

After being rescued by Zhong Miaoke and cared for half a month, his injuries gradually healed.

Yang Kai did not rush back to Zhongdu. The situation there was already settled; whether he returned or not made no difference, so he stayed here contentedly.

Zhong Miaoke even used her connections to plead with Elder Han Zhao to admit the seemingly worthless Yang Kai as a registered disciple of Gu Yun Island so that he could help her care for the peacocks.

What a coincidence! Yang Kai thought silently—as it turned out, he had once been to Gu Yun Island before.

"Senior Sister, you’re an elite disciple of the sect and should be able to cultivate in better places. Why stay here to care for peacocks? It’s a waste of talent," Yang Kai said slowly as he worked and talked with Zhong Miaoke.

"Mm," Zhong Miaoke nodded gently. She was not overly beautiful, with a few freckles dotting her face, but delicate and pleasant to look at, with a wonderful figure. Working with her was not dull at all. Especially since this cheap Senior Sister had a particularly kind heart; otherwise, she wouldn’t have pulled Yang Kai out of the sea and even arranged for him to join Gu Yun Island.

Yang Kai only brushed off his rescue story as the tale of a fisherman who accidentally fell into the water.

"Although the Island Lord and several elders want me to go to Shenfeng Island to cultivate—there the Spiritual Qi is much richer—I don’t want to go."

"Why? People always try to go higher; water always flows down. Senior Sister, you aren’t attached to these peacocks, are you?" Yang Kai teased.

"Not really," Zhong Miaoke slowly shook her head, a trace of wistfulness in her beautiful eyes. After a long while, she said, "I stay because one day I want to repay a debt of gratitude."

"Repay a debt?" Yang Kai was surprised.

"Have I ever told you that I was very unappreciated in the sect before? My status was very low, and many bullied me."

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"One day, everything changed," Zhong Miaoke said, straightening her posture, lifting her chest slightly, and wiping the sweat from her brow as she recalled, "That morning, I was just about to feed the peacocks when I found a dagger stuck in my door. Attached was a letter."

"A letter?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "What did it say?"

"There was a line of words and a yellowed page," Zhong Miaoke smiled faintly. "The line instructed me to deliver these things to the Island Lord and the elders."

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange; he suddenly felt this scene was all too familiar.

"I did as I was told," Zhong Miaoke smiled after pursing her lips. "Guess what? Following that note’s instructions, the Island Lord and elders actually found the lost Transforming Moonbreaker Technique in the Yunxia Sect, lost for over three hundred years! Because of this, the Island Lord rewarded me personally. I received many pills from the Pill Hall and was arranged to cultivate in the Yunsoul Cave for more than a year. That’s what made my cultivation today!"

Zhong Miaoke spoke passionately, growing more excited, a different light blooming in her eyes, cheeks slightly flushed, and her hands pressed against her chest. "If not for that letter, I would still be the same old me—bullied and disregarded everywhere. I don’t know who put that letter on my door, but because of him, my status changed. I’m very grateful to him, from the bottom of my heart!"

Yang Kai coughed lightly, twitching his face slightly. "What a coincidence."

"Yes," Zhong Miaoke nodded repeatedly. "Such a coincidence—Gu Yun Island is so big, and yet he chose to leave the letter with me. Even though I’m now an elite disciple, I don’t want to go anywhere else. I want to stay here until that person appears again."

"What for?" Yang Kai’s face darkened.

"To thank him in person," Zhong Miaoke said softly, suddenly blushing with embarrassment. "And if he’s willing... I want to marry him."

"Let’s forget that," Yang Kai exclaimed in shock. "You don’t even know if it’s a man or a woman."

Zhong Miaoke thought for a moment and replied, "If it’s a woman... I’ll treat her like a little sister and obey her for life. If it’s a man... heehee..."

She suddenly became bashful, wearing the expression of someone in her first bloom of love.

Yang Kai quickly said, "Maybe he already has three wives and four concubines, doesn’t need any woman... Or maybe he’s a ruthless villain, with a face like a butcher’s, huge and brutish, killing without mercy, savage and violent..."

"You can’t speak ill of him!" Zhong Miaoke scowled fiercely. "No matter what kind of man he is, he gave me a chance. To me, he’s the best. If he appears again, I will go with him!"

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his brow and muttered, "He probably won’t show up in front of you."

"What do you mean by that, Junior Brother?" Zhong Miaoke’s breath became dangerous as she advanced threateningly toward Yang Kai, her face darkened. "Are you saying Senior Sister isn’t in his favor?"

"I didn’t say that," Yang Kai protested bitterly.

"So you’re saying Senior Sister is ugly! Hmph, Senior Sister isn’t pretty, but she could at least be his servant, right?"

"Absolutely!" Yang Kai nodded heavily.

"That’s better," Zhong Miaoke smiled contentedly, no longer bothering Yang Kai. "Help clean them up quickly. Elder Han Zhao will be here soon."

Just as Yang Kai was about to nod, his expression suddenly changed. He looked up to the sky and stared for a long while before revealing a bitter smile.

"Senior Sister!" Yang Kai shouted.

"What is it?" Zhong Miaoke looked up puzzlingly. When her eyes met Yang Kai’s, her head suddenly grew heavy, overwhelming fatigue surged forth, and her delicate body sagged down.

Yang Kai stepped forward, caught her, carried her back into the room, then stepped outside.

Two slender figures appeared mysteriously before Yang Kai. The one leading was enchantingly beautiful, as if all the world’s female grace had been condensed in her: the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo. Following her was, of course, Bilo.

Gazing silently at Yang Kai for a long moment, Shan Qingluo finally bit her lip and said through gritted teeth, "You little bastard, everyone in Zhongdu worries about you and searches for your whereabouts, yet here you are playing with women, as promiscuous as ever, your lust unchanged!"

Her face was full of reproach.

"I’m not!" Yang Kai was furious. "Stop slandering me."

"Hmph, just kill him and end it all!" Bilo snarled, like a little tiger glaring fiercely at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glanced at her, his eyes fixed on her delicate mouth, chuckling darkly, "It’s been a long time since I last touched a woman. Don’t provoke me, or it won’t be good if I get rough with you!"

Bilo’s face instantly paled. She quickly hid behind Shan Qingluo and borrowed her authority, "My lord is here. Don’t get reckless with me!"

"Enough." Shan Qingluo scolded lightly and stepped forward, staring at Yang Kai. "Everyone thinks you’re dead. Only I know you’re alive and well. You little bastard, you really make people worry."

Yang Kai bore Shan Qingluo’s Soul Pursuit Seal inside him. Although his cultivation now was enough to easily shatter it, he hadn’t done so, which is why she could still track him down.
