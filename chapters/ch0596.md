## Chapter 596 — The Girl Who Takes Care of the Peacocks

Early morning on Gu Yun Island.

Gu Yun Island is one of the few first-rate forces overseas. The Sect governs a dozen or so islands of various sizes, abundant in Spiritual Qi, blessed with countless heaven-and-earth treasures. Its disciples are diligent and industrious in cultivation, their prospects unclouded.

Though Gu Yun Island’s power does not rival that of Tai Yi Sect, the only shortfall is merely the absence of Transcendent Realm masters.

Several years ago, after Gu Yun Island discovered the Sect’s lost sacred scripture that had been missing for over three centuries—the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique—Island Lord Gu Feng has devoted himself to vigorously cultivating his disciples’ cultivation levels, hoping that one day, the gifted disciples under his wing will ascend to the Transcendent Realm, standing shoulder to shoulder with Tai Yi Sect.

Though this goal is lofty and requires time, Gu Feng is confident that with the aid of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, those few disciples hold the hope to fulfill his expectations.

The sea breeze drifted softly, crisp and natural.

Elite Disciple Zhong Miaoke of Gu Yun Island awoke from a night of secluded meditation. She lightly leapt down from her bed, washed quickly, then opened the door and stepped outside.

She came to a nearby simple hut, gently knocked on the door, and called in a delicate voice, "Junior Brother, Junior Brother, awake!"

The door responded, opening to reveal a youthful face.

Gazing into his eyes — deep and seemingly weathered by countless hardships — Zhong Miaoke was momentarily lost in thought.

She could not comprehend why her junior brother, who was barely twenty, appeared as though he had endured much. His demeanor and manner of doing things did not align with that of a young person, and some of his occasional words were always thought-provoking.

"Senior Sister, good morning," the young man smiled in greeting.

Zhong Miaoke nodded gently; the gentle rise and fall of her ample bosom invited reverie. She laughed softly, saying, "I thought you were still asleep. Hurry and prepare yourself. The Elder will be coming to see the peacocks today. We must clean those little fellows properly, lest the Elder sees them dirty and punish us."

"I see." Yang Kai nodded and returned inside to prepare.

This was a secluded corner of Gu Yun Island, and Zhong Miaoke’s task was to care for several noble peacocks.

These peacocks were not rare mystical beasts, just ordinary peacocks, owned by Elder Han Zhao of Gu Yun Island.

Elder Han Zhao possessed cultivation at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm—not high, nor low—but was famous within Gu Yun Island for his romantic disposition.

Because these peacocks were once tended by his late wife, after her death, Elder Han Zhao treated them as treasures and specially assigned personnel to care for them.

Together with Zhong Miaoke, Yang Kai arrived at the peacock’s domain. Bringing clear water, he helped wash away the dirt from their lofty and aloof feathers.

Looking upon this somewhat familiar island, this somewhat recognizable place, Yang Kai laughed quietly to himself.

He had never expected to be transported here by the shattered Void Passage.

Half a year ago, Zhong Miaoke had pulled him out of the sea near Gu Yun Island.

The destructive power of the broken Void Passage had nearly torn his body into countless pieces; if not for the protection of the Bone Shield, he would have long since perished.

After being rescued by Zhong Miaoke, he was cared for for half a month before his injuries gradually healed.

Yang Kai did not hurry to return to Zhongdu; the situation there had been settled, and whether he went or not was inconsequential. He felt at ease staying here.

Furthermore, Zhong Miaoke had leveraged her connections to beg Elder Han Zhao to let the seemingly useless Yang Kai enter Gu Yun Island as a registered disciple to assist her in caring for the peacocks.

What a fate! Yang Kai thought silently. He had once been to Gu Yun Island in the past.

“Senior Sister, you are an elite disciple of the Sect and should be able to train in a better place. Why do you remain here caring for peacocks? It seems a waste of your talent,” Yang Kai said slowly while busying himself.

“Mm.” Zhong Miaoke nodded gently. She was not particularly beautiful, her face dotted with some freckles, yet delicate and pleasant to behold with a superb figure. Working with her was far from dull—especially since this young Senior Sister had a particularly kind heart. If not for that, she would never have saved Yang Kai from the sea, nor used influence to place him in Gu Yun Island.

Yang Kai’s story of falling into the sea was merely accidental.

“Although the Island Lord and several Elders want me to go to Shenfeng Island to cultivate, where Spiritual Qi is richer, I don’t want to go.”

“Why not? People always strive upwards, water flows downward. Senior Sister wouldn’t be unwilling to part with these peacocks, would she?” Yang Kai teased.

“Not at all,” Zhong Miaoke shook her head slowly. A hint of a melancholy memory clouded her beautiful eyes before she spoke, “I stay here hoping to repay a kindness one day.”

“Repay a kindness?” Yang Kai was astonished.

“Did I ever tell you that I was once undervalued and lowly within the Sect? Many people bullied me.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“One day, this situation changed,” Zhong Miaoke said as she straightened up, arched her chest, wiped sweat from her brow, then recalled, “That morning, as I was about to feed the peacocks, I found a dagger slipped into the door. Attached to it was a letter.”

“A letter?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “What did it say?”

“There was one line of characters and a yellowed page,” Zhong Miaoke smiled faintly. “The line said to hand those items over to the Island Lord and Elders.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew strange, suddenly feeling this scene was familiar.

“And I did as instructed,” Zhong Miaoke smiled, pursing her lips. “Guess what? Following that letter’s lead, the Island Lord and Elders found the long-lost Transforming Moonbreaker Technique in Yunxia Sect! Because of this, the Island Lord rewarded me by letting me receive a bounty of pills in the Pill Hall and arranged for me to cultivate in Yunsoul Cave for over a year. This is why I have my current cultivation!”

Zhong Miaoke spoke passionately, growing more excited; a distinct light ignited in her eyes, her cheeks flushed red, hands pressed to her chest. “If not for that letter, I’d still be the same as before, bullied and disregarded everywhere. I don't even know who slipped that letter under my door, but I know it’s because of him that my status changed. I’m truly grateful to him—from the bottom of my heart!”

Yang Kai coughed lightly, his face twitching. “What a coincidence.”

“Yes,” Zhong Miaoke nodded repeatedly. “Too much of one. Gu Yun Island is vast, yet he chose to leave the letter here with me. So even though I’m now an elite disciple, I don’t want to go elsewhere. I want to stay and wait for him to appear again.”

“Why wait for him?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“To thank him in person,” Zhong Miaoke said softly, suddenly bashful. “If he’s willing... I even want to marry him.”

“That’s asking too much, isn’t it?” Yang Kai was shocked. “You don’t even know if it’s a man or a woman.”

Zhong Miaoke came back to herself, thought for a moment. “If a woman... I’ll treat her like a younger sister and obey her my whole life. If a man... hee hee...”

Her expression twisted shyly, looking lovestruck.

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “Maybe he already has three wives and four concubines and doesn’t need women. Or perhaps he’s some fierce brute, covered in scars, a killer, brutal and savage...”

“Don’t you dare speak ill of him!” Zhong Miaoke glared at Yang Kai, anger swelling. “No matter what he is, he gave me a chance. To me, he’s the best person. Once he appears again, I’ll follow him no matter what!”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his brow and muttered, “Then he probably won’t show up in front of you.”

“Junior Brother, what do you mean?” Zhong Miaoke’s breath became dangerous as she advanced on Yang Kai, her face grim. “Are you saying Senior Sister isn’t to his taste?”

“I didn’t say that!” Yang Kai protested loudly.

“Then you’re saying Senior Sister is ugly! Hmph, Senior Sister may not be pretty, but being his maid is surely acceptable?”

“Absolutely!” Yang Kai nodded firmly.

“That’s more like it, hee hee!” Zhong Miaoke laughed in satisfaction, no longer bothering Yang Kai, and instructed, “Hurry up and wash them clean; Elder Han Zhao will arrive soon.”

Just as Yang Kai was about to nod, his expression suddenly changed. He looked up toward the sky and after a long moment, revealed a bitter smile.

“Senior Sister!” Yang Kai called.

“What?” Zhong Miaoke looked up in confusion, but when her eyes met Yang Kai’s, her head became heavy, an endless fatigue overwhelming her. Her delicate body went limp and toppled downwards.

Yang Kai stepped forward, catching her and carrying her back inside before stepping outside.

Before him suddenly appeared two slender figures. The one leading was charming and sultry, gathering the essence of all the beauties in the world—Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo. Following beside her was Bilo.

Looking at Yang Kai silently for a long moment, Shan Qingluo ground her teeth bitterly, "You little brat, everyone in Zhongdu worries about you and searches for your whereabouts, yet here you are playing with women, as promiscuous as ever, your lust unchanged!"

Her face full of mock scolding.

“Who told you that?” Yang Kai growled. “Stop slandering me.”

“Hmph, master, just kill him and be done with it!” Bilo growled and snarled at Yang Kai like a little tiger.

Yang Kai glanced at her, eyes fixed on her soft, delicate lips, grinning mischievously, “It’s been a long time since I touched a woman. Don’t provoke me, or it won’t be good if I get rough with you!”

Bilo’s face paled, quickly dodging behind Shan Qingluo and boldly declaring, “My Lady is here! Don’t be so reckless with me!”

“All right.” Shan Qingluo gave a mild reprimand, stepped forward, and stared at Yang Kai, “Everyone thinks you’re dead. Only I know you’re alive and well. You little brat, you really make one worry.”

Within Yang Kai’s body is Shan Qingluo’s Soul Pursuit Seal. Though Yang Kai’s cultivation could easily shatter it now, he has not done so, which allowed Shan Qingluo to track him.
