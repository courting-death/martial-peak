## Chapter 1604 — Severe Losses

"Retreat?" Qian Tong blinked in surprise, not understanding why Yang Kai was so anxious.

"Go! If we don't go now it will be too late." Yang Kai did not explain; he shouted once and his figure lunged backward, and before leaving he casually tugged Lin Yurao along.

Lin Yurao was bewildered and did not resist, allowing Yang Kai to pull her, and soon they had withdrawn over ten zhang.

"Brother Qian…" Tianze looked helpless and cast a pleading glance toward Qian Tong.

"Do as Yang Kai says." Qian Tong transformed without hesitation into a streak of light and followed closely behind Yang Kai.

He did not know why Yang Kai would make such a decision, but he chose to trust Yang Kai unconditionally.

Perhaps Yang Kai had his reasons!

Seeing the three of them retreat, Tianze hesitated for a moment, then slapped his thigh in annoyance and hurried after them.

The scene had already descended into chaos.

As the number of cracks on the Domain Stone mountain increased, countless martial artists surged forward, trying to snatch the Domain Stones that had been shattered.

A few shrewd ones, having heard Yang Kai's shout and sensing something amiss, did not wade into the tumult; instead they quietly withdrew.

When something abnormal occurs, there must be a demon at work, especially when it is as huge a change as the Domain Stone mountain about to break apart.

But such people were few—only about one tenth; most had their minds bewitched by the temptation before them and ignored Yang Kai's loud warning.

Crack… crack…

The cracking sounds continued; it seemed the Domain Stone mountain was about to collapse. Under everyone's watchful eyes the fissures multiplied, growing wider and wider.

In the end, the Domain Stone mountain thundered down, the massive mountain of Domain Stones turning into pieces of varying sizes and scattering across the ground.

What struck everyone as odd was that the Domain Stones produced by the fracture were unlike those born from within a Domain vortex; each piece was as thin as cicada wings.

"Impossible—this Domain Stone mountain is hollow?" someone shouted in disbelief.

Those fractured Domain Stones spoke for themselves: if the Domain Stone mountain were not hollow inside, how could such wafer-thin fragments appear when it broke? The scene resembled an empty pottery jar smashed to pieces.

Many found this hard to accept.

Yet even if they were as thin as cicada wings, they were still Domain Stones.

After a few breaths of astonishment, everyone lunged forward like maniacs, coveting those pieces of Domain Stone of all sizes and snatching at them.

The scene instantly spiraled out of control!

Various Secret Treasures and Martial Skills unleashed their power, filling the dozens-of-zhang area so that the naked eye could scarcely make anything out. Screams rose. Blood sprayed…

A rippling wave, visible to the naked eye, undulated from the very center of the Domain Stone mountain and spread outward at great speed.

Everyone covered by that ripple involuntarily halted their movements; their faces suddenly turned pale with terror.

When that ripple washed over their bodies, they felt an aura of danger—that of a domain field!

And it was an extraordinarily terrifying domain field!

The domain field unique to the once-silent Domain Stone mountain seemed to rekindle from death.

"Bad—get out!" a clever martial artist shouted.

No one continued grabbing the scattered Domain Stones; every fighter frantically invoked their Saint Yuan and bolted outward to retreat.

But it was already too late!

When the first ripple appeared, the second and third had already followed in quick succession.

In an instant, countless visible ripples stacked upon one another, filling a range of nearly one thousand zhang and engulfing that thousand-zhang stretch of ground.

Vision blurred as the mighty domain field that gave birth to the Domain Stone mountain revealed its ferocious face—like a mad, ravenous beast it opened its bloodthirsty maw and swallowed nearly two hundred Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioners whole.

The screams from all directions made everyone's scalp tingle; no Origin Returning Realm martial artist could withstand the crushing and grinding of that raging domain field. Waves of vigorous life, like pinched bubbles, vanished in an instant.

After those layers of ripples struck, each person exploded into pieces amid their agonized howls, their lives and blood blooming a final, tragic beauty.

Yang Kai and the other three stood a thousand zhang from the Domain Stone mountain, each of them pale as they stared ahead.

Tianze's lips trembled, his teeth chattering with cracking sounds.

He couldn't imagine what his fate would have been had he been even slightly more greedy just now—he probably would have suffered the same end as those swallowed by the domain field. He looked toward Yang Kai instinctively, his heart overflowing with gratitude.

Were it not for this young man's farsightedness, this trip into the Blood Prison would have meant his doom.

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao's faces were no better.

So many cultivators at the same level as them, so many powerful figures who could press toward the Void King Realm, yet they had perished so helplessly without resistance.

They died like ants…

Their feelings were complex and uneasy.

Meanwhile, a hundred li outside the Blood Prison in a stone pavilion, Luo Hai, who had been sitting there calmly, suddenly rose, his face turning extremely ugly.

"Lord Luo Hai, what has happened?" the old woman surnamed Lei, seeing his change of expression, asked anxiously.

"Yes, Brother Luo Hai, what has you so alarmed?" an elder asked, puzzled.

One who had reached the Void King Realm was usually steady of temperament and rarely startled so; moreover Luo Hai was no ordinary Void King Realm—he was the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, a Second Stage Void King expert. Across the Star Domain, save for a few reclusive immortals, few could match his strength.

Now that Luo Hai's face had turned so grim, they all realized something major must have occurred.

"The Domain Stone mountain is destroyed!" Luo Hai said in a deep voice.

"What? Did I hear that right?"

"Yes—how could the Domain Stone mountain be destroyed?"

"Who did this? Those little brats inside shouldn't have the power for this, right?"

The crowd clamored; had this not come from Luo Hai they would never have believed it.

Even when Luo Hai spoke, they remained doubtful.

How could the Domain Stone mountain possibly be destroyed?

"Lord Luo Hai, is this for real?" the old woman asked, her expression grave.

"Would I jest about this?" Luo Hai frowned. "As for how it was destroyed, I don't know, but it is absolutely destroyed!"

The crowd exchanged glances and no longer questioned Luo Hai's judgment.

He was a Star Lord; if he said it, he must be certain.

They all found it hard to accept such a result.

"Alas, what a pity. The Domain Stone mountain is a treasure of the Blood Prison, existing for tens of thousands of years—how could it be destroyed so suddenly?" After a long while the elder who had spoken before sighed in regret. Although the Domain Stone mountain resided on Cuiwei Star, it could be said to be a treasure of the entire Star Domain. Now that it's gone, anyone would feel sorrow.

Perhaps its destruction will mean the Star Domain will produce far fewer Void King Realm practitioners!

"Right, Lord Luo Hai—since the Domain Stone mountain is destroyed, what about those who were studying around it?" the old woman suddenly recalled a more serious question.

Others listened and grew tense.

"Many died! I can't accurately probe how many lives were extinguished, but I estimate roughly two hundred." Luo Hai replied.

"Two hundred!" the old woman changed color, stunned for a long time before forcing a bitter smile. "Now the major powers have suffered heavy losses."

The Blood Prison Trial already had an outrageously high mortality rate; most who entered were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. No one feared anyone else—everyone slaughtered any obstacle in their path to strive for the Void King Realm.

Now the Domain Stone mountain's catastrophe had killed about two hundred who had entered, and some factions might be completely wiped out, never to recover.

The crowd quickly realized the severity of the situation.

“Fortunately, Third Young Master didn’t come this time… otherwise…” Cold sweat suddenly broke out on the forehead of the old man from the Hengluo Commerce Guild, his face full of lingering fear.

If the Third Young Master Xue Yue had also joined the Blood Prison Trial and gone to the Domain Stone Mountain…

He could hardly bear to imagine it!

Young Master Xue Yue is the Hengluo Commerce Guild's greatest hope for the future.

…

Inside the Blood Prison, in the span of only a few breaths, the chaotic world calmed again. All those who had not retreated in time were left without bones; in the end fewer than thirty people survived the catastrophe.

Those survivors had all heard Yang Kai's shout and decisively retreated, thereby preserving their lives.

After recovering from their fright, they all cupped their hands slightly in Yang Kai's direction to show their gratitude.

With the Domain Stone mountain gone, no one lingered here; each person went off in different directions to delve deeper into the Blood Prison in search of their own chance.

Soon this vast area was left with only Yang Kai and his party of four.

"Sect Master Yang, I cannot express my gratitude enough for saving our lives. Once you leave the Blood Prison, please visit Lushui City; This Zhao will give you a proper welcome!" Tianze said earnestly—he was genuinely grateful to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "You're too polite, Lord Zhao. I did little; I will come to Lushui City, but I hope I won't trouble Lord Zhao."

Qian Yue was still in Lushui City looking into news of Su Yan, and Yang Kai naturally intended to go fetch Qian Yue.

"No, no!" Tianze waved his hand, a smile on his face. "Sect Master Yang's coming would be an honor for Zhao—how could it be a trouble?"

Yang Kai nodded lightly, glanced at Qian Tong and Lin Yurao, and said, "You two be careful from now on."

Hearing the implication of his words, Lin Yurao felt disappointed. "Sect Master, won't you come with us?"

"No, I have other matters." Yang Kai shook his head. The Void Mind Crystal that Chi Yue had ordered had not yet arrived, and the other half of the Yao Transformation Technique was in Yu Xiong's hands; he had to obtain that Yao Transformation Technique.

He was eager to develop the Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power within his body.

"Then you be careful too—none here is likely your match, but the remaining domain field is powerful; measure your strength." Qian Tong advised.
