## Chapter 1203 — Leaving

Although the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree was supremely rare and priceless, Yang Kai did not have to possess it; when he discovered the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree he felt only a brief excitement before returning to his usual calm.

Yet when he thought that the long bone before him might be the Dragon Bone of a legendary ancient Great Dragon, Yang Kai could no longer suppress the excitement welling up from the depths of his heart.

Dragons and phoenixes are two of the mightiest beings, born with the world itself; they are the natural sovereigns of the yao, but they exist only in legend, whether on the Tongxuan Continent or in the Star Domain.

No one had seen a dragon or phoenix, but many descendants bearing their bloodlines still survived among the living.

For example, on the Tongxuan Continent, the Great Yao Lord of the Monster Race, Lei Long, had a trace of ancient dragon blood flowing in his veins. And the predecessor of the Thundertree that Yang Kai had obtained before — the Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast, Thunder Luan — bore a thread of phoenix blood in its body. After the Thunder Luan’s death, its essence, spirit, and even its Inner Core fused into one, nurturing the growth of that Thundertree, becoming its nourishment.

That Thundertree still lay in Yang Kai's Black Book Space and he had not used it, for it was precious; Yang Kai hesitated to take it out to let Yang Yan use it for forging.

The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress inheritances that Yang Kai and Su Yan had obtained also bore traces of those two supreme beings, so Lei Long the Great Yao Lord once said there was a faint aura of a yao emperor about Yang Kai.

These two supreme beings could almost be called immortal existences — they were undying!

Yet this fragment of long bone looked very much like the Dragon Bone of legend, which left Yang Kai confused; if dragons and phoenixes were immortal, where could such a Dragon Bone have come from?

If his guess was correct, then the pearl the size of a pigeon egg might be a Dragon Pearl, and the little snake inside the pearl nothing more than a tattered remnant of a dragon soul.

In any case, he would collect them first and study them later when he had time. Deciding this, Yang Kai drew a deep breath and reached out to grab the pearl before him.

Before his hand could touch it, the little snake restlessly coiling inside the pearl opened its mouth and spat a gout of azure mist that pierced straight through the pearl and enveloped Yang Kai's large hand.

There was no immediate pain, but Yang Kai's face changed drastically.

As the azure mist wrapped his hand he suddenly found that his hand had lost all feeling, and wood-like graining quickly grew across the back of his hand, as if in the next moment his hand would turn to wood.

And that phenomenon crept up from his hand along his arm, as if it intended to turn his entire body into wood.

Yang Kai was alarmed and hastily withdrew his hand, then circulated his Demonic Flame.

The black fire flared up and he tried to use his Demonic Flame to drive off the strange energy, but to his dismay even the fearsome power of the Demonic Flame could not immediately dispel the azure mist on his hand; it could only barely halt its spread.

Sensation in his hand faded further and Yang Kai's face fluctuated; even his Saint Yuan became blocked and would not circulate.

Fortunately his Demonic Flame was no ordinary Saint Yuan to be compared with, and for a time the black Demonic Flame and the azure mist were locked in a standoff at his wrist. The azure mist could not advance an inch, and the Demonic Flame for the moment could only restrain it.

After watching for a while Yang Kai relaxed slightly — so long as the Demonic Flame could stall it, that would suffice.

The incident did not leave him angry or fearful; rather, it made him more convinced his conjecture was right.

The little snake's spiritual remnant was broken and pitifully weak, otherwise it would not have remained here instead of fleeing; the prior chase and flight must have already exhausted it. Even so, a single gush of azure radiance from it held such force that at full strength it could likely have blown him to ashes in one breath.

It had to be the remnant soul of an ancient Great Dragon — otherwise how could it possess such terrifying power?

After expelling that azure radiance the already feeble little snake grew even weaker, hanging its head and becoming translucent as if it might dissipate at any moment.

Seeing this, Yang Kai wasted no more time; he immediately withdrew the pearl and that length of bone, stuffed them into his Black Book Space, and sealed them away.

He had no mind to mine the Saint Crystal; this trip underground had yielded not only the heave-and-earth treasure Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, but also what appeared to be a dragon pearl and Dragon Bone — the haul was beyond imagining.

He sat cross-legged and began to expel and combat the azure energy that had invaded his body.

With his Saint Yuan surging, Yang Kai concentrated his Demonic Flame in his hand; the black fire burned more fiercely in an instant, the blaze seeming to threaten to consume the very space around it.

The azure mist that had been able to contend with the Demonic Flame now retreated step by step; though swift, it was steadily forced out of his body by Yang Kai.

Drops of azure fluid seeped from Yang Kai's fingertips and fell to the ground with a plinking sound.

Two days later Yang Kai rose to his feet, flexed his hand, and found everything normal; only then did he nod faintly and ease his mind.

He glanced back at the Saint Crystal vein he had been mining and then set about hollowing out the ten zhang in front of him, removing any trace so no one would discover this place.

Once he had removed ten zhang of Saint Crystal he turned away without regret and departed.

In another passage Chang Qi was still bent over his digging, his face aglow — it seemed he believed a breakthrough was close and, with such enormous wealth before him, Chang Qi's face was flushed with joy.

When Yang Kai approached, Chang Qi could not help but ask, "Why have you stopped mining the Saint Crystal?"

"I'm done with mining. Guest Elder, are you staying here?" Yang Kai asked.

"Of course I'll stay!" Chang Qi answered without hesitation. "There is so much Saint Crystal here, even if we kept collecting until the Flowing Flame Sandland closed we wouldn't finish. Yang Kai, are you leaving?"

“Mm, I still have some matters to attend to, so I can’t stay any longer,” Yang Kai replied. He didn’t try to persuade Chang Qi otherwise—after all, that many Saint Crystals were indeed an immense fortune for him. After days of gathering, Yang Kai had collected roughly four million Saint Crystals, and even if Chang Qi’s speed was far slower, he would have obtained at least half that amount — around two million.

Numbers like that were unimaginable to him before.

Later when he advanced to the Origin Returning Realm he would need to purchase far stronger Secret Treasures, so naturally he wanted to build some capital.

The heaven-and-earth treasure area was enticing as well, but it was equally fraught with danger — not only demonic beasts but also other warriors. If one ran into people like Qu Changfeng or Meng Hongliang, one might be killed for the treasure. It was far better to stay here in safety and secure a steady income.

Chang Qi understood this clearly, and so did Yang Kai, thus Yang Kai did not try to persuade him.

After thinking for a moment Yang Kai said, "Take this sword; it will speed up your gathering."

Saying so, he formed his Golden Blood into a golden sword and handed it over; the reason Yang Kai could mine faster than others was because he wielded such a tool.

Chang Qi took the golden sword and lightly wiped its edge; a thoughtful expression crossed his face before he smiled. "The last time in the Starry Sky our ship was surrounded by Black Rock Beasts — you were the one who saved us, weren't you?"

When Yang Kai first came here a few days earlier Chang Qi had noticed the golden sword in his hand because it radiated vigor and a potent qi-and-blood force, appearing less like a weapon and more like a living being. But at the time, thinking only of the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, Chang Qi hadn't asked.

Now that Yang Kai handed the sword over and Chang Qi directly felt its aura he understood a little of what had happened.

He had encountered that aura once before in the Starry Sky when the Haike Family's ship was in dire straits and a golden spear suddenly appeared, sweeping through the Black Rock Beast pack and saving dozens of warriors from peril.

The aura emitted by that golden spear was identical to the one within the golden sword.

At the time he and Wu Yi assumed some high-level expert had passed by and helped, but now he realized there had been no such passerby — it had been Yang Kai's doing.

Back then he had only been in the Third Stage of the Saint Realm... thinking of that rank left Chang Qi shaken and increasingly convinced Yang Kai was no ordinary person.

Hearing him ask that, Yang Kai merely smiled without replying, tacitly admitting it. "Using the golden sword will consume some of its stored energy each time, but it should last three to four months. With it you should save a lot of trouble. As for Shen Shitao and the others… don't worry, she's decent and won't mean you harm; besides, if you leave early she will be even less likely to act against you unless she wishes to be punished by me."

"I know that, don't worry. Leave as you must — once the Flowing Flame Sandland closes I'll go to Dragon Lair Mountain with Old Hao to find you," Chang Qi nodded.

"Good."

After bidding Chang Qi farewell, Yang Kai returned to the surface the way he had come.

Though the passage was as smooth as jade, it posed no difficulty for Yang Kai; with a bit of effort he climbed up.

Standing on the grass-choked plain, Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense and, finding no one nearby, concealed the entrance to the underground cavern to prevent discovery.

He then took out his Yuan Magnetic Pointer to confirm the direction of the third stage of the Flowing Flame Sandland and proceeded straight toward it.

The plain was vast; two days later Yang Kai finally emerged from it.

He had encountered no one on the way, nor any spiritual herbs or medicines to gather.

Yang Kai’s thoughts were fixed on the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone, so his speed was extremely fast.

Wei Guchang had warned that the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone was impassable — throughout history everyone who tried to enter had perished, so before coming to the Flowing Flame Sandland Qian Tong had especially warned them not to venture into the Third Stage.

Yang Kai did not know exactly what perils lay there, but refining the Profound Yin Moon Water required an intensely hot environment; the First Layer could not meet his needs, so he had to investigate the third.

If the Third Layer proved too dangerous he would have to find another way.
