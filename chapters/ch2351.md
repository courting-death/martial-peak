## Chapter 2351 — Gao City

The icy longsword shattered the sky, pressing forward relentlessly, just like Luo Bing’s cold and resolute heart.

This sword was destined to strike empty air, because the gap in strength between Luo Bing and Yang Kai was too great. Before she was even halfway there, Yang Kai had already controlled the wooden boat and disappeared without a trace.

Yet, this sword did not miss its mark.

A burly figure suddenly appeared in front of Luo Bing, gazing at her with eyes full of pity and mixed emotions.

Caught off guard, Luo Bing could not stop in time. With a soft squelch, the longsword pierced directly into the chest of that burly figure, sinking three inches deep as blood splattered.

Luo Bing stood frozen on the spot, completely stunned. Staring blankly at that towering figure, she cried out, “Eldest Brother!”

The one who had suddenly blocked her path and let the longsword pierce his own chest was actually Chai Hu.

With Chai Hu’s cultivation at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, dodging this sword would have been effortless. Even if he didn’t want to dodge, he could have easily blocked it by circulating his Origin Qi. But he did none of that, instead letting Luo Bing vent her sword strike on him.

Luo Bing, who had resolved to die, finally panicked. She had come here to ambush and attack, never intending to leave alive. If she couldn’t kill Yang Kai, she wanted to die by his hand, to reunite with her father in the Underworld.

She had come here with the resolve to die, yet she ended up hurting Chai Hu.

Chai Hu’s chest was quickly soaked in crimson. Luo Bing’s pupils dilated, and that patch of red seemed to blot out all the light before her, filling her entire world with this terrifying blood glow.

The immense shock to her mind made Luo Bing’s delicate body go limp, and she nearly collapsed to the ground.

Chai Hu reached out to steady her—not only supporting her, but directly grabbing both her arms and slowly dragging her toward him.

Luo Bing had no strength to resist. It didn’t matter that she was being dragged over by Chai Hu, but the sharp sword in her hand was still lodged in his chest. As she moved, the sword sank even deeper.

Hiss, hiss, hiss…

The sound of metal grinding against flesh was piercingly harsh. In the blink of an eye, the longsword passed straight through his chest. Luo Bing’s beautiful face turned deathly pale as she cried out in panic, “Eldest Brother, what are you doing? Stop it!”

But no matter how she shouted, Chai Hu remained unmoved.

Chi Yue and the others’ faces changed dramatically. None of them had expected Chai Hu to do such a thing. By the time they reacted, Chai Hu had already pulled Luo Bing right up to his chest and whispered in her ear, “Young Master Yang killed your father. I have repaid that debt for him. Don’t go after him.”

“Stop, stop! I won’t seek revenge anymore, I won’t go after him, Eldest Brother, let go!” Luo Bing burst into tears, feeling the warmth soaking her chest. How could she not know it was Chai Hu’s blood? She was at a complete loss, her heart full of guilt. If she hadn’t overestimated herself and caused such a scene, Chai Hu would never have acted this way.

She hadn’t known Chai Hu for long, nor were they close. But in her most difficult and dangerous moment, it was Chai Hu who descended like a divine soldier to save her from dire straits. Even if he had his own reasons for saving her, Luo Bing could never forget that towering figure who had suddenly appeared.

In that instant, a young girl’s feelings were stirred, and the softest part of her heart was branded with his image.

These months of wandering made her miss that sense of safety even more. The faint feelings in her heart fermented like aged wine, growing stronger and clearer, impossible to dispel.

Yet at this moment, upon seeing him again, her longsword had pierced his chest, running him through and nearly costing him his life. Were her years of pampered, carefree living all for this moment of heart-wrenching pain?

If so, she would rather have lived those years in poverty and simplicity, as long as he could remain safe and sound.

“Get out of the way!” Chi Yue shouted in fury, swinging her hand and sending Luo Bing flying, crashing heavily to the ground.

Ghost Ancestor and the others hurried forward to check on Chai Hu’s injuries.

After falling, Luo Bing paid no attention to herself. Instead, she scrambled and crawled toward Chai Hu, her beautiful face a mess of tears, full of guilt and regret.

After a moment, Ghost Ancestor sighed softly and said, "Fortunately, it didn’t injure his heart meridian. It’s not too serious."

As he spoke, he took out a Pill and stuffed it into Chai Hu’s mouth. With a surge of Origin Qi, he shook the longsword out, then channeled his power into Chai Hu’s body to help him absorb the medicine and heal.

“I’ll take him back to recover first,” Ghost Ancestor said, already carrying Chai Hu and flying off toward Thousand Leaves Sect.

Before leaving, Chai Hu coughed lightly and said, “Don’t make things difficult for her. She has her own troubles.”

Chi Yue sighed, “What a mess this is.”

Today’s commotion was utterly baffling, but Chi Yue vaguely sensed something. It seemed her fourth brother and this little princess from Tianhe City had some kind of situation.

In no time, everyone else had left, leaving only Chi Yue standing there with furrowed brows.

Luo Bing was half-kneeling on the ground, gazing in the direction Chai Hu had gone, weeping bitterly and murmuring, “I won’t seek revenge anymore, Eldest Brother, don’t die!”

She kept repeating those words, her tears falling like broken pearls, forgetting that Chai Hu had long since gone and could not hear her.

Seeing her like this, even Chi Yue couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy. She said in a low voice, “He won’t die. Your sword didn’t hurt him badly.”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing suddenly looked up at Chi Yue, crying with relief, “Thank you, thank you!” As she spoke, she pressed her palms together, closed her beautiful eyes to the heavens, and let her tears stream down her cheeks.

“Sigh, take care of yourself,” Chi Yue said, her figure flickering as she hurried after the others.

Only Luo Bing was left, praying devoutly, her sorrowful beauty filling the wilderness.

……

A month later, Yang Kai arrived at a city called Gao City.

This city was roughly on the border of the Southern Territory, not far from the Eastern Territory.

He had come here to make a trip to Netherworld Sect and seek out Yin Lesheng for news of Xiaoxiao. According to his guess, after Xiaoxiao emerged from the Starlight Passage, there was a good chance he ended up with Yin Lesheng.

As for how to inquire, Yang Kai could only play it by ear. He couldn’t just approach Yin Lesheng directly, since there was still enmity between them, and the other party knew he possessed a Stellar Origin.

Netherworld Sect was in the Eastern Territory, a powerful force on par with Qingyang Shrine.

All this information had been told to him by Ye Hen, who also mentioned that among the entire Star Realm, the Southern Territory had the fewest cultivation resources and the thinnest Spiritual Qi, so the overall level of its cultivators was lower.

In the other three great territories, the overall level of cultivators was much higher than in the Southern Territory. Take the Eastern Territory, for example—there were at least ten powerful sects like Netherworld Sect, while the Southern Territory had only four, showing the disparity.

The Eastern Territory also had a hegemonic sect: the Soul Palace, founded by Great Emperor Youhun, one of the ten Great Emperors, was located there.

There were even rumors that the famous Spirit Beast Island and Dragon Isle were both above the Eastern Sea, but no one could confirm this, as those two divine islands were far too elusive for ordinary cultivators.

Perhaps influenced by Great Emperor Youhun, many sects and cultivators in the Eastern Territory practiced evil arts. Netherworld Sect was one such example, so the cultivation atmosphere in the Eastern Territory was completely different from that of the Southern Territory.

Traveling in the Eastern Territory required constant vigilance; one never knew when a villain might try to take your life.

Over the past month, Yang Kai had passed through many cities, using Space Arrays in those cities. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to reach Gao City on the Southern Territory’s border in just a month.

If he had relied solely on flying, with his current speed and cultivation, it would have taken decades to get here. The vastness of the Star Realm was beyond his imagination.

After arriving in Gao City, Yang Kai didn’t rush into the Eastern Territory. Instead, he found an inn and settled in first.

Because this was the border between the Eastern and Southern Territories, in Gao City one could see cultivators from both regions. Yang Kai stayed here to gather information about the Eastern Territory, especially about Netherworld Sect, so he wouldn’t be completely in the dark when he entered.

On the streets of Gao City, among the stream of cultivators, many exuded wild, evil, and violent auras. Even their appearances were fierce and hideous—clearly members of certain sects from the Eastern Territory.

The public order in Gao City was also extremely chaotic. Although there was a City Lord’s mansion and powerful experts overseeing things, Yang Kai had only been here a day and had already witnessed several brawls, with even a few deaths.

Such things were unimaginable in Fenglin City. In fact, even in other cities of the Southern Territory, this would never happen.

During those brawls, Yang Kai clearly sensed the presence of many experts hiding nearby, but no one intervened. Only after the fights ended did those hidden experts appear, arrest all the fighters, strip the dead of their Spatial Rings, and leave the corpses lying in the street, completely ignored.

These experts were clearly from the City Lord’s mansion. Judging by their behavior, it seemed they were eager for bloodshed in the city, so they’d have an excuse to arrest people and line their own pockets.

Yang Kai had no intention of causing trouble. He wanted to find a teahouse or restaurant to stay in for a few days, since such places were full of all sorts of people, making it easy to overhear useful information.

After asking around, Yang Kai headed toward the largest teahouse in Gao City, Yueting Teahouse.

Soon, Yang Kai arrived in front of it. Looking up, he saw that it was indeed grand, five stories tall. In such a chaotic and expensive place, having a teahouse like this showed that its owner had a powerful background, likely connected to the City Lord’s mansion.

Yang Kai stepped inside, and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by a waiter.
