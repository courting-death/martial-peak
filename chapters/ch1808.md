## Chapter 1808 — Void King Realm

Xue Yue suddenly pointed and said, "Look! There seems to be some movement in there."

Through the faint, flickering rifts in that patch of space, some astounding scenes vaguely imprinted themselves on everyone's view.

"This... the more I look, the more it resembles that damned place." Ghost Ancestor almost bit his tongue; though the rifts were minuscule and unstable, he still glimpsed a scene like a Floating Continent suspended in midair.

"Is this the place Yang Kai went into?" Xue Yue asked in wonder.

"Mm, if I wasn't mistaken, it should be." Ghost Ancestor glanced toward Ni Guang and Xue Yue. "But... did you hear anything?"

Xue Yue shook her head, but Ni Guang's face grew grave and he nodded, saying, "I faintly heard thunder, and the aura leaking from those rifts... that kid wasn't at the verge of a breakthrough, was he?"

"You mean... all this commotion was caused by a Baptism?" Ghost Ancestor's expression changed.

“Doesn’t it look like it?” Ni Guang countered.

"It does look like it, but that damned place and here are still two separate spaces; even if Yang Kai were breaking through to the Void King Realm, he shouldn't be able to stir up such a spectacle, right?" Ghost Ancestor's mouth twitched, and after speaking he fell silent.

Others might not be able to make such a show, but Yang Kai was a different story.

He was versed in spatial power; if it truly was him breaking into the Void King Realm and causing two spaces to intersect, it was possible.

"If that's the case, the kid's in danger." Ni Guang said in a low voice.

"What do you mean?" Xue Yue went pale with alarm.

"The energy is terrifying. I don't know if he can withstand it." Ni Guang frowned.

A failed ascent to the Void King Realm carried severe consequences; this was no ordinary early-stage advancement where a weak martial artist's failed breakthrough posed little issue.

At the Void King Realm tier, one failure led to only two outcomes: grievous injury or death.

The latter had a probability of over eighty percent.

Ni Guang, Ghost Ancestor and the others exchanged worried looks. Over on the other side, Zi Long, Xu Wei and Kong Fa were also pointing toward the same spot and drew the same conclusion—that Yang Kai might be ascending to the Void King Realm!

Zi Long's face turned ashen.

He wasn't afraid of Yang Kai succeeding; even if Yang Kai truly became a Void King, it would only be the First Stage of the Void King Realm, and someone like that still failed to impress him.

What he feared was Yang Kai failing to ascend!

If that kid died in there, where would he go to find the Everlasting Tree?

"That bastard!" Zi Long cursed angrily while feeling helpless.

In the patch of space above the Chaos Abyss, the strange disturbances persisted without cease. Everyone watched anxiously, fearing Yang Kai would encounter some mishap.

The situation lasted a full day's time before the turbulent space gradually calmed and the muffled thunder faded.

"Did he make it?" Xue Yue was like an ant on a hot pan, itching to rush into the Floating Continent and see for herself.

Ni Guang and Ghost Ancestor both wore impassive faces and remained silent.

By this time, the outcome must have already become clear, but they could not discern whether Yang Kai had succeeded and could only wait anxiously.

On the Floating Continent—where Yang Kai had broken through—the hundred li around him had been flattened into a colossal pit.

At the very center of the crater lay a pitch-black figure sprawled out in the shape of a great cross — who else could it be but Yang Kai?

A smell of singed flesh hung in the air.

"This is serious!" Yang Kai looked up at the boundless sky, a twitch at his mouth as pain coursed through him; it felt as if every bone in his body had shattered and his flesh ground to dust—any movement tugged at every nerve, making him want to cry out.

He had never expected the Heaven-and-Earth Baptism for ascending to the Void King Realm to be so violent.

On his path of cultivation he had always passed through great-realm breakthroughs with more luck than peril; this time, he had almost died.

Even his Undying Five Elements Sword form nearly fractured under the Heaven-and-Earth Energy; in the end he was forced to use the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique to barely withstand the final moment.

The Dragon Transformation Secret Technique had not yet faded; dragon scales covered his right arm and his right hand had become a dragon claw. Even that dragon arm had been torn, scales flayed and flesh mangled.

It was a bloody sight, but once he sensed his new realm, Yang Kai couldn't help but grin foolishly.

He had reached the Void King Realm!

After so many years, he had finally set foot in the domain of the Void King Realm.

Feeling the surging, inexhaustible power within his body and a fundamentally different comprehension of the Martial Dao, Yang Kai felt the suffering had been worth it.

From the Origin Returning Realm to the Void King Realm, it was like stepping into an entirely new world.

After resting for a short while, Yang Kai rolled up from the ground, forcing himself past the pain, and grabbed a Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring, not even checking what it was before stuffing it into his mouth and chewing ravenously.

Mind and intent united, he guarded his Dantian.

This was unquestionably the best time to consolidate his cultivation; he wasn't about to waste it.

The dragon scales on his right arm receded piece by piece as a faint golden light shimmered. The wounds across his body healed visibly; as flesh knit, strong surges of power rolled out.

The golden light grew until the place he stood was completely bathed in it, his figure hidden.

The activity of his Golden Blood was far more intense than before.

A day later, the golden light dispersed, revealing Yang Kai's muscular frame.

His exposed skin was crusted with dried blood; with a light shake those scabs crumbled to dust, revealing flesh beneath that looked newly born.

"Oh—Wudao Pill!" Yang Kai suddenly remembered and rummaged in his Spatial Ring. A moment later he produced a jade vial and poured out three Spiritual Pills.

They were the three Wudao Pills he had previously refined.

One bore clear Pill Patterns; the other two lacked them but were still of very high grade.

"This is the one." Yang Kai pinched the Wudao Pill with Pill Patterns and popped it into his mouth, absorbing its medicine while using it to gain insight into the truth of the Martial Dao.

His aura grew purer and more condensed; a Martial Dao intent that seemed capable of drawing Heaven-and-Earth resonance spread out from him...

Only after a full half month did Yang Kai suddenly open his eyes and exhale a long breath.

His gaze was ordinary, like that of an everyday person; even the wild Saint Yuan fluctuations from his breakthrough were completely suppressed.

"Not bad," Yang Kai muttered. "Though the realm hasn't fully stabilized, it's close enough." He moved his Divine Sense and an invisible force exploded outward from him.

Instantly, within a thousand zhang around him, the space abruptly thickened and grew heavy, and in that space rifts began to waver into being and vanish, like invisible beasts opening huge maws.

Domain!

After ascending to the Void King Realm, Yang Kai's Shi finally transformed into a Domain! Moreover, it was a Domain fused with his spatial power, far stronger than that of common Void King Realm experts.

Within that Domain, he was absolute master.

Thus, for a Void King to annihilate someone of the Origin Returning Realm was extremely simple; the Origin Returning Realm's Shi could only affect and disturb others, but inside a Domain Field a Void King Realm expert could do as he pleased.

With a thought the Domain Field dissipated. Yang Kai glanced around, then leapt into the air and silently called his Blood Beasts and Stone Puppets, and Liu Yan.

After a moment, all the Blood Beasts flew back and turned into Golden Blood Threads that returned into his body; the Stone Puppet returned too. Only Liu Yan observed Yang Kai for a moment before saying, "Congratulations, Master, on ascending to the Void King Realm!"

"Heh, just a lucky escape." Yang Kai laughed lightly. "Don't worry, I'll raise your strength too."

Liu Yan brightened and respectfully replied, "Thank you, Master."

As an Artifact Spirit, even though she had already refined her true body—the Refining Furnace—and could control it at will, improving her strength was by no means an easy task. Unless she could devour something like the Qiantian Thunderfire, advancement would be extremely difficult for her.

But with Yang Kai's promise, Liu Yan was completely reassured.

Yang Kai carried Sun's True Essence!

As long as she could swallow some Sun's True Fire, her strength would not stagnate.

"Mm, return to the Xuan Realm Pearl for now; I've placed the Sun's True Essence there. Absorb as much as you can, but do not be greedy."

"Yes!" Liu Yan rejoiced and vanished in a flash. In the next moment she appeared within the Xuan Realm Pearl, quickly locating the Sun's True Essence. She happily transformed into a Fire Bird and wrapped herself around it.

After handling those matters, Yang Kai turned his gaze in a direction, his brow furrowing. He then shifted and arrived several dozen li away.

Lü Guichen still sat there, his complexion pale and listless. When he noticed Yang Kai's arrival he looked up and offered a bitter smile.

"Overreaching!" Yang Kai shook his head. He knew why Lü Guichen was in such a state; though he had been breaking through himself, that didn't mean he was oblivious to the outside world.

On the contrary, Lü Guichen being crushed by the power of the Heavenly Baptism was something he had witnessed clearly from beginning to end.

No matter how severe a martial artist's physical or Divine Sense injuries, they could be recovered; but if a martial artist's Martial Dao heart—their will—collapsed, even a Great Emperor might be powerless.

Because that was his own issue; only by staunching his belief himself could he recover.

Yang Kai and Lü Guichen were not close and there was tension between them; Yang Kai not killing Lü Guichen was more than enough mercy, and he had no time for consoling words.

So he merely glanced at him and then ignored him.

Next, his Divine Sense spread outward, extending into the inner reaches of the Floating Continent.

He wanted to see how the Incarnation's refinement of the Stellar Origin was progressing.
