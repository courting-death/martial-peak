## Chapter 248 — Trouble Has Escalated (Part Four)

Yao He lightly coughed and looked at Yang Kai, saying, “Since you are willing to submit to us, you must know what we intend to do with you, right?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I know, it’s just a bug, isn’t it?”

Yao He smiled slightly, “Indeed. Although we are pleased that you have turned from darkness to light, we do not know much about you. Planting a Control Soul Insect is merely a precaution. If you perform well in the future, there will be benefits for you.”

“Thank you for your support, big brother,” Yang Kai flattered.

“Extend your hand,” Yao He said, glancing triumphantly at Zi Mo before commanding Yang Kai.

Yang Kai boldly extended one hand.

Yao He took out a Control Soul Insect of his own and was about to place it in Yang Kai's hand when Yao Xi suddenly shouted, “Wait!”

“What’s wrong?” Yao He turned to look at her.

Yao Xi's expression was wary as she glanced at Yang Kai, then at Zi Mo, and suddenly let out a cold laugh.

Yao He’s expression changed slightly as he understood the meaning behind his cousin's gaze. In an instant, sweat beaded on his forehead. He had been focused on suppressing Zi Mo’s arrogance by humiliating her through the means of subduing Yang Kai, yet he had not considered whether this was a trap!

If this was a trap, then…

Fortunately, his cousin was clever. Realizing this, Yao He hurriedly took back the insect, watching Yang Kai warily, and said, “Channel the cultivation method you practice and let me see your Yuan Qi attribute!”

The nemesis of the Control Soul Insect was heat; any martial artist who cultivated Yang attribute or fire attribute techniques could not be controlled. If the insect was burned, their soul would be injured!

Thus, among the group of Great Han martial artists, one from the Lie Huo Sect had already been killed without leaving a trace.

As soon as Yao He finished speaking, Zi Mo scoffed disdainfully.

The few people from Great Han involuntarily tensed up, especially Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu. Yang Kai had only fought in front of them, and this couple naturally knew Yang Kai’s Yuan Qi attribute. They had not thought of this until Leng Shan quietly reminded them, and only then did they realize. But now, the other party wanted to investigate Yang Kai’s Yuan Qi attribute. They could not help but feel anxious, fearing that Yang Kai would expose himself.

Han Xiao Qi and Ye Han exchanged glances, quietly signaling Hua Ruoyin and Liu Qingru. The four girls from Wan Hua Palace were secretly channeling their True Essence, ready to act at any moment.

Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba were doing the same.

…

Yao Xi stared directly at Yang Kai, coldly scolding, “I told you to channel your technique, did you hear me?”

Hundreds of Demonic Beasts nearby were beginning to stir restlessly.

Yang Kai quickly nodded and then forced out the energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body.

A faint black aura spread out, enveloping Yang Kai completely. This black aura was mixed with a violent, bloody, and murderous scent, making Yang Kai appear somewhat evil.

Upon sensing the attribute of this energy, Yao He and Yao Xi gradually relaxed their expressions.

As long as it was not heat attribute Yuan Qi, the Control Soul Insect had nothing to fear!

“Is this the evil technique you practice?” Yao He looked at Yang Kai with curiosity.

“Hmm.”

“Your strength is a bit low, barely at the True Essence Realm. How did you survive?” Yao He found it hard to understand.

Yang Kai felt quite awkward, “About half a year ago, I accidentally fell into a valley and spent a great deal of effort to climb back up. As soon as I emerged, I was captured by that woman surnamed Zi.”

Yao He chuckled, “You really have bad luck.”

However, this could explain why he had survived until now. Falling into a valley at the Separation and Union Realm would indeed require a slow climb back up.

“Extend your hand,” Yao He’s demeanor relaxed significantly, and Yao Xi no longer paid attention to Yang Kai.

What kind of waves could a small martial artist practicing an evil technique stir up?

Yao He directly tossed a Control Soul Insect into Yang Kai's hand. The insect instantly burrowed into Yang Kai's body, racing along his meridians toward his Dantian with incredible speed.

“Get lost! We’ll call for you when needed. Now, we need to have a good talk with Senior Sister,” Yao He waved his hand at Yang Kai dismissively.

Yang Kai grinned at him.

This smile sent a chill down Yao He’s spine. Before he could react, Zi Mo suddenly moved, stepping forward and charging at Yao He.

“Bitch… ah…” Yao He had just shouted two words when he let out a heart-wrenching scream, his legs going weak as he collapsed to the ground, clutching his head, his face contorted as if he were suffering the most vicious torture in the world.

His soul was injured. No one could endure the pain of that moment!

Zi Mo brushed past Yao He, ignoring him, and directly struck at Yao Xi.

The change occurred too quickly; Yao Xi hadn’t even had time to react before she was hit in the chest by Zi Mo, her soft bosom deforming as she was sent flying, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood mid-air.

Before she could land, she saw the Great Han martial artist who had always been obsequious and flattering towards them, delivering a palm strike to Yao He’s neck.

With a crisp crack, Yao He’s scream abruptly ceased, his head drooping lifelessly.

“No!” Yao Xi exclaimed, her heart racing as she quickly issued commands. The dozens of Demonic Beasts she controlled rushed towards this side, moving like the wind.

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. After taking Yao He’s life, he had already moved, charging behind Yao Xi with clenched fists, striking forward.

Just as Yao Xi landed, she was met with a Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

With a loud boom, True Yang Yuan Qi surged into her body, directly turning her light injuries into severe wounds, sending her flying back toward Zi Mo.

Zi Mo crossed her palms, urging her True Essence, and ruthlessly struck Yao Xi three or four times, her expression cold and merciless.

At this moment, Yao Xi finally had a chance to counterattack. She hurriedly blocked Zi Mo’s lethal strikes, landing on the ground, gasping for breath, and screamed, “Kill them!”

The ones she called upon were naturally the Great Han martial artists she had planted Control Soul Insects in.

Seventeen or eighteen people, she and Yao He each controlled half, meaning she could still control the lives and deaths of about nine people.

But none of the Great Han martial artists responded to her!

“This is what you brought upon yourselves,” Yao Xi’s face turned pale as she glared angrily at the approaching Yang Kai and Zi Mo, screaming viciously.

On the Great Han side, two people suddenly collapsed, clutching their stomachs in agony, rolling on the ground!

Yang Kai and Zi Mo exchanged glances, their speed increasing.

Yao Xi was only at the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm; even Yang Kai could easily kill her now, let alone with her previous injuries and facing Zi Mo, who was at the Sixth Stage of the True Essence Realm?

After a few exchanges, Yao Xi had one of her arms crippled by Zi Mo. Yang Kai’s finger produced a drop of Yang Liquid, transforming into a long sword, and with one strike, he severed Yao Xi’s head.

Until her death, Yao Xi’s eyes remained wide open, unable to close them!

From the moment Yang Kai suddenly attacked until Yao Xi’s demise, merely seven or eight breaths had passed. This battle could only be described as a flash of lightning.

With two sect members dead, Zi Mo remained expressionless.

Yang Kai roared to the heavens, “The Demonic Beasts are about to riot. Defend with all your might, do not seek to harm the enemy, only seek to protect yourselves!”

Over a hundred Demonic Beasts nearby were all under the control of Yao He and Yao Xi, but now that the two had died, these Demonic Beasts became unowned. According to the information Zi Mo had provided earlier, once Demonic Beasts broke free from control, they would violently attack, becoming much more aggressive. However, as long as they sensed pressure, they would still choose to retreat!

With so many Demonic Beasts, the Great Han martial artists could not cope at all. Not to mention that two of their own had already fallen and needed care, even if they were all unharmed, they were no match.

As soon as Yang Kai’s words fell, the more than fifty Demonic Beasts controlled by Yao He charged towards the Great Han group.

This group consisted of the elite of their respective sects. Moreover, with Leng Shan’s earlier reminder, they were not completely caught off guard. They surrounded the two martial artists who had been exhausted by the Control Soul Insects in the middle, while the others spread out on the periphery, working together to resist the oncoming Demonic Beasts.

The four girls from Wan Hua Palace formed a small formation, collectively unleashing a visible Yuan Qi. The four streams of Yuan Qi met and fused in mid-air.

Han Xiao Qi lightly shouted, “Four Symbols Seal!”

The merging Yuan Qi transformed into a cage, falling from the sky and directly trapping three or four Demonic Beasts within. As the four girls changed their hand gestures, a sea of flowers floated within the cage, each petal resembling a small sword. They flew and intertwined within the cage, harboring infinite killing intent. The Demonic Beasts charged left and right but could not break through this cage. In just a moment, they were cut to pieces by the countless petals, bleeding profusely and collapsing to the ground.

Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba from the Shura Sect were enveloped in a blood light, their killing intent soaring. Ye Qingsi, being a woman, fought with a certain grace, unleashing various blood-like martial techniques that gave off a bewitching aura.

In contrast, Zhou Ba, like an iron tower, directly grabbed a Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast and violently tore it apart. Accompanied by the beast's roar, the Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast was instantly split in half, blood flowing like a fountain, innards spilling everywhere, making Zhou Ba appear like a god of slaughter, his expression ferocious.

Zhou Ba grinned, revealing a mouthful of fangs, bringing the Demonic Beast's corpse to his mouth and tearing off a piece of flesh, chewing it incessantly, blood dripping grotesquely.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu teamed up to kill enemies, using the secret technique of the Yingyue Sect, the Full Moon, once again unleashing a torrent of moonlight that penetrated the bodies of the Demonic Beasts. This technique was a large-scale attack secret art, and once unleashed, it significantly reduced the pressure on everyone.

Twin Island, Fei Yu Pavilion, Wen Xin Palace… the martial artists from various sects were all desperately channeling their True Essence, unleashing their killing moves. In an instant, the roars of beasts echoed, shouts rang out, and colorful lights flickered, stabilizing the situation. Although they could not break through, they would not be overwhelmed by the Demonic Beasts in the short term.

“We are in big trouble!” Yang Kai and Zi Mo stood back to back, their expressions grave.

Before dying, Yao Xi had issued an attack command to the more than fifty Demonic Beasts she controlled. Now, they were completely surrounded, and the situation was dire.

“Let’s go join them!” Zi Mo said, turning around and wrapping her arms around Yang Kai’s waist, pushing off the ground to fly into the air.

“This…” Yang Kai sniffed, feeling quite embarrassed.

“I’m saving your life!” Zi Mo huffed lightly.

“Two clear!” Yang Kai chuckled, then shouted over, “Make some space!”

Leng Shan looked up and then stepped aside.

As soon as a gap opened up, Zi Mo and Yang Kai slipped in, joining the others.
