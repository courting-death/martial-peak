## Chapter 248 — Trouble Has Arisen

Yao He lightly coughed and looked at Yang Kai, saying, “Since you are willing to submit to us, you must know what we intend to do with you, right?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I know. Isn’t it just a bug?”

Yao He smiled slightly, “Indeed. Although we are pleased that you have turned from darkness to light, we do not know much about you. Planting a Control Soul Insect is merely a precaution. If you perform well in the future, you will certainly benefit.”

“Thank you, big brother, for your guidance,” Yang Kai said flatteringly.

“Extend your hand,” Yao He said, casting a proud glance at Zi Mo before turning to Yang Kai and issuing the command.

Yang Kai boldly extended one hand.

Yao He took out one of his Control Soul Insects and was about to place it in Yang Kai's hand when Yao Xi suddenly shouted, “Wait!”

“What’s wrong?” Yao He turned to look at her.

Yao Xi’s face was filled with vigilance as she glanced at Yang Kai, then at Zi Mo, and suddenly let out a cold laugh.

Yao He’s expression changed slightly as he understood the meaning in his cousin’s eyes. In an instant, sweat beaded on his forehead. He had been focused on suppressing Zi Mo’s arrogance by humiliating her through Yang Kai’s submission, yet he had not considered that this might be a trap!

If this is a trap, then...

Fortunately, his cousin was clever. Realizing this, Yao He quickly took back the insect and warily stared at Yang Kai, saying, “Channel your cultivation technique and let me see the attribute of your Primordial Qi!”

The nemesis of the Control Soul Insect is heat; any martial artist who has cultivated Yang attribute or fire attribute techniques cannot be controlled. If the insect is burned, their soul will also suffer damage!

Thus, among the group of Great Han martial artists, a member of the Lie Huo Sect had already been killed, not a single one left alive.

As soon as Yao He finished speaking, Zi Mo let out a disdainful laugh.

The few people from Great Han involuntarily tensed up, especially Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu. Yang Kai had only fought in front of them, and this couple naturally knew Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi attribute. They hadn’t thought of this before, until Leng Shan quietly reminded them, and only then did they realize. But now, the other party actually wanted to investigate Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi attribute. They couldn’t help but feel anxious, fearing that Yang Kai would expose himself.

Han Xiao Qi and Ye Han exchanged glances and quietly signaled to Hua Ruoyin and Liu Qingru. The four girls from Wan Hua Palace secretly began to channel their True Essence, ready to act at any moment.

Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba did the same.

...

Yao Xi stared straight at Yang Kai, coldly reprimanding, “I told you to channel your technique, did you hear me?”

The hundreds of Demonic Beasts nearby were beginning to stir restlessly.

Yang Kai quickly nodded and then forced out the energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body.

A faint black aura spread out, enveloping Yang Kai entirely. This black aura was mixed with a violent, bloody, and murderous scent, making Yang Kai appear somewhat evil.

As they sensed the attribute of this energy, Yao He and Yao Xi’s expressions gradually relaxed.

As long as it wasn’t heat attribute Primordial Qi, the Control Soul Insect would have nothing to fear!

“Is this the evil technique you cultivate?” Yao He looked at Yang Kai with curiosity.

“Mm.”

“Your strength is a bit low, barely at the True Essence Realm. How did you survive?” Yao He found it hard to understand.

Yang Kai felt quite awkward, “About half a year ago, I accidentally fell into a valley and spent a great deal of effort to climb back up. As soon as I emerged, I was captured by that woman surnamed Zi.”

Yao He chuckled, “You really have bad luck.”

But this did explain why he had survived until now. Falling into a valley at the Separation and Union Realm indeed required a slow climb back up.

“Extend your hand,” Yao He said, his demeanor greatly relaxed, and Yao Xi no longer paid attention to Yang Kai.

What kind of waves could a small martial artist who cultivated an evil technique possibly stir?

Yao He directly tossed a Control Soul Insect into Yang Kai's hand. The insect instantly burrowed into Yang Kai’s body, racing along his meridians towards his Dantian at an astonishing speed.

“Scram! We’ll call for you when needed. Now we need to have a good talk with Senior Sister,” Yao He waved his hand dismissively at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned at him.

That smile sent a chill down Yao He’s spine. Before he could react, Zi Mo suddenly moved, stepping forward and charging at Yao He.

“Bitch... ah...” Yao He had just shouted two words when he let out a horrifying scream, his legs giving way as he fell to the ground, clutching his head with both hands, his face contorted as if he were undergoing the most vicious torture imaginable.

His soul was injured. No one could endure the pain of that moment!

Zi Mo brushed past Yao He, ignoring him entirely, and directly struck towards Yao Xi with a palm.

The change happened too quickly; Yao Xi hadn’t even reacted when she was hit in the chest by Zi Mo, her chest deforming as she was sent flying, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood mid-air.

Before she could land, she saw the Great Han martial artist, who had always been obsequious and flattering, deliver a palm strike to Yao He’s neck.

With a crisp crack, Yao He’s screams abruptly ceased, his head drooping limply.

“No!” Yao Xi exclaimed in shock, quickly issuing commands in her heart. The dozens of Demonic Beasts she controlled rushed towards this side, their speed like the wind.

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. After taking Yao He’s life, he had already unfolded his steps, rushing to Yao Xi’s back, his fist clenched tightly as he struck forward.

Yao Xi had just landed when she was met with a Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

With a loud bang, True Yang Primordial Qi surged into her body, instantly turning her light injuries into severe wounds, sending her flying back towards Zi Mo.

Zi Mo crossed her palms, urging her True Essence, and ruthlessly struck Yao Xi three or four times, her expression cold and merciless.

At this moment, Yao Xi finally had a chance to counterattack, hurriedly blocking Zi Mo’s lethal strikes. She landed on the ground, gasping for breath, and screamed, “Kill them!”

The ones she called upon were naturally the Great Han martial artists who had been implanted with Control Soul Insects.

Seventeen or eighteen of them, she and Yao He each controlled half, meaning she still had the power over about nine lives.

But none of the Great Han martial artists responded to her!

“This is what you brought upon yourselves,” Yao Xi’s face turned pale as she glared at the approaching Yang Kai and Zi Mo, screaming viciously.

Suddenly, two people from the Great Han side collapsed, clutching their stomachs in agony, rolling on the ground!

Yang Kai and Zi Mo exchanged glances, their speed increasing.

Yao Xi was merely at the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm; even Yang Kai could easily kill her now, let alone with her previous injuries and facing Zi Mo, who was at the Sixth Stage of the True Essence Realm?

After a few exchanges, Yao Xi had one arm crippled by Zi Mo. Yang Kai formed a drop of Yang Liquid into a long sword, and with one strike, he severed Yao Xi’s head.

Until her death, Yao Xi’s eyes were wide open, unable to close them!

From the moment Yang Kai suddenly attacked until Yao Xi’s demise, only seven or eight breaths had passed. This battle could be described as a flash of lightning.

With two of their own dead, Zi Mo remained expressionless.

Yang Kai roared to the heavens, “The Demonic Beasts are about to riot! Defend with all your might, don’t seek to harm the enemy, only seek to protect yourselves!”

The more than a hundred Demonic Beasts nearby were all under the control of Yao He and Yao Xi. But now that the two of them were dead, these Demonic Beasts became unowned. According to the information Zi Mo had provided earlier, once Demonic Beasts broke free from control, they would go on a rampage, becoming increasingly aggressive. However, as long as they felt pressure, they would still choose to retreat!

With so many Demonic Beasts, the Great Han martial artists simply could not cope. Not to mention that two of them had already fallen and needed care; even if they were all intact, they were not a match.

As soon as Yang Kai’s voice fell, the more than fifty Demonic Beasts under Yao He’s control charged towards the Great Han group.

This group consisted of the elite of their respective sects. Moreover, with Leng Shan’s earlier reminder, they were not completely caught off guard. They surrounded the two martial artists who were exhausted from the Control Soul Insects, while the others spread out around them, working together to resist the oncoming Demonic Beasts.

The four girls from Wan Hua Palace formed a small formation, collectively unleashing a visible Primordial Qi. The four streams of Primordial Qi intertwined in mid-air.

Han Xiao Qi lightly called out, “Four Symbols Seal!”

The merging Primordial Qi transformed into a cage, falling from the sky and directly trapping three or four Demonic Beasts within. As the four girls changed their hand gestures, a sea of flowers rose within the cage, each petal resembling a small sword. They flew and intertwined within the cage, containing infinite killing intent. The Demonic Beasts charged left and right but could not break through this cage. In just a moment, they were drenched in blood and fell to the ground.

Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba from the Shura Sect were enveloped in a blood light, their killing intent soaring. Ye Qingsi, being a woman, fought with a certain grace, her various blood-like martial skills giving off a bewitching aura.

In contrast, Zhou Ba, like an iron tower, directly grabbed a Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast, tearing it apart with a roar. The beast was instantly split in two, blood flowing like a fountain, and its innards spilled everywhere, making Zhou Ba appear like a god of slaughter, his expression ferocious.

Zhou Ba grinned, revealing a mouthful of fangs, bringing the Demonic Beast's corpse to his mouth and tearing off a chunk of flesh, chewing relentlessly, blood dripping ominously.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu worked together to kill enemies, unleashing the secret technique of Yingyue Sect, the Full Moon, once again. The moonlight poured down, penetrating the bodies of the Demonic Beasts. This move was a large-scale attack secret technique, and once unleashed, it significantly relieved the pressure on everyone.

Twin Island, Fei Yu Pavilion, Wen Xin Palace... the martial artists from various sects were all desperately channeling their True Essence, unleashing their killing moves. In an instant, the roars of beasts and furious shouts filled the air, and the situation stabilized. Although they could not break through, they were not in immediate danger of being overwhelmed by the Demonic Beasts.

“We’re in big trouble!” Yang Kai and Zi Mo stood back to back, their expressions grave.

Before her death, Yao Xi had issued an attack order to the more than fifty Demonic Beasts she controlled. Now, they were completely surrounded, and the situation was dire.

“Let’s go join them!” Zi Mo said, turning around and wrapping her arms around Yang Kai’s waist. With a push of her feet, she flew into the air.

“This...” Yang Kai sniffled, feeling quite embarrassed.

“I’m saving your life!” Zi Mo huffed lightly.

“Two debts cleared!” Yang Kai chuckled and then shouted towards that side, “Make some space!”

Leng Shan looked up and then stepped aside.

As soon as the space was cleared, Zi Mo and Yang Kai slipped in, joining the others.
