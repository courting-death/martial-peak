## Chapter 2037 — Self-Destruction

As in the earlier scene where that Fei Sheng Palace disciple had died horribly, the moonlight unleashed by the Flourishing Moon Great Formation carried immense killing power, with corrosive, penetrating properties; those struck screamed as parts of their bodies dissolved, and in a very short time they were dead.

None of their protective Saint Yuan had any effect, and even martial artists' defensive Secret Treasures were corroded halfway through.

"Deacon Liu, save me!" One of them did not die immediately; moonlight had pierced a great hole through his abdomen, exposing writhing entrails that flailed as he flew toward Liu Yizhi, crying out for help.

Around the wound the corrosive power clung like maggots to bone, refusing to dissipate and rapidly eating away at the surrounding flesh; by the time he reached Liu Yizhi he had a larger hole in his belly and the white of bone showed.

With a slap, his head burst like a smashed watermelon.

The remaining Fei Sheng Palace disciples nearby were instantly silenced, each staring at Liu Yizhi in terror.

"He was beyond saving!" Liu Yizhi roared. "Better to end his suffering cleanly than let him endure!"

"Hahahaha!" Han Leng's loud laughter rang out. "Are the people of Fei Sheng Palace always so cruel? Han has learned something new today."

Liu Yizhi was stung by the taunt and flushed with anger. He shouted, "You, Han—if you have the guts, show yourself and fight Liu! Relying on a formation's power—what kind of skill is that?"

"Ridiculous—truly ridiculous. If my use of a formation's might doesn't count as real skill, then is ganging up on the few with sheer numbers something to be proud of?" Han Leng sneered.

Seeing provoking words had no effect, Liu Yizhi turned to the surviving Fei Sheng Palace disciples and barked, "What are you waiting for? If you want to live, strike the formation with everything you've got!"

Hearing this, they dared not tarry—each hurriedly unleashed their most potent, signature techniques, flinging desperate, indiscriminate strikes in every direction at the array.

Although Liu Yizhi's earlier brutality terrified them, they also knew he was right—once enveloped by the Flourishing Moon Great Formation, the only way to survive was to keep attacking.

"A bunch of jumping jesters!" Han Leng mocked; then his figure suddenly materialized in midair. He formed seals and countless streams of moonlight shot from the silver moons again; these rays gathered toward one spot and quickly coalesced into a massive beam of moonlight, radiating a terrifying, oppressive aura.

"Go!" Han Leng waved his hand and the huge moonbeam rushed toward a Fei Sheng Palace disciple with such speed there was no time to guard against it.

The disciple did not even have time to dodge; he was engulfed by the moonbeam and vanished between heaven and earth in an instant.

Liu Yizhi, it seemed, had been waiting for this moment; as soon as Han Leng's form appeared he spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood onto his longknife, which trembled slightly and vanished in place—when it reappeared it was already in front of Han Leng, slicing at him.


To Liu Yizhi's anxious gaze, Han Leng's figure suddenly seemed cleaved in two, torn down the middle.

Liu Yizhi's face brightened, but he soon realized something was wrong.

Although the figure appeared cut through, strangely no blood flowed; with a twist Han Leng simply vanished.

The figure Liu had struck was merely an illusory shadow—Han Leng himself had already concealed his body again.

Liu Yizhi frowned, the situation growing thorny. In terms of cultivation they were comparable and their combat strength matched; ordinarily he should not have been so clearly outmaneuvered, but with the aid of the Flourishing Moon Great Formation Han Leng's whereabouts were impossible to discern, leaving Liu only to receive blows and burn with anxiety.



The massive moonbeam did not dissipate but ricocheted within a radius of a hundred zhang, repeatedly striking; more Fei Sheng Palace disciples were completely dissolved.

Within a dozen breaths, only two Void King Realm warriors remained on the spot.

The two exchanged glances and saw in each other's eyes the urge to flee; they knew if they did not escape now they would surely die.

So the two flickered and shot toward where the tower-ship lay.

Moonlight flashed and engulfed one of them; he vanished without a cry. The last man managed to reach the deck and shouted, "Young Palace Lord, let me in!"

On the deck Ning Yuancheng stood, pale and alarmed; he ignored the disciple's plea and snapped irritably, "Get back—don't draw that thing over here!"


"Young Palace Lord—" The disciple looked at Ning Yuancheng in despair, but before he could finish, moonlight struck his back and tore a hole through his chest.

Boom—

The residual force of the moonlight struck the tower-ship's protective shield, producing a sizzling sound as though something corrosive were eating at it; the shield flickered wildly.

Ning Yuancheng stumbled back several steps and fell onto the deck.


Fortunately, the tower-ship was of high quality—seemingly Dao Origin-grade—and its defenses were strong; the residual moonlight failed to breach the shield.

"So that's it—I've finally got you!" At the instant the moonlight's force dimmed, Liu Yizhi suddenly appeared before the tower-ship and slashed with his longknife, blade light spraying through the void.

A figure suddenly appeared ahead—Han Leng, his face iron-gray; a tear in his robe showed the place where Liu Yizhi's earlier slash had struck.

The two stood facing each other before the tower-ship; Han Leng's face was sullen and Liu Yizhi likewise bore a grave expression.

"It seems you have seen through a clue," Han Leng said, his face a little pale as if maintaining the formation had drained him.

"Indeed." Liu Yizhi held his longknife across his front. "The Flourishing Moon Great Formation I had heard of, but seeing it today I know it is only an auxiliary formation—you think hiding in the moonlight will make Liu unable to see?"

Han Leng laughed heartily. "Deacon Liu indeed has sharp eyes. I tried to hide my traces, but I did not expect to be discovered by you."

"Since I have found your flaw, then today this place will be your grave!" Liu Yizhi pointed his longknife and his voice was icy.

Han Leng curled his lip. "We shall see if you have that ability."

He formed seals again and the countless silver moons trembled.

"Trying that old trick again?" Liu Yizhi barked. He slashed his longknife in a vicious sweep, blades of light streaking out as the power of the Laws unfurled, and to everyone's surprise the trembling silver moons stabilized. He added proudly, "The Flourishing Moon Great Formation—nothing more than that!"

"Is that so?" Han Leng's face took on a strange look and he suddenly radiated a blinding light as if he himself had become a full moon.

"What?" Liu Yizhi was horrified, sensing danger; he hurriedly manifested a shield-like Secret Treasure that spun and grew to table size, sheltering him behind it.

At that moment Han Leng seemed ready; a sword cry rang out and the dazzling light condensed into a terrifying sword radiance that shot at Liu Yizhi like an arrow released from a bow.

Not only that, but under Han Leng's control the silver moons which had been stabilized also unleashed moonlight that poured into the sword radiance.

The sword radiance swelled abruptly and within a single breath grew into a monstrous weapon dozens of zhang long.

A staggering, terrifying pressure descended from the heavens, draining the color from Ning Yuancheng’s face as he slumped on the tower-ship, and even Liu Yizhi—sheltered behind his shield Secret Treasure—was seized by a rising panic as a deathly aura washed over them.

Only then did he realize he had underestimated Han Leng and the Flourishing Moon Great Formation.

The Flourishing Moon Great Formation was a formation of Star God Palace; as the hegemon of the Southern Territory, the set of arrays they mastered naturally had exceptional traits. Although Liu Yizhi could see certain flaws, he could not fathom all of it—underestimating the formation would be to beckon death.

"Young Palace Lord, flee quickly!" Liu Yizhi gritted his teeth and shouted, biting his tongue and spitting his Essence-Blood forward.

The shield before him flared and its protection seemed to strengthen, while his longknife thrummed with furious power that even Liu Yizhi had difficulty containing.

"Self-destruction?" A cry of alarm came from within the terrifying sword radiance—Han Leng's voice carrying faint unease.


Not all Secret Treasures can self-destruct; only certain special ones possess that capability. If their owner truly detonates them they can unleash tremendous destructive power, but doing so ruins the treasure and the owner will certainly suffer severe injury.

The longknife Liu Yizhi wielded was a Lower-Level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure; its self-destruction power was not insignificant, and Han Leng did not dare lightly test its edge.

"Don't even think it!" Han Leng's face hardened and he pushed the sword radiance more fiercely, embedding himself within it to try to take Liu Yizhi's life before the Secret Treasure could self-destruct.

Light flashed and a cataclysmic sound rang out.

The Spiritual Qi of the world rocked, and for a moment the Laws of that piece of heaven and earth went askew.

A spatial black hole suddenly appeared where Liu Yizhi stood.

The blast from the Secret Treasure's self-destruction had torn space itself—such was its terror.

The black hole sucked in everything nearby, then suddenly contracted; under the influence of the world's Laws it was repaired again.

In the sky many silver moons dimmed as if Han Leng's final strike had drained the Flourishing Moon Great Formation's power.

Han Leng's silhouette also reappeared nearby.

At that moment his face was hideously distorted, his body bathed in blood, and his left arm twisted at a grotesque angle, looking dreadful to behold.
