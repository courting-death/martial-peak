## Chapter 1415 — Troubles Resurface

Hearing Yang Kai say that, Cheng Pengxuan's old face immediately fell. Yang Kai's perfunctory manner was clear to anyone who wasn't blind; if he truly walked away like that, they might never see that jade token again.

Cheng Pengxuan was furious in his heart, but outwardly showed no sign.

This man held the rank of Great Elder of the Leitai Sect, a lofty position and a man of deep guile; he would not let his emotions spill over for something like this.

"Brother Cheng, Brother Mo, why waste words with this brat? Since he does not regard us, then take it by force." Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect snorted. "A mere Saint King Realm, yet he dares to seize an extraordinary treasure before us—utterly presumptuous."

After all, he had already torn ties with Dragon Lair Mountain, so there was no need to be polite in speech. He would gladly drag Cheng Pengxuan and Mo Xiaosheng into the fray against Dragon Lair Mountain; though he feared the woman surnamed Ye's strength, if everyone struck together, even she would not be a match.

If they could kill Yang Kai, they would not only take the jade token but also seize the Xuan Gold—two gains with one blow; how could Jin Shi let that pass?

Many shared the same thought, yet aside from Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain, no one immediately nodded in agreement. Old Woman Feng spoke bluntly, thrusting her dragon-head cane forward and saying in a cold voice, "Old man Jin's proposal is not bad; I agree. What do you all think?"

Although everyone could guess Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng's plan, whether it was Mo Xiaosheng or Cheng Pengxuan, or other powerful figures present, they could not help but feel a stir of temptation.

This matter could not be solved peacefully. If they wanted the extraordinary treasure, they would have to seize it by force.

Mo Xiaosheng and Cheng Pengxuan exchanged a glance and read each other's intent.

"Whoever dares to strike will be my enemy; in my lifetime I will not rest until we have settled it to the death!" the woman surnamed Ye said, eyes cold as she swept her gaze around.

Many people turned their eyes away in vexation, hearts heavy.

Jin Shi laughed long and looked at her with a mocking expression. "Miss Ye, have you been secluded too long and grown rusty in the wilds? Do you truly think you alone can ignore so many people present? Miss Ye, allow me a word of warning: getting burned by fire is ill-advised—withdraw while you can!"

That faint threat, with other motives beneath it, drew all those present together, seeking to form a majority against the lone woman.

“If you’re seeking death, I shall be the first to grant your wish!” The woman surnamed Ye fixed her phoenix-like eyes on Jin Shi. The Bone-Eroding Severing Flame Lamp appeared once more, hovering above her head, its power gathering and ready to strike.

Jin Shi's expression changed. Though he spoke arrogantly, seeing such a Void King-Grade treasure troubled him; yet for that jade token and for the Xuan Gold, he would not back down.

Fortunately for him, Old Woman Feng also stood on his side. A trace of gravity crossed the old woman's timeworn face as she announced loudly, "Miss Ye, although your means are peerless, you are only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and have long been secluded—why wade into this quagmire? Why not leave now? Another day we shall come personally to apologize!"

Her words were neither servile nor overbearing; they gave Miss Ye face while preserving her own dignity, leaving room for reconciliation if the other party wished it.

Hearing this, Mo Xiaosheng, Cheng Pengxuan, and the others nodded and earnestly urged Miss Ye, hoping she would make the right choice.

Unfortunately, the outcome left them both disappointed and infuriated. The woman surnamed Ye had come out of seclusion this time precisely because of Yang Yan—now that Dragon Lair Mountain, where Yang Yan resided, was in trouble, how could she possibly stand by and do nothing?

“Enough with the useless chatter. If you truly wish to act, then go ahead and make your move—so long as you can withstand this one's wrath and vengeance! I may stand alone, but I wonder if you all have the strength and energy to protect your own sects in the aftermath!” The woman surnamed Ye’s stance and tone were firm to the extreme.

“Fine, fine! You dare spurn my courtesy!” A trace of ferocity flashed across Jin Shi’s face. “Since that’s how you want it, Miss Ye, don’t blame us for being ruthless and merciless!”

As he spoke, a virulent aura suddenly burst from his body. A golden cicada apparition arose behind him; with a wave of his hand countless black, monstrous insects condensed from his Saint Yuan, buzzing incessantly as they swarmed toward the woman surnamed Ye.

Jin Shi practiced the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art, a lineage passed down from the ancient demon race, with formidable power not to be underestimated.

Old Woman Feng flung her dragon-head cane forward, infusing it with Saint Yuan; the cane twisted and transformed into a scaled, fierce jiao dragon dozens of zhang long, opening its blood-red maw and lunging to bite at Miss Ye.

Now that matters had reached this extent, there was nothing left to say—either do it completely or not at all. The powerful figures present were decisive folk, fearful of letting the woman surnamed Ye escape and seek revenge later, so their aim was to kill her.

The moment Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng moved, Cheng Pengxuan and Mo Xiaosheng did not hesitate to join the fray. Cheng's large-seal secret treasure and Mo's Short Ruler both radiated shocking surges of energy as they attacked Miss Ye.

This battle differed from the earlier one; before, most only wished to rid themselves of Miss Ye, so their attention had not been fully on her. Now, bent on cutting her down, they unleashed far greater strength.

Four Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts besieged the lone woman; even with the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp, she was hard-pressed.

Yet no one could deny that as the former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain, Cheng was a famed titan of centuries; even when pressed at the outset of the clash she was not easily cowed. Blue lamp-flames burst forth from the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp to counterattack, forcing the four into a flustered, terrified scramble.

Judging from the situation, the battle between these five top experts would not be decided anytime soon.

However, Jin Shi and the others had already achieved their goal. The woman surnamed Ye—the only one in Dragon Lair Mountain capable of putting up a fight—was now entangled in battle, leaving everyone else as nothing more than fish laid out on the chopping block.

The powerful all assumed this to be the case.

Seeing the woman surnamed Ye being held up, the other experts naturally refused to stay idle and all rushed forward to attack Chang Qi and the others.

There were now over a hundred Origin Returning Realm practitioners in Dragon Lair Mountain; Third Stage cultivators and Second Stage cultivators were plentiful. Chang Qi and his group stood isolated and were no match—engagements rapidly turned perilous. Fortunately, the secret treasures they used had been personally forged by Yang Yan and were immensely powerful, so for the moment their lives were not in immediate danger.

Moreover, at this crucial moment Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu charged in. They could not stand idly by while those in Dragon Lair Mountain were beset. Beyond their good relations with Yang Kai, this place was the territory of Yingyue Hall; Dragon Lair Mountain was under Yingyue Hall's protection. So many powerful men bullying the weak beneath their nose gave them ample reason to intervene.

Yet the two could only each entangle a number of foes and were short of hands, growing secretly anxious.

Almost everyone was swept into the fray in that lightning instant. While attention was thus drawn, Yang Yan formed hand seals and her figure suddenly vanished from the world; no one knew where she had gone.

Using the local restrictions and the array's power, Yang Yan slipped free with ease.

Yang Kai, however, ran into grave trouble. With the woman surnamed Ye and Chang Qi and the others all embroiled, even Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had no time for him, and he was suddenly targeted by more than a dozen Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

Those dozen-or-so men stared at Yang Kai with predatory greed, then surged forward together, each hoping to be the first to slay him and seize his Spatial Ring.

Whoever could snatch the Spatial Ring would claim the first merit!

"Brother Yang, you go—Xuan'er and I will hold them off!" At the critical moment two figures leapt forward: Wei Guchang and Xuan'er had seen the peril and rushed to his side.

There was no time for much talk; Yang Kai only cast them a grateful look.

He was not overly worried for Wei Guchang and Xuan'er's safety. Both were Yingyue Hall's elite, famed among the young generation, now promoted to the Origin Returning Realm; even if they were outmatched, they could still fend for themselves.

Besides, these enemies might not dare risk killing them—should anything befall either, Yingyue Hall would not let it stand.

In an instant, the battle was joined at close quarters. Wei Guchang and Xuan’er joined forces, their secret arts and surging Saint Yuan enveloping four of the enemies within the clash, preventing them from interfering with Yang Kai—allowing him to finally breathe a sigh of relief.

In that situation, slipping away would certainly be the wisest choice, yet Yang Kai would not abandon his friends and helpers to flee alone. His expression cold, he stood his ground and gestured; a refining furnace spun out and flew before him.

The Void King-Grade refining furnace opened in the wind and in no time became a towering monstrosity of several zhang. From its maw a fiery, crimson strange bird cried out and burst forth; with a sweep of its wings it engulfed several enemies in roaring, blazing flame.

The Fire Bird, the artifact spirit, now fought with strength no less than an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, so dealing with those foes posed little problem.

Yang Kai's lips curled in a cold smile as he plunged his hand into the refining furnace, clutched something hard, and strained to drag it free.

A cataclysmic wave of energy poured from the furnace; the remaining enemies' faces all changed at once.

They did not know what Yang Kai aimed to pull from the furnace, but they would not stand idly by. As they charged, secret treasures were unleashed one after another and techniques formed, heaping down upon Yang Kai like a deluge.

Yang Kai's brow tightened; he pointed out, and a purple shield appeared, transforming into a violent sandstorm that cloaked his figure.
