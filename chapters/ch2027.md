## Chapter 2027 — Auction

“Are you waiting here because you have some matter for me?” Yang Kai looked at the attendant and asked.

	The assistant replied, "It's like this: Shopkeeper ordered me to wait here for Pillmaster Yang. He wishes to invite you to attend the auction."

"The auction?" Yang Kai's brow rose; he suddenly recalled that a few days earlier Kang Siran had indeed mentioned this, saying that the warriors of Fenglin City had obtained many good things inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, so City Lord Duan Yuanshan thought to organize an auction for everyone to trade with one another.

	Previously Yang Kai had been short of funds and uninterested, showing no intention of attending; yet Kang Siran still sent someone to invite him.

	This time he had acquired a fair amount of Source Crystals and valuables from the Lu family, so he had a decent sum — it wouldn't hurt to take a look.

	Yang Kai thought for a moment and asked, "What treasures will be offered? For Shopkeeper Kang to be so intent... did he give you any hint?"

The clerk smiled mysteriously, glanced around, leaned in and whispered, "The Shopkeeper said that a Dao Origin Fruit will appear at this auction."

"Really?" Yang Kai was astonished.

"Yes! That's why Shopkeeper Kang is so interested. He also wants Pillmaster Yang to join him, pool funds, and seize that Dao Origin Fruit together."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded.

	"Additionally, the Shopkeeper said one of the auction items will be an ancient pill furnace, at least Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level. If you win that furnace, future pill refinement success rates and output would increase; such an ancient pill furnace is highly desirable to alchemists."

	"That does interest me," Yang Kai smiled. "Where is the auction? When does it start?"

	The clerk grinned, "It begins at noon today. I've been waiting two days for Pillmaster Yang—if you don't go soon, you'll miss it."

"Then my timing is just right. Do this: tell Shopkeeper Kang I will be there. I'll tidy up and come at once."

"Yes!" the clerk answered and immediately withdrew.

Though their voices were low, Zhang Ruoxi nearby overheard much; after the clerk left she looked at Yang Kai in surprise and asked, "Sir, you are actually an alchemist?"

Yang Kai chuckled, "I know a little. We'll talk inside."

	With that he lifted the cave's restriction and led Zhang Ruoxi inside.

The cave residence he rented in Fenglin City wasn't the finest, but it was far from shabby—comfortably mid-to-upper tier. It contained several chambers and was fairly spacious; Yang Kai assigned one of the rooms to Zhang Ruoxi and told her to make it her home from then on.

He handed her the token to his cave dwelling, taught her the methods to open and close its barriers, and instructed her that—aside from himself—she must not open the cave for anyone.

Zhang Ruoxi naturally nodded her agreement.

"If you get bored you can go out for a walk. Fenglin City's security is fairly good, but avoid the black market; the City Lord doesn't manage that area and it's chaotic—at your cultivation it would be dangerous." Yang Kai cautioned.

Zhang Ruoxi softly said, "I won't go anywhere; I'll wait here for you, sir."

"As you wish. Then rest for now—I'm heading out." Yang Kai instructed, then left.

Zhang Ruoxi saw him off from behind.

After Yang Kai left, Zhang Ruoxi began to look around the cave; though tidy, it was exceedingly simple, and thinking that this would be her residence, she considered how to improve it.

	After a long while she smiled; a plan formed in her chest, and she began taking items from her Spatial Ring to arrange the place.

...

At the Spiritual Pill workshop Yang Kai entered and someone immediately informed Kang Siran.

	Not long after, Kang Siran hurried out and caught Yang Kai's arm eagerly. "Pillmaster Yang, you're finally showing yourself! If you hadn't come you'd have missed this auction. Come—time's short; we must hurry to the City Lord's manor."

"The auction is at the City Lord's manor?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Naturally. The City Lord personally organized this auction, so the venue is the City Lord's manor. I'll tell you on the way what good items will appear."

	As they walked toward the manor and listened to Kang Siran's inside information, Yang Kai learned that although Fenglin City's warriors suffered heavy casualties in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, some had indeed obtained valuable items.

The Dao Origin Fruit, needless to say, would be the finale auction item.

Several Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures would also appear, and it was said Dao Origin Realm experts from nearby forces were drawn to participate in the bidding.

In addition there would be Spiritual Pills and lost cultivation techniques.

In short, the auction was grand and unprecedented; the warriors of Fenglin City looked forward to it, but entry was conditional—after all, with so many martial artists the City Lord's manor could not admit everyone.

To enter the auction, besides holding an invitation issued by the manor, only two kinds of people could freely enter.

One was those at the Void King Realm or above; the other was those with abundant funds—otherwise entrance was forbidden.

As a Shopkeeper of a Spiritual Pill workshop, Kang Siran frequently dealt with the manor and had already received an invitation; his invitation allowed one companion entry, so Yang Kai need not be inspected for cultivation or wealth.

	"Tianwu Sacred Land placed three Dao Origin Fruits in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda this time; one will appear at the auction. I wonder who obtained the other two." Kang Siran had long coveted a Dao Origin Fruit and regretted not obtaining one in the Pagoda; now he had to compete. He had nearly brought all his savings to fight for it.

Still, he knew his hopes were slim; though he was a Shopkeeper he could not compare financially with sects and families. If he represented the Ziyuan Commerce Guild and could secure their backing it would be different, but he could not obtain such funds in a short time.

Hearing this, Yang Kai sniffed and made no reply.

After all, one Dao Origin Fruit still rested in his Spatial Ring; as for the third, who knew whose hands it had fallen into and how many Dao Origin Realm experts it might create.

Talking as they walked, they soon reached the City Lord's manor.

Before the City Lord's manor the crowd swelled, shoulders pressed and elbows jostling as countless martial artists scrambled forward to force their way in. Fenglin City's guards did their best to maintain order, and from time to time cultivators streaked through the air, berating those who tried to cut the line.

"Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm wants to attend the auction? Go back and cultivate a few years first—what, you have Source Crystals? Let me see, a hundred-thousand-or-so and you call that Source Crystals? Get out!" came a jeer; evidently some unqualified martial artist had tried to cheat entry and was dragged out by the guards, thrown far off and covered in dust.

"First Stage of the Void King Realm—qualification is barely met. This friend, please proceed."

"You, a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, coming to make a scene? Believe it or not I'll slap you dead—oh, you've brought a million Source Crystals; why didn't you say so earlier? You may enter."

The guards were busy and overwhelmed; with the auction about to begin there were still countless people trying to get in, giving them a headache.

"Ah, it's Shopkeeper Kang."

Kang Siran and Yang Kai squeezed through the crowd and finally reached a guard at the manor, who at once recognized Kang Siran and put on a pleasant face.

"Shopkeeper Kang, please follow the rules—do you have an invitation?"

"Of course I do." Kang Siran smiled and, under many envious gazes, leisurely produced an invitation and handed it to the guard.

	The guard checked it and, satisfied, said, "Very well, Shopkeeper Kang may enter. Once inside present the invitation and someone will attend to you."

"Thank you. Also, I will bring this friend in—no problem, right?" Kang Siran gestured toward Yang Kai.

"According to the rules, that's fine." The guard glanced at Yang Kai and promptly let them pass.

Kang Siran nodded and the two exited the crowd, each exhaling an involuntary breath.

"Let's go—the auction is about to begin." Kang Siran quickened his pace.

Before long, the two entered the City Lord’s Mansion. After Kang Siran presented the invitation, a maid immediately stepped forward to guide them, leading them into a private room B-9.

Kang Siran looked somewhat surprised at the room’s designation. After all, he was a well-known figure in Fenglin City; his cultivation might not be supreme, but he carried the backing of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild—an influence even City Lord Duan Yuanshan would not dare to lightly dismiss.

Yet they had been assigned only to a B-class room, which indicated that rooms with earlier numbers were occupied by those stronger or more influential.

Realizing this, Kang Siran's brow tightened—he felt something amiss.

The auction hall had been formed by temporarily converting one of the manor's great halls; it was vast. The lower hall was densely seated, and Yang Kai estimated at least several thousand people, while the upper private rooms numbered over a hundred.

Even so, many still could not enter. Without Kang Siran's pull, the two of them might have had no place to stay.

At that moment the hall below was in an uproar—groups whispered and discussed; the auction had evidently not yet begun.

Only the hundred private rooms above were quiet and still; those below looked up at the rooms with envy.

	"Let's sit," Kang Siran said; before Yang Kai could answer, he had already found a seat and settled himself.

Yang Kai also sat calmly. He had participated in auctions before; though this was his first time in the Star Realm, it felt much the same—nothing particularly different.
