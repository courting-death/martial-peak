## Chapter 1561 — No Other Intentions

Could this brat be planning to unify the entire continent? To make the demons and yao bow their heads in submission?

The moment that notion arose, Changyuan's expression grew markedly wary and grave.

It wasn't that he was petty; on the contrary, Changyuan was a man of boldness — such temperaments were common among powerful demons and yao — yet precisely because he was the Demon Lord, he couldn't help but consider such possibilities.

Lei Long thought the same. If that were truly his intent, then even if the yao and demon races joined forces, they would be unable to resist and would have to submit, otherwise they would face utter annihilation.

Hearing him ask, Yang Kai glanced at him thoughtfully and chuckled, "Demon Lord, don't overthink it. I won't be staying long this time; I will likely leave very soon."

"Leave very soon?" Changyuan was stunned; he exchanged a look with Lei Long, both extremely surprised.

Yang Kai actually had no hint of ambition...

"Yes. The wonders within the Star Domain enchanted me, so I don't intend to linger here long." Yang Kai chuckled.

Lei Long's eyes brightened and he hurriedly asked, "Is the Star Domain really that magnificent? If possible, Saint Lord Yang, could you tell us about it?"

The other human, yao, and demon experts craned their necks and gazed at Yang Kai, looking very intent to listen.

"Tell us, tell us — I'm curious too," Chu Lingxiao smiled. Although he'd already gleaned much about the Star Domain from Ling Taixu after arriving, those reports came secondhand, so they lacked flavor; now with Yang Kai present, he naturally wanted to probe thoroughly.

“Since Grandmaster has given the order, how could this disciple disobey?” Yang Kai chuckled softly. After a moment’s thought, he spoke unhurriedly: “The Star Domain truly holds many wonders—things we had never even imagined before…”

Everyone in the hall listened with rapt attention.

Time slipped by, and each person listened with relish, their expressions growing progressively more excited.

The boundless expanse of the Star Domain left them in awe; the enchanting vistas and abundant cultivation resources of the Star Domain made them yearn for it. The existence of cultivation stages beyond the Saint Realm — the Saint King Realm, the Origin Returning Realm, the Void King Realm — filled them with shame.

They now fully understood the meaning of the saying about a frog at the bottom of a well.

According to Yang Kai, the Spiritual Qi on most cultivation stars in the Star Domain was extremely dense. The Saint Realm there was hardly notable; only those who reached the Origin Returning Realm could be barely considered experts. Only upon reaching the Void King Realm did one truly become a great Lord.

Everyone's blood burned and boiled; a look of longing flickered in their eyes.

They longed to possess such training grounds and plentiful resources. They hungered to advance their Martial Dao, to become the fabled Saint King Realm, the Origin Returning Realm, or even the Void King Realm…

Yang Kai neither embellished nor diminished; he calmly relayed his understanding of the Star Domain and the sights he'd seen over the years.

That was enough. When he finished, the crowd's emotions surged and could not settle for a long while.

Yang Kai had seen such wonders and marvels, while these people remained on the Tongxuan Continent, fighting to the death over materials which cultivators from some Star Domain regarded as worthless.

This realization left everyone dejected, ashamed, even deeply humiliated.

Changyuan and Lei Long, who had been at odds before, exchanged a look and gave wry smiles, suddenly feeling their prior quarrel childish, utterly juvenile…

"Hmph, the Star Domain is so wondrous — I can hardly wait to see it. If in my lifetime I could witness such marvels, I would die with no regrets!" Chu Lingxiao inhaled deeply.

Lei Long and Changyuan opened their mouths as if to speak, but ultimately could not bring themselves to say anything.

After a long silence, Changyuan sighed and, looking somewhat dispirited, asked, "May I ask Saint Lord Yang why you summoned the human, yao, and demon experts here?"

Hearing this, Lei Long also turned his gaze to Yang Kai, full of curiosity.

Yang Kai smiled and replied, "I'm taking you into the Star Domain!"

A single stone sent ripples across a thousand waves — everyone trembled and stared at Yang Kai in stunned excitement, apparently never expecting him to say such a thing.

Indeed, Yang Kai's descriptions had already stirred everyone's yearning and curiosity toward the Star Domain; they all wanted to see what the Star Domain truly looked like.

But… the Star Domain is not easy to enter. They lacked the ability to break into it, and could only look on helplessly, envying Yang Kai's opportunity and admiring his courage and strength.

Yet now Yang Kai had offered them an olive branch.

Everyone was stunned.

"Of course, I won't force you. This is merely a proposal. In a few days I will depart. Those who wish may come with me; those who wish to remain may stay. I came back this time precisely for that reason," Yang Kai added.

"Is this for real?" Changyuan suddenly stood, his gaze burning as he looked at Yang Kai.

"Saint Lord Yang isn't joking?" Lei Long wore a face of disbelief.

They didn't know what price would be paid to bring people into the Star Domain, but it certainly wouldn't be trivial. If Yang Kai possessed such power, he would likely prioritize his human kin and friends. Now that he extended such favor to the yao and demons as well, Changyuan and Lei Long were both incredulous and exhilarated, thrown off balance.

"I'm not joking," Yang Kai said earnestly.

With his affirmative reply, Changyuan and Lei Long stood dumbfounded.

After a long while, Changyuan asked solemnly, "May I ask, Saint Lord Yang, what do we need to give in return? To bow to you and pledge fealty?"

"Heh…" Yang Kai grinned, a mocking look on his face. He said calmly, "Why would I need you to bow and swear fealty? I'll say this bluntly: I could sweep the entire Tongxuan Continent with a single finger. If I wanted your submission, I wouldn't bother with words — I'd simply use force to crush you."

Changyuan and Lei Long instantly broke into a cold sweat.

They didn't think Yang Kai was talking nonsense. From his earlier explanations about domains and higher levels, they had sensed his overwhelming might — something they could not withstand.

This young man had long surpassed that generation of legendary figures and the Great Demon God whom the demon race revered as supreme! He had walked farther and stood higher.

Even if the Great Demon God were to return, he would probably still have to look up to Yang Kai.

"Then why…" Lei Long hesitated, staring at Yang Kai.

"We're old friends. If I can help, I'll help. No other intent," Yang Kai said lightly.

Changyuan and Lei Long were filled with shame, wishing for a hole to hide in so they would never face anyone again.

Suddenly Changyuan cupped his fist with a solemn expression, "Saint Lord Yang's conduct is noble. Changyuan thought in a mean way of you — if I have offended, I ask for your forgiveness!"

Lei Long hurriedly expressed his apologies as well, his face sincere.

"It's all right. You're leaders of your races; it's reasonable to consider matters deeply," Yang Kai waved his hand and indicated he bore no grudges; in their position he might think the same.

The two experts' faces relaxed somewhat.

"The Star Domain surely holds many marvels, but it must also be perilous. If Saint Lord Yang brings so many into the Star Domain, can you ensure the safety of those people?" Lei Long asked worriedly.

"There are certainly dangers. Whether you follow me is voluntary — it's your choice. You may remain; perhaps one day the Tongxuan Continent will revive and become like the cultivation stars of the Star Domain, and then you can attain deeper realms of the Martial Dao. But when it will happen is uncertain." Yang Kai smiled faintly and glanced meaningfully at Xia Ningshang.

Having refined the Stellar Origin and become a Star Lord, and after breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, Xia Ningshang's aura had noticeably improved; the layer of dullness that had shrouded her seemed to have lightened.

If she continued to advance at this pace, one day she would stand at the pinnacle of the Star Domain, and the entire Tongxuan Continent would benefit alongside her.

"This matter is weighty. Please allow us a few days to deliberate; I need to discuss it carefully," Changyuan frowned.

"Naturally." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

He immediately ordered the yao and demon experts to retire and rest so they could thoroughly deliberate the matter.

The humans required no deliberation: the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Zhongdu's kin and friends, and even the Tianxiao Sect had already decided to follow Yang Kai into the Star Domain. Of course, some disciples were unwilling to leave their sects; the human experts accepted their choice.

Not everyone possessed the reckless courage to risk their lives for an uncertain promise of glory; such a step demanded great bravery and a yearning for a higher Martial Dao.

Overall, such people were not numerous — roughly thirty percent of each sect.

The assembly dispersed; there remained many matters to handle.

The hall soon emptied, and Yang Kai cheerfully walked over to a pair of women who looked like twin sisters.

As he approached, the two women's breathing seemed to quicken slightly, as if excited.

"Jiao'er, Mei'er, long time no see," Yang Kai greeted with a chuckle.

It had been too crowded earlier for him to exchange greetings with the Hu sisters; now with a moment of leisure, he naturally wanted to speak with them.

Besides, it seemed they had been waiting for him here.

The two women smiled faintly and, in unison, asked, "Long time no see — are you well?"

"Quite well!" Yang Kai nodded, his brow furrowing slightly with a hint of puzzlement.

His gaze shifted repeatedly between the two women, but he could not discern which was Hu Jiao'er and which was Hu Mei'er.

This puzzled him and made him scratch his head.

Having cultivated the Consonant Spirit Technique, their formerly slight differences in appearance had vanished; even their temperaments and the life qi within them were indistinguishable.

Standing there, they seemed like a single person!

Moreover, their cultivation had already reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, not merely the First as Great Elder Xu Hui had first reported.

Their rate of advancement was terrifying. Yang Kai inwardly clicked his tongue with amazement.
