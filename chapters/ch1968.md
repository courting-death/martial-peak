## Chapter 1968 — Grand Giveaway

If it had not been for the girl Mo Xiaoqi telling Yang Kai she knew the exact location of the Fire Bird, Yang Kai would not have followed her here for anything.

Intrigue within the Star Realm was far greater than in his home Star Domain; Yang Kai could not afford to act carelessly.

Yet the tidings Mo Xiaoqi had let slip were such that he simply could not refuse.

Hearing Yang Kai ask so, Mo Xiaoqi nodded and said, "Of course it's true."

"Where is it?" Yang Kai asked bluntly. At his side, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei also focused their attention, as if trying to listen more carefully.

"It's in..." Mo Xiaoqi had barely gotten a word out when she suddenly caught herself, hurriedly swallowing the rest of the sentence and then smiling, "I won't tell you now — just follow me."

She wore a face of innocent naivety, as though she had truly intended to lay out the Fire Bird's exact location.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. "How am I to believe you? If you know that Fire Bird's exact location, why not gather familiar hands and go find it yourself instead of summoning people like us?"

Xu Qing nodded and said, "Brother Yang's point is reasonable, Miss Mo Xiaoqi. It's not that we don't trust you; we are strangers to one another, and Xu also has the same question — I hope Miss Mo Xiaoqi can answer it."

Mo Xiaoqi frowned delicately and, appearing entirely natural, replied, "I went in before and saw it, so of course I know where it is. Did you see those injured fellows? I had quietly followed behind them when they went in. Later they encountered that little creature — some died, some fled — and I followed that little creature all the way to its lair. As for why I didn't seek out familiar people... I don't know anyone here, and I might not be able to take it alone, so I came to you all."

Yang Kai and Xu Qing exchanged a glance and both nodded slightly.

There was no obvious flaw in Mo Xiaoqi's words; or rather, even if there were flaws, they could not be traced.

Seeing the others fall silent, Mo Xiaoqi could not help but grow a little anxious and hastily said, "Don't be afraid — that little creature is fierce and troublesome, but after all it's still in an immature form, not actually that hard to deal with. If we prepare thoroughly, taking it down will be no problem."

Yu Ruomei pursed her lips and smiled, saying, "Sister Xiaoqi, it's not that we're afraid, it's just... there is only one Fire Bird. If we actually get it, how will we divide the spoils?"

At her words, Mo Xiaoqi immediately grew bashful and said embarrassedly, "I was intending to discuss this with Elder Brothers and Sister. That little creature would be extremely useful to me — if we do get it, could you give it to me...?"

Upon hearing this, not only did Yang Kai gaze at her with a strange expression, but even Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei's faces turned unpleasant.

They were all cultivators at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; why should they toil and get nothing in return? Setting aside Yang Kai's private intentions, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei certainly would not agree to such a baseless demand.

That old witch, putting on innocence a little too well, Yang Kai privately despised her; did she not know that excess was as bad as deficiency?

Seeing the others' sour expressions, Mo Xiaoqi hurriedly added, "Of course I won't make you work for nothing — I can give you adequate compensation."

"Compensation?" Xu Qing snorted, his tone no longer as affable as before, sneering, "I wonder what sort of compensation Miss Mo intends to offer us?"

Mo Xiaoqi did not answer him; instead she lowered her head and released her Divine Sense, sensing within her Spatial Ring. After a short while, a flash of light appeared in her hand as she produced three Secret Treasures.

The first was a pink silk robe, as thin as gauze, studded with colorful gems; those gems were clearly no ordinary stones, each emitting strange energy fluctuations.

The second was a ruler two fingers in length, jet black in color — though small, it gave a feeling of great weight, as if it could even suppress a cultivator's Divine Sense.

The last was a thick-backed cleaver, the blade heavy and carved with intricate patterns, a bloody aura emanating from it that suggested many experts had met death beneath it.

The energy ripples emanating from these three Secret Treasures were, astonishingly, not weak at all.

"Void King-Grade Secret Treasures?" Xu Qing's eyes bulged, and Yu Ruomei's breath suddenly grew rapid.

Yang Kai was equally dumbstruck.

For the three items Mo Xiaoqi produced were indeed Void King-Grade Secret Treasures — and of unquestionably high caliber.

"This Chongying Ruler and the Long Regret Blade are Void King-Grade Upper-Level treasures, each possessing its own wonder. The Colorful Threaded Silk Robe is a Void King-Grade Middle-Level treasure, woven from the silk of three-thousand-year Snow Silkworms produced in the Northern Snow Prefecture. It resists the Five Elements, grants excellent protection, and the star-sand inlaid upon it can transform into piercing attacks, combining offense and defense... Um — I'll offer these three as initial compensation, okay? If the venture succeeds, there will be generous additional reward." Mo Xiaoqi looked timidly at the three and stammered, "Is that acceptable?"

Xu Qing could not help but swallow hard, while Yu Ruomei's beautiful eyes were already fixed upon the Colorful Threaded Silk Robe like a leech, unwilling to look away.

Yang Kai forcibly suppressed his astonishment and calmly appraised Mo Xiaoqi, his inner vigilance at its peak.

That she could casually produce three such high-grade Void King-Grade Secret Treasures showed her resources were far from ordinary; such a person was certainly not someone without a name — she might even be a Dao Origin Realm expert in disguise, otherwise who would behave so brazenly?

Even if she were inexperienced, the basic rule of not flaunting wealth should be understood — that she dared to expose such treasures meant she was utterly confident.

But if she truly could evade detection from Dao Origin Realm perception, then at the very least she should be a second- or third-stage Dao Origin Realm expert — so why come to people like them?

Yang Kai could not make sense of it.

"Not acceptable?" Seeing that the three had not responded, Mo Xiaoqi showed a trace of disappointment and was about to withdraw the three Secret Treasures.

"Miss Mo, what are you saying?" Yu Ruomei was the first to come to her senses, chuckling softly, "Sister thought you a good girl at first sight. Since you want that little creature, Sister will not compete with you — I'll help you with this matter."

Though she spoke with lofty righteousness, her hands were not slow; she directly snatched the Colorful Threaded Silk Robe and shoved it into her Spatial Ring.

Leaving aside whether the lone Fire Bird within Yuqing Mountain was truly worth a Void King-Grade Middle-Level defensive treasure, even if it were, splitting it four ways would not compare to that Colorful Threaded Silk Robe.

Moreover, Mo Xiaoqi had already given her one robe before any action had begun; if they succeeded, there would doubtlessly be further benefits.

So she did not hesitate.

Xu Qing, seeing Yu Ruomei take it, cleared his throat and said, "Miss Mo's sincerity is felt by Xu. In that case, let Xu have a share as well."

Saying so, his gaze lingered over the remaining Chongying Ruler and Long Regret Blade, seemingly torn, but he finally picked up the Chongying Ruler and placed it into his Spatial Ring.

Mo Xiaoqi turned her expectant gaze toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned; instinctively he did not wish to wade into this murky business, but thinking that Liu Yan might well face countless attackers, he could only put on a false smile.

Xu Qing also urged from the side, "Brother Yang, Miss Mo is so sincere — why are you still hesitating?"

Yang Kai sighed and said, "I'm not hesitating, it's just... I don't use blades."

At this, Mo Xiaoqi's face brightened and she hurriedly asked, "Then what sort of treasure would Brother Yang like?"

She feared not that Yang Kai would ask for too much, only that he would ask for nothing.

"A sword — is there one? An ice-attributed sword-type Secret Treasure," Yang Kai suddenly remembered that the Yao Worm Matriarch still lacked a proper weapon and hastily asked.

"Oh, I'll look — I remember I have one." Mo Xiaoqi said as she put away the Long Regret Blade and began searching inside her Spatial Ring.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei's eyes, burning hot, were fixed on her ring as if it contained some unparalleled treasure.

It was no wonder they reacted so; Mo Xiaoqi's display in that brief moment had convinced them she harbored countless precious items. If she could casually produce three or four Void King-Grade treasures, who could tell how many more lay within her ring?

Such a Spatial Ring — who would not covet it?

Yang Kai coldly smiled to himself as he observed their reactions.

He did not believe Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei could not see Mo Xiaoqi's issues; but people die for wealth as birds die for food — an eternal truth — and he did not bother himself with their thoughts.

After a while, Mo Xiaoqi looked up and, sheepish, said to Yang Kai, "Brother Yang... I seem to have remembered wrongly — I don't have an Upper-Level Void King-Grade ice long sword."

Her expression was like that of a child who had done something wrong, earnestly seeking forgiveness.

Yang Kai said calmly, "If you don't have it, then forget it."

It was not an urgent matter anyway; the Yao Worm Matriarch could still fight well without a weapon.

“Twin swords — will that do?” Mo Xiaoqi said, then suddenly produced two long swords that radiated a cold aura. One gleamed purple and measured roughly three feet three inches, the other shimmered bluish-green at about two feet five inches. One long and one short, the pair complemented each other perfectly; their blades crossed and reflected light in flowing ripples, like matched jewels, without a hint of discord.

Most notable was that both swords radiated the power fluctuations befitting Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei's eyes instantly reddened and their breathing quickened.

"Twin swords?" Yang Kai's eyes also lit up — he had never expected Mo Xiaoqi to bring him such a surprise.

In essence, twin swords were another form of sword-type Secret Treasure; they were many times more difficult to wield than a single sword, but in turn could unleash far greater power.

For this reason, the value of twin swords far exceeded that of ordinary treasures, equating roughly to defensive treasures of the same rank.

Two matching Void King-Grade Upper-Level long swords possessed a true value by no means inferior to a typical Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.
