## Chapter 1645 — Don't Blame Me for Being Merciless

"So it really is you!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Ran Yunting also snorted, looking down at Yang Kai from her lofty height as if peering at an ant, her expression utterly indifferent.

"Looks like you really want my life!" Yang Kai's face curled into a mocking smile. "All that scheming to bait me into acting was for this moment, wasn't it?"

The moment he sensed Ran Yunting nearby, Yang Kai knew that none of this was accidental — it was a carefully laid trap.

Whether he meant to seek out Qing Ya or not today, he would be drawn here; that was why Bing Die deliberately cried out before entering Qing Ya's grotto — to rouse Yang Kai in the pavilion.

Once Bing Die startled him, Yang Kai would inevitably respond.

It was sheer coincidence that Yang Kai happened to be close by.

Repeatedly making things difficult for Qing Ya, slapping slanderous labels on her, even striking her hard — all of it was to provoke Yang Kai into action.

In the end, Bing Die disregarded the safety of those Enforcement Hall disciples and sent them forward to kill Yang Kai; that too served the same purpose.

Everything had proceeded according to a prearranged plan.

The mastermind behind it all could be none other than Ran Yunting!

As Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley, she held great authority; the Enforcement Hall answered to her command, and only she could mobilize its disciples.

Qing Ya was nothing but an innocent pawn — Ran Yunting's ultimate target was Yang Kai alone!

"Great Elder..." Qing Ya gazed up at the towering Ran Yunting with a look of despair.

"Ungrateful wretch, you have no right to call me that!" Ran Yunting glanced at Qing Ya coolly. With a flick of her hand, an icy, bone-piercing gale shot straight at Qing Ya.

Qing Ya stood frozen in place, unable to react.

Yang Kai once more moved in front of Qing Ya, throwing a punch toward the oncoming wind.

Demonic Flame erupted — the pitch-black fire met the frigid gale, each opposing and mingling with the other; cold and heat collided with savage intensity, making the surrounding space seem to buckle.

Ran Yunting raised a dark brow and at last regarded Yang Kai with a serious look, secretly shocked at his power.

Her earlier strike had not been full strength; though it seemed casually delivered, it carried perhaps thirty to forty percent of her power, yet Yang Kai had only thrown a seemingly perfunctory punch to dissipate it.

Clearly he still had strength to spare!

"I had my doubts — that someone of your caliber could kill Jiang Xi and Yan Chilei. But now it seems it's true. Not bad," Ran Yunting said with a slight nod, offering a few perfunctory words of praise without being moved by Yang Kai's display.

"But this ends now. On my Icebound Island you dared harm Ice Heart Valley disciples and scorn my valley — today you will surely die!" Ran Yunting's gaze turned ice-cold and emotionless as she looked at Yang Kai. "To die by my hand would be your honor!"

On Ice Peak countless female disciples of Ice Heart Valley trembled, staring at Ran Yunting in shock.

Is the Great Elder going to personally strike?

Who exactly was this young man? Why had the Sect sought him out so painstakingly before, and now the Great Elder intends to kill him? There must be untold grievances at play — everyone was bewildered, not knowing what this truly involved.

Besides... the Great Elder hadn't shown herself in a long time.

Rumor had it her last fight was ten years ago; no one had seen it with their own eyes, only that her opponent had become an ice sculpture.

And now the Great Elder was about to kill this young man on Icebound Island.

For a moment, countless Ice Heart Valley disciples craned their necks, eager to witness the Great Elder's might and to see what awe-inspiring methods she possessed.

Many also cast sympathetic glances at Yang Kai, thinking he had angered the Great Elder and fearing he might be buried on Icebound Island today.

Under all those watching eyes, Yang Kai's face, which had been cold and furious, suddenly calmed — a strange shift that made everyone's hearts skip, a vague sense of ill omen spreading.

Then Yang Kai bowed slightly to Ran Yunting.

He actually saluted her!

Eyes popped everywhere.

Every Ice Heart Valley disciple could not understand what Yang Kai intended: facing the Great Elder's lethal intent, he bowed to her.

Was he frightened? Did this man recognize he was no match for the Great Elder and wish to plead for his life?

Bing Die sneered at the side, her gaze full of scorn and mockery; she despised such cowardice from the bottom of her heart, seeing no trace of the manly spirit she thought a man should have.

With a man like him, he imagines he can win Su Yan's heart? Absurd.

“It’s far too late for repentance now!” Ran Yunting remained aloof and unshaken, her tone cold as she said, “You should already know why this Elder must kill you. If you truly understand—if you truly care for her—then end your own life. I have no wish to stain my hands with your blood, for after all, I will still have to face her often in the future.”

As if offering one last mercy, Ran Yunting waited in silence after saying Yang Kai should take his own life.

Yang Kai smiled briefly, his face still calm, and shook his head: "I have done no wrong."

Ran Yunting's expression hardened. "At this point you still cling stubbornly? She is not someone of your kind. She will ascend to the pinnacle of the Martial Dao; you will only look up at her back and fall further behind. Better to end things now than to suffer later — if you do so, perhaps she will remember you forever. The peak of martial power is loneliness and solitude; only those who endure it can achieve greatness. Can't you see the future?"

“You’re the one who can’t see the future!” Yang Kai said coldly, fixing his gaze on Ran Yunting. “My salute to you was in thanks for the guidance and care you’ve shown her over the years. After this salute, you and I are enemies. If you intend to kill me, then steel yourself to be struck down!”

Lightning flashed in Ran Yunting's phoenix-like eyes, a divine radiance like the edge of a blade that made people avert their gaze; all the female disciples of Ice Heart Valley could not help but look away.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, meeting her gaze without the slightest retreat.

“As for whether I’m worthy of her—that’s not for you to decide. Who says the pinnacle of the Martial Dao must be lonely and desolate? I intend to walk that path alongside her and ascend to the supreme peak together!”

"Ignorant brat, talk is cheap — give me your life!" Ran Yunting, enraged by Yang Kai's arrogant words, cut off further words. She formed seals and a vortex appeared before her; it spun, drawing in the frigid spiritual qi within a radius of ten li and condensing into an ice spear dozens of zhang long and three zhang thick.

At a glance the ice spear looked like a torn-up ice peak — colossal, peerless, terrifying.

The watching disciples cried out in astonishment, their vision stunned.

The Great Elder's first strike shook heaven and earth, filling their eyes with worship and yearning.

When might any of them stand at the Great Elder's height?

But everyone knew this was an unrealistic fantasy; within the Sect perhaps only Su Yan and a few others had such hope; the rest were destined to be the glittering backdrop for those geniuses.

Those thoughts crossing their minds, the disciples hurriedly used their footwork to flee to a distance.

They dared not linger; a battle at the Great Elder's level had terrifying destructive power — lingering even a moment risked being swept up.

Yang Kai swept his hand and sent Qing Ya several li away, then leapt up without changing his expression to confront the mountain-sized ice spear.

Ran Yunting's eyes narrowed; she formed hand seals and exhaled a white mist that flowed into the spear ahead of time.

A layer of light flashed and the ice spear seemed to gain even greater destructive force.

Black flames burned on Yang Kai's fists as his Saint Yuan was pushed to the limit; just before contacting the giant spear his fists slammed forward.

Boom, boom, boom...

Thunderous sounds rolled out as the ice spear shattered inch by inch.

Yang Kai was like a beast swimming upstream — where he passed, ice shards flew and nothing could stop him; he smashed the colossal spear to pieces and charged straight to Ran Yunting's side.

It took no more than the blink of an eye!

"I respect you as Su Yan's master and do not wish to make things hard for you. But since you intend to kill me, don't blame me for being merciless!" Yang Kai's voice turned icy as he stood three zhang below Ran Yunting and launched another punch.

An inexplicable force burst out with his Saint Yuan, the space seeming to warp; around where Ran Yunting stood, slender spatial fissures began to crawl.

The Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley was horrified and could not help but cry out.

At that moment, she actually felt as if her life was hanging by a thread — as though if she didn’t give her all, she would die in the very next instant.

To be honest, Ran Yunting had never taken Yang Kai seriously. Although she had heard from the Thirteenth Elder Yu Xueqing that Yang Kai killed Jiang Xi and Yan Chilei, she had not seen it herself and secretly thought Yang Kai might merely be a rising talent who could fight above his rank, but could never be her match.

After all, she had been famous for a long time, at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the strongest force beneath the Void King Realm.

But in this brief clash she felt overwhelming pressure emanating from Yang Kai.

This young man was like a sharp sword drawn from its sheath — his edge fully revealed, his Shi surging to the heavens, seemingly even surpassing her own!

Cold sweat sprung on her back as Ran Yunting's expression changed and she frantically pushed her own field of Shi.

Snow whipped through the air, centered on her; within a radius of one hundred zhang the temperature plummeted and feather-like snowflakes drifted down, each bearing mysterious power.

Within this field Ran Yunting alone reigned supreme — the falling snow could become her deadliest weapon, able to slay any enemy caught in her domain.

The wandering spatial fissures froze in place.

Her gaze turned icy as she looked at Yang Kai, murderous intent mounting; with a shift of Divine Sense the falling snow seemed to take on life and swarmed to engulf Yang Kai.
