## Chapter 2034 — Scramble

A man surnamed Han cultivated to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and possessed abilities that could rival the city lord Duan Yuanshan, so even though the Drunken Old Man had warned him a moment ago, he paid it little mind; he intended to try the same trick again—to put pressure on whoever was bidding in the adjacent private room and force them to back down.

Divine Sense power from the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm suddenly surged forth and broke through the private room’s restriction, charging inward.

But what Han could never have foreseen was that before he could even muster his power, a wave of Divine Sense—every bit as strong as his own—suddenly surged out from the adjoining chamber and slammed back at him.

Han’s eyes narrowed; he had no time to retract his Divine Sense and could only grit his teeth and clash head-on with his opponent.

The invisible collision rippled through the main hall; Divine Sense power abruptly dissipated. Han gave a muffled groan, having suffered a slight setback from being caught off guard, and a cold snort echoed from the other private room in reply.

The clash of Divine Sense powers ended in an even draw.

“Also at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!” Han’s face darkened as he finally understood why the bidder earlier had spoken so arrogantly — they were backed by a powerful expert; it seemed the other side’s background was not simple.

For a moment, Han’s expression turned icy.

“Ha! This Young Master has already bid four million five hundred thousand—any higher offers? If not, this Artifact Spirit will belong to me!” The bidder who’d spoken before paid no mind to the duel between the two Dao Origin Realm experts and continued to shout arrogantly.

In that private room a middle-aged man’s brow furrowed slightly. He said softly, “Young Palace Lord, four million five hundred thousand to buy a fire-type Artifact Spirit isn’t very worthwhile. You don’t cultivate a fire-type skill and possess no fire-type Secret Treasure; what will you gain by buying it? If the Palace Master finds out about this, perhaps he will—”

“What do you know!” Across from the middle-aged man, a handsome youth with rosy lips and white teeth, holding a gilt fan and dressed like a noble son, sneered. “I indeed don’t cultivate fire-style skills, nor do I have a fire-type Secret Treasure, but…don’t you think this Artifact Spirit is very pretty? Besides, I’m curious whether she feels any different from a real woman. If so…hehe. No matter how many Source Crystals it costs, this Young Master will pay.”

The middle-aged man frowned at his words but could not say more and could only smile wryly. He knew this Young Master had a penchant for women, especially cold, mature beauties; the Artifact Spirit’s appearance naturally suited his taste.

“Five million!” Yang Kai announced the new price from B-9 private room with a blank expression.

“Bastard!”

Just as Yang Kai’s bid left his mouth, the youth acting like a noble suddenly sprang to his feet, paying no heed to decorum, and cried out fiercely, “You dare snatch what I set my sights on? Do you want to go against my Fei Sheng Palace? I bid five million one hundred thousand!”

At his outburst, many warriors present immediately realized his identity.

The bidder was none other than the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace, Ning Yuancheng.

Yang Kai’s face registered recognition as well — no wonder the voice sounded familiar; it was Ning Yuancheng. Yang Kai had dealt with him more than once: the first time helping Mo Xiaoqi out of trouble, the second at the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Just now, his mind had been occupied with Liu Yan, so he had not paid enough attention and had failed to pick up the voice.

It seemed the Dao Origin expert who had clashed Divine Sense with the man surnamed Han in Ning Yuancheng’s private room was likely Liu Yizhi, the Dao Origin expert guarding Ning Yuancheng's side.

“Fei Sheng Palace, so what? If your old man Ning Boyang were here, Han might even show him some face and let this Artifact Spirit go. As for you…hmph, you’re not worthy. Five million two hundred thousand!” From the adjoining private room, the man surnamed Han sneered.

“Who exactly are you?” Ning Yuancheng’s face went dark and he barked angrily.

The man surnamed Han laughed, "Go ask your father—he'll tell you whose man I am."

“Damn it, how dare he look down on this Young Master.” Ning Yuancheng’s face went iron-gray with anger.

"Young Palace Lord, this is after all someone else's turf. That Han is not one to be trifled with—perhaps... we should just let it be," Liu Yizhi urged.

“Let it go? How can I swallow this? He dared belittle me — fine, let’s see who brings more Source Crystals! You dare compare wealth with this Young Master and invite your own death!” Ning Yuancheng, on the verge of frenzy, shouted, “Five million five hundred thousand!”

"Five million six hundred thousand!" the man surnamed Han calmly increased the bid.

"Six million!"

"Six million one hundred thousand!"

……

From that point on, aside from his earlier few bids, Yang Kai had no further say in the auction. Once the price escalated to six million, Yang Kai knew he had no chance.

Kang Siran only had five million Source Crystals, and Yang himself carried but a few hundred thousand; even combining their funds they fell short of six million, unless they actually put up a chunk of Heavy Earth as collateral.

But Heavy Earth was far too precious; he dared not display it lightly lest he invite trouble, so recognizing he had no hope of competing, Yang remained silent.

Kang Siran glanced at him and sighed, offering comfort: “Brother Yang, let it be and go with the flow.”

Yang Kai merely nodded slightly and said nothing more.

At that stage of the bidding, anyone could see the contest carried a streak of spite: if Han had bid on Liu Yan for the sake of the Ink Jade Cauldron, then Ning Yuancheng’s purchase was truly a matter of face.

Although Han had tremendous wealth, he had just spent several million Source Crystals buying an Ink Jade Cauldron a moment ago, so he likely did not have that many Source Crystals left on him now.

When the price climbed to seven million, Han’s voice had grown gloomy.

In the end, when Ning Yuancheng called out a high bid of seven million five hundred thousand, Han finally fell silent.

"Ha, you dare compete with this Young Master? Haven’t you checked your own worth? When this Young Master fixes his sights on something, he never loses!" Ning Yuancheng mocked loudly.

"Young Palace Lord, show some mercy," Liu Yizhi murmured softly from the side.

"Why? This fellow doesn’t put me in his eyes — do you expect me to crawl to him? Dream on!" Ning Yuancheng flipped open his gilt fan and fanned himself with a face full of triumph.

Liu Yizhi sighed deeply and did not press the matter further.

"The Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace has bid seven million five hundred thousand. Is there a higher offer? If not, seven million five hundred thousand — once, twice, thrice — the fire-type Artifact Spirit belongs to the Young Palace Lord; please bring your Source Crystals to the backstage for settlement." The Drunken Old Man’s face wrinkled into a smile; as auctioneer he wanted as high a price as possible, for his own gains.

After speaking he fell solemn, his voice lowering: "The auction is nearing its close, and I needn’t say much about this final item — you all know it well. Bring the lot forward."

With that, a maid dragged a jade tray forward.

The final auction item, of course, was the Dao Origin Fruit the Tianwu Sacred Land had put into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; countless eyes widened as everyone leaned in to see.

Many warriors had never in their lives seen a Dao Origin Fruit; even if they knew they could not win the bid, they still wanted a look for later gossip over tea and meals.

Many guests at this auction had come specifically for the Dao Origin Fruit; in previous auctions, many of the Dao Origin experts in the A-Class private rooms had not even lifted a hand, not taking part in the Ink Jade Cauldron’s appearance or Liu Yan’s bidding.

They had come for only one purpose — the Dao Origin Fruit.

A single Dao Origin Fruit could refine a batch of pills; with luck it might yield five or six pills, possibly producing five or six experts of the Dao Origin Realm — a temptation no power could ignore.

Thus this final auction was destined to be fiercely contested among the great families and sects.

Yang Kai’s thoughts had long since drifted away from the auction floor.

The Dao Origin Fruit might hold great attraction for others, but to him it meant little; he already had one Dao Origin Fruit and lacked the funds to contest this one.

He silently tuned his senses to Liu Yan’s location.

Although the restriction on that round bowl had weakened his connection with Liu Yan to almost nothing, when he calmed his mind he could still perceive her.

Since he could not openly contest Liu Yan at the auction with strong wealth, he could only steal her in secret.

Fortunately, Liu Yan had ultimately been bought by Ning Yuancheng, so stealing her did not weigh heavily on Yang Kai’s conscience. He and Ning Yuancheng had some history: at the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda’s second-tier entrance Ning Yuancheng had once led a group of Fei Sheng Palace disciples to attack him.

Yang Kai paid little mind to Fei Sheng Palace’s other members, but the Dao Origin Second Stage Liu Yizhi posed some difficulty.

A Second Stage Dao Origin expert was not someone he could contend with directly; fortunately he had the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal — two blood beasts, one with Second Stage Dao Origin power and the other with First Stage — which together should be enough to restrain Liu Yizhi.

If they could keep Liu Yizhi occupied, then by Yang Kai’s methods snatching a Ning Yuancheng—gilded on the outside but rotten within—would be child’s play.

That was the thought, but actual execution would involve variables; he needed to plan carefully.

Yang Kai's thoughts drifted far beyond the mortal world, while the auction hall outside had already erupted into a white‑hot scramble over the Dao Origin Fruit.

Even Kang Siran had joined the bidding, but with his funds he had only two chances to call higher prices; his bids were immediately topped and the Dao Origin Fruit’s price soared to a level that left him despondent.

When someone shouted eight million, Kang Siran slumped back in his chair and sighed deeply.

Yang Kai, however, paid it no mind. Through his perception he could already sense Liu Yan’s aura within Fei Sheng Palace’s private chamber — she had evidently been handed over by the City Lord’s side. Ning Yuancheng, though, showed no hurry to depart; he lingered, intent on watching this dragon-and-tiger contest over the Dao Origin Fruit.
