## Chapter 950 — Twin Pavilion Visitors

In the Tianxiao Sect's inner chamber at the foot of the peak, Yang Kai unleashed his True Yang Yuan Qi, condensing it into a blaze of True Yang fire that surged toward the Bone Clan's skeleton.

Chu Lingxiao and the four senior uncles stood silently at the side, their faces showing clear apprehension.

Yang Kai's True Yang fire was no ordinary flame; it was the crystallization of his cultivation, impossibly concentrated and vigorous—few things could withstand its consuming heat.

The Bone Clan, bound by Locking Demon Chains and a variety of secret treasures, remained motionless, seeming truly dead to all appearances.

Yet the ominous killing intent that radiated from its body grew steadily denser.

Ssssss…

The chamber rang with grating crackles; with the naked eye they could see the bones and the meridians attached to them slowly burning to ash.

Suddenly, two jade-green lights flared up from the eye sockets of the bones—like two dismal eyes or twin ghost-fires, flickering and uncertain.

The already violent killing intent exploded outward with a thunderous roar.

A furious roar erupted from the Bone Clan's divine consciousness, seeping into everyone's Sea of Consciousness so that each person could keenly feel its unwillingness and rage; the howl carried an inexplicable Divine Sense attack that disturbed the divine senses of everyone except Chu Lingxiao.

Faces fell; Yang Kai increased his True Yuan output even further.

Crack—crack— the skeleton gradually shattered and turned into blackened dust.

The ghost-fire that had leapt in the Bone Clan's eye sockets rapidly dimmed and soon lost its light.

After the time it takes to burn an incense stick, only a mound of pitch-black powder remained.

The group looked at one another, silent for a moment.

“He really didn’t die… what tenacious vitality!” Fei Yu’s face was filled with lingering fear.

"Only a skeleton remains—how can it survive?" Cang Yan found it inexplicable as well.

"Perhaps he was always just a skeleton, with no flesh at all—maybe the bones themselves are his life essence…" Yang Kai mused.

"So you mean, as long as the skeleton remains, he won't die?" a voice asked.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "In any case, this race is entirely different from those known on the continent and extremely dangerous. If we encounter them again, we mustn't take it lightly."

"Don't worry—if I meet him again, I'll grind his bones to dust," Li Wan muttered fiercely.

"Are there such strange beings on the continent?" Chu Lingxiao frowned; with his experience and knowledge, if Yang Kai hadn't happened to arrive that day, he wouldn't have been able to determine the identity of the Bone Clan he had casually brought back.

At the time he had gone to scout the snowy mountains, tracing the source of the killing intent, and under a hundred zhang of packed snow he found the skeleton; sensing its abnormality, he had taken it back with him.

Fortunately, he had the foresight to seal it there.

"But since that day I've felt something different about the heavens and earth," Chu Lingxiao said solemnly.

“Patriarch, you mean…” Yang Kai looked at him doubtfully.

Chu Lingxiao pondered, then after a moment said, "You lack the cultivation to sense it clearly, but I believe anyone who reaches the Third Stage of the Saint Realm would feel the same as I do. The world seems clearer than before; at night many stars that previously could not be seen are now visible."

Yang Kai's expression changed.

"I don't know why this is, but it looks like the heavens are about to change," Chu Lingxiao sighed softly.

The four senior uncles trembled; now they understood why the Patriarch had often left his secluded chamber at night to look up at the starry sky since that day.

They hadn't known the reason for the Patriarch's odd behavior and had assumed Chu Lingxiao sought to comprehend the Dao; hearing this, they realized he had observed something unusual and had gone to study it closely.

After staying two more days at the Tianxiao Sect, Yang Kai, Ling Taixu and Su Mu returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Before they left, the Patriarch repeatedly warned them to be careful; if they ever encountered another creature as strange as the Bone Clan, they must inform him immediately.

Yang Kai readily promised.

He was silent on the journey, lost in thought.

Ling Taixu noticed his distraction and asked, "Has something happened?"

Yang Kai nodded and recounted the Bone Clan incident. Ling Taixu's face shifted, but he could offer no concrete advice—after all, he'd not been on Tongxuan Continent long enough to know its breadth, let alone what the Bone Clan was.

In the past, in the Great Han, they hadn't even known of demons and yao.

They had believed that the only intelligent beings in the world were humans.

It was only upon reaching Tongxuan Continent that they realized how narrow their prior knowledge had been.

"Grandmaster, don't worry—if the sky falls, someone taller will bear it," Yang Kai said with a light laugh, his mood easing. He turned to Su Mu and asked with a grin, "What has you grinning like that—did you get something good?"

Su Mu chuckled and produced a Spatial Pouch like an offering. "Look, the Patriarch gave this to me."

"A Spatial Pouch!" Yang Kai nodded. "You know how to use it, right?"

"Of course—the Patriarch and the senior uncles and aunt also gave me many secret treasures and martial manuals; I've put them all inside." Su Mu held the pouch to his chest and patted it reverently.

"You've been given so much—make good use of it and don't disappoint the Patriarch and your seniors," Ling Taixu admonished earnestly.

“Disciple understands,” Su Mu said with a solemn nod, then suddenly added, “Brother-in-law, when will you bring my sister back? Our whole Sect has already come over—it’s about time Sister returned too.”

"Mm, when I send you back this time I'll go look for Su Yan," Yang Kai promised.

Even without Su Mu's reminder, he had planned the same; seven or eight years of separation had been long enough—Yang Kai did not want to suffer that longing any longer.

Xia Ningshang is also at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; once Su Yan is found, the whole family can be reunited.

Yang Kai very much longed for such a life.

Two days later, the three returned to the old site of the War Soul Hall.

No sooner had they arrived than Xu Hui reported, "Saint Lord, two days ago some people came to the Sacred Land seeking an audience with you."

"Who are they?" Yang Kai asked.

"They say they're the pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion—named Wu Fa and Wu Tian!" Xu Hui reported, unable to keep from grinning; even he found the two names brazen.

"Oh? They came in person?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

On the journey to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land with these Great Han cultivators, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's master Chen Zhou had sent Elder Xiao Ling to inform the Twin Pavilion; months later the Twin Pavilion had indeed taken action.

That the two pavilion masters came personally showed they truly valued the Hu sisters.

Yang Kai was pleased—at least they had shown sufficient sincerity.

"Saint Lord, do you wish to see them?" Xu Hui asked.

"Yes—of course. Where are they now?"

"They're in the Sacred Land!"

"Good. Continue to entertain them and tell them I'll return at once."

Xu Hui acknowledged and hurried off.

After he left, Yang Kai released his divine sense and searched the War Soul Hall; in a moment he located the Hu sisters and rushed toward them.

The War Soul Hall covered a considerable area; the Blood Battle Gang's quarters lay to its northwest, where a cluster of buildings could house their disciples.

The Hu sisters and their leader Hu Man were busily tending the new lodgings with the other disciples—repairing damaged rooms and sweeping floors.

Seeing Yang Kai, Hu Man laughed heartily and came forward, clasping his fists. "Nephew Yang has come."

The Hu sisters' eyes lit up, their smiles blooming like flowers.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and asked, "How is it here—are you satisfied?"

Hu Man hurriedly said, "How could we be anything but satisfied? You arranged everything and brought many cultivation supplies. We only need to settle in and cultivate. We're a fully satisfied with the environment—there's nothing to complain about."

"That's good. If you need anything, tell the Sacred Land elders; they'll do everything possible to help."

“There’s nothing I need.” Hu Man laughed heartily, then suddenly shifted the topic: “But if my worthy nephew ever has free time, could you spare a moment to give some guidance to my two daughters? I would be endlessly grateful. Mm, best if it were day and night guidance—even personal, hands-on teaching would be fine. I trust you completely, heheh!”

“Father, if you don’t speak, no one will mistake you for a mute!” Hu Jiao’er’s face flushed red as she glared at her father.

Since coming here, Hu Man had constantly praised Yang Kai to his daughters; they well understood his intentions, and saying such things in front of Yang Kai made Hu Jiao'er a little embarrassed.

His intentions were obvious on his face.

"Go on chatting then!" Hu Man chuckled awkwardly and slipped away.

"Don't mind him," Hu Jiao'er said, coming to Yang Kai's side, the flush still on her cheeks. "He's prone to babbling nonsense."

"What brings you to see us?" Hu Mei'er asked.

"The Twin Pavilion people are here," Yang Kai replied solemnly.

The Hu sisters both trembled, their eyes burning as they looked at Yang Kai.

“The visitors are the two Pavilion Masters of the Twin Pavilion. Their intentions are obvious, and their sincerity sufficient. Now it all depends on what you wish to do.”

The sisters exchanged a glance, seeming unable to decide; after a moment Hu Jiao'er said, "Whatever you say, we'll do—we'll follow your lead."

They handed the choice to Yang Kai.

"Do you want to go?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The sisters nodded together. Hu Jiao'er said, "We want to see what kind of sect it is."

Yang Kai could understand their feelings—when he learned that the Dragon-Phoenix Palace was the source of his and Su Yan's legacy, he had instinctively connected it to himself.

Granting Sun Yu such a great opportunity, and showing goodwill toward the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, was also for this very reason.

“If you want to go, then go! Over there, you might even find people you share common ground with, and who knows—you may gain even greater rewards.”

With Chen Zhou vouching for Wu Fa and Wu Tian's character, and with his own guarantee, the Hu sisters should not suffer any loss if they went to the Twin Pavilion.

The Twin Pavilion masters will treat them like treasures.
