## Chapter 2435 — The Might of the Star Refining Technique

In other words, those who possess higher-grade Star Seals can detect the hiding places of those with lower-grade Star Seals from a great distance.

If your Star Seal is of a lower grade than someone else’s, no matter what profound secret arts you use, you’ll still be found. This trait of the Star Seal turns every opening of the Shattered Star Sea into a bloody storm—many cultivators don’t hesitate to kill in order to upgrade their Star Seals.

This trait of the Star Seal is truly heaven-defying, and Yang Kai’s expression grew grave as he listened.

He hadn’t paid much attention to the grade of his own Star Seal before. In his mind, as long as it was usable, there was no need to pursue more. But after hearing Hua Qingsi’s explanation, Yang Kai finally understood that to ensure his own safety, his Star Seal’s grade had to be high enough, or else he could easily be discovered by others.

This trait indirectly fuels slaughter and plundering among cultivators! Every cultivator in the Shattered Star Sea, whether willing or not, is forced to find ways to raise the grade of their Star Seal.

“That’s basically all there is to the Star Seal, but I’ve also heard another legend…” As Hua Qingsi spoke, her expression suddenly turned serious.

Zhang Ruoxi asked nervously, “What is it?”

Hua Qingsi looked at Yang Kai and said, “It’s said that if you can obtain the highest grade Nine-Pointed Star Seal, it can guide you to the location of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s inheritance!”

“Is that for real?” Yang Kai’s face was full of shock.

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and smiled, “Since the Shattered Star Sea has existed, this legend has always circulated. No one can prove if it’s true or not, because no one has ever managed to upgrade their Star Seal to the highest level. Naturally, there’s no way to verify it.” She paused, then continued, “But this probably doesn’t interest you much, Young Master Yang.”

The Incarnation cultivates the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, which is precisely the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s inheritance. Yang Kai naturally has no need to pursue it.

“It may not interest me much, but it’s different for others.” Yang Kai’s expression grew a bit more serious. He suddenly realized that in this Shattered Star Sea, the Star Seal was like a double-edged sword, the very source of all bloodshed and sin. It brought great benefits to cultivators here, but its traits also led to brutal slaughter among them.

If not for the existence of the Star Seals, the chances of conflict among cultivators here would be much lower.

“Of course, not everyone wants to seek the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s inheritance. In the Shattered Star Sea, there are also other treasures left behind by various Great Emperors, all things we cultivators yearn for. I heard that in the Shattered Star Sea five thousand years ago, someone found the Green Lotus Great Emperor’s Immortal Green Lotus and inherited his mantle.”

“What happened to that person?” Liu Yan asked calmly.

Hua Qingsi replied, “The top sect Green Lotus Palace, which now resounds throughout the Eastern Territory, was founded by that person. He is also the current Palace Master of Green Lotus Palace.”

“That’s some good luck,” Yang Kai raised his brows slightly.

“Luck is fate. Which of us cultivators doesn’t rely on fate in our cultivation?” Hua Qingsi said softly.

Yang Kai deeply agreed. Any cultivator who could reach the Dao Origin Realm needed tremendous fortune. If their fate was deep enough, they could go further and glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm. If not, they would spend their whole life wandering at the Dao Origin Realm.

“Alright, let’s leave that aside for now. There’s some broken Origin Power here—let’s refine it together first,” Yang Kai said.

Originally, the Stellar Origin should have been hidden somewhere inside the Cultivation Star, and just searching for it would have taken a lot of effort. But now, this Cultivation Star was already shattered, and the broken Origin Power had leaked out, so there was no need to search—just refine and absorb it.

Upon hearing this, Hua Qingsi and the others all nodded, each finding a spot to sit cross-legged and circulate their cultivation arts.

Yang Kai did the same. Although he didn’t think much of the Origin Power here, what that person said earlier wasn’t wrong—many grains make a tower, and when quantity changes enough, it leads to a qualitative change.

Origin Power is a very special force. Refining and absorbing it won’t increase a cultivator’s strength, but it brings great benefits to any cultivator. Especially for Hua Qingsi and the others, who had never refined Origin Power before—if they could gain something in the Shattered Star Sea this time, it would definitely help them advance to the Emperor Realm.

Time passed slowly. The four of them sat scattered not far from each other, meditating without disturbing one another.

After half a day, Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

He found that the efficiency of refining and absorbing like this was simply too low.

The four of them had worked hard for half a day, but the Origin Power here hadn’t been absorbed much at all. At this rate, it would take at least ten days, perhaps even half a month, to completely refine all the Origin Power here.

If it took four people this long, wouldn’t it take one or two months for a single person? That was far too troublesome.

He quietly observed Hua Qingsi and the others and found they were the same as him.

Only Zhang Ruoxi seemed to be refining and absorbing a bit faster, perhaps due to her bloodline, but even so, the difference was very limited.

He wondered what would happen if he let the Incarnation out to use the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to refine—since its trait was to devour everything under the heavens, the Origin Power here would be no exception.

As he thought about it, Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit up.

The Incarnation had the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, but he himself had another secret art—one specifically for refining Stellar Origins.

The Star Refining Technique!

He had obtained this secret art back when the Imperial Garden on Dark Star opened. Strictly speaking, it was Yang Yan’s secret art. Yang Kai was able to refine Dark Star’s Stellar Origin and become its Star Lord all thanks to the Star Refining Technique.

Later, he passed the Star Refining Technique to Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang, who also successfully refined the Stellar Origin of Tongxuan Continent.

This proves that the Star Refining Technique is absolutely a secret art specialized for refining Stellar Origin! Isn’t it perfect for this place?

Yang Kai instantly became excited. Without hesitation, he began to use the Star Refining Technique.

At first, there was no reaction around him, but as time passed, the broken Origin Power in the surroundings seemed to sense an irresistible lure, like cats drawn to the scent of fish. One after another, streams of Origin Power surged toward him, gathering for him to refine and absorb.

After a while, specks of starlight appeared around his body, as if he were surrounded by countless fireflies. Each speck of starlight contained rich Origin Power, the manifestation of the Origin's strength.

Yang Kai’s body became a bottomless pit, accepting everything, opening himself up to all the starlight.

For a moment, the scene was a spectacular sight, dazzling and magnificent.

Hua Qingsi and the others were all startled, opening their eyes to look at Yang Kai in astonishment.

With Yang Kai doing this, even Zhang Ruoxi couldn’t absorb any more Origin Power. All of it was drawn to Yang Kai, leaving the others unable to gain any benefit.

No one knew how much time passed before the starlight around Yang Kai gradually thinned and then disappeared.

Realizing there was no Origin Power left here, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, his face full of satisfaction.

Across from him, three pairs of beautiful eyes looked at him resentfully, as if he had abandoned them after getting what he wanted.

Yang Kai wiped the sweat from his forehead and said awkwardly, “I was just running an experiment—I didn’t expect it to work so well!”

Although he had been refining Stellar Origin, he was still somewhat aware of what was happening around him and understood why Hua Qingsi and the others were looking at him so strangely.

Hua Qingsi asked, “Young Master Yang, what secret art is that? You absorbed all the origin here in just half a day.”

“The Star Refining Technique.” Yang Kai beckoned, “Come, I’ll teach you. This secret art is practically tailor-made for this place.”

The three women’s eyes lit up at his words. They hurried over, sat down cross-legged in front of him, and looked at him intently.

Yang Kai immediately began to teach them, holding nothing back.

The three women listened with great focus, and their comprehension was excellent. Two days later, they had fully grasped the technique. Once they had mastered the Star Refining Technique, Yang Kai set off again, heading into the cold, empty starry sky.

With the Star Refining Technique, he felt he could completely make up for the time lost over the past year.

After all, the time others needed to refine Stellar Origin was nothing compared to his own—his efficiency was far higher.

Five days later, Yang Kai used his Star Seal to find another Cultivation Star with broken Origin Power.

He took Hua Qingsi and the others down, and in less than half a day, all the Origin Power there was absorbed. It was the first time Hua Qingsi and the others had absorbed origin so efficiently, so they were left wanting more.

Over the next month, Yang Kai continued to search and explore the starry sky, finding Stellar Origins several more times.

This month of wandering gave Yang Kai a deep appreciation for the wonders of the Star Seal. Often, from a great distance, he could sense the presence of others—presumably because their Star Seals were of a lower grade and couldn’t hide their auras from him.

He didn’t go looking for trouble with those people, just focused on searching for Origin Power.

After a month, all four of them had gained quite a bit.

One day, after absorbing the origin of a Cultivation Star, Hua Qingsi suddenly walked up to Yang Kai, looking like she wanted to say something but hesitated.

Yang Kai looked at her curiously and asked, “Sister Hua, what is it?”

Hua Qingsi said, “Young Master Yang, I want to act alone.”

Yang Kai was stunned and frowned, “Is it because four people have to split the Origin Power?”

Hua Qingsi shook her head, “How could I think that? It’s just…” She turned to look at the pitch-black void, her beautiful eyes flickering with a strange light. “I can feel that the Shattered Star Sea is a place of rebirth for me. Somewhere out there, an opportunity is waiting for me! I want to go see.”

Yang Kai raised his brows at her words.

Hua Qingsi was now already a peak Dao Origin Realm expert, just one step away from advancing to the Emperor Realm. At such a critical juncture, having this kind of feeling likely meant there really was an opportunity waiting for her.

Sometimes, a sudden flash of insight in a cultivator’s heart is more effective than ten or twenty years of closed-door cultivation.
