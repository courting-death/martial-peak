## Chapter 1924 — Unwilling

During his days with the Sword Alliance, life was hardly different from serving the Hengluo Commerce Guild — rushing about, boarding warships to travel to one cultivation star after another, medicine stars, mining stars, and arranging Great Space Arrays.

Fortunately, Qingmu Star served as a transfer point, so the time consumed was not long.

In barely one and a half years, the Sword Alliance had linked together seventeen stars.

Yang Kai once again held a lecture on pill refinement for the alliance’s alchemists, which at last allowed him to break free.

At that time, only six years remained before the ten-year pact he had made with Ghost Ancestor would come due.

He returned to Dark Star!

When Yang Kai returned to the sect, everyone in Lingxiao Sect was naturally overjoyed; over ten thousand disciples came out to welcome him.

Yang Kai was astonished to find that the martial standards within the sect had risen another notch since he had left — especially Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, who, at some unknown time, had both broken through to the Void King Realm!

After her breakthrough, Su Yan’s aura grew ever purer and without blemish. Although her Ice‑Crystal Yu Body had been cultivated later rather than being innate, the esoteric secrets from Chi Lan Star’s Ice Valley still carried tremendous, awe‑inspiring power—more than enough to reshape her original constitution.

With the Ice‑Crystal Yu Body, the originating power of the Ice Phoenix within her, and wielding the Profound Frost Divine Sword, Su Yan was no ordinary First Stage of the Void King Realm.

Against an ordinary Second Stage of the Void King Realm, she would not necessarily be at a disadvantage.

If she and Yang Kai joined their swords, easily cleaving a Third Stage of the Void King Realm would likely be no great challenge.

After breaking through, Xia Ningshang’s aura had grown ever more natural, as if she had merged with heaven and earth itself; Yang Kai watched for a long while and could not discern the reason, only feeling it must be the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body returning to its true essence.

Combat was not Xia Ningshang’s forte. But in alchemy, she was an absolute genius.

Upon ascending to the Void King Realm, her pill‑refining advanced by leaps and bounds; she had long since surpassed the present Yang Kai in that art.

She had returned to Tongxuan Continent several times to witness the land’s vigorous prosperity and development, and knew that only by growing stronger herself could she bring a brighter future to Tongxuan Continent, so she spared no effort in cultivation.

Her cultivation was alchemy!

The sole result was that Lingxiao Sect now stored vast quantities of Spiritual Pills; no matter how many herbs flowed into the sect, Xia Ningshang would refine them into pills and immediately send them out across Dark Star for sale, exchanging them for yet more medicinal materials.

Besides the two women, others had also made considerable progress in their cultivation.

However, Ye Xijun had only just broken into the Void King Realm and had not managed to advance further, while Ghost Ancestor remained in seclusion and likewise could not take that crucial step, remaining stuck at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai rested in Lingxiao Sect for a month. During that month he spent time properly with his parents, Grandmaster, the founding master and other relatives, and was almost inseparable from Su Yan and Xia Ningshang.

It was only after a month that he suddenly vanished from everyone’s sight.

Apart from a handful of people who knew where he had gone, no one knew his current whereabouts.

Night fell, the sky studded with stars.

On Lingxiao Sect’s Medicine Peak, Xia Ningshang sat on the stone steps outside the main hall, propping her chin in her hands and looking up; through the star‑spangled night she seemed to make out a familiar figure.

Ssshhh…

Light footsteps sounded; Xia Ningshang turned and upon seeing the newcomer smiled slightly. “Senior Sister!”

Su Yan nodded gently, walked to stand beside Xia Ningshang, and likewise looked up toward a certain part of the sky.

The two peerless beauties, one standing and one seated, in an instant became the most beautiful sight in the world.

A breeze stirred, ruffling their waterfall‑like hair.

Su Yan narrowed her beautiful eyes slightly and asked, “Junior Sister, are you worrying about him?”

Xia Ningshang shook her head slowly. “Not worried. He always returns safely.”

“Then is it reluctance?” Su Yan asked again.

Xia Ningshang’s face flushed; she bit her lip and said, “Would Senior Sister be willing?”

A faint blush also flitted across Su Yan’s jade‑white cheek and she shook her head. “Of course I’m reluctant. But… it doesn’t matter; it’s like this every time.”

“Yes, it’s like this every time!” Xia Ningshang smiled softly. “I’ve somewhat become accustomed to it.”

Su Yan said, “Men are always a worry. Back then we were nothing but small figures in Zhongdu; later we went to the Tongxuan Continent, and then to the Star Domain. Each time our horizons broadened, and every time he went out first as the vanguard. This time is no different. We don’t really know what the Star Realm holds or what dangers await, but there’s nothing we can do except not let ourselves fall too far behind him in cultivation — then wait.”

“Senior Sister, are you a little unwilling?”

“I want to accompany him, to share wind and rain!” A trace of melancholy flashed through Su Yan’s beautiful eyes.

Thinking of Yang Kai’s years of experience, there had never been an occasion when he faced danger and she stood at his side; instead, whenever she was in peril he would appear like a god and use his heroic body to shield her from all the raging storms that came.

While enjoying being protected and cared for, Su Yan naturally harbored a small… unwillingness.

Even if it were mountains of blades and seas of fire, even if it were the hells of Asura, just once she wanted to walk that path hand in hand with him; even if blood ran in torrents and he body were lacerated, even if she paid with her life and her soul was extinguished, she would have no regrets.

Momentarily silent, the two women’s beautiful eyes pierced the void and fixed on some distant point.

Outside Dark Star, for ten thousand li, lay a Death Domain — a wasteland steeped in terrifying energies, the lingering ruinous breath left from the titanic clash between the Starry Sky Emperor and the Insect Emperor. Imperial Might hung heavy and chaotic there, the laws themselves in disarray; even Void King Realm experts would not dare to trespass lightly.

Because such a Death Domain enveloped the star, Dark Star had remained undiscovered by outsiders for so many years, existing in a semi‑sealed state.

At this very moment, Yang Kai lay shirtless at the very center of the Death Domain.

His body was doused in blood yet emanated golden light; the powerful regenerative ability of his Golden Blood was continuously repairing his injuries, but the horrific Imperial Might around him was also ceaselessly shredding his flesh.

His physical body cycled between destruction and restoration.

Yang Kai endured unimaginable pain and torment.

He did not deploy any power to resist the Imperial Might pressing in from all sides; instead he let his body be the instrument to perceive the wonder of that might and the profound depths of the laws.

He had cultivated the Undying Five Elements Sword, his bodily quality was robust, he had swallowed countless Huntian Pills, and he possessed pure Golden Blood; these advantages allowed him to survive in such a place.

Any other Void King Realm practitioner would have to circulate their power to withstand the Death Domain’s terrifying force.

Yet even so, that dreadful Imperial Might was not something he could repel with ease.

He had no choice but to explode the accumulated Golden Blood within him to sustain his life.

As time passed, a layer of golden blood cocoon had already formed on Yang Kai’s body; to the eye he looked like a silkworm, wrapped entirely in a blood cocoon, with only the powerful beat of his heart sounding from within, attesting to his surging life force.

Though tortured beyond endurance, Yang Kai felt this was also a rare experience and opportunity for him, and an excellent moment to refine the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Wrapped in the blood cocoon, he took out the Five Elements Treasures and ravenously absorbed the energy from them, integrating it into his flesh.

Moreover, he retrieved the Void Mind Crystal he had obtained from the Tongtian Auction House on Purple Star and peered into the mysteries of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

The starry sky was hushed and still; no one expected that within this awe‑inspiring Death Domain someone was pushing his limits and using such enormous pressure to stimulate his potential.

Yang Kai knew his remaining time was limited; arranging Space Arrays for the Hengluo Commerce Guild and the Sword Alliance had wasted much of his years, so he could only make up for it in this way.

Time passed day after day — one year, two years, three years…

One day the weather was clear, cloudless for thousands of miles, the blue sky as clear and reflective as a mirror.

Suddenly, somewhere in the void a dazzling golden light erupted, flashing and vanishing in an instant.

At the same time, a shocking aura came from a very distant place.

Dark Star trembled with a hum, as if some thread in destiny had been pulled, causing the star’s fortunes to fluctuate.

The next moment, an unbelievable scene unfolded.

The Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Qi of Dark Star suddenly grew noticeably richer. From the Star Domain innumerable shafts of light surged toward Dark Star—each one brilliantly multicolored and exquisitely beautiful, like a rainbow trailing a long tail as it arced down to every corner of the star.

But they soon found that where those multicolored lights landed, those places became like paradises — the Spiritual Qi was tens or even hundreds of times richer than usual.

Desolate mountains that had long been ignored instantly brimmed with Spiritual Qi and would soon be green and vibrant, filled with birdsong and blossoms.

Even places that already enjoyed good Spiritual Qi became even more suited for a cultivator’s seclusion.

Every cultivator felt their blood boiling and flowing; the comfortable surroundings made them ecstatically joyful.

They believed this to be a great gift from the heavens!

In Lingxiao Sect, in the Hundred Flowers Residence.

At the instant the golden light burst forth, Ye Xijun had sensed it and looked up.

The next moment a grim, ghost‑like figure appeared beside her, its aura deep and unfathomable — none other than Ghost Ancestor, who had recently broken through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Seeing Ghost Ancestor arrive, Ye Xijun inclined her head slightly.

Ghost Ancestor grinned and said, “That kid has emerged from seclusion!”

“So it was Sect Master who caused the commotion?” Ye Xijun asked.

Ghost Ancestor replied, “Who else could stir the fortunes of the entire star besides its Lord? He has absorbed the star’s Origin, and his strength is tied to Dark Star itself. You’ve lived here so long; haven’t you noticed that every time he grows stronger, Dark Star benefits greatly?”
