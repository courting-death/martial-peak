## Chapter 1779 — A Bit Crowded

"Elder, your position is still very dangerous — excuse me!" Yang Kai suddenly said in a low voice, then moved without hesitation, wrapping an arm around Luo Lan's waist and pulling her into his embrace.

Caught completely off guard, Luo Lan was unable to resist and fell into Yang Kai's arms.

"Ah!" she cried out, her brows lifting in alarm as her Saint Yuan flared.

“Elder, sense what’s behind you!” Yang Kai spoke rapidly, just before Luo Lan, in her anger, could strike.

Luo Lan was startled, immediately releasing her Divine Sense to probe the situation behind her.

At that sight, her face changed color.

Right behind her, less than an inch away, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light had flowed across, leaving only a tiny sliver of space.

If Yang Kai had not pulled her back a moment earlier, by now half her body would likely have been engulfed by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; given that light's terrifying power, the outcome for her was easy to imagine.

Even now, her position remained perilous; the divine light creeping over the spatial rift looked as if it might touch her at any moment — exceedingly dangerous.

A chill ran through her whole body as Luo Lan finally felt the aftershock of fear.

She also understood Yang Kai had not meant to take advantage of her; it had been a necessity, and she hurriedly dissipated her Saint Yuan, embarrassedly saying, "Sorry, I overreacted."

"It’s fine." Yang Kai shook his head and knit his brows inward — he, too, felt a headache coming on.

Although the spatial rift here provided just enough space for him and Luo Lan to hide, the situation still left both of them rather uneasy—the two were pressed so close their faces were nearly touching, their bodies pressed tightly together. Yang Kai could distinctly feel the soft sensation of Luo Lan’s chest pressing against his own, the astounding elasticity and the two slight protrusions at her front stirring his heart and mind in spite of himself.

Especially when Luo Lan spoke—her breath, fragrant as orchids, brushed directly against him…

Were anyone ignorant of the truth to see them now, they would likely assume Yang Kai and Luo Lan were engaging in some shameful affair; in truth, both were tormented by the situation.

Yang Kai was better off — after all, he was a man. Though uncomfortable, he calmed his mind, suppressed desire, and thought of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang to drive away distracting thoughts; after a little while his expression returned to normal.

Luo Lan, however, grew redder and redder; the pale, slender line of her neck flushed crimson, inviting endless imaginings. The delicate body Yang Kai held stiffened to the extreme, trembling slightly from nerves.

She had never imagined this encounter would bring her into such intimate contact with someone as junior as Yang Kai!

This had never happened before.

That firm chest, those broad arms, and the masculine scent so close at hand all crashed upon her senses like a flood or a wild beast, leaving her utterly unable to remain calm.

Her cheeks burned like fire; she was certain her face was unbearably red.

To blush so in front of a junior... Luo Lan wished she could find a hole and disappear forever in embarrassment.

When she remembered the Seven Luminaries Divine Light would take at least another half an hour to fade, and that she would have to maintain this posture with Yang Kai for that long, she grew even more restless and uncomfortable.

She could not help but twist her body a little...

"Elder... don't move," Yang Kai said with a wry smile. He had just managed to clear his distracting thoughts and find composure, but Luo Lan's movement ruined his effort, especially when he sensed the two small protrusions pressing against his chest grow firm...

Hearing Yang Kai say that, Luo Lan felt even more ashamed, wishing she could sink into the ground. She lowered her head until it was buried against her own chest.

"I'll turn away," she suddenly suggested softly after a moment of silence.

Facing each other was unbearably awkward; turning around would ease the situation somewhat.

"Oh." Yang Kai nodded and loosened his hand from around Luo Lan's waist.

Carefully, fearing she might touch the Seven Luminaries Divine Light only an inch away, Luo Lan turned so that her back faced Yang Kai.

"Uh..." Yang Kai immediately noticed a new problem.

When they faced each other he had been able to feel the magnificence of her bosom, but now that softness and springiness were gone; instead, her rounded buttocks pressed directly against his lower body — firm, shapely, and with an undeniably exquisite feel.

Luo Lan also sensed it and, having turned, stiffened as if struck by lightning, frozen in place and afraid to move.

Time dragged on; both endured it like a year.

"Elder..." Yang Kai suddenly spoke.

“Mm?” Luo Lan was startled, her whole body trembling slightly. In such an awkward atmosphere, Yang Kai’s sudden voice gave her quite a scare—especially since his breath brushed right across her earlobe as he spoke, like a gentle caress upon her ear, sending a tingling shiver through her.

"I've thought it over; I should leave," Yang Kai said.

"Leave?" Luo Lan blinked. "Where can you go now?"

Once she steadied her mind she understood Yang Kai's suggestion was meant to protect her chastity and reputation. Her heart warmed; secretly she thought the young man was not so bad for not having taken advantage of the situation and for keeping his composure.

But the entire Medicine Valley was covered by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; Yang Kai had nowhere to go.

"Into the spatial rift!" Yang Kai replied.

"Into that?" Luo Lan was shocked. Although she knew Yang Kai was skilled in spatial power, she did not understand the depth of his attainment, so her first thought was danger — if they went in and could not find a way back, they'd be trapped forever.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “This place is fine for one person to hide in, but for two… heh, it’s a bit too cramped.”

"But... are you certain you can come out of there?"

"I can get out." Yang Kai nodded. He had already traversed the void rift once before, of course he had confidence. The only risk was that the exit might not open back into Medicine Valley but somewhere else in the Lost Realm, which would be a serious loss. Unless they stayed put and he tore open the void from the same place later to return.

He did not explain such details to Luo Lan — after all, their relationship was not intimate.

Luo Lan fell silent a moment, then said softly, "You don't have to take such a risk for me... let's just wait here until the Seven Luminaries Divine Light fades."

Yang Kai's concern for her chastity made her reluctant to see him take big risks.

"Thanks for your concern, Elder, but I'll still go." Yang Kai smiled and prepared to enter the spatial rift. Just before leaving, a thought rose and he said, "Oh right, Elder, I'll give you something."

"What is it?" Luo Lan asked curiously.

No sooner had she spoken than Yang Kai reached out and lightly touched her shoulder.

"Good luck, Elder!" Yang Kai said, then vanished straight into the spatial rift.

The space behind her suddenly felt empty, and Luo Lan was momentarily dazed. After a brief pause, she shifted her steps, moving back a little to place herself in a safer position.

Only then did she have time to check what Yang Kai had given her.

With Divine Sense she probed the spot he had touched on her shoulder and cried out, "This is..."

For some reason, when her Divine Sense examined the place Yang Kai had touched, she could clearly sense fluctuations in the surrounding spatial force and perceive the hidden spatial rift nearby!

At last she understood the magnitude of the gift Yang Kai had given her.

With this gift she could travel freely within the Lost Realm without worrying about accidentally encountering hidden spatial rifts.

Luo Lan was ecstatic!

"Thank you!" Although she knew Yang Kai could not hear her, she still spoke the words to quiet her heart.

This encounter had made her see clearly what kind of person Yang Kai truly was and how much potential he possessed. No wonder Young Master Gu Jianxin praised him so highly; Yang Kai himself had such charm and ability.

Previously Luo Lan's friendly attitude toward Yang Kai had been because of Gu Jianxin, and because she wished to borrow his spatial force; now, even without those factors, she would not look down on him for his merely Origin Returning Realm cultivation.

The young man had good character and tremendous potential; befriending him was certainly a wise choice, and she might need his help in the future.

Luo Lan resolved quietly that once she returned to Qingmu Star she would take good care of Yang Kai's Twin Shark Island residence.

......

Within the void rift, Yang Kai was alone.

Leaving a Spatial Mark on Luo Lan so she could sense the existence of spatial rifts wasn’t because Yang Kai had been overcome by lust.

From beginning to end, he had not harbored many thoughts toward her.

He only thought that if Luo Lan were safer and stronger, his residence and the Great Space Array on Qingmu Star would be more secure. Besides, leaving such a spatial imprint was effortless for him and cost nothing.

So why not?

After entering the void rift, Yang Kai did not linger but began to search the surroundings.

The Seven Luminaries Divine Light would not withdraw for another half hour, and he had plenty of time within the void rift to look for a true Ethereal Crystal.

In this way his time would not be wasted waiting, though he had to be careful to note his exit point so he did not accidentally leave the Medicine Valley.
