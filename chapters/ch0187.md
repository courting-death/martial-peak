## Chapter 187 — All-Around, Non-Differential, Three-Dimensional Stimulation

Miao Lin's words were so blatant that his intentions were already apparent.

Yu Aoqing's pretty face turned cold as she spoke in a chilling tone, "If you dare to speak nonsense again, I will kill you!"

"Hehe!" Miao Lin remained unafraid, "After all, we're all going to die. What's the difference between dying early or late? Senior Sister, you've lived in this world; do you really want to die with your virginity intact? That would be too much of a waste. Why not let your junior brother serve you well tonight and let you experience the most wonderful pleasures in the world? That way, even if we die, you won't have any regrets."

Yu Aoqing was panting heavily, clearly furious. Her eyes were like frost as she glared at Miao Lin, who she never expected to be so bold and reckless under such immense pressure of life and death, daring to lay a hand on her.

But Yu Aoqing clearly would not let him have his way. The killing intent flickered in her eyes; as long as Miao Lin dared to come any closer, she would not hesitate to strike him down!

Miao Lin noticed this and, though he was determined to taste her sweetness, he couldn't muster the courage. After a long stalemate, he forced a smile and retreated.

Yu Aoqing couldn't help but relax. In a place like this, unless absolutely necessary, she truly did not want to engage in a fight with anyone.

The cave was silent.

However, this tranquility did not last long. About the time it takes to burn an incense stick later, heavy panting from both a man and a woman echoed simultaneously.

Yang Kai and Yu Aoqing both frowned and looked towards the source of the sound. Just one glance left Yang Kai speechless, and Yu Aoqing was left dumbfounded.

Miao Lin had failed to persuade Yu Aoqing, but he gained something else; at that moment, he was passionately entangled with Luo Qianqian.

Perhaps Miao Lin's flowery words had taken effect, or perhaps the pressure of death required a release. Whatever the reason, Luo Qianqian was not a virtuous woman; the two embraced, rolling on the ground, lost in passionate hugs and kisses, completely oblivious to their surroundings.

Listening to the passionate gasps in the cave, Yang Kai felt his blood flow accelerate, and his throat felt a bit fiery, unable to resist the urge to lick his lips.

It had been three or four months since he had parted from Su Yan. As time passed and his strength grew, the effects of the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique on him deepened.

During the recent exploration of the Hidden Island with the Yunxia Sect's ship, he had been cautious everywhere, leaving him no time to think too much. Even when he was in trouble on the Hidden Island, acting alongside Yu Aoqing and the others, he sometimes felt involuntary desires. Yet, he could rely on his willpower to suppress them.

If nothing unexpected happened, Yang Kai believed he could hold out for a long time until he returned to Lingxiao Pavilion to cultivate with Su Yan.

But… Yang Kai could never have imagined that one day, someone would perform a live show right in front of him, just three zhang away, right under his nose!

This kind of stimulation was more intense than any verbal or physical temptation; it was a full-spectrum, non-differential, three-dimensional stimulation coming from sight, sound, and smell!

Even a saint would likely feel ripples in their heart. How much more so for Yang Kai, who was deeply affected by the Dual Cultivation Technique?

It was like a beggar who had gone hungry for months suddenly being presented with a feast of delicacies right in front of him…

Yang Kai wished he could slap Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian to death!

Yang Kai felt uncomfortable all over, and what about Yu Aoqing, the outsider? She was no less distressed.

First, she was stunned, her cheeks flushed, then her mouth slightly agape, dumbfounded. When Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian rolled to her feet, disheveled and panting heavily, she finally snapped out of her daze and jumped up, hurriedly fleeing towards Yang Kai.

The cave was small to begin with, and with Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian rolling on the ground, the space left for Yang Kai and Yu Aoqing was very limited.

The scene was bizarre and strange, likely a rare occurrence in a thousand years!

A man and a woman were passionately venting on the ground, while another man and woman sat aside as onlookers. It looked like the extravagant life of the wealthy.

Adulterers!

Yang Kai and Yu Aoqing cursed in their hearts almost simultaneously.

But at that moment, who could blame Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian? Yu Aoqing was already so embarrassed she wanted to find a hole to hide in, and Yang Kai had no mind to meddle; he was desperately trying to suppress the rising desires within him.

The heavy breathing grew more intense, clothes scattered all over the ground, and soon Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian were in a heated embrace, the air becoming humid, the scene exceedingly suggestive.

With a suppressed gasp, the sounds of splashing water and moans soon followed.

Yu Aoqing instinctively leaned closer to Yang Kai; at that moment, she felt he was her only support, at least more reliable than the lustful Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian.

"Get away!" Yang Kai was already struggling to hold back, and now Yu Aoqing was pressing against him, her soft body and the scent of a young girl almost made him lose control.

His rough attitude and low growl managed to bring Yu Aoqing back to her senses a little. She glared at Yang Kai in anger, but found him staring at her with bloodshot eyes.

Those eyes… were even more filled with desire and madness than Miao Lin's had been just now.

Yu Aoqing felt a chill run down her spine as she remembered that the boy beside her was also a man!

She quickly moved aside, but the intense gasps and moans poured into her ears like a devil's song, causing her heart to surge and her body to feel warm, as if a fire was burning in her lower abdomen, making her breath hot.

An unfamiliar sensation spread throughout her body, leaving her weak and soft.

In a panic, Yu Aoqing quickly covered her ears with both hands, squatting down and shaking her head vigorously.

In Yunxia, she had always been high and mighty; any male peer who saw her was either polite or showcased their strong abilities or extensive knowledge. She had hardly ever heard of matters between men and women, let alone witnessed someone behaving so lewdly in front of her!

Those strange sounds and exaggerated actions were like hammers striking her head, leaving her dizzy and unable to think.

Time passed slowly, each breath feeling like a torment.

She didn't know how long it had been when she heard Luo Qianqian let out a high-pitched, sharp scream, like a tragic cry of someone on the verge of death, even her breathing seemed to stop.

This terrified her. Did Luo Qianqian… die too?

But immediately after, Luo Qianqian miraculously came back to life, starting to make sounds again.

At this moment, Yu Aoqing had lost all her previous arrogance and pride; she felt like a hedgehog stripped of its spines, only seeking a quiet place to rest.

Yang Kai could no longer endure.

He felt that if he didn't act soon, he would surely fall into temptation.

But before he could make a move, a swarm of large insects rushed in from outside, approaching Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian, raising their sharp claws high and stabbing down fiercely.

Real screams erupted. Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian were almost pierced together and dragged away by those large insects.

"Senior Sister Qing, save me!" Luo Qianqian shouted in panic.

Yu Aoqing was trembling in fear, having no ability to save her.

Blood was scattered along the way. Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian were dragged further away.

Soon, the shrill screams gradually weakened, eventually disappearing.

Just as Miao Lin had said earlier, being able to enjoy themselves before dying was indeed a way to die without regrets.

After the sounds of the two had faded for a long time, Yu Aoqing quietly released her ears, turning to look back, and finding they were gone, she couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

The scene just now had left her feeling utterly humiliated. So even though she knew her junior brother and sister were doomed, she felt no sorrow, only relief.

Just as she was patting her chest and letting out a sigh of relief, she suddenly noticed that the boy was looking at her with a greedy gaze, and then he leaped up like a hunting leopard, pouncing toward her fiercely.

Heavy breathing, scorching breath. It was just like Miao Lin before, no, even more frenzied than Miao Lin.

"You seek death!" Yu Aoqing shouted angrily, raising her palm to strike at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai also struck out with a palm, Flame Yang Explosion!

The fierce three bursts of True Yang Primordial Qi surged into Yu Aoqing's delicate arm. Poor her, a dignified practitioner at the Sixth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, who had just fought against a swarm of insects not long ago, had hardly recovered any Primordial Qi and was mentally unstable. She could barely unleash thirty percent of her strength, how could she withstand Yang Kai's bizarre technique?

When the first burst of Primordial Qi exploded, she managed to deflect it easily, but before she could catch her breath, the second burst erupted violently. In a panic, Yu Aoqing activated her Primordial Qi to defend, and she barely escaped unscathed. But when the third burst exploded, Yu Aoqing's face instantly paled.

A scream escaped her lips as she flew out like a kite with a broken string, her jade arm was also shattered, and excruciating pain shot through her, nearly bringing her to tears.

Before she could get up, Yang Kai had already pounced on her, striking out again, dislocating her other arm.

Yu Aoqing endured the pain, curling one knee, viciously aiming for Yang Kai's lower body. Yang Kai nimbly flipped over, narrowly avoiding it. With a swift motion of his hand, he swept past her, causing Yu Aoqing to let out a muffled groan as her thigh fell weakly.

With three of her limbs rendered useless, Yu Aoqing couldn't even stand up, let alone attack.

She watched helplessly as the boy, with bloodshot eyes, leaned down like a lustful bull, shamelessly kissing her neck and cheeks.

His hands were squeezing her chest, showing no tenderness, only violence and wantonness.

"No… no…" Yu Aoqing struggled and cried, listening to the sound of her clothes being torn, but she had no way to resist.

The jade body that countless male disciples of Yunxia had dreamed of but could not approach was gradually displayed in this cave, pure and delicate, skin as white as snow, soft to the touch, with a proud figure.

The boy continued to kiss down, no, it was biting! Yu Aoqing could clearly feel the rows of bite marks being left on her body.

A sense of humiliation surged in her heart, and Yu Aoqing felt as if her heart had turned to ashes. At that moment, this boy seemed to have transformed into a different person, like a devil filled with malice, bloodthirsty and cruel, making her heart race with fear.
