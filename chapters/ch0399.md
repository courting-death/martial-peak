## Chapter 399 — So Poor?

Feeling… one is so exhausted, there were already signs of being unable to get up in the morning. Today, I also have to go to my mother-in-law's home to celebrate.

By the way, I wish everyone a happy Lantern Festival.

***************************

Among the four who were killed, aside from one in the Divine Roaming Realm First Stage, the other three were all at the True Essence Realm Eighth Stage and Ninth Stage.

Such cultivation might not stand out in the entire Zhongdu, but for the Zhu Jie Gang, they were hard-to-come-by talents. The people here came from humble beginnings, and lacking good cultivation methods and martial skills, it was already not easy to raise their abilities to this level.

Yet, in the blink of an eye, these four had met their demise!

Fourth Master Yang's disciple’s ruthlessness and cold decisiveness were now evident.

The others in the hall changed their expressions drastically, staring at Yang Kai in fear, their hearts swelling with dread. It seemed that only at this moment did they truly witness the overwhelming strength of a direct descendant of the Eight Great Families.

Among those present, the strongest was none other than Pang Chi, a mere Divine Roaming Realm Second Stage. He believed he was unable to kill those four in such a short time, yet Yang Kai did it.

Didn’t this mean that in a real fight, even he wouldn’t stand a chance against him?

What a terrifying young man! A True Essence Realm Seventh Stage individual actually possessing such powerful combat ability.

“Who else wishes to submit to the Huo family? I don’t mind sending him on his way!” Yang Kai scanned the surroundings coldly, his gaze met with expressions of calm and no hint of guilt from everyone.

“Young Master… please show mercy!” Pang Chi pleaded, his voice trembling. The four who intended to submit to the Huo family had all been killed, while the remaining people had vehemently opposed this matter during the prior discussion. Pang Chi feared that if Yang Kai's rage flared up and he killed the wrong person, it would be difficult to manage.

However, how could this young master, who had just been outside the hall, so accurately locate the positions of those four? This method was truly unfathomable.

Yang Kai lightly nodded, showing no intention to kill further. He withdrew two secret treasures and slowly sat down, causing the remaining people to breathe a sigh of relief.

Pang Chi wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and shouted outside.

Not long after, someone hurriedly rushed in, respectfully asking, “What instructions does the gang leader have?”

“Drag these ungrateful scoundrels out and bury them,” Pang Chi pointed at the four corpses.

The guard was taken aback, and upon seeing the blood all over the floor, his complexion suddenly turned pale. He quickly responded and rushed outside to call for some help, trembling as he dragged the bodies away.

The bloody stench still filled the hall. Everyone dared not even breathe, all waiting for Yang Kai to speak.

“From today onwards, the Zhu Jie Gang will be under my management!” Yang Kai scanned the room calmly. “Does anyone have objections?”

“No one dares! The Zhu Jie Gang was nurtured under Fourth Master Yang’s support. Since you are the disciple of Fourth Master Yang, we are willing to follow your orders!” Pang Chi hurriedly replied.

“Hmm, tell me about the Huo family's situation.”

Earlier, when he was outside the hall, Yang Kai had only heard bits and pieces and did not know the whole story.

Pang Chi pondered for a moment before recounting the details of the disagreement that occurred.

The Huo family was also one of the Eight Great Families in Zhongdu, naturally supporting some hidden factions.

This time, it wasn't the main Huo family that wanted the Zhu Jie Gang to submit, but another force that this family supported, which was somewhat akin to the Zhu Jie Gang. They had promised numerous benefits and had probably bribed a few core members of the Zhu Jie Gang, which explained the heated argument in the main hall.

Those led by Pang Chi didn’t wish to betray Yang Yingfeng, but the other four had different thoughts. People naturally aspire to rise, and water flows downwards. Although the Zhu Jie Gang had been supported by Fourth Master Yang, over the years, they had never even met Yang Yingfeng, so their loyalty was understandably lacking. With some external influence, it was inevitable that they would be tempted.

Moreover, even if they betrayed Yang Yingfeng, given Fourth Master Yang’s somewhat dull and reciprocating nature, he likely wouldn’t pursue them too harshly. However, refusing the Huo family's olive branch might bring trouble.

Considering all this, it was inevitable that those four would want to lean toward the Huo family for better prospects.

But now, the four had been killed, and naturally, no one would continue arguing.

After listening to Pang Chi’s recount, Yang Kai nodded secretly, knowing he was not deceived.

After telling his story, Pang Chi quietly stood beside Yang Kai, head bowed and no longer speaking, while the others eagerly looked at Yang Kai, seemingly waiting for some direction.

After a long silence, Yang Kai finally spoke, “Before I came here, my father wanted me to win people over with virtue, to make you submit willingly. But I don’t have that time or inclination.”

“I am about to participate in the contention for the family leadership. Following me means you will also join in this battle for leadership. This is an opportunity, but it also entails danger. You all are not children, you ought to understand this.” 

Everyone nodded in unison. None of those present were over the age of thirty. In front of them, Yang Kai was still a child, yet now he said this, leaving them all a bit depressed.

“You can choose for yourselves. Those who do not wish to partake in this contention for the family leadership may leave now; I won’t hold it against you. But this opportunity only comes once. If you do not leave now, there won’t be another chance.” 

He then quietly waited.

Everyone exchanged glances. Yang Kai’s frankness was truly unexpected, coupled with the ruthlessness displayed earlier; they all realized that this Young Master of the Yang family was decisively straightforward, preferring to act swiftly without hesitation.

After a long while, no one dared to rise and leave.

Pang Chi smiled slightly and stated, “We may not have even met Fourth Master Yang, but for so many years, we have taken refuge under Fourth Master Yang’s shadow, and only then could we remain safe until now. Since Young Master needs us, we naturally cannot shirk our responsibility.”

His words seemed indifferent, revealing that they didn’t truly acknowledge Yang Kai from their hearts.

Yang Kai was well aware of this point. Nevertheless, he truly didn’t have the time or mindset to cultivate the Zhu Jie Gang like he did with the two Blood Servants.

Unconcernedly nodding, he grinned, “I can tell you clearly that following me does not guarantee good fortune, but not following me will definitely bring you bad fortune!”

His smile bore a sinister undertone that sent shivers down their spines.

Everyone immediately rose, speaking in unison, “We are willing to serve the Young Master!”

Since Yang Kai had expressed himself so frankly, if they did not show their intent, they would indeed look foolish.

“Please sit.” Yang Kai nodded with a smile. “Pang Chi, you sit too!” 

“Yes!” Pang Chi wiped the cold sweat from his brow, thinking that this Young Master truly was nothing like Fourth Master Yang; they were completely opposite kinds of people.

“How many people are currently in the Zhu Jie Gang?” Yang Kai asked casually.

“There are about six hundred people,” Pang Chi replied.

“Six hundred…” Yang Kai frowned a bit. This number was indeed on the low side but not overly concerning. “What’s the strength like?”

Pang Chi forced a smile, feeling embarrassed. “Most are at the Separation and Union Realm. About thirty percent are at the True Essence Realm. Their qualities fluctuate, while regarding the Divine Roaming Realm, there are only three left. However, one of them…” 

Of the three Divine Roaming Realm individuals, one was already killed, leaving only two—one at First Stage and one at Second Stage. Such strength was indeed miserably inadequate.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai did not show any disappointment; he wanted the Zhu Jie Gang, not because he needed them for battle.

“Are all six hundred currently in Zhongdu?” 

“Yes, if the Young Master requires it, a single command will summon them all,” Pang Chi nodded.

“Send out two hundred people. I need to scout for a group of individuals.” 

“Please give your orders!” 

Yang Kai mentioned the number of people and the notable characteristics of Su Yan and her group. Pang Chi quickly took careful note.

“Additionally, find me fifty clever messengers, ready at all times!” 

“Understood!” Although Pang Chi didn’t know why Yang Kai needed so many messengers, since it was an order, he would carry it out.

“By the way, what business does the Zhu Jie Gang primarily engage in?” Yang Kai inquired.

Pang Chi gave an awkward smile, “We mainly operate inns, tea houses, and restaurants. The gang’s disciples also often take on small jobs in the city; it’s all just minor businesses.” 

“What’s your surplus?” 

Pang Chi's embarrassment deepened as he stammered for a long time before saying, “Up to now, we only have a savings of five hundred thousand taels.” 

“So poor?” Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment.

Everyone couldn’t help but flush red. Pang Chi sighed helplessly, “Making a living in Zhongdu city is indeed not easy.”

The Eight Great Families were too dominant. Those hidden forces had good hosts to support them and frequently received rewards from their families, while the Zhu Jie Gang was different. This was supported by Yang Yingfeng, and Fourth Master Yang held a relatively low position in the Yang family. Over the years, in pursuit of treatment for his own hidden ailment, he had spent significant resources on famous doctors and could not spare too many resources or riches to reward the Zhu Jie Gang.

It was no wonder those four individuals were inclined to support the Huo family.

After some thought, Yang Kai took out a stack of silver notes and handed them to Pang Chi. “Take this money to use for now.” 

As they stared at the large stack of silver notes, everyone’s breaths quickened slightly.

So many silver notes were worth at least several millions. This new master truly was generous.

Pang Chi momentarily stunned, unexpectedly accepted without hesitation, repeatedly expressing gratitude.

Yang Kai glanced at him and smiled gently.

“Make sure to handle the tasks I assigned you, and I will come again in the future." Saying this, Yang Kai stood up and walked toward the door.

A group of people quickly saw him off respectfully.

After Yang Kai left, all the martial artists in the hall exchanged looks.

“Gang leader, how much did that Young Master give?” someone couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity.

Pang Chi counted carefully, exclaiming, “A full three million!”

Three million, that was the amount Lü Liang had given to Yang Kai initially, and now it was all being transferred to the Zhu Jie Gang.

A chorus of astonished gasps erupted, with someone excitedly saying, “Fourth Master Yang’s son is far more generous than Fourth Master Yang!” 

“Indeed. Although this young man is ruthless and his style of action is straightforward, he appears quite impressive,” others chimed in.

Pang Chi maintained his composure, “Now that we’ve taken the money, we cannot have anyone speaking of betrayal. That Young Master is indeed a person who does not blink while killing!” 

Everyone shuddered, recalling the four martial artists who had perished earlier, nodding in unison.
