## Chapter 18 — Good Deeds Are Rewarded

Yang Kai threw a punch, and amid the howling fierce wind, it struck the left row of eyes on the Flower-Backed Spider, instantly shattering two of them.

The Flower-Backed Spider was horrified. Its scant intelligence sparked a deep fear toward this bleeding yet exhilarated man before it. It tried to retract the front leg that had pierced Yang Kai’s arm, but Yang Kai tightened his muscles, firmly pinning it in place, making escape impossible for the moment.

Yang Kai’s second punch came roaring down, smashing two more of the spider’s eyes.

The spider howled in pain, its body continuously retreating. Its few movable legs flailed wildly, leaving a series of shallow but bleeding wounds on Yang Kai’s body.

The pain only fueled Yang Kai’s excitement, as if boundless strength surged through him. A cruel smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. Using his intact fist, he launched a relentless barrage of attacks, each blow heavier and faster than the last. The spider’s forehead cracked open, its bodily fluids splattering everywhere.

Piercing shrieks echoed continuously. The spider, unwilling to die quietly, sprayed silk from its mouth. At such close range, Yang Kai had no way to dodge and was soon wrapped tightly.

Yet, the spider was already battered beyond recognition. Its entire head was nearly shattered. Were it not for its resilient beastly vitality, it would have perished long ago.

Despite this, after spraying its final thread of silk, the spider gradually ceased struggling and ultimately succumbed beneath Yang Kai’s fists.

Yang Kai had never imagined he could so easily defeat a beast, let alone kill one.

Though it was only a first-grade beast, such a foe was not something a Body Tempering – Fifth Stage cultivator could easily handle. Though Yang Kai was injured, the wounds did not seem serious.

Confirming the Flower-Backed Spider was truly dead, Yang Kai finally pulled out the front leg embedded in his arm. The moment it came free, a warm gush of blood followed.

There was no time to examine his injuries. Yang Kai swiftly tore apart the spider silk binding him, then hurriedly lifted the boy lying on the ground and carried him out.

The boy’s father had also broken free from the silk bindings and was rushing over. Seeing Yang Kai, bloodied and holding his son, he hurriedly asked, “What happened to him?”

“He’s lost a lot of blood and has been poisoned,” Yang Kai replied.

Outside the cave, Yang Kai laid the boy flat on the ground, then dashed back to retrieve his satchel. He found some herbs inside, chewed them thoroughly, and handed some to the hunter. “Chew hard, then feed it to him.”

The hunter, distraught and desperate, had no hesitation and immediately began chewing the herbs vigorously.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s mind was crystal clear, the medicinal properties of the herbs unfolding within him. Which herbs could detoxify, which could heal wounds, which could staunch bleeding—his knowledge rivaled that of a skilled physician.

After a while, Yang Kai spat out the chewed herbs and applied them to the boy’s wounded arm. The hunter fed the chewed herbs into the boy’s mouth.

Under their anxious and hopeful gazes, the boy’s pale face gradually regained some color, and his breathing steadied considerably.

The hunter finally relaxed, collapsing onto the ground in tears. The iron-willed man sobbed, “Thank heavens he’s alright, thank heavens…”

Yang Kai poured cold water on the moment: “It’s not enough. These herbs are only basic and can merely alleviate his symptoms. He must be taken down the mountain to see a doctor, or the poison may leave lasting damage.”

The hunter obediently nodded. “Then I’ll take him to find a doctor right now.”

“Not so fast,” Yang Kai stopped him. “Let him stabilize first.”

“Of course, benefactor,” the hunter replied. Having suffered such calamity, he had lost all resolve and accepted whatever Yang Kai said.

Then, suddenly remembering that his benefactor was also injured, he worriedly asked, “Do you need to treat your wounds?”

Yang Kai waved his hand. “No need.”

“But you’ve lost so much blood. How can you bear it?” the hunter stared at him in shock.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai stood up, hopping lightly. “For some reason, I feel fine.”

More than fine—he felt exhilarated. Yang Kai guessed this was related to his Proud Bone Golden Body, but how could he explain that to a mere hunter? Recalling the battle just now, his blood still boiled.

This was his first life-or-death fight, yet he felt no fear. Instead, he enjoyed the sight of blood splattering, as if it were an everyday occurrence.

“Wait here a moment. I’ll be right back,” Yang Kai suddenly said, grabbing his satchel and rushing back into the cave.

The hunter thought he was going to deal with the beast’s corpse, but that was not the case.

Though the Flower-Backed Spider was a beast, its corpse held no value; its grade was too low.

Yang Kai entered the cave to gather herbs.

During the fight, he had noticed a large patch of purple flowers inside the cave but had no time to examine them. Now, recalling this, his spirits soared.

If he was not mistaken, those purple flowers were exactly the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers he urgently needed!

The Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower grows in damp, dark places with many corpses—conditions perfectly met by this cave.

Filled with hope, Yang Kai returned to the cave entrance and nearly burst into laughter.

The world says good deeds are rewarded, and it seemed true! Had he not come to rescue this hunter and his son, how could he have stumbled upon such fortune?

Before him lay a vast patch of purple flowers, unmistakably Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers, numbering roughly thirty to forty plants. The purple blossoms formed a beautiful carpet, a truly delightful sight.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai took out his shovel and began gathering the flowers.

After some effort, Yang Kai was satisfied and ready to leave when he noticed a dark red object resembling a mushroom at the cave’s corner.

Curious, he approached for a closer look. The object was about the size of a bowl’s mouth, dark red in color, somewhat like a mushroom, yet also resembling a lingzhi mushroom. Yang Kai did not recognize it, and the small booklet given by Shopkeeper Meng contained no description of it.

Could it be a rare treasure of heaven and earth? Yang Kai rubbed his hands together eagerly. Whatever it was, he would take it back first—it wouldn’t take up much space anyway.

When Yang Kai emerged from the cave, his small satchel was already full.

“Let’s go. I’ll accompany you down the mountain,” Yang Kai said to the hunter waiting outside.

“Thank you, benefactor,” the hunter said with tears of gratitude. He knew well that Yang Kai was worried about their safety and wanted to accompany them.

“It’s nothing. No need to thank me,” Yang Kai replied lightly, then the two hurried down the mountain.

By dusk, they arrived at Wumei Town and quickly found a clinic.
