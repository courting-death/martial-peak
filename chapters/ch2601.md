## Chapter 2601 — A New Divine Spirit

The Phoenix Blood Fruit had no use other than healing, but it was incredibly effective. As long as a single breath remained, it could pull someone back from the brink of death. In this regard, it was as miraculous as the Immortal Source Liquid.

Even Fan Wu and the others couldn’t help but stare wide-eyed. Though they were exalted Divine Spirits, when had they ever seen such a peerless treasure as the Phoenix Blood Fruit? They were utterly shocked.

But soon, the expressions of the three Saint Venerables fell again, especially Luan Feng, whose beautiful face was full of regret and unease.

Judging from the current situation, even after awakening her bloodline, this descendant of Heaven’s Punisher still valued Yang Kai greatly. Otherwise, why would she summon a Phoenix Blood Fruit from the Blood Gate to heal him? This was truly a waste of a heavenly treasure.

Yet earlier, when Yang Kai was being humiliated and bullied by Shi Huo, the three of them had only watched coldly, not lifting a finger to help. As a result, Yang Kai ended up in such a miserable state. Who knew if this descendant of Heaven’s Punisher would settle accounts with them later?

Especially Luan Feng—Ruoxi had slapped her own face in front of her, begging her to help Yang Kai, but Luan Feng remained unmoved, not even thinking to stop Zhang Ruoxi. In the end, Zhang Ruoxi’s face was swollen from her own slaps, and the blood at the corner of her mouth still hadn’t dried.

Had she known things would turn out like this, she might as well have done Ruoxi a favor and saved Yang Kai. That would have earned her a debt of gratitude. But she had stood by, unwilling to offend Shi Huo.

That would have been a favor owed by the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher!

Now look—Shi Huo was dead, even his Origin Power stripped away. All her previous concerns had become a joke, and now she was left anxious and on edge.

For the first time in her life, Luan Feng truly understood what regret felt like. Her mouth was full of bitterness. If she had another chance, so what if she offended Shi Huo?

“Sir, please heal yourself first!” Ruoxi couldn’t help but urge when she saw Yang Kai holding the Phoenix Blood Fruit without moving.

She had followed Yang Kai for so many years, but never had she seen him in such a wretched state. Her heart ached for him, but beneath that pain surged a boundless fury! Though Shi Huo—the true culprit—had already been slain by her hand, the three who stood idly by were just as detestable.

Yang Kai nodded and put the Phoenix Blood Fruit into his mouth, swallowing it.

Though the fruit was rare, it was Ruoxi’s heartfelt gift, so he naturally wouldn’t refuse.

A sweet taste spread across his tongue, and then a warm current surged from his abdomen, spreading through his limbs and bones, quickly repairing his injuries.

Yang Kai was secretly amazed. Though he had long known the Phoenix Blood Fruit was a sacred healing fruit, only after taking it did he truly understand its heaven-defying properties.

Legend had it that as long as one still had a breath left, a single Phoenix Blood Fruit could restore them to full vigor. Now, it seemed the legend was true.

“Sir, what about those three?” Ruoxi quietly sent a message as she turned to look at Fan Wu and the other two, who stood motionless in the distance.

Seeing her gaze, Fan Wu and the others tensed up, swallowing nervously. Those cold eyes made them uneasy. They had no idea what this descendant of Heaven’s Punisher was planning.

“What do you want to do?” Yang Kai replied with a question.

“Kill them all!” Ruoxi’s eyes turned cold.

Yang Kai could only smile bitterly. He knew she was truly angry this time and had no intention of letting Fan Wu and the others off.

“But I’ll listen to you,” Ruoxi added. “If you want them dead, I’ll kill them.”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then asked, “The power you used to kill Shi Huo earlier—it wasn’t your own, was it?”

Ruoxi nodded slightly. “I borrowed the power left by my ancestor in the Blood Gate. My own strength isn’t enough to fight them.”

“Are there any drawbacks to using that power?” Yang Kai asked again. Power that didn’t belong to oneself would never be easy to control. After all, Ruoxi was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Suddenly gaining the strength to kill a Divine Spirit couldn’t come without a price.

Ruoxi was silent for a while before answering honestly, “It puts a strain on my body.”

“Then let it go,” Yang Kai said with a gentle smile.

“But, sir…” Ruoxi still seemed unwilling to let things go.

Yang Kai said, “Though they watched coldly before, it’s only human nature. Their crime isn’t worth death. In the end, they didn’t really do anything to me. Shi Huo’s death is enough. Besides, Luan Feng tried to stop you earlier—I owe her a favor.”

Ruoxi bit her red lips, then gave a barely perceptible nod, accepting Yang Kai’s decision.

“If you say not to kill, then I won’t. But we have to give them a warning, or they’ll think we’re easy to bully!” Ruoxi snorted, then slowly stood up in front of Yang Kai, casting a cold gaze at Fan Wu and the others.

Yang Kai could only shake his head with a wry smile. Ever since Ruoxi’s bloodline awakened, her personality had changed dramatically—she had become so assertive and forceful that he found it a little hard to get used to. Still, this was a good thing. In this world, gentleness and meekness alone were not enough to survive.

For the first time in their lives, Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou truly experienced the agony of torment. Watching Ruoxi and Yang Kai whispering and secretly communicating, each of them grew more anxious and uneasy.

Now, seeing Ruoxi stand up, the three felt their scalps tingle and instinctively wanted to get away from this place of trouble. But with Shi Huo’s death as a warning, none of them dared to make a rash move, fearing they’d bring disaster upon themselves.

“Do you have any orders, my lady?” Fan Wu braced himself and cupped his fists. Luan Feng and Cang Gou also looked over nervously, their expressions stiff.

Ruoxi snorted coldly and said indifferently, “You three had a hand in aiding the wicked and making things difficult for my master. Even killing you wouldn’t ease the hatred in my heart!”

At these words, Fan Wu and the others’ faces changed dramatically. They nearly couldn’t help but run away, but with so many concerns, they forced themselves to stay put.

“However…” Ruoxi’s tone shifted. “My master is merciful and doesn’t wish to kill needlessly. Since the main culprit has already been punished, he won’t pursue the matter further.”

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou were overjoyed, all three looking at Yang Kai as if he were their savior, their faces full of gratitude.

“You may be spared from death, but not from punishment. I’ll give you a small lesson—take it to heart. If you ever use your Divine Spirit power to do evil again, let Shi Huo’s fate be your warning!” As she finished, Ruoxi suddenly struck toward where the three stood.

The Blood Gate hummed, and two crimson beams shot out, striking Fan Wu and Cang Gou directly. The two Saint Venerables had no chance to resist and were sent flying, spitting blood in midair.

Luan Feng stood frozen, her beautiful eyes trembling.

It took her a while to realize she hadn’t been attacked. But she was clever and immediately understood why Fan Wu and Cang Gou had been struck while she was unharmed—it was because she had helped save the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher earlier.

For a moment, she was filled with relief.

Fan Wu and Cang Gou landed on the ground in a sorry state, but dared not utter a word of complaint. Instead, they both breathed a sigh of relief and cupped their fists together, saying, “Thank you, my lady, for your mercy.”

They knew that since Ruoxi had already acted, the matter was over and their lives were no longer in danger.

Ruoxi snorted, a faint, unnatural flush appearing on her pretty face. It must have been the strain from borrowing the Blood Gate’s power again.

Standing where she was, Ruoxi glanced into the distance, then suddenly raised her hand and called out, “Stone Uncle, Xiaoxiao, come over here!”

The Stone Uncle she spoke of was undoubtedly the Incarnation. After so many years together in the Xuan Realm Pearl, Ruoxi was very familiar with the Incarnation.

Hearing her, the Incarnation and Xiaoxiao immediately rushed over from ten li away.

In no time at all, the Incarnation and Xiaoxiao were standing before Ruoxi.

Ruoxi glanced at Fan Wu, who immediately understood and hurriedly lifted the restrictions from the Incarnation and Xiaoxiao, restoring their freedom.

“Stone Uncle, this is for you.” As she spoke, Ruoxi flicked Shi Huo’s Origin over to the Incarnation. The heart-like object spun and hovered in front of the Incarnation’s chest.

“For me?” The Incarnation’s eyes lit up. He had seen Ruoxi kill Shi Huo and naturally knew what this was.

This was Shi Huo’s Origin. If someone suitable could refine it and inherit its Origin Power, there would be another Shi Huo.

Ruoxi nodded, drawing the Heaven’s Punisher Sword once more and gently tapping the Incarnation with it. “The Stone Spirit Race and Shi Huo have a connection. Their bodies and inherited power are very similar, so the Stone Spirit Race can inherit Shi Huo’s power.”

The Heaven’s Punisher Sword touched the Incarnation, and its tip shone brightly, branding a strange pattern on his chest. From within the pattern came a mysterious suction force, drawing Shi Huo’s Origin into it, where it vanished in the blink of an eye.

The Incarnation grunted, and pitch-black flames suddenly erupted from his body, his expression twisting in pain.

Ruoxi discarded the Heaven’s Punisher Sword and quickly formed seals with both hands, sending a series of profound techniques into the Incarnation. With each seal, the black flames were suppressed, until, after the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the flames disappeared completely.

At the same time, the Incarnation suddenly calmed down, sitting cross-legged as if entering deep meditation.

“That Stone Spirit… is about to soar,” Fan Wu remarked from nearby.

Luan Feng gave a bitter smile. “I’ve long heard that Heaven’s Punisher could not only strip Divine Spirits of their Origin, but also create new Divine Spirits. Seeing it today, the reputation is well deserved.”

Cang Gou couldn’t help but sigh with envy. “If that Stone Spirit tried to inherit Shi Huo’s Origin on his own, he’d have only a ten percent chance of success. But with the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher helping, there’s no risk at all. In time, once he refines Shi Huo’s Origin, there will be one more Divine Spirit in this world.”
