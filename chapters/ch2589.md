## Chapter 2589 — A Battle That Shook the Heavens

The other seven Saint Envoys did the same. Seeing that there was no hope of breaking open the Blood Gate and that the Stone Spirit Race was actually about to retreat, they unleashed their full power without reservation. Their cultivation erupted to the limit in an instant, and the Stone Spirits fighting them suffered heavy losses, forced to retreat step by step.

However, the Stone Spirit Race was not only born with boundless strength, but their bodies were also extremely tough. Unless their bodies were shattered, they would not die, nor would they even be injured.

After forcing back his opponent with a single move, that burly Yao King shouted, "All Yao Kings, hear my command! The Stone Spirit Race has trespassed into the forbidden land of the Blood Gate with ill intent. By order of the Saint Venerable, capture them all!"

As he pointed, the thirty-odd Yao Kings who had been watching nearby sprang into action like wolves and tigers, instantly surrounding the Stone Spirit Race.

Yang Kai's heart sank as he realized the trouble was immense. The Eight Envoys plus the thirty-odd Yao Kings made nearly forty experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Such a powerful lineup could only be subdued if a Great Emperor personally intervened.

Buzz, buzz, buzz...

Waves of overwhelming auras erupted, making the whole world hum. Even the rubble on the ground began to float upward, as if some invisible force was lifting them.

"If you don't have the skills, why take on such a delicate task?" Hu Li sighed, shaking his head slowly. His gaze swept over the ten massive Stone Giants before finally settling on Yang Kai. He said, "Leave this human to me. The rest are yours to handle."

He only had the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm and truly did not have the courage to face the Stone Spirit Race head-on. But dealing with a human at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm was no pressure at all.

The burly Saint Envoy clearly knew what Hu Li was up to. He just shot Yang Kai a cold glance and reminded, "Hu Li, you'd better be careful. This man is skilled in the power of space."

Hu Li was surprised and muttered, "Power of space? Now that's interesting."

Even so, he still didn't take Yang Kai seriously. After all, the gap in cultivation was too great.

The burly Saint Envoy's face was gloomy as he looked coldly at the Elder and said, "Elder, this Lord respects your age and does not wish to fall out with your tribe. If you cooperate and surrender, perhaps the Saint Venerables will show mercy when they return. But if you stubbornly resist, then this Lord will have no choice but to offend you."

The Elder sighed, "I appreciate the Saint Envoy's kindness, but my Stone Spirit Race... will never submit to anyone!"

"Not even the Saint Venerables?" The burly Saint Envoy's eyes turned cold.

The Elder slowly shook his head.

The burly Saint Envoy nodded lightly and said indifferently, "If that's the case..." He raised his hand high, then swung it down fiercely, spitting out a single word: "Kill!"

Swish, swish, swish...

Over thirty Yao Kings moved, their bodies wrapped in surging Yao Qi, howling as they charged at the Stone Spirit Race. In an instant, led by the Elder, the Stone Spirits roared in unison. Each massive fist swung out, as if they could shatter the world, wrapped in unimaginable, violent power, meeting the Yao Kings head-on.

The Yao Kings dared not clash with them directly. They all used yao techniques, concealing their forms and relying on their numbers and agile movements to tangle with the Stone Spirits.

Boom, boom, boom...

Explosions rang out, beams of light burst forth, and in an instant, a battle that shook the heavens began.

"Take Shi Jiu and go! Save the bloodline of the Stone Spirits!" the Elder suddenly roared, his voice booming like thunder. He swung his staff in a wide arc, smashing it down at a Yao King who lunged at him. The Yao King, however, deftly dodged the blow.

Yang Kai knew the Elder was speaking to him, but at this moment, how could he just leave? If it were only himself, he could come and go as he pleased. But to take Xiaoxiao away, he would have to put him into the Xuan Realm Pearl first.

Yet Xiaoxiao was now in a berserk state, fighting alongside the other Stone Spirits. Without his cooperation, Yang Kai simply could not force him into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

"Human, let this King see your skills!" Suddenly, a figure flashed before Yang Kai's eyes. Hu Li, the Yao King, appeared in front of him, smiling slightly as he sent a light palm strike his way.

"Get lost!" Yang Kai also raised his palm to meet the attack.

"Not afraid, are you!" Hu Li chuckled, finding this human rather interesting. He actually dared to clash head-on with someone a whole Stage above him. Was he inexperienced in battle?

But soon, Hu Li's smile froze. The moment their palms collided, he felt a force no weaker than his own sweep away his attack. Not only that, but there was a mysterious spatial power in the blow, as if it could slice his hand apart.

Hu Li was shocked and quickly retreated, staring at Yang Kai in horror. The contempt and indifference in his eyes vanished, replaced by extreme seriousness.

"Condense!" Yang Kai shouted, and as the Laws of Space surged, the space around Hu Li instantly thickened and solidified. It was as if he had fallen into a quagmire—his movements became sluggish, and even his internal power was hard to circulate.

Yang Kai clapped his hands together, then pulled them apart. With a sizzling sound, a massive, pitch-black Moon Blade suddenly formed and was hurled straight at Hu Li.

Hu Li's face changed dramatically, cold sweat beading on his forehead. He felt his limbs go cold and his whole body freeze. He desperately tried to dodge, but under the strange binding of the Laws of Space, he simply couldn't avoid the attack.

In his panic, he could only open his mouth and spit out a snow-white orb about the size of a quail egg, exuding a strange fragrance.

Inner Core!

At the brink of life and death, Hu Li was decisive enough to spit out even his Inner Core, which he would never reveal lightly.

He blew a breath onto the spinning Inner Core, and a tangible shield instantly appeared in front of him.

Boom...

The massive Moon Blade struck the shield, as if slicing into a mass of tough cotton candy. Only after exhausting its power did it barely manage to break through the defense!

At the same time, the power of space binding Hu Li vanished. He dared not hesitate, quickly retrieving his Inner Core and leaping back dozens of zhang, putting distance between himself and Yang Kai before gasping for breath, his face full of lingering fear.

Just underestimating this human for a moment had nearly doomed him. If not for the power of his Inner Core, he would have been cut in two.

Who exactly is this human...?

"Hmm?" Over there, one of the Eight Envoys who had been watching the fight was surprised to see Hu Li retreat, astonished by Yang Kai's strength.

But he also knew that Hu Li, the Yao King, was not known for his combat strength, relying more on trickery, so he wasn't too shocked. With a cold snort, he stepped forward.

His afterimage remained in place, but he himself appeared in front of Yang Kai.

Looking down at Yang Kai from above, this Saint Envoy reached out to grab him, as if catching a chick, his expression relaxed as he said, "A mere First Stage Emperor dares to act so wildly in the Ancient Land. It seems your elders never told you how dangerous this place is. This is not a place where humans can run rampant."

Yang Kai's expression was grim as he quickly formed a series of hand seals. A mysterious aura spread out, and time seemed to stop flowing.

The Saint Envoy felt his thoughts suddenly freeze. In a blur, Yang Kai's palm was already striking him.

"The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream!"

A soft murmur sounded in the Saint Envoy's ear. Before everyone's eyes, he seemed to be immobilized, unable to defend as the seal struck him.

Only then did the Saint Envoy suddenly snap out of it.

His face changed dramatically as he felt a terrifying force surge through his arm. He cried out, retreating in haste, his Yao Yuan surging to resist the power invading his arm.

Looking down, the Saint Envoy's eyes widened in shock.

His arm seemed to have undergone the baptism of countless years, its vitality rapidly draining away, the once-robust limb visibly withering.

"What power is this?" the Saint Envoy exclaimed, frantically channeling his Yao Yuan to expel the force.

But how could Yang Kai give him the chance? Now that he had fallen out with the Ancient Land yao, he had to kill as many as he could to relieve the pressure on the Stone Spirit Race.

The Myriad Sword buzzed as it appeared, Emperor Yuan surging. A sword light over ten zhang long blazed brilliantly, slashing down at the Saint Envoy.

If this strike landed, the Saint Envoy would be seriously injured if not dead, and at the very least would be out of the fight for now.

In truth, this Saint Envoy's strength exceeded Yang Kai's expectations. Since mastering the Years Like a Shuttle Seal, it had always been unstoppable, but this Saint Envoy managed to break free from the Laws of Time at the critical moment, so the seal only injured his arm.

He truly was a powerhouse on par with the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. If he had been on guard, Yang Kai doubted the Years Like a Shuttle Seal would have landed at all.

The sword light was blinding, its intent soaring to the heavens. Yang Kai's killing intent was almost tangible.

"Human, how dare you!" the burly Saint Envoy roared. Without any visible movement, he suddenly appeared between Yang Kai and the wounded Saint Envoy, meeting the Myriad Sword head-on with a fierce punch.

First, this human Yang Kai had forced back Hu Li, the Yao King. Now, another Saint Envoy had been injured by him. If this Saint Envoy really died under Yang Kai's sword, the Ancient Land yao would lose all face.

Even if they killed Yang Kai afterward, they would still be harshly punished by the Saint Venerables.

How could the burly Saint Envoy just stand by and watch Yang Kai run rampant?
