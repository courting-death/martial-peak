## Chapter 1818 — Great Prospects

With the Ghost Ancestor's Ten Thousand Souls Banner lurking at his side, Zi Donglai dared not conceal anything; he immediately told everything he knew, down to the last detail.

Collect the nine Star Emperor Tokens and one could glimpse the secret of the Great Emperor.

Though it sounded mystical, it held tremendous allure for every martial artist who pursued the Martial Dao.

Yang Kai frowned and pondered; Yang Yan had indeed told him that gathering the nine Star Emperor Tokens would trigger certain hidden truths, but she had not explained what they were, and the mystery had long kept Yang Kai itching with curiosity.

If Yang Yan did not speak, she must have her reasons, and Yang Kai naturally would not pry.

Still, he already possessed six Star Emperor Tokens, so he was not far from assembling all nine.

This might well be the greatest secret within the Star Domain, and Yang Kai could not help but be tempted.

Even the Ghost Ancestor fell silent after hearing this, his expression grave.

"That's all I know. Sirs… could you at least let me go for now?" Zi Donglai watched their faces and asked anxiously.

"Let you go?" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Your physical body has long been destroyed; you are a soul-body now. The only thing keeping you from dissipating is this Secret Treasure, the Soul-Fixing Bowl. If I let you go, where could you possibly go?"

Zi Donglai was stunned by Yang Kai's words.

Just now, he had only been thinking about escaping from those two hateful figures and hadn’t realized that, in his current state, moving about on his own was utterly impossible. The Soul-Fixing Bowl was refined from Soul-Nurturing Wood and possessed the effect of nourishing the soul, but it couldn’t withstand any serious damage. If he really tried to travel through the Star Domain while controlling the Soul-Fixing Bowl, it wouldn’t even take half a day before he was completely shredded and swallowed by the domain storms, leaving not even dust behind.

At the thought of this, Zi Donglai's entire soul-body wilted; his eyes grew dim and he muttered, "It's over now. I'm truly finished this time!"

Yang Kai gave the Ghost Ancestor a look, and the Ghost Ancestor understood. He chuckled and said, "Very well, I'll find you a decent place."

Saying so, he began to wield his Ten Thousand Souls Banner. A pulling force suddenly emanated from the banner, attempting to draw Zi Donglai's soul into it.

"No!" Zi Donglai cried out in alarm, shouting, "Don't devour me!"

Remaining in the Soul-Fixing Bowl was no good fate, but it was far preferable to being devoured by the Ten Thousand Souls Banner; the yin-souls on that banner had lost all reason and existed only to slaughter. Zi Donglai would never willingly become such a thing.

"Don't devour me. Please don't devour me…" Zi Donglai struggled desperately, but he could not resist the banner's pull.

"Boy, stop resisting. What's the use?" the Ghost Ancestor snorted.

"No! I won't go in there!" Zi Donglai shouted. Suddenly, as if remembering something, he turned to Yang Kai and said, "Friend, if you spare me, I can give you the Star Emperor Token from Purple Star!"

"Wait!" Yang Kai raised a hand to signal the Ghost Ancestor.

The Ghost Ancestor touched his banner and it quieted at once.

Yang Kai focused on Zi Donglai and asked in a low voice, "What did you just say?"

Still shaken and wary of the Ghost Ancestor, Zi Donglai answered, "I said I can give you the Star Emperor Token from Purple Star. Purple Star has a Star Emperor Token!"

"Isn't this one from Purple Star?" Yang Kai lifted the token in his hand. "Your Purple Star has two?"

"No." Zi Donglai hurriedly shook his head. "That token does not belong to my Purple Star. It originally belonged to Xu Wei, but I found it in the Lost Realm and gave it to my father."

"Xu Wei actually had that thing?" Yang Kai was astonished.

"He said he obtained it during his early adventures…" Zi Donglai weakly explained.

"So your Purple Star truly has a Star Emperor Token?" Yang Kai's face lit with wild joy.

"I stake my life on it; it's true!" Zi Donglai swore quickly, fearing Yang Kai might lose patience and strike him down.

"You're already dead — what life do you have to stake?" the Ghost Ancestor mocked him.

Zi Donglai wailed, "I'm telling the truth! Please, you must believe me!"

"Mm, I believe you!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Sect Master, you don't seriously intend to collect all nine Star Emperor Tokens, do you? No one has managed that in tens of thousands of years. How many do you have now?" the Ghost Ancestor asked in puzzlement.

"If I said I had six, would you believe me?" Yang Kai said solemnly, and with a flick of his hand six Star Emperor Tokens lay neatly before the Ghost Ancestor.

"Hiss…" The Ghost Ancestor drew in a sharp breath, his heart shaken and his eyes nearly bulging.

"Six are in my possession; Purple Star has one. As far as I know, the Hengluo Commerce Guild has one as well. If we secure those two, there will be only one remaining unknown!" Yang Kai licked his slightly chapped lips.

"The last one… is with the Sword Alliance," Zi Donglai whispered.

Yang Kai abruptly turned to look at him.

Zi Donglai shrank his neck. "I'm not lying. Although only a few in the upper echelons of the three great forces know this, I heard it from my father — the information is reliable."

Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor exchanged a look and saw the excitement in each other's eyes.

Nine Star Emperor Tokens were scattered across the Star Domain; six were in hand, and the remaining three had now been located — assembling them suddenly seemed possible.

"You're not entirely useless, boy." Yang Kai glanced at Zi Donglai with a look of approval that encouraged him. Zi Donglai hurried on, "Don't throw me into that thing. I can take you to Purple Star and retrieve that Star Emperor Token."

"Take you to Purple Star so you can call people to come and take revenge?" Yang Kai sneered.

"How could that be? I can only remain in this Soul-Fixing Bowl and have no ability to summon anyone. I only want to live," Zi Donglai wailed.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Tell me then: where is your Purple Star's Star Emperor Token stored, and how can it be retrieved?"

Zi Donglai steadied himself and said, "It doesn't matter if I tell you, because the two of you alone cannot obtain it; you must have my guidance. The Purple Star's Star Emperor Token is kept in a hidden chamber, and the key to that chamber is in my father's Spatial Ring. Only I know how to open it…"

As he spoke, Zi Donglai suddenly seemed to realize something and panicked, "Don't force me. Even if I tell you how to open it, finding the chamber still requires me to lead the way."

"Relax. Cooperate and I promise not to harm you," Yang Kai said with a genial smile. "If this endeavor succeeds, releasing you might not be impossible."

"Don't lie to me." Zi Donglai drooped. "You killed my father — how could you let me go? I only beg that you don't let my soul be scattered."

Yang Kai was taken aback but chuckled. "You're finally getting clever. Since you've been frank, I can give you a guarantee: I may not set you free, but as long as you cooperate, I will not kill you."

"Do I have the right to refuse?" Zi Donglai gave a bitter laugh.

"I prefer to work with the clever," Yang Kai said approvingly. He rummaged through Zi Long's Spatial Ring, produced a golden key, and asked, "Is this the key to that chamber?"

"Yes. When you truly arrive at Purple Star's main world, call me out and I'll tell you how to get in. I'm exhausted and will rest for a while." As he spoke, Zi Donglai's figure dimmed and retreated into the Soul-Fixing Bowl.

Yang Kai put away the key and the Soul-Fixing Bowl and fell into thought.

"Sect Master, this matter truly holds great promise," the Ghost Ancestor suddenly said, now keenly interested. He had been indifferent before because gathering the Star Emperor Tokens seemed too difficult, but the prospect excited him. "If that boy helps with Purple Star's token, acquiring it wouldn't be hard. As for the Hengluo Commerce Guild's token, given your relationship with that little girl, it shouldn't be difficult to get her to hand it over — she's the Commerce Guild's future successor. The one from the Sword Alliance…"

"I've met Gu Jianxin once. Perhaps I can start with him," Yang Kai mused. "Star Emperor Tokens are valuable, but everything has a price; if I can pay it, the Sword Alliance may be willing to part with theirs."

"Shall we go to Purple Star now?" the Ghost Ancestor asked impatiently.

He was very curious to know what would happen after the nine Star Emperor Tokens were assembled.

"No rush. This can't be hurried. I will first return to my homeland, then go back to the Sect. Once everything is settled, we'll deal with this."

"Very well. I'll follow you; I've had no home and will stick by you," the Ghost Ancestor grinned broadly.

Within Zi Long's Spatial Ring, besides the Star Emperor Token and the golden key, were many heaven-and-earth treasures he had found in the Lost Realm, and a vast personal store.

The Spatial Ring of the Purple Star's lord was practically a Treasure Vault!

Especially the Skybreaking Shuttle: though it had some defects in its forging, it was a fine choice for travel.

Yang Kai spent a few days refining it slightly, then boarded it with the Ghost Ancestor, checked their bearings, and sped toward the Tongxuan Continent.

The reason Yang Kai returned to the Tongxuan Continent was simple: he intended to set up a Great Space Array there and link it to the Dark Star.

Once established, returning to his homeland in the future would be effortless; after a few long-distance Star Domain transfers, one could arrive.

Only he could accomplish such a thing.

The Chaos Abyss was not far from the Tongxuan Continent. Back when Yang Kai reached the Saint Realm he had flown for a year and a half to arrive at the Chaos Abyss. Now, piloting the Skybreaking Shuttle, his speed was astonishing, and in just two months he descended upon the Tongxuan Continent.

"Is this your homeland?" The Ghost Ancestor frowned after arriving. "The Spiritual Qi here is far too thin. How did you ever cultivate in such a place?"

He could not have imagined that Yang Kai's hometown, the place that produced such a prodigy, would be such a plain continent.

He had imagined a land of birds and flowers, abundant in Spiritual Qi.
