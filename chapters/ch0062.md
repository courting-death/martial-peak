## Chapter 62 — Xia Ningshang’s Decision

Beside Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai focused intently on his cultivation.

Not far away, several Three-Yang Fruit trees thrived vigorously. The largest tree already bore three fruits, nearly ripe, while the smallest was still a tender sapling just breaking through the soil.

Since returning from the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area that day, Yang Kai had been cultivating here tirelessly, day and night, forsaking sleep and food. The reckless strike from Long Zaitian had ignited a fierce determination within him—a burning desire to grow stronger. That humiliation would be avenged, with his own hands.

After nearly ten days of grueling practice, his Body Tempering Realm had reached the ninth stage and was faintly approaching its peak. The breakthrough was imminent, yet the key eluded him, leaving Yang Kai with a profound sense of helplessness.

He understood that breaking through a major realm required a stroke of fate; it was not as simple as advancing through minor stages. Even if his internal Yuan Qi was sufficient, the timing had to be right, and he needed to comprehend the essential truths.

In truth, his cultivation these days had been relatively smooth. Freed from the daily chore of sweeping, he gained extra time to refine himself. The Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs had long since been consumed. Without their strange fragrance weighing him down, the True Yang Technique operated noticeably faster than before, making it easier for Yang Kai to absorb the Yang Qi of Heaven and Earth.

However, all the Yang Liquid he condensed these days was used to catalyze the seeds of the Three-Yang Fruit; not a single drop was stored in his dantian.

The energies of Heaven and Earth gathered around him, ready to pour into his body once he grasped the mysteries of the Open Origin Realm, cleansing his marrow and bones. Yet, despite sitting cross-legged by the ravine, Yang Kai failed to succeed.

Day and night passed, and Yang Kai remained stuck. Though his mood was calm and unhurried, the shackles binding him refused to break. The situation was truly strange.

Late at night, under the vast starry sky, Yang Kai suddenly sank into a state of confusion beside Dragon Confinement Ravine. His Yuan Qi became somewhat chaotic, and a trace of pain appeared between his brows.

Not far off, Xia Ningshang quietly observed him and couldn’t help but murmur softly. Though some distance separated them, she could still sense an unusual fluctuation in his Qi—a cold, sinister aura intertwined with it.

How could this be? This was clearly the sign of a cultivation deviation. Yet he had only just broken through from Body Tempering Stage Nine to the Open Origin Realm. How could he possibly be courting death?

To be blunt, a warrior as weak as Yang Kai didn’t even have the qualifications to fall into deviation. Only those with deeper strength would encounter such calamities during cultivation.

But now, this very thing was about to happen to Yang Kai.

Xia Ningshang’s delicate brows furrowed, puzzled.

She had come here herself, after all. Having silently observed Yang Kai for over two years, it had become a habit. These past few days, his sudden disappearance had left her with a strange emptiness, as if nothing held interest anymore. After searching, she found him here beside Dragon Confinement Ravine, and a heavy weight lifted from her heart.

Upon arriving, Xia Ningshang knew Yang Kai was on the verge of breakthrough. She had waited a full day, yet he had failed to succeed. Now, with this strange occurrence, how could she not be concerned?

Just as Xia Ningshang grew anxious, a pure and intense heat suddenly surged from Yang Kai’s body. As this warmth erupted, the signs of deviation instantly burned away, and his Qi fluctuations immediately stabilized.

“True Yang Qi!” Xia Ningshang’s lips parted slightly, her beautiful eyes filled with astonishment, nearly exclaiming, “How can it be so pure!”

That fiery aura was unmistakably Yang attribute energy. Many disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion cultivated fire or Yang techniques, and their bodies contained such heat, but none compared to the purity of Yang Kai’s.

Though the heat was not overwhelming—after all, Yang Kai’s strength was still low—it was exceptionally clean, without the slightest impurity, like an untainted spring.

Before she could fully recover, Xia Ningshang noticed Yang Kai slipping back into the signs of deviation. A faintly evil aura replaced the fiery Qi, slowly spreading within him.

Moments later, another burst of True Yang Qi exploded forth, suppressing the evil and restoring Yang Kai’s stability.

This cycle repeated several times, leaving Xia Ningshang dumbfounded. She had never seen a warrior experience such bizarre phenomena while breaking through the Open Origin Realm.

Generally, breaking into the Open Origin Realm did involve some resistance from Heaven and Earth, but since it was a low realm, a little effort was usually enough. Yang Kai’s situation was clearly different; the obstacles he faced were greater than anyone else’s, rivaling the difficulty of breaking through a major realm.

Yang Kai himself was in agony. Just moments ago, he had glimpsed a hint of the breakthrough’s mystery and had one foot stepping into the Open Origin Realm. Yet at that moment, a sinister aura suddenly erupted from his bones, nearly causing him to lose his mind. Fortunately, his True Yang Yuan Qi burst forth, bringing him back to clarity.

Now, two energies warred within him: the True Yang Yuan Qi he cultivated, and the evil aura emerging from his bones. They battled endlessly, turning his body into a battlefield. When the evil aura gained the upper hand, his mind blurred, and a bloodthirsty excitement surged within him, craving to kill.

The sensation was like the rush of adrenaline after being wounded in battle, but with a difference. When injured in combat, though excited and bloodthirsty, his mind remained clear.

When the True Yang Yuan Qi prevailed, his mind was clear and his body felt comfortable.

The struggle dragged on without end, neither side gaining final victory.

Yang Kai was miserable beyond words.

Xia Ningshang dashed through Lingxiao Pavilion, clad in tight black attire that revealed her graceful figure—slender waist like a willow branch, long legs that stirred the imagination. Her hair was tied neatly at the back, and a black veil covered her face. She hurried swiftly toward Yang Kai.

She had watched him for a long time and was deeply worried. After much thought, she decided to intervene. Normally, one should not disturb a cultivator during breakthrough, but Xia Ningshang clearly sensed the raging battle intent within Yang Kai—a thirst for blood.

Only a battle could free him, could break the endless cycle.

So, after returning to her quarters to change clothes—lest Yang Kai recognize her, since they had met before—she hurried back to Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Yang Kai was still suffering, and his fluctuations seemed even more intense than before.

Without hesitation, Xia Ningshang leapt toward him, killing intent blazing in her eyes, and struck out with a palm.
