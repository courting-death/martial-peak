## Chapter 1586 — Void Mind Crystal

"However, though you bear the power of the Sacred Dragon Origin, you seem not to know how to employ it, squandering such a tremendous opportunity," Chi Yue sneered at Yang Kai. "That is why Xue Lian could so easily reclaim the Inner Core; if not for that, how would he still be alive?"

An embarrassed expression flickered across Yang Kai's face.

That so‑called Sacred Dragon Origin was something he had obtained back when he was at the Lingxiao Pavilion, when he and Su Yan had entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave together.

Many years later, Yang Kai learned it was a legacy left behind by the two founders of the Dragon‑Phoenix Palace on the Tongxuan Continent.

But over all these years Yang Kai had never put it to use; only when he practiced dual cultivation with Su Yan did the golden dragon pattern imprinted on his body become more active.

Chi Yue was not entirely wrong to say he had wasted such a heaven‑sent opportunity.

"Leaving that aside, in ancient times those Ancient Divine Spirits each possessed world‑shattering divine powers; each was a sovereign among the yao, and above them the dragon and phoenix stood supreme! It is unknown why, at some point, those Ancient Divine Spirits all disappeared. Some say a great war broke out among them and almost all the Divine Spirits perished; others say they concealed themselves. As for the truth, no one knows."

“After the disappearance of the Ancient Divine Spirits, other powerful yao took the dominant position. These yao were collectively known as the Ancient Aberrant Species, or, as some called them, the Primordial Aberrant Species. The Blood Jiao, the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, and the Nine Nether Qiongqi all belong to this category. Although the Primordial Aberrant Species appeared after the Divine Spirits, some among them were by no means inferior—some even surpassed the Divine Spirits. Moreover, some of these Primordial Aberrant Species still exist in the world today, though what remains are merely their bloodlines passed down through countless generations, not the original beings themselves from ancient times.”

"The bloodline Xue Lian bears and the origin power Qingluo possesses are both Primordial Aberrant Species, right?" Yang Kai asked humbly.

"Correct." Chi Yue nodded. "That is why I said Qingluo's future achievements will be brighter than mine! She possesses the complete origin power, not like me, who only inherited a faint bloodline. In a sense, she and I can be considered family; you should understand what position Qingluo holds in my heart."

"I understand," Yang Kai replied solemnly.

"And speaking of the Divine Spirits," Chi Yue said, pleased with Yang Kai's attitude, "among the Divine Spirits the dragon and phoenix are supreme. Among the dragon clan, the Golden Sacred Dragon is most revered! The power you inherited is the Golden Sacred Dragon's origin power!"

"Golden Sacred Dragon!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

"Simply put, the power you've inherited, even among the Divine Spirits, ranks among the most powerful. Now you should understand how greatly it attracts the yao lords, yes?"

Yang Kai nodded lightly, then smiled: "I'm rather impressed that you could resist such temptation, Senior."

"If not for Qingluo, do you think I'd waste words on you?" Chi Yue's pretty face turned cold, a trace of unwillingness showing. "If not for Qingluo, I would long since have pulled out your sinews and refined your soul."

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh.

"Still, I'm curious just how much of the Sacred Dragon Origin you inherited…" Chi Yue regarded Yang Kai with great interest, her Divine Sense sweeping over him carefully, a puzzled look forming on her face.

"I don't know either," Yang Kai shrugged.

"Huh, strange." Chi Yue suddenly seemed to discover something and grew even more curious. "It seems as if there are two streams of Divine Spirit power within you—one the earlier Sacred Dragon power, the other…"

"Do you mean this?" Yang Kai frowned, drew out the Dragon Bone sword Dripping Jade without hesitation, poured Saint Yuan into it, and with a roar of dragons an emerald great dragon immediately coiled above his head, looking down at Chi Yue from on high.

Chi Yue's phoenix-like eyes narrowed and she cried out, "Impossible — you actually have this!"

With her sight it was instantly recognizable: a secret treasure forged from a section of Dragon Bone, into which a Dragon Pearl seemed to be fused. And the faint dragon soul still had not been extinguished.

Chi Yue was overwhelmed with shock, her eyes reddening as envy and jealousy rose for the fortunes Yang Kai possessed.

How could a mere human possess opportunities that made every yao envious?

"Is this your trump card?" Chi Yue panted, feeling the dragon might wash over her and the faint Heavenly Moon Demon Spider bloodline within her stirring; after a long moment she calmed her excitement and, with a complex expression, said: "If this is your trump card, then let me advise you — don't think too highly of yourself. The might of this Secret Treasure may make you invincible below the Void King Realm, but the Void King Realm… cannot be withstood by the Origin Returning Realm."

Yang Kai smiled, saying nothing.

The child still has other cards! Chi Yue was truly shocked — what sort of freak was this?

Yang Kai looked at Chi Yue calmly.

He knew what Chi Yue had just detected was not the Dragon Bone sword at all, but should be the remnant soul of the Ice Phoenix.

However, the Ice Phoenix remnant did not belong to him; it only temporarily attached to him — it belonged to Su Yan.

Yang Kai would rather expose the Dragon Bone sword than let Chi Yue discover the existence of the Ice Phoenix.

If Chi Yue knew this, who could say what she would think.

"Enough, put it away. If you keep that up I fear I will be unable to restrain myself from acting against you," Chi Yue said sternly.

Yang Kai complied and sealed the Dragon Bone sword back into his body.

Chi Yue sat composed but still emotionally stirred, remaining silent for a long time. Yang Kai did not want to provoke her recklessly and simply stood waiting.

After a full cup of tea’s time, Chi Yue finally raised her head again and looked at Yang Kai. A strange smile appeared on her face as she asked leisurely, “Boy, do you wish to unearth the power of the Sacred Dragon Origin within you?”

At once Yang Kai's eyes brightened. "Senior, do you have a way?"

"Heh, did you think I have no method?" Chi Yue smiled slyly. "I watched your fight with Xue Lian from start to finish. Indeed, your physical constitution is extraordinary — even a notch above Xue Lian's. I don't know how you tempered it; it must have something to do with that five‑colored radiance. But if you can bring forth the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin's efficacy, your body will rise another level; you could even be compared to a true Golden Sacred Dragon!"

Yang Kai's eyes shone even brighter.

"That would be an undying, imperishable existence!" Chi Yue's words were laden with strong temptation.

Yang Kai's desire was immediately reined in; he watched Chi Yue warily and hesitated. "Speak plainly, Senior. Don't beat around the bush. I admit I'm very interested and could pay a price to obtain it, but please tell me clearly what you want me to do. If it's too troublesome, forget it."

"Good!" Chi Yue exclaimed. "Talking to someone clever is not tiring. Yes, I have something to ask of you. You may refuse or accept — everything is voluntary."

"Please speak, Senior!"

"Have you heard of the Blood Prison Trial on Cuiwei Star?"

"I've heard of it," Yang Kai said with an odd expression. He had indeed heard of the Blood Prison Trial; he had left Qian Tong and the others on Cuiwei Star waiting for the trial to begin.

Could what Chi Yue proposed be related to that?

Although the Blood Prison Trial was renowned throughout the Star Domain, attracting Third-Order Origin Returning Realm experts from all corners to participate, the experts on Di Chen were, after all, yao. They couldn’t possibly go openly to Cuiwei Star, could they?

"If they openly went, they'd gain nothing. Just as the yao on Di Chen dislike humans, humans do not welcome the yao."

"Since you know of it, it will be easier to explain." Chi Yue smiled. "I need you to go to Cuiwei Star, enter the Blood Prison, and fetch something back for me."

"Fetch what?"

"A Void Mind Crystal!" Chi Yue said in a low voice.

"What is that?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Something only a Third Stage Void King Realm expert can condense; you can think of it as the crystallization of that expert's essence and spirit. When a warrior of that level dies, a Void Mind Crystal may remain. I want you to retrieve the Void Mind Crystal left by a top expert who hailed from our Yao Star Di Chen; its true form is actually an Inner Core."

"An Inner Core?"

"Yes. The origin of the Blood Prison Trial you should know: it was the battlefield after a dozen to twenty Void King Realm experts clashed and were almost utterly annihilated. The battlefield is saturated with the Domain might of Void King Realm experts, which is why it drew so many Third Stage Origin Returning Realm warriors to the trial. Back then one of our yao lords took part in that fight but sadly perished in the Blood Prison. I want you to extract his Void Mind Crystal."

"You want me to retrieve it?" Yang Kai frowned. "By the way, Mi Tian and Xue Lian have come to the palace at this time — could it be they are going to participate in the Blood Prison Trial?"

He suddenly realized this point. Calculating the time, the Blood Prison Trial was not far off. Coincidentally, the son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord and the son of the Blood Jiao Lord had both come to the Red Moon palace, and now, at this very moment, Chi Yue had brought up the Blood Prison Trial again. No matter how he looked at it, Yang Kai felt there must be some connection between these events.

"Yes, they will go; that is why they gathered at my palace! Only from here is it safe to reach the Blood Prison. Also going are Qingluo, Yu Xiong, Ba He, and two yao newcomers you have not yet met — they should be arriving soon."

“Since so many people are going to take part, why send me to fetch it?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at Chi Yue and let out a cold chuckle. “Don’t tell me it’s dangerous?”

"Participating in the Blood Prison Trial is dangerous in itself; haven't you heard that many who enter the Blood Prison fall? As for taking that Void Mind Crystal… danger is certain. But you are so brazen — are you afraid of mere danger?"

"I only have one life, so of course I must cherish it; please, answer my earlier question," Yang Kai said stubbornly, looking at Chi Yue.
