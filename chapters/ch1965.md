## Chapter 1965 — Escape

If the Emperor Realm was among the elite of the Star Realm, then a titled Emperor was the elite among the elite.

The Heaven Devouring Emperor was unquestionably one of them.

Wu Mengchuan was actually a descendant of a titled Emperor? Such a thing truly took Yang Kai completely by surprise.

And judging from that Emperor's title, he had clearly cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art; one could even say the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was the legacy passed down from the Heaven Devouring Emperor.

Yang Kai was stunned!

A cultivation method cultivated by a titled Emperor — how could the word "precious" begin to describe it? It was an unparalleled rarity of the world! If word spread, even ordinary Emperor Realm practitioners would come fighting desperately to seize it.

Yang Kai suddenly felt uneasy; he had inadvertently learned such a colossal secret — would Wu Mengchuan turn on him, deny knowing him, and kill him to silence him?

Moreover... why had he so readily handed the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to him? That was undoubtedly his most precious possession.

Yang Kai did not believe Wu Mengchuan was truly that benevolent; from the old man's current conduct, he seemed cruel, ruthless and heartless — he could casually slaughter those old followers who had followed him for years; how could he be so magnanimous toward a martial artist he had only just met?

Thinking this, Yang Kai quietly grew alert and decided that at the slightest sign of trouble he would release the Yao Worm Matriarch.

As if sensing the change in Yang Kai's aura, Wu Mengchuan actually turned his head and let out a low chuckle toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's hair stood on end.

Fortunately, Wu Mengchuan paid him no mind and said in a low, rumbling voice, "Hmph. If one of you had not leaked word back then—letting those four thieves learn that I am a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Emperor and that I possess the Heaven Devouring Battle Art—would I have come to this? Years have passed. I have no interest in digging up who betrayed me; if you all die, everything will be clean."

As he spoke, Wu Mengchuan grew even more ferocious in unleashing the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

Standing not far behind him, Yang Kai, who was straining to withstand that devouring power, had cold sweat trickling down his forehead.

Damn... today he had just heard so many explosive secrets at once; he felt a bit overwhelmed.

From Wu Mengchuan's words one could infer that he had likely been betrayed by one of his subordinates back then, resulting in the four Great Protectors learning that he possessed the Heaven Devouring Battle Art; consequently they had risen up and imprisoned him here, hoping to extract the cultivation method of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

There had perhaps been plots and schemes — ambushes and treacheries.

But Wu Mengchuan had obviously refused to cooperate. Otherwise he would not have lived to this day; the four Great Protectors would have killed him to silence him long ago.

Who would not covet a method passed down from a titled Emperor? The four Great Protectors, upon receiving the news, had reason to strike at Wu Mengchuan; after all, their strength was around the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm — with four against one, and with an ambush, they would surely have succeeded.

As many distracting thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind, the screams from the surrounding cells gradually subsided, and the life of those fighters soon faded away.

Yang Kai turned and looked around; he found the dead men's bodies utterly desiccated, as if weathered away for a hundred years, each with bulging eyeballs — a ghastly sight, with no trace of blood in their bodies.

After devouring so many people's Qi and blood and life essences, Wu Mengchuan's senile image had changed; now he had a head of black hair, fair skin, and a robust, towering frame, looking no different from a man in his thirties or forties.

From the violent power fluctuations surging from his body, his cultivation had indeed been restored to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!

He turned his head and gave Yang Kai a low, leering chuckle: "Let's go. This old man will carve a blood path for you — hm. I smell the aura of an old acquaintance, how nostalgic!"

With that he strode straight forward.

Wherever he passed, the cells on both sides spat out bloodlight that he swallowed with his gaping mouth; the slightly weaker fighters locked inside were killed outright, the stronger could not last long before having their Qi and blood and life essence forcibly taken by Wu Mengchuan.

As they walked, the power fluctuations in Wu Mengchuan's body grew ever more terrifying.

The savage surges of Qi and blood even made Yang Kai blanch with fear; he worried the old man would be unable to withstand them and might self-destruct.

Several figures rapidly approached; they had obviously detected that something was wrong within the Bone Prison and wanted to investigate. Leading them was Yan Xiuran, and following him were the two Void King Realm warriors who had tortured Yang Kai many times before.

These people had only just entered the Bone Prison and had not had time to ascertain the situation before being struck from a distance by Wu Mengchuan, who smashed them into pulp.

From the shattered flesh shot out streaks of bloodlight, which Wu Mengchuan swallowed one by one with his open mouth.

"Brother Yang..." Liu Qianyun's voice came from the darkness.

A cold light flashed in Wu Mengchuan's eyes and he was about to move against Liu Qianyun when Yang Kai hastily shouted, "Senior, she is my friend!"

"Your friend?" Wu Mengchuan looked coldly at Liu Qianyun for a moment, seeming somewhat hesitant; after a long moment he nodded and said, "Fine — her strength isn't that high; she's of little use to this old man."

"Thank you, Senior, for sparing her!" Yang Kai exhaled heavily.

If Wu Mengchuan had truly moved against Liu Qianyun just now, Yang Kai absolutely could not have stood idly by — he would have been forced to come to blows with Wu Mengchuan.

Fortunately that did not happen.

"Brother Yang… this senior is—" Liu Qianyun began, voice trembling. She hardly knew she had just come back from the brink of death, yet even so she sensed Wu Mengchuan was not to be trifled with; his gaze sent a cold sweat across her body. It felt as if the Reaper himself had marked her — a choking aura of death washed over her, making it hard to draw a breath.

"This is Senior Wu," Yang Kai casually explained, then looked at Wu Mengchuan and asked, "Senior, could you help remove the restriction inside my friend's body?"

Although Yang Kai could now remove the restriction from Liu Qianyun himself, it would certainly take some effort; it was better to see if Wu Mengchuan would act.

Wu Mengchuan did not speak; he merely lifted his hand and the restriction inside Liu Qianyun's body was directly broken, her power returning.

"Boy, when you leave here later, take your friend and go — go as far as you can," Wu Mengchuan suddenly said faintly.

"Huh?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

He had been thinking about how he would later escape from Wu Mengchuan's grasp. After all, he now possessed the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, and it was precisely because of that cultivation method passed down from a titled Emperor that Wu Mengchuan had once been imprisoned and framed.

He believed Wu Mengchuan could not possibly allow him to leave with such a method.

Yet he had not expected the old man to say something like that.

There was definitely a catch! But Yang Kai could not yet see what it was.

"What? You don't want to leave?" Wu Mengchuan chuckled lowly.

"It's not that," Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. "If that's so, then thank you, Senior."

"Mm, just don't die; this old man looks forward to your growth, heh heh heh heh!" Wu Mengchuan cackled strangely and strode toward the front.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged a glance and closely followed.

Before long, the three had left the Bone Prison.

"Go." Wu Mengchuan stood with his hands clasped behind his back, narrowing his eyes as he fixed his gaze in one direction. From that way a streak of mystic light was rapidly approaching, and by its aura it was none other than Miao Qi—the very man Yang Kai had seen not long ago.

Yang Kai cupped his fist toward Wu Mengchuan: "Take care, Senior!"

After saying that, he tugged Liu Qianyun and tore through the void.

After Yang Kai left, Wu Mengchuan turned his head to look once at the direction in which he had vanished; in his eyes, flickering like ghost-fire, he chuckled, "The seed has been sown; when will it sprout? I'm really looking forward to it."

After watching for a while he suddenly turned his head again, his face icy as he stared toward the direction Miao Qi was coming from, his robe moving though there was no wind as he intoned, "Miao Qi, come and meet your death quickly!"

Inside the mysterious light, upon hearing this, Miao Qi's heart shook and he hurriedly halted, exclaiming in terror, "Wu Mengchuan? How could you have escaped?"

"Heh heh heh heh, my life was not meant to end; I had noble help. I said back then that one day I would cut you thieves into pieces — today I come to fulfill that promise."

After that momentary panic, Miao Qi gradually calmed and looked coldly at Wu Mengchuan: "Hmph, you've just broken free; do you think you can match this Lord? Don't forget, we are both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!"

"I don't do things I'm not confident about!" Wu Mengchuan's voice fell, and he suddenly spat out a small, bottle-shaped Secret Treasure; from that bottle sprayed ten thousand streaks of bloodlight, instantly covering the surroundings in blood-red — even the flowing air seemed to turn into blood, as if they stood within a boundless sea of blood.

"The Blood Spirit Bottle! That thing really is with you!" Miao Qi's terrified cry rang out from within the sea of blood.

Wu Mengchuan roared, "Indeed, this thing has been with me all along; if it had not failed to fully restore back then, I would not have suffered your treachery. Miao Qi, oh Miao Qi, you have underestimated me. After all, I am a descendant of a titled Emperor — how could I not possess an Imperial Treasure or two? In this sea of blood spirits, I am the master; how much strength can you possibly display? I will crush your bones one by one, slowly devour your Qi and blood and life essence; your soul will become my feast, and you will never have the chance to enter reincarnation!"

Wu Mengchuan's resentful, venomous words sounded like a curse in Miao Qi's ear, turning his face suddenly pale.

"Rest assured, after I kill you I'll go find Zhu Junshan, Bian Yuqing and Tong Cong — you will all die!"

From within the sea of blood came Miao Qi's panicked roar.

The Blood Spirit Bottle was an Imperial Treasure left behind by the Heaven Devouring Emperor; although with Wu Mengchuan's Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation he could not unleash its full power, with an Imperial Treasure aiding him Miao Qi was simply no match — defeat and death were only a matter of time.
