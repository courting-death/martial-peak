## Chapter 2509 — Perfecting the Small Xuan Realm

The moment he connected his mind and spirit with the entire Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai immediately understood that his previous thoughts had been correct.

The Small Xuan Realm was sending out an intense longing for that sliver of the sealed Great Might of Heaven and Earth yearning to use it to repair its damaged areas. This was the will of this small world.

It was just like a wounded person instinctively reacting upon seeing a healing Pill.

Yang Kai was secretly delighted, but outwardly remained calm, his eyes tightly shut as his hands continuously wove mysterious seals.

He had no idea what these seals actually were, nor did he even know what he was doing. He was simply following the will of the Small Xuan Realm, his body responding instinctively.

One mark after another shot out from his hands, striking the sealed Great Might of Heaven and Earth suspended in midair. Soon, the flowing light of that power was densely covered with countless marks.

At the same time, the streak of light that had been struggling so fiercely suddenly stopped resisting.

In that instant, Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes and shouted in a low voice, “Release!”

As soon as he spoke, the sealed Great Might of Heaven and Earth exploded, transforming into countless finer streams of light. Like fireworks bursting in the sky, they bloomed with dazzling beauty, splitting into innumerable rays that radiated to every corner of the Small Xuan Realm.

The streams of light scattered and merged into the Small Xuan Realm, each one vanishing without a trace.

The battered Small Xuan Realm seemed to be greatly nourished, the entire world humming with excitement.

The damaged areas stopped collapsing, Heaven and Earth separated once more, the sky cleared, and the chaos faded away.

As time passed, the ravines on the ground were smoothed over, the devastated landscape began to change, and the deathly stillness of the Small Xuan Realm was inexplicably replaced by a faint, invigorating vitality.

The vast amount of broken Origin Power he had devoured in the Origin Sea also underwent some mysterious transformation at this moment, rapidly merging into the Small Xuan Realm, turning into clear Heaven-and-Earth Laws that strengthened the very foundation of the realm.

The wind rose, clouds surged, thunder rumbled. Lightning flashed, rain fell, sprouts emerged.

The entire Small Xuan Realm seemed to be reborn, brimming with vibrant life everywhere—even the rare flowers and exotic herbs planted in the medicine garden began to sway gracefully.

No one knew how long the whole process lasted.

When everything finally settled, Yang Kai suddenly felt his mind and spirit disconnect from the Small Xuan Realm, waking from that wondrous state.

Looking around, the Small Xuan Realm was still the same Small Xuan Realm, but the desolate scene was gone. Compared to before, it was better than ever.

Yang Kai could clearly sense that the Heaven-and-Earth Laws within the Small Xuan Realm were more complete. Although it still couldn’t compare to a true great world, it was far better than before.

The Great Might of Heaven and Earth could actually allow the Small Xuan Realm to evolve? Yang Kai’s brows rose, a smile spreading across his face.

His Small Xuan Realm had never been perfect—Yang Kai knew this well—but he hadn’t known how to make it as complete as a great world. After this attempt, though, he seemed to have grasped some useful information.

Just a single strand of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth could bring such dramatic change to the Small Xuan Realm, and so much improvement to its Laws. If he could bring in more Great Might of Heaven and Earth wouldn’t the Small Xuan Realm become truly perfect?

At that point, this place would be a Sacred Land for cultivation. Even at the peak of one’s training, one could receive the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy here and break through to the next realm.

But the Great Might of Heaven and Earth is not something one can simply find. Without reaching the level of a Great Emperor, it’s impossible to comprehend. With Yang Kai’s current cultivation at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, he could only sigh in admiration.

Still, at least he now had a direction, and Yang Kai felt truly invigorated.

After thoroughly inspecting the Small Xuan Realm once more and confirming that there were no hidden dangers—only improvements—Yang Kai finally felt at ease.

He wondered how Liu Yan was doing outside.

With a thought, he exited the Small Xuan Realm and returned to the outside world.

“Eldest Brother Yang.”

He had just appeared when Mo Xiaoqi’s call reached his ears.

Yang Kai looked toward the voice and saw that Mo Xiaoqi and Zhang Ruoxi had both awakened. They looked quite well, with no lingering issues.

Smiling slightly, Yang Kai said, “You’re awake.”

Mo Xiaoqi said, “Eldest Brother Yang, why did you come to the Ziyue Desert? Has the Shattered Star Sea closed? What happened after that? Who sealed my Sacred Soul Seal? Did I hurt you?”

She fired off a barrage of questions, her face a bit tense and uneasy. It seemed she knew that her loss of consciousness was related to the Sacred Soul Seal being undone, but she had no memory of what happened afterward.

Yang Kai glanced in surprise at the Incarnation standing not far away and asked, “You didn’t explain it to her?”

The Incarnation shrugged. “They just woke up. I haven’t had the chance.”

Yang Kai nodded and briefly recounted what had happened after her rampage. Of course, he didn’t mention the battle between Duan Hongchen and Wu Kuang, as it was too shocking. As for the closure of the Shattered Star Sea, he simply said he didn’t know.

After listening, Mo Xiaoqi patted her chest in relief and let out a breath. “As long as I didn’t hurt you. If I had, I’d never have the face to see you again.”

Yang Kai said solemnly, “Don’t ever undo the seal so carelessly again. The power of a Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence is far too terrifying. With your current strength, you can’t control it.”

Mo Xiaoqi stuck out her tongue. “Got it.”

Only now did Zhang Ruoxi have a chance to speak. She glanced worriedly into the distance and asked, “Sir, what’s happened to Sister Liu Yan? Why does her aura feel so weak?”

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to investigate and found that the Phoenix Egg was just as it had been when he left, with no significant change. He said in a deep voice, “This is her opportunity. Don’t worry.”

As he spoke, he glanced meaningfully at Zhang Ruoxi.

To be honest, this trip to the Shattered Star Sea had left Yang Kai shocked by many things. Whether it was the Mountain and River Bell, the True Phoenix Fire, or the resurrection of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, or the Mortal Great Emperor who severed his own cultivation for tens of thousands of years—these were things ordinary people wouldn’t encounter in a million years.

But what puzzled him most was still Zhang Ruoxi.

Duan Hongchen had taken a drop of Zhang Ruoxi’s Essence-Blood to reseal Mo Xiaoqi’s Sacred Soul Seal, and his regard for Zhang Ruoxi had left Yang Kai deeply concerned.

The Mortal Great Emperor had asked Yang Kai to guide Zhang Ruoxi toward good, and even said that if she reached the peak of cultivation, the power she could unleash would be even more terrifying than Wu Kuang’s. If she turned to evil, it would spell disaster for the Star Realm.

If Yang Kai hadn’t known Duan Hongchen’s true identity, he might have thought he was exaggerating and trying to scare him. But after learning that Duan Hongchen was the Mortal Great Emperor, Yang Kai dared not think that way.

Someone who would risk his life for all living beings in the world had no reason to frighten him for no cause.

What kind of bloodline power did this little girl from the Zhang Family possess, to make Duan Hongchen treat her so seriously? And back in the Time Temple, the Divine Spirit Qiong Qi had even given Zhang Ruoxi a Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress.

How could an ordinary person receive such an honor? Encountering a fierce beast like Qiong Qi and not being eaten was already a stroke of luck—how could one possibly receive an Imperial Treasure from it?

And then there was that strange Ethereal Jade Disc, which only Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline could activate.

Thinking of the Ethereal Jade Disc, Yang Kai suddenly felt it was time to hand it over to Zhang Ruoxi. After all, it was a Zhang Family heirloom. Previously, Zhang Ruoxi’s strength hadn’t been enough to unlock its secrets, but now that she had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she should be able to make progress.

As for the secrets hidden within the Ethereal Jade Disc, Yang Kai wasn’t all that concerned. Still… perhaps it could unravel the mysteries of Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline. With that thought, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a bit tempted.

Curiosity killed the cat. The more Duan Hongchen tried to keep things hidden, the more Yang Kai wanted to uncover the truth about Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline.

“Sir… why are you looking at me like that?” Zhang Ruoxi noticed Yang Kai’s intense gaze fixed on her, as if he could see right through her, and she couldn’t help but lower her head, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

Yang Kai grinned. “Ruoxi has grown into a fine young lady.”

Compared to when he first met Zhang Ruoxi, she had indeed matured a lot. The best years of her girlhood had been spent at Yang Kai’s side—he had watched her grow up.

This inevitably made him think of Lin Yun’er. That little girl had gone to the Star Realm with Yang Yan back then, and when she left, she hadn’t even grown up yet. By now, she should be about the same age as Zhang Ruoxi.

Yang Yan had said at the time that Lin Yun’er was well-suited to inherit a friend’s legacy. He wondered how she was doing after all these years.

And as for Yang Yan, Yang Kai had been in the Star Realm for so long without hearing any news of her. It was strange—by rights, Yang Yan should also be an expert of her generation, so how could she be so obscure?

Zhang Ruoxi’s face turned even redder, a shy glow appearing in her eyes.

Mo Xiaoqi chimed in, “What about me? I’m not a little girl anymore, either.”

“Right, right.” Yang Kai nodded quickly, pulling his mind back from his memories.

“Eldest Brother Yang, where are you going next? Take me with you, okay?” Mo Xiaoqi looked at Yang Kai with shining eyes, full of excitement.

Yang Kai smiled. “Of course I can take you. But… aren’t you afraid Aunt Feng will come and drag you back again? Aunt Feng doesn’t seem to like you running around outside.”

Mo Xiaoqi wrinkled her nose. “Hmph, after she dragged me back last time, I was locked up on the island to cultivate. It was so boring I nearly died. Now that I’ve finally gotten out, I’m not going back so soon. Besides, we just came out of the Shattered Star Sea—Aunt Feng and the others definitely don’t know I’m here. I’ll go back when I’ve had enough fun.”

“You’re so willful—does the Beast Great Emperor know?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Mo Xiaoqi stuck out her tongue. “Eldest Brother Yang, you figured it out?”

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “You’re so young and already have such powerful cultivation, you must come from an extraordinary background. You’re skilled at taming Demonic Beasts, claim to be from the Eastern Territory, and keep mentioning ‘the island.’ If I still didn’t know you were from Spirit Beast Island, I’d be an idiot!”
