## Chapter 2585 — Luring the Tiger Away from the Mountain

"But... how could that bell possibly return for no reason?" Xie Wuwei still couldn't believe it. Suddenly, as if something occurred to him, he widened his eyes and said, "Don't tell me you..."

Yang Kai smiled and nodded. "That's right, the bell now belongs to me. I've already hidden it in that place."

Xie Wuwei looked up in shock, his eyes full of disbelief, as if he couldn't trust his own ears.

"Yao King, you won't refuse this small favor, will you?" Yang Kai's face darkened. "Don't forget, your soul imprint is still in my hands."

Xie Wuwei frowned. "You want this king to reveal the news to the Four Saint Venerables. What exactly are you planning?"

"That's my business. You don't need to ask." Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Xie Wuwei ignored his evasiveness and continued, "You want to lure the Four Saint Venerables away... Are you planning to enter the Blood Gate? Aren't you human?"

The Blood Gate was a forbidden place for the ancient creatures, only those born in the Ancient Land could have bloodlines drawn to it. What would Yang Kai, a human, want with the Blood Gate? Xie Wuwei couldn't figure it out.

"Why worry about so much?" Yang Kai impatiently pushed him, turned him around, and patted his back. "Go take care of it quickly."

Xie Wuwei didn't leave. He turned back, his eyes shining. "Young Master Yang, if you want to enter the Blood Gate, count me in."

"You want to enter the Blood Gate too?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, then quickly understood. He realized Xie Wuwei also wanted to obtain the Divine Spirit's power.

Xie Wuwei snorted. "If it weren't for those four sitting nearby, this king would have rushed over long ago. Why wait until now?"

Yang Kai chuckled and nodded. "Alright, let's see if you have the luck when the time comes."

Xie Wuwei immediately perked up, his figure flickered, and he disappeared from Yang Kai's sight.

……

At the ruined stone pavilion, the Four Saint Venerables stood side by side, gazing into the distance toward the Blood Gate, their expressions grave.

Just then, a Yao General hurriedly rushed over, raised his fists, and said, "Greetings, honored ones!"

Fan Wu glanced down coldly. "What is it?"

The Yao General replied, "Reporting, Xie Wuwei, the Yao King, has urgent business and requests an audience."

"Xie Wuwei?" Fan Wu frowned.

Fan Wu naturally knew Xie Wuwei, one of his eight Yao Kings, clever and powerful, counted among the very top. Why would he come at this time?

Fan Wu waved his hand. "Let him come."

"Yes!" The Yao General responded and quickly retreated.

Not long after, Xie Wuwei followed behind him and returned. Even as a Yao King, facing the Four Saint Venerables, Xie Wuwei felt immense pressure, especially since his secret dealings with Yang Kai were no small matter. If the Saint Venerables discovered it, he would die without a grave. He couldn't help but feel nervous. Taking a deep breath, Xie Wuwei raised his fists. "Greetings, honored ones."

Aside from Fan Wu glancing at him, the other three Saint Venerables ignored him. After all, Xie Wuwei was Fan Wu's subordinate, unrelated to them.

"What is it?" Fan Wu asked indifferently.

Xie Wuwei looked up, appearing as if he had something important to say but hesitated. This look piqued the curiosity of the other three Saint Venerables, who all turned to look.

Fan Wu said, "If you have something to say, speak freely. The Saint Venerables are not outsiders."

This was exactly what Xie Wuwei was waiting for. He was secretly pleased but kept a calm face. He raised his fists again. "Reporting, one of my Yao Generals recently discovered a bell in a valley three thousand li from here."

"A bell? What's so special about it?" Fan Wu asked, frowning.

Xie Wuwei replied, "According to the Yao General's description and my own deduction, the bell is likely the legendary Mountain and River Bell!"

"What?" Fan Wu was shocked, and the other three Saint Venerables' eyes instantly flashed, staring at him in disbelief.

In that instant, Xie Wuwei's body lowered, feeling as if mountains pressed down on him, making it hard to breathe.

"Can you confirm it's the Mountain and River Bell?" Luan Feng was the first to lose composure, asking sharply.

Xie Wuwei replied with difficulty, "Eighty percent sure. My subordinate said the bell radiated extremely dense Primordial Power and seemed to suppress heaven and earth. He only glanced from afar, didn't dare approach, and hurried back to report."

"Suppressing heaven and earth, Primordial Power..." Cang Gou's lips trembled with excitement. "It must be the Mountain and River Bell. Where exactly is it?"

Fan Wu noticed his excitement and said calmly, "That's strange. The Mountain and River Bell was stolen from the ancient land by Origin Cauldron long ago. It's been missing for tens of thousands of years. Rumor has it this Primordial Era treasure was lost in the Shattered Star Sea after Origin Cauldron's death. How could it suddenly reappear in the Ancient Land, and at this time?"

He was clearly suspicious. Although the Mountain and River Bell was valuable to him, he couldn't help but probe further.

Luan Feng's eyes flashed with a strange light. She nodded slightly. "The timing is indeed odd."

Shi Huo's eyes turned, suddenly realizing, "Are you suspecting someone wants to lure the tiger away from the mountain?"

Fan Wu snorted coldly, his face icy as he stared at Xie Wuwei. "Wuwei, I've always treated you well. Do you know what happens if you deceive me?"

Xie Wuwei stiffened, unable to lift his head under the immense pressure. He could only say in a deep voice, "You have shown me great kindness, honored one. I would never forget it. This matter is true, and I dare not hide anything. As for the bell... I heard that a few years ago, the Shattered Star Sea on the human side opened. Maybe someone brought the Mountain and River Bell out from there?"

This made Fan Wu thoughtful. He knew about the Shattered Star Sea, and Xie Wuwei's words had some basis.

"Whether it is or not, we'll know if we look. It's only a few thousand li away." Cang Gou urged impatiently.

"Of course we'll look, but who stays here to keep watch?" Fan Wu glanced at the others.

Luan Feng smiled. "I've never seen such a treasure. I'll go broaden my horizons."

Cang Gou said seriously, "I'll go too."

Shi Huo glanced at Fan Wu, then snorted indignantly. "Why are you looking at me? I'm going too. Since you're all leaving, there's no way I'm staying behind alone."

Fan Wu sighed, knowing he couldn't count on the other three. The Mountain and River Bell appeared for no reason at this time, and a few thousand li away. He couldn't help but suspect someone wanted to lure the tiger away from the mountain. But all four Saint Venerables wanted the bell, and feared others would get it. Leaving anyone behind wasn't suitable.

He sighed again. "Let's all go have a look. But the Mountain and River Bell is a Primordial Era treasure, not something just anyone can subdue. Everyone... let fate decide."

Though he felt uneasy, the Mountain and River Bell's allure was too great. Besides, thirty-two Yao Kings and eight Saint Envoys guarded this place. Nothing should happen in the short term.

Standing below, Xie Wuwei was anxious, but now he was overjoyed, knowing the plan could succeed. Once the four left, Yang Kai would have an easier time. He just didn't know what Yang Kai relied on to have confidence in breaking the Blood Gate's seal in front of so many powerful yao experts.

There were nearly forty Third Stage of the Emperor Realm experts united here. Even a Great Emperor would have to give way.

Before he could savor his joy, Fan Wu suddenly beckoned him. "Wuwei, lead the way!"

Xie Wuwei's face turned bitter. He didn't dare resist and obediently went ahead.

As light flashed, Xie Wuwei led the Four Saint Venerables away, vanishing from sight.

In the distant forest, Yang Kai, who had concealed his aura, watched the Saint Venerables leave and finally breathed out. With the Four Divine Spirits guarding here, he truly didn't dare act rashly.

Fortunately, the greatest threat was gone. The remaining Yao Kings and Saint Envoys were strong, but not to the point of despair.

He waited quietly for a while, confirmed the Four Saint Venerables were far away, then released his Divine Sense to communicate with his Incarnation.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, the Incarnation, sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes and said in a deep voice, "Everyone is ready."

The waiting Stone Spirits and Wood Spirits all became solemn. Even Xiaoxiao took out the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, resting it on his shoulder, looking imposing.

Everyone knew the coming battle would be life or death. Succeed or perish!

A murderous atmosphere suddenly spread, making the entire Small Xuan Realm feel much heavier.

On the towering mountain, barren and bare, only an oval blood-red portal stood in place.

The Blood Gate!

One of the two forbidden lands of the Wild Ancient Land, where ancient creatures could be reborn.

Figures moved around the Blood Gate, patrolling constantly. Each aura was powerful and thick, Yao Yuan surging, all looking hard to provoke. These were the eight Saint Envoys under the Four Great Saint Venerables.

They were the most trusted subordinates of the Four Great Saint Venerables, naturally arranged to patrol the innermost area, guarding against the Yao Kings' possible disobedience.

Yet the Blood Gate held an irresistible allure even for these eight Saint Envoys—a call of bloodline that no amount of loyalty could fully suppress. As they patrolled back and forth, their eyes would drift toward the Blood Gate again and again, their gazes burning with barely concealed desire.

But with others present, though tempted, they dared not trespass into the Blood Gate.

It was a painful torment, like starving with a delicious feast before you, but only able to look, not eat.

Fortunately, the eight Saint Envoys were strong enough to barely suppress their restless hearts.

"Hmm?" Just then, a patrolling Saint Envoy paused, looking toward the Blood Gate, his brows furrowing.

He vaguely felt an abnormal energy fluctuation coming from the Blood Gate, something never seen before.
