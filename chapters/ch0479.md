## Chapter 479 — Let’s Talk About Something Else

In the side hall, Yang Kai sat quietly clad entirely in black clothes and robes, waiting patiently. Behind him, Ying Jiu stood expressionless and watchful, his Divine Sense wandering, alert to all directions.

Seeing Yang Kai’s calm and unafraid demeanor, Ying Jiu secretly admired him.

As night fell, Yang Kai suddenly motioned for him to follow outside. Ying Jiu did not ask where they were going. But when the two sneaked to their destination, he was immediately shocked.

The place Yang Kai was heading for was none other than Yang Wei’s mansion! Ying Jiu immediately raised his vigilance.

Recalling the earlier quarrel between the young master and Qiu Yimeng, Ying Jiu suddenly understood why Qiu Yimeng strongly opposed Yang Kai in a way unbefitting of a lady from the Qiu Family, thinking the lone venture reckless.

Since entering the side hall, Ying Jiu had sensed several faint Divine Senses sweeping the area, though no one was seen, not even Yang Wei himself.

Ying Jiu knew these were experts from Yang Wei’s mansion observing covertly.

Not only Ying Jiu knew this—the young master surely did as well—but he remained composed and unflustered.

“Ninth Brother, you have quite the nerve, coming alone to my mansion. Aren’t you afraid I’ll detain you?” A cold voice suddenly echoed inside the side hall, shaking the eardrums. “Or do you think no one is home?”

Yang Kai only heard Yang Wei’s shouting, a constant buzzing in his ears. At the same time, a burst of Divine Sense power fiercely poured into his mind, yet with no killing intent, clearly just a test.

A few days ago, when Yang Kai fought Liu Qingyao, Yang Wei had watched from hundreds of zhang away, never truly grasping Yang Kai’s strength. Naturally, he was curious about Yang Kai’s capability.

Yang Kai was unmoved, allowing the Divine Sense to flood his mind, smiling lightly. “Afraid? If Eldest Brother would do that, I wouldn’t have come!”

“Ha!” Yang Wei laughed heartily, finally stepping out from the shadows to face Yang Kai.

Ying Jiu narrowed his eyes, noticing Yang Wei arrived alone without a single Blood Servant guarding him. Though many strong men guarded the side hall, Ying Jiu was confident that capturing Yang Wei would be a mere casual gesture.

These two brothers... Ying Jiu shook his head slightly. They truly trusted each other implicitly.

Yang Kai pulled back the hood covering his head, revealing his true face, and smiled calmly at Yang Wei. The latter clapped his hands lightly, and soon a maid brought tea.

After the maid left, Yang Kai said, “Eldest Brother, is this the first time we’ve spoken like this?”

“That’s right.” Yang Wei nodded. Since childhood, he gave off an aloof impression and was not close with any of his brothers. This was the first time Yang Kai and he had a private one-on-one conversation.

“Ninth Brother, what do you intend with your visit?” Yang Wei asked straight to the point, apparently suspecting something.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded and took a deep breath. “The clan is unhappy with our progress, otherwise they wouldn’t have invested a thousand treasures to speed things up. Since they want us to act faster, we must move faster. Otherwise, they will accelerate even more pressure on us. Eldest Brother should understand this.”

“I understand. I believe others do, too.” Yang Wei nodded.

“So, if we don’t act now, others will seize the initiative.” Yang Kai’s voice lowered. The clan’s attitude was clear—the thousand treasures investment was a clear message of urging, and everyone understood.

Once the factions refine those treasures, someone will inevitably be the first to make a move.

“Eldest Brother, who do you think will be the first target?”

Yang Wei regarded him seriously. “Is this even a question? If not you, then me.”

“I think so too.” Yang Kai smiled widely.

Among the six remaining Yang Family young heirs, Yang Zhao and Yang Kang were brothers, and Yang Shen and Yang Ying were another pair of brothers. Although they were rivals, in the succession war, when other enemies appeared, they would still watch each other’s backs.

A soft target is easiest to seize. If there was a major action, it would certainly be the two pairs of brothers working together, targeting either the isolated Yang Kai or Yang Wei.

Yang Wei, as Eldest Brother, still showed some restraint that first night of the succession war, so those four would not attack him first.

By this reckoning, within ten days, Yang Kai would definitely face attacks from all sides!

His momentum had grown too strong. Just a few days earlier, he had seized two Mystery-Grade treasures—how could those older brothers allow him any breathing room?

Each of those four brothers’ forces alone Yang Kai didn’t fear much, but if they combined, defending would exact a heavy toll, unless Meng Wuya and Di Mo intervened, which might reduce the losses.

Precisely because he realized this, Yang Kai had hurried to Yang Wei’s mansion that night to discuss strategy.

“Who do you want to strike?” Yang Wei asked with some excitement.

“Fifth Brother.” Yang Kai grinned.

Yang Wei was momentarily stunned, then suddenly realized and snorted coldly. “Fifth Brother chose Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian as his Blood Servants—it was not a wise choice!”

Among the six brothers, Yang Kang was by no means the weakest, but Yang Kai still chose him as the first target due to those two Blood Servants.

If there had been no accident before the succession war started, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian should have been by Yang Kai’s side.

Yang Kai’s targeting was clearly influenced by his feelings about Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

“What do you want Eldest Brother to do?” Yang Wei inquired sternly.

“Just hold Second Brother in check. I’m afraid if he hears the news, he’ll come to stir things up.” Yang Kai chuckled.

“No problem!” Yang Wei nodded seriously, then smiled slyly. “But if I do this, what do I get out of it?”

Yang Wei clearly wanted some tangible benefit. Even though he and Yang Kai were brothers, they were still rivals—he wouldn’t expend his forces to help for free, and his subordinates wouldn’t be willing either.

If Yang Kai wanted Yang Wei to restrain Yang Zhao, he had to offer sufficient stakes to show sincerity.

Even among brothers, accounts had to be clear.

“What does Eldest Brother want?” Yang Kai had already considered this before coming, so it wasn’t surprising.

Clearing his throat lightly, Yang Wei smiled. “I envy your alchemists. How about you send five of them over?”

Yang Kai chuckled in disbelief. “Your appetite is too big, Eldest Brother!”

“Not that big.” Yang Wei smiled. “Your mansion has thirty alchemists. I only want five.”

“That’s not my call,” Yang Kai shook his head. “You know their temperaments. Though they brew pills here, I can’t command them. How about I send you a batch of Mystery Pills instead?”

“Mystery Pills?” Yang Wei’s eyes brightened but he shook his head wryly. “You sure are generous, Ninth Brother! Fine, I agree!”

He knew it was unrealistic to get five Yao Wang Valley alchemists; this was just raising the price to get what he wanted.

His expression turned serious. “When do you want to act?”

“Tomorrow night.”

Yang Wei frowned, his face showing confusion.

He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to move so quickly.

Just one day. Normally, many martial artists would be refining those treasures they seized recently. Yang Kai’s timing clearly relied on the support granted by those treasures.

But... would the Mystery-Grade treasures he gained be ready in time?

His own was at least eight days from refinement completion, probably the same for others.

“I’ll await your news!” Yang Wei didn’t pry further. For treasures, if they could be used, everyone would; if not, no one could. All stood on equal footing.

As they spoke, he glanced toward Ying Jiu, eyes full of suspicion.

During the treasure battle at Po Jing Lake, six Blood Servants were afflicted by the Sealing Yuan Curse, Ying Jiu included. Yang Wei didn’t understand why he was now at his mansion with Yang Kai and seemed unaffected by the curse.

What did this mean? Had he broken the Sealing Yuan Curse?

“That settles it.” Yang Kai slowly stood, chuckling coldly. “Business done, let’s talk about something else.”

Yang Wei’s expression froze.

“Stop hiding things and be straightforward.” Yang Kai’s cold gaze swept the area as he spoke sharply.

At that moment, Ying Jiu’s figure suddenly blurred, dissolving into the air as if he had never been there.

Yang Wei’s face darkened dramatically as he focused to scan around, his expression turning ashen.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—

Suddenly figures appeared from all directions, swiftly surrounding Yang Kai. From the side hall’s main entrance, Meng Shanyi entered with an elegant demeanor, face composed.

“Shanyi!” Yang Wei’s face fell, his voice stern. “What do you intend?”

As he spoke, a violent surge of True Yuan erupted, his expression hostile.

Meng Shanyi glanced at Yang Wei, biting his lip, and cupped his fists. “Eldest Young Master, forgive me. I acted on my own, wanting to seize this chance to detain Ninth Young Master.”

He then turned to Yang Kai. “Ninth Young Master, don’t blame me for scheming. You brought this upon yourself. If I don’t seize this rare opportunity, I would be unworthy of your favor. Eldest Young Master is unaware of this; it’s all my idea alone. If you want revenge later, come find me.”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “Of course Eldest Brother doesn’t know. If he did, he wouldn’t have talked so much with me.”

Hearing this, Meng Shanyi nodded slightly. “I’m glad you understand.”

Yang Wei’s face showed no expression, his gaze gloomy. He took a deep breath. “Shanyi, you’ve made a mistake this time!”

Meng Shanyi smiled bitterly. “Eldest Young Master, since you hesitate out of brotherhood, let me do the dirty work for you!”

“I didn’t mean that.” Yang Wei slowly shook his head, disappointment clear. “Do you think Ninth Brother would come alone without some backing? Do you really think you can detain him with these people?”
