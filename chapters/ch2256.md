## Chapter 2256 — This Old Man Is Furious

“Shut up!” The round-faced girl who had been standing behind Luo Yuan suddenly frowned and shouted at Yang Kai, “You’re not allowed to speak ill of Senior Brother Luo!”

“Brother Yang...” Luo Yuan looked at Yang Kai and called out, “Come, fight me!”

Yang Kai slapped his own face, feeling there was really nothing left to say to this guy.

Just then, another change occurred.

Accompanied by a series of whooshing sounds, many experts suddenly appeared from all directions. As they arrived, their gazes fell on the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand; after a closer look, their eyes lit up with greed.

Clearly, the Imperial Treasure's Emperor Intent had drawn them here, and seeing it, they coveted it immensely.

Most of those who came were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, with not a single Emperor Realm expert among them. Even if these cultivators had glimpsed an Imperial Treasure before, it was only in passing—they had never truly possessed one.

Yet now, in little Fenglin City, an Imperial Treasure had appeared, and it was a sword-type Imperial Treasure focused on killing!

When their Divine Senses swept over and found that Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, their faces lit up with joy.

With so many people suddenly arriving, Luo Yuan frowned, his face showing displeasure. He surged his Origin Qi, and a visible wave of force spread out from where he stood, radiating in all directions.

“All of you, get lost!” he roared, furious that these busybodies had interrupted his duel with Yang Kai.

Thud, thud, thud...

Regardless of cultivation or age, everyone present was intimidated by the force and aura. Some retreated more than ten steps, others dozens of zhang, all with ashen faces.

Not to mention Luo Yuan’s recent rise to fame—most people recognized him. Even if they didn’t, seeing the power he displayed now, they knew he was no ordinary Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Who would dare provoke a tiger?

Yet two people stood their ground, unmoving.

These two were both old men—one sat with eyes closed, ignoring the pressure, while the other’s eyes gleamed as he sneered, as if mocking Luo Yuan’s overconfidence.

These two were none other than Gao Shan and Liu Shui, the two Protectors of Fei Sheng Palace.

Earlier, the two Protectors had been at the City Lord’s Mansion, guarding Young Palace Master Ning Yuanshu. But when the Imperial Treasure appeared and its aura spread, they sensed it, got permission from Ning Yuanshu, and hurried over—arriving just in time to see Luo Yuan’s outburst.

“Young man, don’t be so hot-tempered...” Protector Liu Shui smiled at Luo Yuan, putting on the airs of a senior. “Too much anger is bad for your health.”

“Hmph!” Protector Gao Shan opened his eyes and snorted coldly. “Young people these days don’t know their place. They think a little skill means they can ignore all the heroes of the world. Sooner or later, they’ll suffer a big loss and learn their lesson.”

“The two seniors speak so well!” Yang Kai looked at them, his eyes turning, and put on a respectful look, nodding like a pecking chick and cupping his fists from afar. “Your advice is invaluable. I completely agree. Anyone who can say such things is clearly extraordinary.”

“Well said, well said.” Liu Shui smiled at Yang Kai, finding the young man quite pleasing to the eye.

“A teachable child—he’ll achieve great things!” Gao Shan praised without reservation.

“May I ask the seniors’ esteemed names?” Yang Kai asked humbly.

“This old man is Gao Shan!”

“This old man is Liu Shui!”

The two introduced themselves in turn, then said together, “We are the left and right Protectors of Fei Sheng Palace!”

Their lines were well-rehearsed, spoken with practiced ease.

“Fei Sheng Palace...” Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly, exclaiming, “So you two are the famous Gao Shan and Liu Shui, renowned throughout the Southern Territory!”

Seeing Yang Kai’s reaction, Gao Shan and Liu Shui were even more pleased. Gao Shan smiled, “You’ve heard of us?”

“Heard of you? More than that!” Yang Kai said solemnly, spouting nonsense. “Your names thunder in my ears, deafening me!”

“Hahahaha!” Gao Shan and Liu Shui exchanged glances, laughing so hard they could barely close their mouths.

Everyone else broke out in a cold sweat, glaring at Yang Kai’s shameless flattery. It was utterly brazen!

At the same time, everyone secretly looked down on Gao Shan and Liu Shui, thinking these two old fools had really lived all these years for nothing. They were both Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts, yet just a few words of flattery from a youngster had them grinning ear to ear, almost forgetting their own names. Was this really the dignity of Fei Sheng Palace’s two great Protectors?

It was as if everyone was seeing Gao Shan and Liu Shui for the first time, glancing at them with all sorts of expressions.

“But...” Yang Kai’s face suddenly darkened, as if he wanted to say more but hesitated.

“But what?” Gao Shan frowned, looking at Yang Kai suspiciously.

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh. “But it seems someone here doesn’t respect you two. Before you arrived, I happened to hear some unflattering things said about you!”

“Hmm? Who dares disrespect us?” Gao Shan roared, sweeping his cold gaze around.

Those he looked at all averted their eyes. The two old fools might be silly, but their strength was real. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have taken over the City Lord’s Mansion, forcing others to stay with the various families. No one dared challenge them for it.

“Was it you?” Gao Shan suddenly glared at a shifty-eyed middle-aged man, questioning him harshly.

“No, no!” The man waved his hands, breaking out in a cold sweat. “I arrived after you two. How could I say such things?”

“Hmm.” Gao Shan believed him and looked at someone else. “Was it you?”

“Absolutely not! I’ve admired you two for years—how could I do such a thing?” the man replied seriously.

“Who was it? I’ll teach him a lesson!” Liu Shui was furious, glaring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hesitated, playing coy. “I dare not say... I’m too weak. If I speak, I might be silenced!”

“Speak! Don’t be afraid. With us here, who would dare? If anyone tries, I’ll wipe out his whole family!” Gao Shan boasted, acting as if he was invincible.

“With your promise, I’m relieved.” Yang Kai beamed, pointed, and shouted, “It’s him! That guy! Before you arrived, he said the strongest in Fenglin City—Gao Shan and Liu Shui—were nothing but ants and grasshoppers to him. He could crush you with a finger! He even said Fei Sheng Palace was a den of trash, full of filth, and that its disciples weren’t even born of parents, but from...”

“From what?” Gao Shan was furious, his clothes fluttering without wind.

“I’d better not say. It’s too unpleasant. But that’s what he meant!” Yang Kai laughed.

“Outrageous!” Gao Shan roared, “This old man is furious!”

“Very good!” Liu Shui glared at the man Yang Kai pointed at, sneering. “Young people really have big mouths. I want to see how you’ll crush us with a finger!”

Luo Yuan frowned, looking at Yang Kai. “You mean me?”

Yang Kai shouted, “Luo Yuan, if you’re a man, own up to your words! Are you going to deny what you said? Gao Shan and Liu Shui are right here—if you’ve got guts, repeat what you said and see if they can kill you!”

“I understand.” Luo Yuan nodded slightly, but didn’t explain.

Seeing he didn’t deny it, Gao Shan and Liu Shui were even more convinced Yang Kai was telling the truth.

Gao Shan shouted, “You think you’re invincible just because you’ve made a name for yourself? There’s always someone stronger out there. You’re not nearly as good as you think.”

“Why waste words? He insulted us—he deserves to die!” Liu Shui snorted, looking down on Luo Yuan. “Boy, will you come here and offer your neck, or do we have to come take your head? If it’s the former, you’ll suffer less. If it’s the latter, you might get hurt.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed, feeling his plan to redirect disaster was working.

Sure enough, with his pride, Luo Yuan couldn’t ignore such threats. Even if he hadn’t said those things, he wouldn’t back down now. His brows rose, a wild look appeared, and his Origin Qi trembled as he sneered, “You two old things want my life? Do you have the ability?”

“Still so arrogant at death’s door! Take this!” Gao Shan, furious, stretched out his hand and struck at Luo Yuan.

Instantly, the sky churned and the power of Law surged. A giant palm print descended from above, blotting out the sun and enveloping Luo Yuan.

The onlookers all changed color.

Gao Shan was, after all, a senior of Fei Sheng Palace, with solid Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation. His attack was extraordinary. Everyone wondered how they would defend or dodge if it were aimed at them.

The more they thought about it, the worse they felt, realizing that aside from dodging, there was little hope of withstanding such a blow...

Yet Luo Yuan stood his ground, not dodging or evading, as if he’d been scared stiff.

The round-faced girl behind him was the same, her beautiful eyes fixed on Luo Yuan’s heroic back, oblivious to the commotion.

Rumble...

The giant palm, formed from world energy and Law Power, slammed down. The void around Luo Yuan roared with violent energy, gales swept in all directions, and any Divine Sense probing inside was devoured by the massive force, making it impossible to see what was happening within.

Several of the Qin Family’s houses were instantly flattened by the impact, reduced to ruins.
