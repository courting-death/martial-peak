## Chapter 2481 — Incarnation Breaks Through

In the void, the sea of blood shattered, and blood rained down in all directions.

In the blink of an eye, the crimson blood light that filled the world vanished without a trace.

Wu Mengchuan stood to the side, face deathly pale and utterly hollow, as if his soul had fled.

The Blood Spirit Bottle was destroyed, and he suffered a tremendous backlash. Coupled with the Years Like a Shuttle mark from Yang Kai earlier, he was now barely clinging to life, blood gushing from his mouth, his body staggering as if he could barely stand.

Yang Kai wasn’t in much better shape.

This was the second time he had summoned the Mountain and River Bell. After the strike, his vision went black, his head spun, his ears rang, and his heart pounded like war drums, thumping loudly.

Gritting his teeth, veins bulging, he raised his hand. The Myriad Sword became a long rainbow and shot toward Wu Mengchuan.

With a soft squelch, the Myriad Sword pierced Wu Mengchuan's abdomen, pinning him to the ground. Blood instantly stained the earth red.

Wu Mengchuan struggled, but he had no strength to break free.

In the next moment, Yang Kai once again released his Incarnation, saying with difficulty, “I’ll leave him to you!”

Although the Incarnation hadn’t participated in the battle, it had seen everything clearly from within the Xuan Realm Pearl. As soon as it appeared, it immediately approached Wu Mengchuan and slapped down with a massive palm.

Boom...

The earth trembled as the spot where Wu Mengchuan stood was completely covered by the enormous palm.

The Incarnation’s eyes flashed brilliantly, like twin bolts of lightning piercing through time itself. With a low, excited shout, it declared, “Heaven Devouring Battle Art!”

As the divine art activated, pure energy overflowed from Wu Mengchuan’s aged body and was absorbed by the Incarnation.

Before long, the Incarnation let out a strange cry, filled with joy and excitement. Mysterious forces surged within its massive body.

Seeing this, Yang Kai knew the Incarnation was about to break through its bottleneck.

Wu Mengchuan was right—if the Incarnation could devour him, it could advance. It didn’t matter who cultivated the main or secondary version.

Wu Mengchuan had schemed endlessly, but in the end, someone else benefited. Had he known this would be the outcome, he probably wouldn’t have taught the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to Yang Kai back then.

But then again, who in this world could possess the Incarnation’s foundation, cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Art without suffering backlash, and defeat Wu Mengchuan at the Dao Origin Realm?

Just the Blood Spirit Bottle alone was enough to make ninety-nine percent of Dao Origin Realm cultivators retreat.

Anyone else who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art and encountered Wu Mengchuan would be nothing more than a meal.

As his mind relaxed, endless exhaustion swept over him. Yang Kai forced himself to stay conscious, sat down cross-legged, stuffed a handful of Spiritual Medicine into his mouth, and closed his eyes to recover.

Over on the Incarnation’s side, the excited and strange cries continued, thundering like a storm.

As the Incarnation devoured, Wu Mengchuan's aura waned, as if he might die at any moment.

Suddenly, the Incarnation let out a startled sound, as if it had discovered something. Its giant palm pressed down, and with a crisp crack, Wu Mengchuan burst like a watermelon, his body mangled beyond recognition—dead beyond doubt.

The Incarnation continued devouring.

After a while, the Incarnation withdrew its hand and stood still, a thoughtful look flashing in its lively eyes. It stood there quietly for a long time without moving.

Its eyes grew brighter and brighter. After a flash of enlightenment, the Incarnation sat down cross-legged and formed hand seals, remaining motionless.

There was no Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, nor any gathering of Spiritual Qi. The Incarnation seemed to fall into a kind of slumber.

Time passed slowly. Two full days later, Yang Kai finally opened his eyes. Though still weak, he could move freely.

He first retrieved the Mountain and River Bell and the Myriad Sword, then turned his attention to the Incarnation.

Although he had been meditating, he had also been paying attention to the Incarnation, so he knew exactly what had happened.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

He sensed the Incarnation’s aura was steadily weakening—not just its body, but even the fluctuations of its Divine Soul were fading, as if it had truly fallen asleep.

Yang Kai didn’t dare disturb him rashly.

After all, the Incarnation wasn’t a body of flesh and blood. Its advancement was very different from ordinary cultivators. Without the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, he had no idea if this was normal.

All Yang Kai could do was provide the Incarnation with some Source Crystals, ensuring it had enough Spiritual Qi.

With that in mind, he hurriedly took out a small mountain of Source Crystals from his Spatial Ring and piled them beside the Incarnation.

But as soon as he set them down, a mysterious force devoured them, and all the Spiritual Qi vanished, leaving only dust.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. He had taken out at least thirty million Source Crystals, and they were gone in an instant. The consumption was terrifying.

Fortunately, he wasn’t lacking in Source Crystals, so he quickly brought out more.

And so it went, over and over.

Billions of Source Crystals were thrown out—Lower-Level, Middle-Level, and Upper-Level alike—before the Incarnation’s devouring finally slowed.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai kept a close eye on the Incarnation. Whenever the Source Crystals ran out, he would bring out more.

In no time, more than half of the wealth Yang Kai had swindled recently was gone!

After a full month, the Incarnation finally stopped absorbing Spiritual Qi from the Source Crystals. No matter how many Yang Kai placed beside it, it devoured no more.

Yang Kai guessed it had reached some kind of limit.

Perhaps... success or failure would be decided in this moment.

At a certain point, as Yang Kai watched the Incarnation closely, he suddenly heard a cracking sound.

Startled, he didn’t know what had happened and quickly sent out his Divine Sense to investigate.

What he saw shocked him.

Cracks had appeared on the Incarnation’s body, as if a wall left unrepaired for years could no longer bear the strain.

This discovery left Yang Kai anxious. The Incarnation had devoured Wu Mengchuan and should have broken through its bottleneck, gaining greater power.

But the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was meant for humans. Who knew what would happen when a Stone Puppet cultivated it?

As Yang Kai’s anxiety grew, the cracking sound came again, this time unending.

Looking closely, he saw cracks spreading all over the Incarnation’s body.

Crash...

Soon after, large chunks of stone began to fall from the Incarnation.

Yang Kai’s eyelids twitched, his heart filled with worry.

After so many years of cultivation, the Incarnation’s body had become fixed. Every part of it was as tough as an Imperial Treasure—ordinary attacks couldn’t harm it at all.

But now, its outer layer kept cracking and falling away.

What had gone wrong? Yang Kai was anxious but helpless, not knowing what he could do to help.

The crashing continued. In just ten breaths, a ring of rubble had piled up around the Incarnation. Strangely, the fallen stones immediately crumbled, as if they had no hardness at all.

After a while, Yang Kai suddenly looked surprised, staring blankly at the Incarnation.

He discovered that after shedding a layer of stone, the Incarnation had shrunk considerably.

Although its previous massive form was impressive, it was too unwieldy. Now, after shrinking, the Incarnation would undoubtedly be more agile.

Was this a good sign?

Survival of the fittest—since the Incarnation could exist in this world, its existence was justified. Its growth and evolution would naturally follow the path of improvement, adapting toward greater strength.

Perhaps this was its own process of evolution.

Crack...

Another crisp sound rang out, and Yang Kai saw new cracks appear on the now smaller Incarnation.

With previous experience, Yang Kai wasn’t as nervous this time and simply watched quietly.

As expected, after enough cracks appeared, another layer peeled off, and the Incarnation shrank again.

This process continued for several days, and the Incarnation underwent six rounds of shrinking.

Only then did it finally settle.

Its aura and Divine Soul fluctuations surged again, reaching a level that even startled Yang Kai.

That was definitely the aura and Divine Soul fluctuations of the Emperor Realm.

Although there was no earth-shattering breakthrough, no Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, the Incarnation now undoubtedly possessed power on par with the Emperor Realm.

With the Heaven Devouring Battle Art and Demonic Warhammer, the Incarnation’s unique physique would allow it to unleash unimaginable strength.

Only then did the Incarnation suddenly open its eyes, which sparkled with vitality, clearly having gained much.

“How do you feel?” Although he had seen the result, Yang Kai couldn’t help but step forward and ask.

The Incarnation slowly stood up.

Although the Incarnation had undergone six rounds of transformation and shrunk considerably, it still stood as tall as three men. Its massive frame and extraordinary presence radiated an imposing aura. Its body, dark and lustrous like a boulder polished by countless years of ocean waves, exuded such power that even Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a sense of pressure.

“Not bad!” The Incarnation grinned, but with the Stone Puppet’s naturally angular face, the smile looked rather silly.

After a pause, it added, “I can feel I’m many times stronger than before, but... I need to get used to this body first!”

As it spoke, it clenched its fist.

With such a drastic change in size, the Incarnation wasn’t used to it yet and would need time to adjust.

Yang Kai nodded, “Then take some time to get used to it.”

As he spoke, he reached out, preparing to store the Incarnation in the Small Xuan Realm.
