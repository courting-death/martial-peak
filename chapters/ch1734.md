## Chapter 1734 — Taixu Sword Physique

"This companion of yours was a little tactless, so he died!" Yang Kai looked calmly at Zhang Fu, his eyes utterly devoid of emotion, making Zhang Fu break out in a cold sweat that poured down like rain.

He wanted to flee, but found that no matter how he tried he could not summon the courage.

He had a feeling that if he truly attempted to run, the next to be beheaded would be himself.

"I hope your answer will satisfy me!" Yang Kai read his expression and continued to apply pressure to Zhang Fu.

Zhang Fu's face went ashen, his gaze terrified and wary; he pressed his dry lips together and said, "If I tell you what you want to know, will you let me go?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai sneered.

Zhang Fu's body trembled; in a hoarse voice he said, "Since you won't spare me, why should I cooperate? Either way it's death."

"I'll give you a quick end, one in which you won't be aware of your death!" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

That smile was like a demon crawling out of hell; Zhang Fu found facing this youth even more terrifying than facing Lord Li.

"I need to think!" Zhang Fu swallowed and, as he spoke, his eyes flicked left and right, obviously searching for an escape route.

Yang Kai watched him with a smile, then suddenly snapped his finger; a golden light flashed, and Zhang Fu screamed, stumbling backward.

But before his body could move, an incomparably powerful Shi field wrapped him, rendering him utterly immobile!

Zhang Fu's eyeballs trembled violently; his gaze dropped to his left hand and discovered that the tip of one finger—about an inch—had been cut off by some sharp instrument, the cut clean and blood spraying into the void.

That kind of pain, to an Origin Returning Realm warrior who had seen many battlefields, was not great, but what truly filled Zhang Fu with terror was that he had no ability to resist Yang Kai.

They were both Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators, yet the other acted like a lofty deity who could easily control life and death!

The golden light flashed again…

Zhang Fu felt the pain once more; the finger that had already lost an inch was cut another inch. The severed section floated in the void and slowly drifted away.

The other said nothing; his fingers merely flicked, and the golden threads that bound Zhang Fu's hand kept flashing.

An inch. Another inch…

Zhang Fu’s left hand was shortened inch by inch until his entire palm was sliced clean off. Yet Yang Kai still showed no intention of stopping—on the contrary, he continued the motion with chilling precision, controlling each cut with flawless accuracy.

What terrified Zhang Fu beyond measure was that, as this game continued, a voice cold to the bone came from the other: "After I finish cutting off your left hand, I'll cut off your right, then your left leg, then your right leg. Given your cultivation, you likely won't die for now, and then I'll slice you open inch by inch. Don't worry—I guarantee you'll be alive and well until I reach your heart; that way you'll be able to watch clearly how you die."

Zhang Fu could no longer restrain his panic; forcing down the piercing pain, he roared, "Enough! Tell me what you want to know and I'll tell you everything! Don't torture me any more."

It was just death either way; long pain was worse than a short pain. Zhang Fu truly could not bear to watch how he would die—merely imagining the scene chilled him to the bone.

Yang Kai's hand paused slightly; he regarded him at leisure and said with a faint laugh, "If you had come around earlier, you'd have suffered less—why stretch it out?"

Clenching his teeth, Zhang Fu growled through the pain, “The victor is king, the loser is the villain—I’ll tell you!”

"Fine! Who exactly are you people?" Yang Kai did not waste words and asked directly.

"We are of the Sword Alliance!"

"The Sword Alliance?" Yang Kai raised a brow.

The Sword Alliance was considered a major force within the Star Domain, ruling over several Cultivation Stars. Though not as vast as the Hengluo Commerce Guild, its strength was by no means something to be slighted.

Come to think of it, Yang Kai had met warriors from the Sword Alliance years ago. Besides the Hengluo Commerce Guild and the Sword Alliance, there were forces like Purple Star, the Spine of the Star River, and the Abandoned Nest—each holding a piece of the Star Domain's territory. They vied for dominance and occasionally skirmished at various scales.

"Who were you hiding over there to ambush?" Yang Kai asked again.

Zhang Fu's eyes flickered and he hesitated, but in the end he gritted his teeth and said, "Also people from our Sword Alliance."

Yang Kai regarded him with a strange expression.

Zhang Fu then cried out, "I'm not lying! We intended to ambush merely our rivals—though we all belong to the Sword Alliance, there are always factions!"

Yang Kai gave a slight nod; from the other's eyes he saw no sign of lying, and the explanation was plausible.

For a major force like the Sword Alliance, internal strife was inevitable—no sect of that scale could ever be truly united as one. But for such conflicts to escalate to the point of ambush and assassination was truly beyond belief.

"Be more specific." To be safe, Yang Kai pressed further.

Since Zhang Fu had chosen to cooperate, he had nothing left to hide and proceeded to tell Yang Kai everything in detail.

Within the Sword Alliance, several factions coexisted, but two were the most prominent — one led by the current Alliance Master, and the other by the Vice Alliance Master. The two sides had been locked in open and secret contention for many years.

The Lord Li he had mentioned earlier was called Li Minghai and was a notable expert within the Sword Alliance, belonging to the Deputy Alliance Master's faction.

This time they lay in ambush to strike at a rising star of the Alliance Master's faction, who was also a descendant of the Alliance Master Gu Cangyun—Gu Jianxin!

"A rising star—even if he was the Alliance Master's descendant, would he be worth mobilizing Void King Realm warriors to ambush?" Yang Kai stared at Zhang Fu in surprise and wondered, "What about this person made you take such measures?"

Zhang Fu gave a bitter smile: "If he were an ordinary Origin Returning Realm warrior, he wouldn't merit such attention, but the Young Alliance Master possesses the Taixu Sword Physique and has already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If he were to ascend to the Void King Realm, the Deputy Alliance Master's faction would never again see daylight. So with the Young Alliance Master's current lack of powerful escorts, we planned this operation, and your appearance made Lord Li think the plan was compromised, which is why he tried to kill you."

"Taixu Sword Physique?" Yang Kai stroked his chin. "That's a special constitution, right? One that makes you so wary—could it be that formidable?"

"The Young Alliance Master is only sixty years old and has already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—do you still doubt his prowess?" Zhang Fu's expression turned grave. "You don't look very old yourself; your strength is considerable, but if you met our Young Alliance Master, it's unclear who would win."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai chuckled.

For a cultivator to reach the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm before the age of sixty was indeed a heaven-defying talent! However, judging by Yang Kai’s age, he seemed to be only around fifty — making him even more extraordinary than that Gu Jianxin.

Cultivators often lost track of the passage of years while training, so they were no longer overly concerned with age.

"If you say so, I am a little interested in your Young Alliance Master," Yang Kai said with a sly smile.

Zhang Fu sized him up from head to toe, then nodded. “People like you will inevitably clash one day — and when you do, the sparks will be earth-shattering. But… that depends on whether the Young Alliance Master can survive this assassination attempt first! Alright, I’ve told you everything you wanted to know. You can make your move now!”

"Travel well." Yang Kai inclined his head faintly.

"Do it!" Zhang Fu urged impatiently, but Yang Kai still showed no sign of striking—then, in the next moment, his consciousness blurred.

Indeed… there was no pain at all!

Standing where he was, Yang Kai took the Spatial Rings from Zhang Fu and Liu Dong, produced two Demonic Flames, and burned their corpses; only then did he glance thoughtfully back toward the route, mount his Star Shuttle, and depart.

He did not want to provoke trouble, but Li Minghai had struck without asking reasons simply because he passed by, and that was intolerable. One did not take a blow without returning it.

He planned to stir up a commotion! If he could find an opportunity to eliminate Li Minghai, all the better.

In the Meteorite Sea, the group led by Li Minghai waited quietly like dormant predators, watching for the opportune moment.

After a long while someone frowned and asked, "Why haven't Zhang Fu and Liu Dong returned yet? With their abilities, they should have succeeded by now."

"Could they have encountered danger?"

"What danger could there be here? You don't mean to suggest he was killed by that passerby, do you?"

"Impossible. That passerby barely survived Lord Li's blow; how could he have the strength to kill Zhang Fu and Liu Dong? Still, it's odd they haven't returned for so long. Sir, shall I go look for them?" The man said as he asked Li Minghai.

"No need. If they can't handle such a simple task, they are useless alive. Do not act rashly. Within a day or two the Young Alliance Master's warship will pass here—we will wait silently."

"Yes!"

After a few words they fell silent again, occasionally glancing in some direction as they awaited the Young Alliance Master's warship.

This meteorite sea was vast and easy to hide in; otherwise Li Minghai would not have chosen this spot to ambush Gu Jianxin's warship.

Precisely because it was so large, when Yang Kai stealthily circled in from a great distance, no one noticed him.

At that moment Yang Kai was no more than a hundred li from Li Minghai and the others.

He hid on a meteorite and watched the direction where Li Minghai's group waited, his expression cold.

With his current strength he could have gone up and wreaked havoc; even if he could not handle Li Minghai, killing a few of his subordinates and retreating at leisure would have been no problem.

But Yang Kai did not intend to act rashly; the one who had hurt him before was Li Minghai, so he naturally wanted to settle the score with Li Minghai. He waited for the Young Alliance Master to arrive, for the two sides to clash, and then to seize an opportunity to ambush—using the enemy's methods against them!
