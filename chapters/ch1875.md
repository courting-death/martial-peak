## Chapter 1875 — You Dare

In the face of an old monster like Kuang Shizong, Gongsun Liang did not dare play any tricks; what he said contained not the slightest embellishment — he simply laid out the events of the day in plain, straightforward detail.

When he heard that the ancestral tablets in the ancestral hall had been shattered, Kuang Shizong erupted in fury; a terrifying pressure swept across the hall, its weight like the heavens collapsing, pressing down on everyone's hearts and leaving them shaken and uneasy.

His sharp gaze swept toward Zi Wuji, and at that look Zi Wuji spat a mouthful of blood — he had been gravely wounded.

With his shrewdness, he of course knew that the smashing of the tablets was Zi Wuji's covert deed; this was a grave insult to the ancestors and naturally demanded punishment.

Only when he heard that Yang Kai had faced two opponents alone and had not fallen behind but instead seized the advantage did Kuang Shizong raise a brow and regard Yang Kai with keen interest.

Yang Kai remained calm and unafraid, grinning at him.

In a short while, Gongsun Liang finished speaking and stood quietly where he was, anxiously waiting.

The atmosphere was heavy; no one dared speak. The place where Kuang Shizong stood had, without doubt, become the focal point of all eyes; no one knew what he was thinking at that moment.

After a long while, Kuang Shizong finally said slowly, "Why have I not heard that my Purple Star has gained a Third Venerable One? Where did you obtain that Command Token?"

Yang Kai gave a faint smile and said, "Sir, that is a strange question to ask — the Command Token was of course given to me by Brother Zi Long."

"He gave it to you? When and where?" Kuang Shizong's stern eyes bore into Yang Kai as he demanded coldly.

Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming looked at Kuang Shizong in doubt, not understanding why he would ask such irrelevant questions.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed slightly. A bad premonition prickled at him, but he remained composed and asked, "Sir, what do you mean by those questions?"

"You know full well what I mean!" Kuang Shizong's face suddenly turned grave. He stepped a single pace toward Yang Kai, but the force that moved with that step felt like a colossal hammer smashing down upon Yang Kai. Even with Yang Kai's current strength, he was driven back three steps, his face flushing.

"Zi Long... where has he gone? Is he dead or alive!" Kuang Shizong demanded in a deep voice.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly and he remained silent. Kuang Shizong's question clearly meant he already knew something or had drawn a conclusion; whatever Yang Kai said might reveal a flaw, so it was best to keep quiet.

"Silent? That only proves a guilty conscience," Kuang Shizong sneered. “Boy, you may not know this, but a Purple Star Venerable is not someone who earns the title merely by holding the Command Token. My approval is required as well. Without my consent, even Zi Long wouldn’t have the guts to hand that token out. You possess the Command Token, yet I’ve never even heard of you. So tell me—did Zi Long decide I was no longer worth acknowledging, or is there some other issue here? Do you intend to give an explanation?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai could not help but give a little laugh and said casually, "Perhaps Brother Zi Long planned to inform you after some time. Besides... I have already returned the Command Token to the Great Elder; can't this matter end here?"

"Hmph!" Kuang Shizong snorted coldly and paid no heed to Yang Kai; instead he looked down at Zi Wuji and said coldly, "Is your father's Life Lamp still intact?"

Although Zi Wuji had been grievously wounded a moment before, he was not irreparably harmed and was currently recuperating. At the question his body shivered and his expression wavered, as if hesitating whether to lie, but he answered honestly: "Master, my father's Life Lamp... has shattered!"

"What?" The crowd was stunned; even Gongsun Liang showed a look of disbelief.

They all knew what a Life Lamp represented, and they understood clearly what it meant when a Life Lamp was broken.

It meant Zi Long had fallen! The lord of Purple Star was dead!

Only Li Maoming, who had received the news from Zi Wuji earlier, remained comparatively composed though his expression was sombre and he smiled bitterly. He and Zi Long had once fought side by side as close as brothers; later they parted over a woman, but they were not enemies. Upon learning of Zi Long's fall, Li Maoming felt no secret glee — only deep sorrow.

"So it is," Kuang Shizong sighed softly, his face seeming to age considerably.

After a moment of silence he turned his sharp, hawk-like gaze back to Yang Kai and said in a low voice, "Where did Zi Long fall?"

"The Lost Realm!" Yang Kai replied with a frown.

"Who slew him!"

Yang Kai was surprised. "Oh? You believe Zi Long’s death has nothing to do with me?”

Kuang Shizong sneered, "You are formidable, but not qualified to have killed Zi Long. If you had, do you think I would be talking to you now? I would have long since avenged Zi Long by taking your life."

"Your sight is sharp indeed!" Yang Kai said with a face of feigned admiration, then his expression turned grave: "Brother Zi Long died under the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; his death was not caused by another person!"

"Seven Luminaries Divine Light!" Kuang Shizong's face changed; he clearly knew what the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was. Perhaps he had once been to the Lost Realm and understood its danger. He nodded lightly and said, "If that's so, then it was his own misstep."

"After Zi Long fell, I took his Spatial Ring, and that Command Token... heh..." Yang Kai smirked awkwardly.

"So you are not my Purple Star's Venerable One?" Gongsun Liang's eyes flashed with hatred and he could not help but bark angrily.

"Forgive me, Great Elder, forgive me!" Yang Kai laughed and cupped his fist at him in mock respect.

"You infuriate me!" Gongsun Liang felt his blood boil, nearly about to explode with rage.

Kuang Shizong cast a cold glance at him and then turned to Yang Kai: "Boy, you are not my Purple Star's Venerable One, yet you brazenly impersonated one and came to trample my Purple Star City — an unforgivable crime!"

"This wasn't just my doing!" Yang Kai protested, looking aggrieved.

"If not for you, how could this situation have arisen?" Kuang Shizong looked at Yang Kai with killing intent, as solid as a tangible substance.

Yang Kai went on guard, operating his Saint Yuan and ready to strike back at any moment.

To his surprise, Kuang Shizong did not immediately attack. Instead he said, "Boy, I will give you two choices: One, I kill you, reduce you to ashes and bones to soothe the ancestors of Purple Star; or two, join Purple Star and become one of us, serving Purple Star. Choose for yourself!"

Yang Kai smiled wryly and said, "Sir, you put me in a bind: I do not wish to die, and I do not wish to join Purple Star. What am I to do?"

“Boy, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. This old man is fond of talent and doesn’t wish to see someone like you die before your time. You’d best think it over carefully before you answer.”

“I’ve already thought it through,” Yang Kai said with a firm nod.

Kuang Shizong narrowed his eyes and stared in Yang Kai's direction, saying deliberately, "You impersonated my Purple Star's Venerable One and infiltrated the Purple Star Palace, getting yourself entangled in this mess — you did not come merely for spectacle, did you? I suspect... you came for these people."

As soon as the words fell, Kuang Shizong waved his hand, and from a distance below came faint cries of surprise, followed by a roar and violent energy rippling out. Kuang Shizong's face grew stern; he reached out and clenched his hand, and then pulled.

Several figures flew uncontrollably from that direction and came to a stop not far from him.

To everyone's shock they were Shen Tu and the others.

Behind Shen Tu and the others, the Stone Puppet bore the Heaven-Shaking Pillar in relentless pursuit. Xiaoxiao's small body had swollen considerably, as if trying to save Shen Tu and the others, but it was utterly powerless.

Shen Tu and the others looked panicked; they had only just been rescued by the Stone Puppet and were preparing to flee Purple Star City, yet Kuang Shizong subdued them with a single move, suddenly making them the center of everyone's attention and leaving them in utter distress.

Kuang Shizong held Shen Tu and the others not far before him, frowning as he looked at the Stone Puppet below with suspicion.

Even with his eyesight he could not determine whether the Stone Puppet was a living being or merely a puppet; he could only sense faintly that this stony thing was not simple.

Yang Kai squinted at Kuang Shizong and asked, "What do you intend, sir?"

"Nothing much." Kuang Shizong, pleased to see Yang Kai a little nervous over Shen Tu and the others, smiled proudly and said, "So you are of the Hengluo Commerce Guild? Yet why have I never heard of someone like you in the Hengluo Commerce Guild?"

“Youngsters like me aren’t exactly famous—naturally you haven’t heard of me. But you, a figure revered as a Grandmaster of the Martial Dao, resorting to tricks like this? If word spreads, aren’t you afraid others will laugh at you?” Yang Kai’s expression darkened, cold enough to scrape frost off his face.

"Who dares mock me? I'll wipe out his entire clan." Kuang Shizong showed contempt. "I will give you one last chance: swear fealty to Purple Star and I will spare these ragged fish; otherwise, you will all die!"

Shen Tu floated in midair, his strength bound so he could not operate his Saint Yuan. He smiled bitterly at Yang Kai and said, "Brother Yang, don't bother with us; save yourself..."

Before he finished speaking he was suddenly struck as if by a heavy blow and spat a mouthful of blood.

"Second Young Master!" The Hengluo Commerce Guild fighters were alarmed; one of them turned and cursed at Kuang Shizong, "Old bastard, how dare you..."

Bang...

The man's words were cut off as his skull suddenly burst open; red and white matter flew everywhere as the headless corpse fell from midair.

Shen Tu and the others turned deathly pale — none of them expected someone of Kuang Shizong's standing to actually strike down an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, and in such a manner while he was already subdued.

In that instant no one dared utter another word, for fear of inviting death.

“I’ve little patience left. The next one to die will be him.” Kuangshi Sect pointed at Shen Tu, his expression chilling. “That brat seems to carry some weight. Once he’s dead, perhaps you’ll give my proposal some proper thought.”

At those words Shen Tu's body could not help but tremble.

"How dare you!" Yang Kai roared angrily, his face turning savage.

Setting aside his personal bond with Shen Tu, he could not stand by and see Shen Tu slain — and as for Xue Yue, if Shen Tu were allowed to be killed by Kuang Shizong, Yang Kai would no longer have the face to meet Xue Yue.

After all, Shen Tu was Xue Yue's Second Brother.

Kuang Shizong's expression flickered; his look was strange as he said, "No one has spoken to me like that in a long time — amusing. Boy, then open your eyes wide and see whether I truly dare to kill him!"
