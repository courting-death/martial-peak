## Chapter 557 — Visitors from Overseas

Turning his head to look around, not a single person displayed any mockery or disdain toward him; they simply looked at him with calm indifference. Liu Feisheng instantly felt deeply ashamed, wishing he could dig a hole and hide in it.

The apathetic attitude of these people was even harder for him to accept than outright ridicule.

"Young Master, your generosity astounds me. I’m ashamed I haven’t been of much help lately. These things..." He hesitated, struggling with his words.

The five Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures were forgivable; although good, Liu Feisheng was the Young City Lord of Tianyuan City, and his status was not low enough to be unable to obtain such treasures if he wished. But the ten Mystery Grade Pills were something he could not disregard. With these ten pills, he could save himself at least two to three years of grueling cultivation, which would allow him to advance several minor realms ahead of his peers.

"Take them," someone urged from the side.

"Then I won’t refuse," Liu Feisheng gritted his teeth, accepting the ten Mystery Grade Pills and five Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures. He then solemnly cupped his fists toward Yang Kai before turning and leaving.

Yang Kai stood still with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression calm as he continued to wait.

"Young Master, we shall also take our leave," a Divine Roaming Realm expert from the Duanmu Family stepped forward with an unperturbed expression.

The Duanmu Family had originally supported Yang Tie, the third brother of the Yang Family, but on the first night of the Succession War, Yang Tie was eliminated, and the Duanmu Family suffered heavy casualties. The five survivors subsequently entered Yang Kai’s service.

Last night’s battle saw all five deployed, but only two returned alive.

They had always been by Yang Kai’s side to avenge their fallen family members, a wish that had long since been fulfilled. Now, with only the two of them left barely clinging to life, they no longer felt any attachment to this place.

Given the pressing circumstances, they naturally had to depart.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Thank you for your efforts, senior brothers."

More Lingxiao Pavilion disciples brought ten Mystery Grade Pills and five Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures. The two from the Duanmu Family accepted the items and left swiftly as well.

"Young Master, Ziwei Valley will leave as well." Fan Hong came forward, smiling bitterly.

Yang Kai nodded and waved his hand in acknowledgment.

Fan Hong took the Mystery Grade Pills and Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures generously, bade farewell to Yang Kai, and headed out.

Only a few steps away, he suddenly stopped and turned back. "Junior Sister, aren’t you leaving?"

He was addressing Luo Xiaoman.

Fan Hong and Luo Xiaoman were both from Ziwei Valley and were senior and junior disciples, respectively.

Luo Xiaoman shook her head slowly. "I’m going with Sister Qiu. You go on ahead, senior brother."

Fan Hong considered this, then said nothing further and left.

"Anyone else leaving?" Yang Kai scanned the surroundings. "There is no need to hesitate. It’s not too late to leave immediately. Otherwise, you might truly become enemies of the Eight Great Families. If you won’t think for yourselves, then consider your families and sects."

"No need to say more." Hu Jiao’er snorted coldly. "No one left here now intends to leave."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Those who left had joined Yang Kai’s household later for various reasons. Those who remained had sincerely wished to repay Yang Kai’s aid since the Succession War began or was underway.

"That’s right." Chen Xueshu nodded. "Brother Yang, as you said, you will be leaving here in a few days. We don’t mind staying these few days. Once you leave, we’ll go as well. A few days isn’t so long; surely the Eight Great Families won’t be so petty as to object?"

Looking at them, Yang Kai paused for a moment and then nodded. "Very well, then everyone shall wait a few days."

"Disperse, disperse." Dong Qinghan shouted; now that the decision was made for everyone to leave in a few days, the heavy burden weighing on everyone’s hearts suddenly vanished.

Yet, thinking of enduring hardships together for so long only to soon part, they still felt some sadness.

In this lifetime, how many friends could one truly entrust with their life? Everyone here had become such friends.

As the gathering dispersed, and only Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng remained in the side chamber.

Yang Kai smiled at Qiu Yimeng. "What is it you want to say?"

Qiu Yimeng shook her head slowly. "Nothing much. I’m just a bit regretful for you, feels unfair."

Yang Kai stood up, took a few steps, then inhaled softly. "Such is the world. I don’t feel wronged or treated unfairly at all. At least I tried. Beauty, please don’t look at me with the eyes of a beaten dog, alright? I haven’t fallen so far yet."

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but smile, and the room brightened immediately.

"You and Huo Xingchen should also leave quickly. Staying here too long won’t do you any good."

Those two had resorted to fairly crude tricks to remain in Yang Kai’s household, but the eyes of the Eight Great Families were sharp; they knew exactly what ploys were used.

"My injuries haven’t healed. I won’t be able to move freely for a few days." Qiu Yimeng stuck out her tongue mischievously, wanting to linger in the house a few more days.

Yang Kai nodded with a smile, about to speak, when his expression suddenly changed.

For some unknown reason, the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia inside him began to stir restlessly, as if drawn by an eerie force, trying to break free from within.

This discovery startled him. He promptly circulated True Yuan to suppress the internal restlessness.

Before he could figure out what was happening, a commanding voice came from outside the mansion: "This is Tai Yi Sect’s Li Yuanchun paying a visit. Is this the residence of Yang Kai, Young Master of the Yang Family?"

At that, the expressions of Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng instantly shifted.

At the same time, two voices rang in Yang Kai’s ears—Meng Wuya and Ling Taixu alerting, "The visitor is beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!"

"Tai Yi Sect?" Qiu Yimeng furrowed her brows. "The superpower overseas? What business do they have here? And why come for you?"

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted, irritated. "Truly a troublesome time."

He finally understood why the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia inside him were stirring. Surely more than just the Tai Yi Sect had come.

Outside the mansion, a crowd bustled, led by a greying-haired, ruddy-faced elder in his eighties. Over fifty people stood with him, all Divine Roaming Realm experts, many at the peak of that realm.

After Li Yuanchun’s announcement, a man beside him became excited. "I sense it! The Shura Sword, the Shura Sect’s ancestral treasure, is indeed here."

Another—a bewitching woman with a dark aura and pitch-black fingernails—murmured coquettishly, "I also sense the aura of my Falling Flower Divine Sect’s Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia."

The first speaker added, "Too bad the Shura Sword has been assimilated into his body. Retrieving it with secret techniques will be troublesome."

Li Yuanchun nodded slightly. "The Gu Yun Island discovered the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique in Yunxia Sect over three years ago. Since then, our great overseas sects have been probing the whereabouts of our ancestral treasures lost three centuries ago. At last, we have our lead. Everyone, do not act rashly. We are here to negotiate peacefully. After all, this is not overseas — let us not act recklessly on another’s turf."

"We understand, and trust Senior Li’s judgment," others nodded lightly.

However, a flicker of doubt appeared on Li Yuanchun’s face. The Shura Sect sensed the Shura Sword’s aura, the Fallen Flower Divine Sect sensed the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia’s, but why could none detect the Tai Yi Seal’s presence?

According to overseas powers’ speculation, these treasures should all be kept together in one place, held by the same person.

As they spoke, their eyes also swept over a young girl standing not far away.

This girl was dressed distinctively.

A cloud-like mane of flowing hair framed her delicate, willow-leaf eyebrows like faint smoke; her eyes bright and slender, a charming jade-like nose, cheeks faintly blushed, breath fragrant like orchids, cherry-lipped, flowerlike face dazzlingly beautiful, skin as translucent and white as snow or frost, her figure graceful and enchanting.

What drew attention most was her cultivation — for such a young age, to have reached the Divine Roaming Realm.

Many felt silently stunned; Li Yuanchun was especially awed. Indeed, the Inland lands were full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers, for they casually saw such a girl with such power.

Though she arrived with them, she was clearly not part of their group.

The girl bore a mischievous look, quietly waiting yet vigilant against the overseas crowd—like a crouching tiger, which was somewhat amusing.

Outside, the crowd waited, but inside Yang Kai’s mansion, he briefly explained his theories to Qiu Yimeng.

Years ago, he ventured overseas alone to hone himself, lost in Yunxia Sect. Under their coercion, he was taken to a hidden island where he acquired the Warm Spirit Lotus and many ancestral treasures from overseas powers.

So far, he had only used the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia.

Although cautious, he had used them several times over the years. If overseas powers had the will to probe, those years of usage would have left some clues.

This was probably why they had traveled tens of thousands of li from overseas to reclaim the treasures lost three centuries ago.

"I see," Qiu Yimeng nodded gently after listening, seeing clearly the situation. "The treasures rightfully belong to them, but you are not at fault. You acquired them unknowingly. Now that they have come, what will you do?"

"Negotiate," Yang Kai chuckled. The Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia had helped him a great deal during this time, but as his strength rose, especially after the Po Jing Lake treasure battle and gaining the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure, their roles diminished.

Yang Kai himself didn’t favor relying on the mystical power of treasures.

So if conditions were right, he wouldn’t mind returning them. After all, keeping them was neither here nor there. They were things those people were determined to reclaim, and forcibly holding onto them would only provoke enmity.

Before he could say more, another shout called from outside, impatient and urging.

Yang Kai smiled. "Come with me; let’s go see."

Qiu Yimeng nodded and hurried after him.
