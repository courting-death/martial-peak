## Chapter 1783 — Do I Need to Cooperate with You?

Zi Donglai's smile froze on his face in an instant, and his cheek twitched uncontrollably.

Even Zi Long's eyes snapped open, and he stared hard at Yang Kai.

Even he, with his calm temperament, was provoked by Yang Kai to a fury that climbed three zhang; if the Seven Luminaries Divine Light could not devour even soul power, he would have used a Soul Technique to turn Yang Kai into a true idiot and shut him up for good.

But at the moment, no matter how much resentment he harbored toward Yang Kai, he could only bite it back; there was nothing he could actually do to him.

He believed Yang Kai had seen that too, which was why he acted so brazenly.

"I, Zi Donglai, swear that later I will make you taste every torment of the world!" Zi Donglai ground his teeth and spat the words with venom.

He was truly furious; humiliated by Yang Kai repeatedly in front of his father, even dragging his father's name into it — how could he endure? Yang Kai had to pay a painfully heavy price to wash away his hatred.

"I'm so frightened," Yang Kai said coldly, looking at Zi Donglai. "But boy, oaths aren't something you utter lightly; if you fail to fulfill it, divine retribution will befall you!"

Zi Donglai glared at Yang Kai and said nothing.

He had realized that in a war of words he was no match for Yang Kai. He had never experienced anything like this before; after Yang Kai's repeated provocations he could no longer steady his mind, his face twisted into a savage leer.

Beside him, Zi Long frowned.

Zi Donglai was blinded by rage and might not have noticed the insidiousness of Yang Kai's words, but as a Void King Realm expert with wide experience, Zi Long knew the stakes all too well.

On the surface Yang Kai's remark sounded harmless, merely an exchange of petty words with Zi Donglai.

But if one thought it through, it was utterly malicious.

If Zi Donglai failed to accomplish what he vowed, Yang Kai's very existence would become his heart demon.

Zi Donglai was now at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; his next breakthrough would be into the Void King Realm. That threshold was vitally important — if a heart demon attacked at the moment of breakthrough it would wreak huge interference, perhaps causing a failed breakthrough and the dispersal of his soul.

Thus when Zi Long heard what Yang Kai had said, he realized how underhanded Yang Kai truly was.

This brat was clearly not stupid, so why, when he was outnumbered and alone, did he repeatedly push at his limits, offending not only Zi Long but also Xu Wei? What was he trying to do?

Did he really have so much confidence that he could escape under Zi Long and Xu Wei's very noses?

Even Zi Long, with his high cultivation and broad knowledge, could not fathom Yang Kai's intent at the moment.

But from the current situation it was clear: this lad could not be allowed to live. As long as he lived he would be a heart demon interfering with Zi Donglai's ascent, so... he had to die.

Zi Long resolved inwardly that once the Seven Luminaries Divine Light faded he would strike with all his might to cripple Yang Kai, then let Zi Donglai carry out his oath; after Yang Kai was dealt with, he would compete with Xu Wei for the Wudao Flower.

He was confident his strength would make that easy.

"Kid!" Xu Wei shouted from over there, his tone impatient. "One last time I ask you: will you cooperate with me or not?"

"Get lost!" Yang Kai turned to Xu Wei with disdain. "Who do you think you are? Why would I cooperate with you?"

"Good, good!" Xu Wei, also angered by Yang Kai, hardened his face and said icily, "Then I'll see how you die later!"

There was no doubt Yang Kai would die; Xu Wei believed he need not act, for Zi Long would not spare Yang Kai, so he was content to sit back and watch the struggle.

“No need for your concern!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, stretching his body where he stood. He rolled his neck and loosened his shoulders, a series of crisp cracking sounds echoing out. It sounded half like he was talking to himself, yet also as if meant for Zi Long and Xu Wei to hear: “That’s enough talk—this Young Master won’t waste any more breath on you.”

He put on the air of someone preparing for serious action.

The other three stared dumbfounded, unsure what Yang Kai intended.

But the next moment their eyes widened and they all watched Yang Kai's movements with astonished expressions.

Yang Kai, wearing an indifferent look, took a step forward; then he stepped again...

After two steps he had reached the edge of the safe zone that the space fissure behind him provided; one more inch forward and he would plunge into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, a situation of extreme peril.

"What, convinced you're doomed and want to commit suicide?" Zi Donglai taunted.

He could think of no other explanation; though unlikely, it was the nearest guess he could reach.

Yang Kai glanced at him but paid his taunt no heed; he merely stepped forward once more.

"Ha!" Zi Donglai laughed uproariously, certain he need not act personally to vent his rage.

But his laughter was cut off at once.

In his sight Yang Kai suddenly vanished as if he had never been there.

At that instant a strange, exquisite fluctuation of energy surged around Yang Kai's body.

"Where did he go?" Zi Donglai was stunned, but the next moment he caught sight of a figure that had abruptly appeared on the other side.

Zi Donglai followed the movement and could not help but cry out in surprise.

The figure that had appeared was none other than the Yang Kai who had disappeared from under his nose; he had already arrived in another safe zone — the very place where the five Wudao Flowers grew!

There was a space fissure behind the slope where the five Wudao Flowers grew; it was the shelter provided by that fissure that kept them from being covered by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

Yang Kai had appeared standing beside a Wudao Flower.

Zi Donglai looked bewildered, staring between Yang Kai and the place he had just been; he could not fathom what world-shattering secret technique Yang Kai had used to cross the spatial barrier in an instant and appear a hundred zhang away.

Beside him Zi Long's eyes narrowed as though he had seen a terrifying scene, his gaze flashing with remarkable light.

"Spatial Force!" Xu Wei shouted, pointing at Yang Kai and bellowing in a rough voice, "You actually command Spatial Force? How do you command Spatial Force?"

Xu Wei's expression shifted as if he had seen a ghost — volatile and extreme.

"Spatial Force?" Zi Donglai was momentarily stunned, but he quickly understood what Xu Wei meant.

For a moment his eyes on Yang Kai brimmed with incredulity and jealousy.

Spatial Force was an exceedingly esoteric power—difficult to enter, and even harder to master. Across the vast Star Domain with its countless cultivators, how many truly understood the power of space? That number would certainly not exceed a thousand.

And among that thousand, how many had refined Spatial Force to a deep level?

Zi Donglai did not know, but he knew such people were rarer even than Void King-Grade alchemists.

His Purple Star did have practitioners of Spatial Force, but none could perform what Yang Kai had — ignoring spatial barriers to instantly teleport a hundred zhang; that was true teleportation, not an illusion caused by speed.

Those few practitioners on Purple Star only knew crude methods of repairing Space Arrays; they could not use their Spatial Force for other deeds.

Even so, those few held extremely high status within Purple Star, enjoying treatment far above that of ordinary Guest Elders.

They were Purple Star's treasures.

Yet compared to what Yang Kai had done, they were worlds apart.

If Yang Kai’s display of mastery over Spatial Force marked him as an expert, then those few others were no more than apprentices who had just stepped into the Martial Dao. Even with Zi Donglai’s discerning eyes, it was clear—the two were utterly incomparable.

How did this unremarkable brat obtain such a fate, enabling him to cultivate Spatial Force to this level? Zi Donglai looked at Yang Kai with searing jealousy; an unbalanced flame burned deep within him.

He was the Young Master of Purple Star and had enjoyed privileged circumstances; why had he not been able to enter Spatial Force cultivation?

To master this power would be more potent than cultivating any mighty technique.

Zi Donglai clenched his fist, eyes full of unwillingness.

"So that's it!" Zi Long inhaled deeply and his expression lost its former assuredness, instead becoming extremely grave. "So this is what you relied on; no wonder you dared speak so insolently earlier."

Yang Kai chuckled and did not deny it.

Few knew he mastered Spatial Force; he had kept it hidden, but now, drawn by the five Wudao Flowers, he had to expose it.

Wudao Flowers were exceedingly rare, especially the five pale-purple ones here, mature in their medicinal age — miss them now and finding Wudao Flowers again would be difficult.

Choosing the lesser of two evils — that was Yang Kai's decision.

"So your name is Yang Kai?" Zi Long's demeanor was far more composed than his son's; shocked at Yang Kai's mastery of Spatial Force, he steadied himself and asked.

He had not paid Yang Kai much attention before, but he had vaguely heard Xue Yue address him and thus remembered his name.

"And what if it is?" Yang Kai sneered coldly at Zi Long.

Zi Long chuckled softly and was not angered by his attitude; rather, with affability he said, "It was my fault for attacking you earlier."

He spoke with an earnest expression.

"Father..." Zi Donglai looked at Zi Long in astonishment, his face full of disbelief.
