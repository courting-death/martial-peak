## Chapter 325 — Alliance

“Do you want to come back to the Qiu Family with me?” Qiu Yimeng suddenly proposed solemnly, her eyes filled with sincerity.

This was undoubtedly an opportunity. Qiu Yimeng could also see the estrangement between Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo. If she could offer effective conditions to impress him at this moment, it would undoubtedly bring a valuable ally to the Qiu Family, making the suffering from this confinement somewhat worthwhile.

Qiu Yimeng was a decisive woman and naturally knew what to do at this moment.

“Miss Qiu, you must be joking?” Yang Kai looked at her with indifference, lightly chuckling coldly.

“I am serious.” Qiu Yimeng tucked a stray hair behind her ear, “I can provide you with better treatment than here. Anything you want is available, cultivation resources, beautiful maidens to serve you, everything you need!”

“Sister Qiu…” Luo Xiaoman called softly, not expecting Qiu Yimeng to offer such generous conditions to win Yang Kai over.

The Qiu Family, as one of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, had immense power and wealth, with many people wanting to join, but the Qiu Family always set their standards high, preferring to accept only genuine elites or experts.

But… to win over a few from the Divine Roaming Realm, did it really require such a high price?

Was this guy really that valuable?

However, although Luo Xiaoman was not as perceptive as Qiu Yimeng, having spent more time with her, she knew that Qiu Yimeng was usually quite accurate in her assessments.

Since she dared to say that, the man in front of them might indeed be worth allying with!

With this thought, Luo Xiaoman no longer underestimated Yang Kai, and her gaze toward him became more serious.

“How about it? I am asking you earnestly about this matter.” Qiu Yimeng looked at Yang Kai solemnly, continuing her inquiry.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow. He did not expect this woman to not only be talented and powerful but also decisive in her character. Based on her conduct during this time, if she did not perish prematurely, she would certainly become someone significant in the future!

“Moreover, I can promise you that if you want to marry a woman from the Qiu Family’s collateral branch, I can take charge of the decision for you. I have a cousin who is quite lovely, and you can take her as a wife or a concubine as you wish.”

Yang Kai looked at her with a playful expression: “The allure of beauty cannot tempt me.”

Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, her beautiful eyes shimmering: “Then what about just now…”

“Just now was merely an accident.” Yang Kai said, unruffled, showing no signs of embarrassment.

“Then will you agree or not?” Qiu Yimeng found Yang Kai utterly unyielding and increasingly felt that he was difficult to deal with, making her somewhat exasperated.

If it were another young man, having received such promises would have likely made him bow in submission, yet he appeared completely unconcerned, with not even a hint of wavering in his expression.

This bastard had such a large appetite?

“No need. I am doing quite well at the moment.” Yang Kai bluntly refused, not wanting to waste any more words with her.

Qiu Yimeng was momentarily taken aback before suddenly smiling slightly: “You should consider it carefully; if you change your mind, you can find me anytime. The doors of the Qiu Family will always be open for you!”

She understood that such a man could not be pushed. He needed the freedom of choice; otherwise, not only would it be impossible to achieve her goal, it could also backfire. Deep down, she felt a pang of regret for her earlier eagerness.

But seeing him so calm, Qiu Yimeng couldn't help but feel a flicker of annoyance. Hence she asked hastily, “Let’s talk about something else. Can you help me and Xiaoman send a message to the Enchantress Queen?”

“I can talk to her once I see her.” Yang Kai frowned and shrugged: “As you can see, I am also a prisoner right now, but my treatment is much better compared to yours.”

“That’s true.” Qiu Yimeng smiled. “Regardless, I must thank you. If we survive this ordeal, when I return to the Qiu Family, I will certainly clear the name of Lingxiao Pavilion for you!”

Yang Kai's eyes brightened, shining with brilliance as he looked at her, and after a long while, he nodded slightly.

Qiu Yimeng’s words had finally won her some favor in Yang Kai’s heart.

“You all should do as you please!” Yang Kai said, then closed his eyes and began to meditate.

After watching for a while, Qiu Yimeng realized that this man was indeed diligently cultivating right in front of her and Luo Xiaoman, unable to help but chuckle softly, knowing he was hinting for them to leave. Thus, she took Luo Xiaoman and said, “Let’s go.”

“By the way.” Before leaving, Yang Kai suddenly called out, “If you want to bathe, let Yunli and Ruoyu prepare some warm water. The bathing pool is on the first floor, and I won’t be leaving this room for a while.”

Qiu Yimeng’s face flushed, realizing that everything she and Luo Xiaoman had said during their ascent to the upper floor had been overheard by him.

“Thank you. I hope we won’t be enemies in the future!” Qiu Yimeng said solemnly while staring deeply at Yang Kai.

Once they were downstairs, Luo Xiaoman could no longer help but softly inquire, “Sister Qiu, do you really think that highly of that guy?”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression was serious; after contemplating for a moment, she nodded: “Yes, among those I have dealt with, he is the strongest. Also, it seems he has grown significantly stronger in just half a month of not seeing him. Although he is in a lower realm than me, I feel an invisible pressure whenever I am near him.”

“That might be because our True Essence is restrained. If we fully restored our strength, we shouldn't be afraid of him!”

“No…” Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head. “I trust my intuition. Liu Qingyao from the Liu Family probably couldn’t compare to him!”

“Ah… the number one son of the Eight Great Families couldn’t beat him?” Luo Xiaoman’s eyes widened in astonishment.

“It’s seven families; the sons of the Yang Family are all outside, not counted in.” Qiu Yimeng sighed, recalling the methods the Yang Family used to train their direct disciples, feeling somewhat dismissive.

As she thought, she suddenly became alert. Yang Kai's surname was also Yang; could it be...

It shouldn’t be. Although she didn't recognize the sons of the Yang Family, those people couldn’t be of this age. The only one comparable to Yang Kai's age would be the youngest son of the Yang Family, but it was said that that young master was inherently deficient and was not fit for cultivation.

However, this person’s ruthlessness and domineering behavior were quite similar to those of the Yang Family.

“Fortunately, this person has no significant background. If he had a powerful background, hehe…” Qiu Yimeng chuckled wryly, recalling how she always held herself in high regard during her time in Zhongdu. Few young masters were worthy in her eyes, but unexpectedly, during this time of stillness and thought, she encountered such a character.

While talking, they found Yunli outside the house and asked her to help prepare some hot water, nervously washing in the first-floor bathing pool with great caution.

However, Yang Kai really remained on the second floor, cultivating without appearing at all.

……

Since that day, after years of pent-up emotions were vented through the cherry lips of Bilo, Yang Kai's temperament had also turned completely serene.

On the path of cultivation, relaxation and tension have their proper balance.

That release seemed to have eliminated all the fatigue Yang Kai accumulated over the past year, rejuvenating him inside and out.

Yang Kai faintly felt some insights, and his heart realm had unexpectedly seen some improvement.

With the improvement of his heart realm and the relaxation of his body and mind, even his speed of cultivation had significantly increased.

Although he lacked elixirs to replenish his Divine Sense, Yang Kai continued to observe the True Alchemy Formula.

After a session of probing, exhausting his Divine Sense, he patiently waited for several hours, allowing it to recover slowly, while during the waiting, he operated the True Yang Technique without slackening for a moment.

The Proud Bone Golden Body Technique and the incense burner finally played their roles during this time. These two long-sealed items and the martial techniques had not been utilized for a long time.

But as long as there was an opportunity, Yang Kai would remember to use them.

Three days later.

Shan Qingluo returned to Piaoxiang City.

The first place she went was Fenghuan Tower.

After not seeing her for some days, this enchantress seemed to have become even more bewitchingly beautiful, exuding a nearly imperceptible charm at all times, her delicate figure resembling a fragile willow in the wind, looking weak and fragile yet harboring immense strength.

She was among the few experts in the world, and no one could afford to underestimate her.

With sparkling eyes, she looked at Yang Kai and giggled: “You rascal, you have been quite well-behaved these days.”

Yang Kai chuckled coldly, “I have self-knowledge!”

“Alright, don’t be angry.” Shan Qingluo spoke sweetly, her voice dripping with honey, “Didn’t I leave a few women to serve you? How come Yunli said you didn’t take any of them? I didn’t realize you were so serious.” Shan Qingluo looked at him with surprise.

“That’s right.” Yang Kai felt a surge of guilt.

Shan Qingluo laughed lightly, moved closer, exhaling gently, softly saying, “Bilo's skills aren’t bad, right?”

“Passable…” Yang Kai's face flushed, quickly changing the subject: “What exactly do you want to achieve by keeping me here?”

“I haven’t been plotting anything.” Shan Qingluo turned her body gracefully, enveloped in an ethereal glow, lightly sitting on the fragrant bed, gazing at Yang Kai with a smile, “Feeling bored?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai glanced at her coolly.

Shan Qingluo suggested: “Then why not go out for a walk?”

“Where can I go?”

“Wherever you want; no one is stopping you.”

Yang Kai glared at her, suddenly realizing, staring at her suspiciously: “You mean to say, I can leave here?”

“Of course, when have I ever said you couldn’t leave? Hehe…”

“You woman…” Yang Kai felt a surge of anger.

“Enough, don’t be angry.” Shan Qingluo’s expression became serious, stating: “I came back this time to tell you that you can leave here. Wanting a man isn’t about keeping him locked up; I understand this as well.”

“Indeed, while you can keep a person, you cannot hold their heart!” Yang Kai nodded earnestly before eagerly proposing, “What about the Soul Pursuit Seal…”

“Just keep it for now; otherwise, I won’t be able to find you.” Shan Qingluo pouted, looking somewhat sorrowful.

“Fine.” Yang Kai also did not insist.

Although Shan Qingluo said he could leave, Yang Kai did not feel much joy; at least, he wasn’t as excited as he had imagined.

Perhaps it was because he knew this enchantress meant him no harm, even if she kept him close. Thus, though he was confined by her these days, he felt little aversion.

Moreover, taking advantage of her name, Yang Kai also reaped numerous benefits, so it wasn’t to his disadvantage.

If it weren’t for that time when he delved deep into Shan Qingluo’s Sea of Consciousness and saw many of her inner thoughts, he would have long since torn off the mask of friendliness with her.
