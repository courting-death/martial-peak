## Chapter 463 — Water Moon Azure Wave Armor

Everyone's gazes and minds were drawn to the ninth batch of Heaven-Grade treasures—except for the six disciples of the Yang Family!

Since the treasure-snatching battle began, they had not made a move. One by one, their followers had been sent out, and now each of them had only a single Blood Servant guarding at their side.

The six men were all on guard against each other, quietly observing their opponents’ movements. Yang Kai, Yang Wei, and Yang Zhao wore calm and unhurried expressions, while Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying appeared somewhat restless. When their own faction’s martial artists lost in the treasure hunt, they would sigh in regret, their faces clouded. When good-quality treasures were seized, they would smile happily and feel invigorated.

But no matter who, all waited silently for the appearance of the Mystery-Grade treasures, and they knew these were about to emerge.

Suddenly, from several thousand zhang high in the sky, a few faint points of light flickered like stars. As they brightened, extraordinary energy ripples spread through the air.

All eyes were drawn as these energy fluctuations pulled at their souls, forcing them to look upward.

The lights grew ever brighter, approaching the ground at an incredible speed like meteors falling from the heavens, trailing brilliant multicolored streaks behind them.

The six brothers lit up at what they saw—excitement blazing in their hearts.

The Mystery-Grade treasures had finally appeared!

And eight of them at once!

This was the grand finale of the treasure-snatching battle, and they were the most precious eight treasures of all!

Mystery-Grade was the highest tier in this world, whether for treasures or pills. Creating an Advanced Pill was already a tremendous challenge; forging Mystery-Grade treasures was even more difficult. Each Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure was nearly a family heirloom of a First-rate force.

Only the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu had the foundation to produce eight Mystery-Grade treasures at once.

Soon, the eight Mystery-Grade treasures that had fallen from the sky hovered about a thousand zhang above the ground, still rapidly descending.

Everyone—spectators and martial artists alike—felt a deathly aura pressing down from the heavens. It was as if the world were on the brink of destruction, sending chills down many spines.

“Run!” someone shouted. Then they instantly fled.

Since the third batch, all treasures had been rigged beforehand. To snatch a treasure, one had to endure attacks unleashed by the treasure itself.

These eight Mystery-Grade treasures were no different. The attacks unleashed by such treasures would be devastating; even masters at the seventh or eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm could barely withstand them, let alone those merely watching.

Screams broke out as the crowd fled like dogs bereft of a home, scrambling to distance themselves from Po Jing Lake.

Not only bystanders but even the competing martial artists hurried to dodge the impending attacks.

The six Yang brothers did not move, only watching the lights in the sky, their eyes growing ever more radiant.

Eight hundred zhang... seven hundred zhang...

At this distance, the shapes of the eight treasures could be discerned. Each was different in form, ranging from large to small. Without getting them into hand and examining, their functions remained a mystery.

Yang Kai released his powerful Divine Sense, circling the eight treasures. One mirror particularly caught his interest.

This mirror exuded profound and obscure energy fluctuations—exceptionally cold and probably a cold-natured treasure. Although Yang Kai cultivated the True Yang Technique, he still sensed this mirror could be more formidable than the others.

Five hundred zhang...

As if by silent agreement, the six Yang brothers, who had remained still until now, simultaneously surged upward, racing toward the eight treasures.

Their gazes met midair, confirming each other’s targets. It was clear none wished to clash prematurely.

There were eight treasures; divided evenly, each could claim at least one. The remaining two would be the centre of contention.

Yang Kai was relieved that none of his elder brothers seemed to have the same target as him. Since the functions of the Mystery-Grade treasures were unclear, everyone planned to take one and avoid unnecessary conflict.

Up and down, the distance between the six brothers and the eight treasures rapidly closed.

All six fiercely accelerated their True Yuan. The six Blood Servants following them likewise gathered their strength.

In an instant, the twelve collided with the treasures.

The six Blood Servants suddenly quickened, arriving just moments ahead of their masters. Cultivating their True Yuan to shield themselves, each launched attempts to seize the treasures.

The explosion of energy from a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure was more than the six brothers could endure at their current strength. Only the Blood Servants could first trigger the treasures’ attacks and absorb or evade them to allow a chance to snatch them away.

A dazzling brilliance burst forth, blinding all who saw it, with violent energy exploding in an instant.

Six muffled groans sounded simultaneously. Amidst the radiance, intricate mysterious patterns flowed.

Whoosh—two treasures left untouched dropped beside them. The six men watched eagerly but dared not act rashly. Even Yang Kai hesitated to trigger the restrictions within a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure lightly.

As the six observed, a tall figure below rushed toward one of the two unattended treasures. This person appeared to have ascended just after the brothers moved.

Upon recognizing him, Yang Kang cursed, “Damn, Liu Qingyao!”

The newcomer was the First Young Master of Zhongdu. Like the Yang brothers, he had remained inactive until the Mystery-Grade treasures appeared. Now he moved, aiming at one of the treasures the Yang family also had their eyes on.

“Courting death!” Yang Shen coldly snorted. The restrictions in a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure were no trivial matter. Liu Qingyao, despite his skill, was only a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivator. A hit would be fatal or at least grievous.

Yet Liu Qingyao showed no sign of panic. He surged his True Yuan fiercely, activating the piece of clothing he wore.

The garment shimmered to life, depicting a great river and a crescent moon with fish swimming vividly within the flowing water. The river waters surged, waves rolled, and water swept over stones, forming an impenetrable first-stage water curtain that enveloped Liu Qingyao’s body.

The crescent moon suddenly burst forth with thousands of gleams of rosy light, each one striking toward the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure.  
The seemingly insignificant fish suddenly twisted and transformed into a Jiao, its blood-red maw gaping wide, its aura surging to the heavens.

“Water Moon Azure Wave Armor!” Yang Zhao exclaimed, clearly recognizing the armor.

Yang Kai frowned. Though he had never heard of Water Moon Azure Wave Armor, it must be the reason Liu Qingyao dared to risk taking on a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure alone.

This piece of armor was formidable both offensively and defensively, undoubtedly a Mystery-Grade artifact!

Liu Qingyao was the First Young Master of Zhongdu, born into the Liu Family. It was reasonable for him to have a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure at his side.

In a flash, the Jiao and thousands of rays struck the treasure, triggering its restrictions. Countless golden lights flashed out, quickly overwhelming the rosy beams.

The Jiao struggled but could not withstand the golden radiance and dispersed.

Taking advantage of this, Liu Qingyao grabbed the treasure. Countless golden lights struck him, causing the water curtain around him to ripple fiercely.

Yang Kang and the others inwardly shuddered, wishing Liu Qingyao would be wiped out outright.

To their disappointment, when the golden glow completely subsided, it had no effect on Liu Qingyao. He calmly held the treasure without releasing it.

Just as everyone thought he had succeeded, Liu Qingyao’s expression changed abruptly; his eyes snapped wide open.

From the treasure burst forth blue energies, twisting like ribbons that coiled around Liu Qingyao several times. These energies were extraordinarily strange, impossible to evade, and even the Water Moon Azure Wave Armor could not block them.

“Block!” Liu Qingyao shouted furiously. The water curtain expanded fiercely, finally slowing the blue energies’ wrapping.

The six Yang brothers watched the sudden turn of events, each filled with suspicion and doubt.

But Yang Wei quickly caught on, his face darkening; he shouted to the Blood Servants who were still defending against treasure attacks, “Fall back quickly!”

His shout came too late. Liu Qingyao had relied on his treasure to fend off the attacks and seize the item. The six Blood Servants surely could not succeed when their targets were more fortified.

They lacked Mystery-Grade treasures but had supreme cultivation and strength.

The six Blood Servants had each already seized the treasure their master desired. As Yang Wei shouted, six of the treasures emitted blue energies that began binding the Blood Servants.

Seeing the blue energy, the Blood Servants’ expressions changed sharply, evidently understanding what these were. Without hesitation, they scattered in all directions.

But the blue energies pursued relentlessly, even faster than their speed.

None escaped; all were tightly bound.

Unlike ordinary ropes, these blue energies fused into the Blood Servants’ bodies after binding them, vanishing without affecting their freedom or movement.

From a distance, the six Blood Servants looked at each other, all wearing sullen expressions.

“We’re caught!” Tu Feng muttered gloomily.

Others gnashed their teeth, cursing, “Too vicious!”

Ying Jiu remained silent, quickly hurrying to Yang Kai’s side and placing the mirror-shaped treasure in his hands, then flying down without looking back.

Yang Kai frowned at him. Though he saw no injury, Ying Jiu was unlike his usual self now—like a tiger stripped of its teeth, utterly harmless.

Not only Ying Jiu but the other Blood Servants too handed treasures to their masters and immediately withdrew.

“What is happening?” Yang Kang shouted, holding a circular treasure, clearly bewildered.

“Eldest Brother, if it’s convenient, could you explain it to us?” Yang Zhao asked Yang Wei with a faint smile.
