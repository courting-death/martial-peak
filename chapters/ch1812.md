## Chapter 1812 — Is Purple Star’s Young Master So Special

Zi Donglai's gaze had gone utterly blank.

He stared blankly at the scene before him — at Yang Kai, brimming with vigor as he unleashed one deadly move after another, and at Kong Fa, scrambling in distress and utterly miserable. In that instant, he simply could not accept what he was seeing.

In a head-on battle, Yang Kai was actually suppressing Kong Fa completely!

They had only exchanged blows for thirty breaths of time, and Kong Fa was already reduced to merely defending, utterly unable to counterattack.

He could see that Kong Fa's movements were stiff and his Saint Yuan ran poorly — clearly the result of being suppressed by Yang Kai's Domain — so although they were both at the peak of the First Stage of the Void King Realm, inside Yang Kai's Domain, the balance had tipped; Kong Fa was no match at all, and his defeat and death were only a matter of time.

At that thought, Zi Donglai's heart gave a jolt; he suddenly felt that something was very wrong.

Xu Wei was already dead; if Kong Fa died as well, Yang Kai's next target would be himself.

Neither of the two Void King Realm masters could stand against Yang Kai — how could someone like him, merely at the Origin Returning Realm, possibly resist?

At the same time, his father was being entangled by that eerie, ghostly figure, looking as though he could barely fend for himself.

What to do, what to do? Zi Donglai looked bewildered, completely at a loss over how to handle this thorny situation.

Just then, another figure stepped out of the vortex where Yang Kai had just appeared; the moment the man emerged he began shouting and crying, "Young hero, wait for me! I can't find my bearings… Huh? I'm out? Ha ha ha — I, Lü Guichen, am finally free! I no longer have to stay in that damned place!"

The man still seemed not to have fully grasped the situation; the instant he appeared from the vortex he laughed maniacally, acting as if nobody else existed.

Who was this guy? Where had he popped up from? Zi Donglai looked at the suddenly appearing Lü Guichen in astonishment, vaguely feeling the other was familiar, yet he could not recall where he had seen him before.

"Enough — capture him first. If he's with that bastard, he's surely one of his people!" Zi Donglai's thought flashed, and his body flickered to Lü Guichen's front, grabbing him by the throat. He said coldly, "Don't move. Try anything and I'll take your life!"

Lü Guichen was startled out of his wits, cold sweat pouring down his body. He didn’t dare make the slightest move and nodded repeatedly, “I won’t move, I won’t move! My friend, there’s no need for violence — we can talk this out…”

Saying this, Lü Guichen glanced toward Zi Donglai.

In that instant Lü Guichen's eyes suddenly burst with joy and he cried out, "Young Master? You are the Young Master?"

"You called me Young Master?" Zi Donglai was stunned. "Who are you?"

"Young Master!" Lü Guichen fell to his knees in the void with a thud, clasping Zi Donglai's thigh like he had seen a kin, tears and snot flowing in a great mess. "Young Master — your subordinate Lü Guichen! I am Lü Guichen of Zisha Star. Decades ago I was fortunate to see you once and even received a word of guidance from you; Young Master, have you forgotten?"

"Lü Guichen?" Zi Donglai frowned; the name felt familiar but he couldn't recall it immediately. Seeing the other's genuine joy, he did not suspect deceit. He pondered briefly, then suddenly realized, "You're of the Lü Family — a descendant of Lü Li?"

"Yes, yes, that's me!" Lü Guichen rejoiced when Zi Donglai finally remembered him. "I thought I'd never see anyone from our Purple Star again; I never imagined that as soon as I'm freed I would behold the Young Master's face. I am truly fortunate for three lifetimes."

"So it's you." Zi Donglai then confirmed that the man really was one of his Purple Star people. His expression cleared slightly as he nodded, "Stand and speak. Weren't you dead for decades? How did you come out of that place?"

"Waa…" Lü Guichen, an old man, wept copiously, tears streaming. "This matter… it's a long story!"

"Make it short." Zi Donglai was anxious about how to handle the current situation and had no patience for rambling.

"It's like this…" Lü Guichen hurriedly summarized the important points.

"I see." After listening, Zi Donglai nodded. "You've suffered these decades."

"Not suffering, not suffering — being able to see the Young Master again makes it all worthwhile." Lü Guichen forced a smile, speaking as if he had endured decades of hardship only to perform some great service.

Zi Donglai was furious but had no time to bother with him — the other’s strength was merely at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm and utterly useless in this battle.

“Right, Young Master — the origin power of that continent was refined by a young man. If we could capture him…”

"What?" Zi Donglai's face changed. "That fellow refined the origin of an entire continent?"

"Yes… although I did not see it with my own eyes, it should be true. He—this youth…" Lü Guichen's eyes swept and he immediately saw Yang Kai fighting Kong Fa, pointing in that direction.

As he spoke, his mouth suddenly gaped open…

Because he saw Kong Fa desperately holding on beneath Yang Kai, his body bathed in blood.

Dozens of Golden Blood Threads danced around Yang Kai; those threads moved like living things, darting through the void and repeatedly inflicting harm on Kong Fa.

"Stop, young friend! I yield — spare my life!" Kong Fa's face had gone ashen; while laboring to fend off the Golden Blood Threads' assaults, he cried out loudly.

"If yielding helped, why bother cultivating?" Yang Kai remained unmoved and swept his hand forward, "Moon Blade!"

Hiss…

A Moon Blade a full one zhang long suddenly took form and slashed vertically toward Kong Fa.

Kong Fa's face went pale; his hand formed endless seals as brilliant light appeared upon him, and an ancient-bell-shaped Secret Treasure flew out and turned into a bell-shaped light screen to envelop him.

Boom…

The bell rang loudly; the sound waves roiled, turning into formless force that struck the Sea of Consciousness.

The Moon Blade struck the light screen but could not fully break it, penetrating less than three inches before being halted.

Seeing this, Kong Fa breathed a quiet sigh; this Huangming Bell had been obtained in earlier trials and was a Void King-Grade defensive Secret Treasure, extremely sturdy and not something ordinary fighters could break.

With the Huangming Bell protecting him, Kong Fa could tangle with ordinary Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts.

Seeing Yang Kai's attack fail, Kong Fa's confidence rose a little as he snorted, "You insist on finishing me off? We met by fate — leave me a way out so we may meet again in the future."

"Nonsense!" Yang Kai's expression did not change; he swung his hands repeatedly. "You think a turtle shell will keep you safe? I'll smash your turtle shell!"

Hiss hiss hiss hiss…

A dozen or so enormous Moon Blades swept at Kong Fa one after another. Kong Fa's face changed drastically; terror and despair filled his eyes as he poured all his Saint Yuan into the Huangming Bell.

The bell's ringing grew louder and the bell-shaped light screen brightened markedly.

Boom boom boom boom…

Moon Blade after Moon Blade struck the Huangming Bell's defense, rattling the light screen until it shook and seemed on the verge of shattering.

Crack…

At last a deathly sound entered Kong Fa's ears; he shivered violently, widening his eyes to look ahead and saw a crack appear in his Huangming Bell's protective light screen.

The fissure spread outward at great speed; in the blink of an eye the screen was riddled with holes.

With a crash, the Huangming Bell's defense finally broke.

"Spare me, young friend!" Kong Fa went pale and shouted.

"Die!" Yang Kai's face turned cold. Dozens of Golden Blood Threads condensed into a golden long sword that followed the Moon Blades; with a slight flick it flashed and was gone.

The next moment Kong Fa's body stiffened where he stood.

He bowed his head to look at his chest and saw a bloody hole; through that hole he could see his shattered heart.

Vitality quickly drained; everything before his eyes went black.

"Unbelievable… I actually…"

Kong Fa's words cut off as he completely lost his breath.

Yang Kai reached out, summoned up the Huangming Bell into his hand, and without a glance threw it into his Spatial Ring; he also took Kong Fa's Spatial Ring.

"You're next!" Yang Kai abruptly turned, his gaze coldly fixed on the shocked Zi Donglai, and with a light wave of his hand a burst of force surged toward Zi Donglai.

Zi Donglai was horrified; although Yang Kai's strike seemed casual, he knew it could not be easily stopped — after all, it was an attack from a Void King Realm expert.

In desperation, without thinking, he grabbed Lü Guichen by the throat and violently hurled him forward.

"Young Master, you…" Lü Guichen was still intoxicated with the joy of seeing Zi Donglai again and had not imagined such a thing. Before he could react he was already in midair.

A gust hit him; Lü Guichen did not utter a sound as his entire body exploded into a cloud of blood mist.

"This brat is ruthless." Yang Kai sneered at Zi Donglai with a face full of mockery.

He was also surprised that Zi Donglai would do such a thing to interrupt his attack.

This Purple Star Young Master was rotten to the bone.

He had not killed Lü Guichen on the Floating Continent, nor had he prevented him from following him out of the Floating Continent through the spatial corridor, mainly because Lü Guichen had given him a bit of useful information earlier.

He neither deliberately helped nor targeted him; Lü Guichen's fate was up to himself.

How laughable — after finally escaping from the Floating Continent, this man was actually tricked by his own Young Master. Even in the Underworld, he’d probably remain with his eyes open, unwilling to rest.

"But you still have to die!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

"What do you intend?" Zi Donglai's face went pale as he shouted with a fierce but hollow voice, "You brat, don't think that because you've ascended to the Void King Realm you can do as you please. I am the Purple Star's Young Master — you cannot kill me!"

“Is Purple Star’s Young Master so special? Does your family tell you he’s someone who cannot be killed? Idiot — I truly don’t know how you’ve managed to live this long,” Yang Kai spat disdainfully.

"You really intend to kill me?" Zi Donglai was utterly shocked, now certain Yang Kai was not bluffing. "Do you know what will happen if you kill me? The Purple Star will never let it go. Even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you will never live in peace!"
