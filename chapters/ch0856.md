## Chapter 856 — Troublesome

After meeting Wu Jie, Yang Kai confirmed the suspicion that had been gnawing at him: these people had come to the Endless Snow Mountain specifically for the Coffin-Bearer.

The snow mountains stretched boundless and vast, yet there were already thousands of martial practitioners searching—no doubt it would take them only a short time to find where the Coffin-Bearer was hiding.

Yang Kai felt a restless agitation. His alchemy still lacked just a little refinement; had that not been the case, he would have gone to find the Coffin-Bearer at once and entered the Small Xuan Realm hidden within that Blood Coffin treasure.

What troubled him more was the formidable mysterious figure Wu Jie had mentioned—an enormous variable. From the wary tone in Wu Jie's words, Yang Kai could infer that this stranger was a top-tier expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

There truly weren't many people in the world who had reached that level of power.

Who could it be?

Yang Kai racked his brain in puzzlement.

"Saint Lord?" Wu Jie, noticing Yang Kai's reverie and prolonged silence, couldn't help calling softly.

Yang Kai came back to himself and was about to speak, but his expression suddenly went cold as he appraised Wu Jie up and down with a meaningfully sharp gaze, then let out a strange chuckle.

"What's wrong?" Wu Jie frowned, puzzled by Yang Kai's sudden change in attitude and the odd way he was looking at him.

"Wu Jie, I remember you said your Netherworld Sect makes a living collecting money and helping people avert disasters, right?"

"Indeed—this has always been the foundation of my sect!" Wu Jie nodded earnestly. "That's why over the years we were able to remit enough supplies to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and grow the sect."

"Then…how much were you paid?" Yang Kai's face darkened and he snapped, "You even sold someone out—you're bold!"

Wu Jie started and involuntarily took a few steps back. He asked suspiciously, "What do you mean by that?"

Yang Kai stared at him intently, and his Divine Sense suddenly flared, plunging into Wu Jie's mind. Wu Jie's complexion changed dramatically; only when he sensed no murderous intent did he relax somewhat.

After a long moment, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense and nodded coolly, "Looks like you knew nothing about it…"

"You mean…" Wu Jie finally caught on. His ghostly eyes swept around, and after a moment he emitted a wheezy laugh, but a deep unease crept into his gaze as he stealthily drew closer to Yang Kai.

"Come out! What's the point of hiding with half your head showing?" Yang Kai suddenly called in a low, commanding voice.

"Impressive! You can see through their ruse—no wonder you’re someone my lord took a liking to. Isn’t that so… Saint Lord?" With a derisive laugh, shadows rippled around them and several figures suddenly and eerily materialized, encircling Yang Kai and Wu Jie.

At the sound, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and he looked over, his gaze fixing on a handsome middle-aged man. Yang Kai couldn't help but exclaim in disbelief, "Yu Mo?"

The speaker was no stranger but a strong expert Yang Kai recognized.

Yu Mo was the Demon Domain's Sand City's demon expert at the First Stage of the Saint Realm.

Beside Yu Mo stood a man in a black cloak, wrapped in darkness, his aura plain and seemingly that of an ordinary person—yet he exerted tremendous pressure on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn't even glance at the other manifested experts.

"Boy, it's been years—you're much stronger now!" Yu Mo smiled leisurely, an expression that suggested he had Yang Kai well and truly in his grasp.

Yang Kai shot him a look, then turned his gaze back to the cloaked figure and gave a wry smile: "Since you're here, Yu Mo, then Lady Xueli must have graced us with her presence as well?"

The cloaked figure chuckled like a silver bell. Upon hearing that voice, the nearby experts were suddenly stunned—none of them had expected that the supremely powerful mysterious figure would be a woman.

The hat covering her head was lifted, revealing an exquisitely beautiful face.

Zhang Ao of Poxuan Palace and Cao Guan of the War Soul Hall, among others, went slack-jawed when they saw her face, evidently captivated as if their minds had been snatched away by her beauty.

In truth, though Xueli's looks were far from mediocre, they were not the absolute pinnacle of beauty; it was her high status and overwhelming power that gave her an astonishingly magnetic aura.

"Hmph!" Yu Mo snorted in displeasure.

Only then did Zhang Ao and the others come to their senses and hurriedly avert their gazes, anxiety prickling in their chests.

"Boy, you made yourself easy to find!" Xueli sneered lightly. "You escaped from Sand City years ago—three years have passed—and I've never had anyone consume so much of my time."

"Then I must be honored indeed." Yang Kai laughed lightly, utterly calm and unafraid.

"Lady Xueli?" Wu Jie murmured. Yang Kai's address of the cloaked woman made him think, and after a moment his body trembled as he blurted, "Demon General Xueli?"

Only then did he finally grasp who the mysterious visitor really was.

Instantly, a chill rippled through the group, and a wave of cold rose from their hearts.

In the Demon Domain, under the Demon Lord, there were four great Demon Generals—each a top-tier expert—and Xueli was one of them.

Wu Jie had never imagined such a figure would penetrate human territory and even have Zhang Ao and the others acting at her behest.

Her obvious target was Yang Kai!

What about this young Saint Lord could make her care so much?

The name Demon General Xueli sent Zhang Ao and the others' eyes wide as they stared at her, clearly trying to confirm if it were true.

Xueli ignored them, her burning eyes fixed on Yang Kai with a possessive, greedy hunger.

"A Demon General dares to show up here—aren't you afraid of being attacked by human experts? You're not exactly welcome in these parts," Yang Kai said with a thin laugh.

He was inwardly vexed as well.

Earlier, when Wu Jie described the strange nature of this mysterious figure, Yang Kai had been guessing at who it might be.

He had thought it could be Demon General Gou Chi.

Though he had never met Gou Chi, that general had tried multiple times to kill him; sending assassins here wouldn't have been surprising.

It might even be Demon General Meng Ge.

After all, when Yang Kai was very weak he had used the Locking Demon Chain to kill an incarnation of Meng Ge's soul—Meng Ge should remember his aura.

He had never expected the visitor to be Xueli.

Yang Kai felt he bore her no great hatred; although he had fled Sand City years ago, he had done nothing to damage her interests or prestige—there was no reason for her to have hunted him for three years, was there?

And yet she had come personally.

Hearing Yang Kai, Xueli laughed softly. "If I were afraid, I wouldn't have come. There are many human experts, but who would stand up for you?"

"Lady Xueli is truly skilled and bold," Yang Kai snorted.

"But…I'm a little surprised. Growth in strength is expected, but how did you discover I had arrived? At your current cultivation you shouldn't have been able to sense it."

Wu Jie looked at Yang Kai with curiosity. What had just occurred had been too sudden—he had no idea anyone had followed him. If Yang Kai hadn't abruptly changed his attitude, he would have remained in the dark.

"Liu Gui is dead," Yang Kai said coldly. "He was the pawn I planted among you. When he died, I naturally became alert."

"I see!" Xueli slightly nodded, thinking that it must have been the Divine Roaming Realm youth they had killed earlier who had exposed their presence.

"Saint Lord…this is troublesome." Standing with Yang Kai, Wu Jie peered around nervously and whispered.

"It is troublesome!" Yang Kai frowned. "Had I known Xueli was here, I wouldn't have summoned you—my mistake."

He had thought only Zhang Ao and the others were present; he had not expected a top expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to be here as well.

If Wu Jie had tried to conceal his approach from her perception, he would inevitably have revealed many flaws.

"Wu Jie, I'm disappointed—you've been conspiring with this brat all along!" Zhang Ao suddenly shouted. "No wonder you weren't motivated two years ago."

"It seems Brother Wu's Netherworld Sect no longer intends to stake a claim in this realm," Cao Guan sneered sarcastically.

"Are you trying to threaten me?" Wu Jie looked at them coldly.

"So what if we are?" Zhang Ao snorted. "There's still time to backtrack. In consideration of our long acquaintance, if you hand this brat over now we won't make things hard for you."

Yang Kai glanced at Wu Jie with guarded intent, and Wu Jie laughed loudly: "Are you all out of your minds? You didn't know this person's true identity—fine. But now that you know she is Demon General Xueli, you would still risk your lives for her? Have you lost your heads?"

"We're already trapped—if it comes down to it, we'll just relocate to the Demon Domain!" Zhang Ao barked, adopting a 'damned if we do' attitude, then ingratiatingly looked to Xueli: "We only wonder whether you would accept us."

"Willing, of course. Near Sand City I have some spare territory—vast stretches, tens of thousands of miles. If you want it, it's yours. I enjoy watching you humans tear each other apart," Xueli chuckled.

"Tens of thousands of miles…" Zhang Ao and Cao Guan's eyes lit up with greed.

To hold such territory would greatly benefit a sect's development.

Seeing their expressions, Yang Kai couldn't help but smile.

Those two idiots had no idea about the land near Sand City—Xueli's so-called territory was clearly the Sand Sea! If Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others were thrown there, few would remain alive for long; laughable that they looked so pleased.
