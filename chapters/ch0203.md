## Chapter 203 â€” Return to Lingxiao

She was like a celestial pearl bathed in dew, her demeanor increasingly ethereal and transcendent, pure and untainted, as flawless as white jade. Anyone in her presence would involuntarily feel a sense of humility and self-reproach. With an icy clarity and a beauty that could topple cities, her skin was as white as snow, delicate enough to break with a touch. She resembled a fairy descended to the mortal realm, exuding an aura of holiness and an unapproachable nobility.

Although he had once possessed her and had been reckless with her, upon this meeting, Yang Kai still felt a vague sense of unreality.

Su Yan's nobility and icy purity had evidently no effect on Yang Kai.

The long-suppressed desires surged within him, and taking two steps forward, Yang Kai unceremoniously wrapped his arms around Su Yan's slender waist and leaned down to kiss her.

Su Yan, flustered, raised her hand to block him, her voice like a mosquito's buzz: "Let's go down!"

As soon as the words left her mouth, Yang Kai leaped down, plunging toward the Dragon Confinement Ravine with utmost decisiveness.

Falling a hundred zhang, the Wings of Yang Flame behind him unfurled with a whoosh, soaring gracefully into the cave he had crafted.

Su Yan's beautiful eyes sparkled with surprise as she gazed at the wings on Yang Kai's back.

Once inside the cave, he retracted his wings and casually tossed the two large bundles he was carrying onto the ground. Yang Kai then swept Su Yan off her feet, a meaningful smile playing on his lips as he walked step by step toward the stone bed.

Su Yan's heart raced like a startled deer, pounding wildly. Although she had experienced such moments twice before, recalling them now still made her feel unbearably shy, causing her to bury her head in Yang Kai's embrace.

Arriving at the stone bed, he gently set her down.

Su Yan boldly lifted her head to look at Yang Kai, her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue.

As they kissed, their breaths grew heavier, one body burning with heat, the other icy as frost, both filled with an insatiable longing for each other.

A soft sound echoed as Yang Kai suppressed his frenzied desires and gently unfastened Su Yan's buttons, revealing her porcelain-like skin.

Clothes flew about, hair became disheveled. Yang Kai rolled over and pressed down on her.

In the midst of passion, Su Yan gasped repeatedly, her body softening like mud, while Yang Kai grew more vigorous, like a knight charging forward with a raised lance, brimming with boundless energy and spirit, crashing into her relentlessly.

Even as Su Yan activated the Ice Heart Technique, she could not suppress the shyness swelling within her. Her skin glowed with a rosy sheen, her hair in disarray, fragrant sweat glistening on her body.

"Is this... is this okay?" Su Yan bit her lip, suppressing her shyness as she complied with Yang Kai's wishes, assuming a posture on the stone bed that left her feeling somewhat embarrassed.

"Very good!" Yang Kai nodded vigorously, his fingers moving eagerly.

That night, returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai and Su Yan indulged in playful antics until dawn.

Recalling the carved murals he had seen in the Thousand Gold Tavern in Haicheng, Yang Kai put these into action, exploring and practicing, relishing every moment, becoming increasingly spirited.

Su Yan had no idea that the matters between men and women could possess so many variations, so many changes, akin to a miraculous martial technique. Each transformation brought forth a different sensation and pleasure.

Yet these changes were too overwhelming for her, and Su Yan felt herself on the verge of being unable to cope.

After countless variations, Yang Kai discovered that his favorite position was one he had inadvertently explored in the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

He positioned Su Yan with her back to him.

In the throes of passion, the vivid Ice Phoenix pattern on Su Yan's back seemed to come alive, soaring across her delicate, fair skin.

Gazing at the Ice Phoenix pattern, at her smooth back like exquisite silk and her slender waist, Yang Kai felt an inexplicable excitement and impulse.

He knew that since Su Yan bore this Ice Phoenix pattern, he must have a Fire Dragon pattern on his own back, inherited from the roots of the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

After their passionate encounter, the two began their dual cultivation.

Their bodies intertwined closely. Practicing the Dual Cultivation Technique, they spent a full day together. Both Yang Kai and Su Yan felt their strength had improved slightly, though not by much; the greatest benefit was that their Yuan Qi had become purer.

The Dual Cultivation Technique allowed their Yuan Qi to merge and refine, and with each session, their internal Yuan Qi would only become more condensed.

After their dual cultivation, Yang Kai could not resist the temptation and indulged in Su Yan once more...

As he gently helped her dress, Su Yan's beautiful eyes glimmered with a hint of springtime affection and satisfaction. She was somewhat frightened; Yang Kai now resembled an unyielding battle machine, his ferocious assaults leaving her weak and sore time and again. 

She feared that if she did not help him put on his clothes, she would never escape his clutches.

Once dressed, the two embraced and lay on the stone bed.

There was no need to express their feelings; they could both sense each other's thoughts.

"By the way, your speculation has come true," Su Yan suddenly spoke while lying in Yang Kai's arms.

"What speculation?" Yang Kai played with a strand of her hair, enjoying the tranquility after the storm.

"A few months ago, didn't you say that the appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave might have far-reaching implications?"

"Did outsiders come?" Yang Kai's expression turned serious.

"Yes, the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu did not send anyone, but many clans and sects heard about the Inheritance Celestial Cave's appearance and sent numerous experts. Currently, they are trying to recruit disciples who have entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave from the three factions. Whether it be Lingxiao Pavilion, Blood Battle Gang, or Fengyu Tower, many disciples have been lured away during this time."

"What kind of people came to Lingxiao Pavilion?" Yang Kai asked, feeling somewhat relieved. No wonder he had sensed many Divine Senses sweeping over him when he returned to the sect that night; it turned out to be those experts from the clans and major powers.

"The Dong Family from Xuanzhou, the Bai Family from Yunzhao, and the Zhiwei Valley from Quanzhou, along with many others, are secretly lurking in Wumei Town."

The Dong Family? Yang Kai's heart stirred.

"What conditions did they offer you?" Yang Kai inquired. As the top young disciple among the three factions, Su Yan was the most likely to have obtained the inheritance from the Inheritance Celestial Cave, so those three major powers would surely want to recruit her, and their offer would not be low.

"Within two years, help me advance to the Divine Roaming Realm, and I can take any elixirs and secret treasures from their family, with a status equal to that of an elder!" 

"What a grand gesture!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly. "What are their demands?"

"To marry into their family!"

"Just as I thought..."

"I won't agree to that." Su Yan nudged Yang Kai playfully, "Although they suspect I obtained the inheritance, they have no solid evidence. So they haven't been too excessive, but have been staying in Lingxiao Pavilion all this time."

"All the young masters from those three powers have come, right?" Yang Kai sneered. To pursue a beauty, naturally, the young masters had to make their move to win her favor, but these people were clearly miscalculating. Not to mention that Su Yan was already his, their relationship was inseparable. Even without these entanglements, Su Yan's character would never agree to such a thing.

With the Ice Heart Technique, she would not be swayed by such trivial matters.

"Yes." Su Yan nodded slightly, reaching out to caress Yang Kai's cheek. "You don't need to worry; I am only yours."

"I'm not worried," Yang Kai grinned. "If they can move you, they can just go ahead and try."

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai frowned and said, "But it's still quite unpleasant. Damn it, how dare they have their eyes on my woman!"

Su Yan smiled sweetly, feeling a wave of happiness rise within her.

Even someone as indifferent as she was, seeing Yang Kai get jealous made her feel a surge of bliss.

After dawn, Su Yan left.

Yang Kai began to organize the things he had acquired during this period, glancing around his cave and was secretly astonished to find that it had changed dramatically.

When he left, it had merely been a cold, dim stone cave, but now it resembled a new home, complete with tables and chairs, numerous potted plants, and various decorations hanging on the walls.

Even the stone bed had warm and comfortable bedding, which he had not noticed during his playful antics with Su Yan.

These... must be the result of Xia Ningshang and Su Yan working together to renovate.

The renovations were quite good.

As he approached the cave entrance, he noticed a Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng drooping its head, looking dispirited, its features scrunched up as if it were sulking.

When Yang Kai returned that night, this sentient Spiritual Herb had greeted him but received no response, leaving it dejected until now.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng had been well taken care of; the abundant Yang energy in this place meant Su Yan only needed to come down every few days to provide it with some Yuan Qi.

Yang Kai chuckled, squatting down to feed it two drops of Yang Liquid, instantly brightening the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng's mood.

Sitting cross-legged beside the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, he focused his mind, and the Wordless Black Book appeared in his hand.

During these days, every time he advanced, whether it was a Stage or a Realm, Yang Kai would check the Wordless Black Book, hoping to glean some secrets from it.

But each time, he came with excitement and left disappointed. After so many attempts, Yang Kai had lost some of his initial enthusiasm.

The black book had already provided him with significant help; even if he could no longer gain anything from it in the future, Yang Kai had the confidence to grow on his own. Thinking this way, his mindset improved considerably. Relying on others was not as good as relying on oneself; no matter how good the black book was, if he did not put in the effort, it would be useless.

This time, he habitually began to explore, not expecting to gain anything. He casually flipped to the fifth page and infused it with Yuan Qi.

Unlike previous attempts that had sunk into silence, this time the black book actually responded.

"Eh?" Yang Kai's expression brightened, his eyes widening as he gazed into the black book while continuing to pour in his Yuan Qi.

Layers of ripples spread outward, and soon, golden light emerged from the black book. However, unlike before, this golden light did not burst forth from the book but connected together, densely packed, resembling a complex formation.

Before long, a line of large characters appeared.

Yao Wang Valley, Wan Yao Pool!

Moments later, this line of characters faded, and the golden light on the black book gradually disappeared.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows. This time was different from before; the black book had not given him anything but rather the name of a place.
