## Chapter 1479 — Heaven-Defying Spiritual Pill

Fortunately the problem was not severe; Yang Kai spent half a month sorting it out.

Next he naturally set about taking inventory of the gains from the Imperial Garden trip.

Thinking this, Yang Kai reached into his Spatial Ring and with a sweep of his hand a flash of light passed and a pile of medicinal materials immediately appeared before him. These ingredients were of course those gathered together with the people from Ice Heart Valley in that hidden valley.

At the time Yang Kai had no time to deal with them, so he had casually placed them into the Spatial Ring; now that he had free time he meant to arrange them properly, otherwise left like this their efficacy would certainly dissipate considerably.

As an alchemist, Yang Kai naturally knew how to properly preserve Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine. He took out boxes made of different materials from the Spatial Ring and carefully stored the herbs according to their properties—those suited to jade preservation were placed in jade boxes, those suited to wood in wooden boxes. There are many intricacies to preserving medicinal materials, but these posed no difficulty for Yang Kai.

After a round of busy work it was soon finished; Yang Kai smiled faintly as he put each box away.

These were several hundred specimens of fully matured Spiritual Herbs; their grades varied, but each one was priceless—after all these Spiritual Herbs and Medicines had existed in that hidden valley for tens of thousands of years, and all could be called ten-thousand-year Spiritual Medicine.

Spiritual Pills refined from such Spiritual Herbs and Medicines were far superior in efficacy to those made from ordinary herbs, and they would greatly aid Yang Kai in sharpening his own alchemical craft.

Coupled with the ingredients he had collected when he first entered the Star Domain from the Floating Continent, Yang Kai felt that before he advanced to Void King-Grade as an alchemist he would absolutely not lack materials; even after reaching the Void King Realm there were still many Void King-Grade ingredients to practise on.

Next Yang Kai took out an alchemical furnace, likewise discovered in that hidden valley.

It was the very furnace the valley's owner had used in life, of Void King-Grade quality—rare and extremely precious.

Yang Kai already had two such furnaces. One was a Void King-Grade refining furnace inhabited by the artifact spirit of a Fire Bird; the other was the alchemical furnace before him, but in any case neither was something one could easily encounter.

If an artificer or an alchemist had a good furnace, they could save a great deal of time when refining and could produce superior Secret Treasures and Pills; as the saying goes, if one wishes to do a good job one must first sharpen one's tools—this is the principle.

Unfortunately refining furnaces and alchemical furnaces are harder to make than ordinary Secret Treasures, so furnaces of the same rank are far rarer and more valuable than Secret Treasures.

The young woman in the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm from Ice Heart Valley also knew the furnace's value, but because of many thoughts and concerns she handed the furnace to Yang Kai in exchange for a greater distribution of Pills.

That choice was not a loss for her, but it was a windfall for Yang Kai.

Pills are something Yang Kai could refine himself later; even pills born with special features would not be difficult for him, but a Void King-Grade alchemical furnace was extremely hard to come by.

The furnace stood about half a person high, its texture ancient. A lonely aura spread from it; the whole vessel was purple, and on the body of the cauldron there were two large characters which Yang Kai had not examined closely at the time—now, looking, he clearly discovered those two characters to be Purple Void.

This was evidently the furnace's name.

Purple Void Cauldron — not a bad name at all.

With this furnace's assistance, refining Pills in the future would become easier and their quality higher.

Furnaces differ from Secret Treasures in that they do not require vast amounts of time to temper; one only needs to stamp one's own mark within the furnace. However, because this Purple Void Cauldron had a previous owner, Yang Kai had to first erase the former owner's imprint before he could rebrand it with his own.

This was not difficult. The hidden valley's owner had been dead for who knew how many tens of thousands of years, and the imprint left behind was extremely weak. Yang Kai erased it without effort, then spent several days and imprinted his own mark, successfully claiming the Purple Void Cauldron as his.

Fondling it with pleasure for a while, Yang Kai put it away; it was not yet time to refine Pills, so there was no need to use it.

Immediately Yang Kai took out another item.

It was a Spiritual Pill! Not one of the Pills he and the Ice Heart Valley young woman had divided, but one Yang Kai had scooped out from the Purple Void Cauldron.

When Yang Kai first found the Purple Void Cauldron he had swept its interior with his Divine Sense and detected a pill inside, and judging from the posture preserved by the skeleton at death, it should have been the last pill the valley's owner had exhausted himself to concoct.

Fortunately it had succeeded.

But Yang Kai had no time to examine it carefully then—the Ice Heart Valley young woman had rushed into the cavern—so Yang Kai had swiftly put this pill away, not knowing whether it was still usable.

If it were an ordinary pill, regardless of quality, after tens of thousands of years its medicinal efficacy would certainly have dissipated, rendering it useless—merely a waste pill.

Only Spiritual Pills that bore Pill Patterns could maintain their potency intact; Pill Patterns act like a shackle, locking the pill's medicinal nature so it does not fade.

The Spiritual Pills Yang Kai and the Ice Heart Valley young woman had divided in the cavern were all born with Pill Patterns—rarities; the other waste pills had been discarded.

As for whether the pill from the Purple Void Cauldron bore Pill Patterns, Yang Kai could not be certain, but that did not stop him from hoping—after all, it was a Spiritual Pill the master alchemist had burned his last life force to forge.

Yet at this moment, as Yang Kai gazed at the Spiritual Pill in his hand his expression changed, then he showed both astonishment and ecstatic joy, exclaiming, "Pill Cloud?"

He had never expected that the Spiritual Pill he had scooped from the Purple Void Cauldron would actually have sprouted a Pill Cloud!

The surface of the Spiritual Pill was wrapped in mist, as if a miniature seven‑colored cloud had condensed around it, appearing exquisitely beautiful.

This was undoubtedly a Pill Cloud; Yang Kai stared for a long while before he was certain he was not mistaken.

Yang Kai had seen Spiritual Pills with Pill Clouds before—he had taken one and he had personally refined another.

The one he had taken had caused his Warm Spirit Lotus to evolve to a six‑colored stage and had raised his strength by a notch.

The one he had refined had been used to rescue Xue Yue—the Leaving Flame Pill.

The one he took was found in an ancient ruin beneath the sea on the Tongxuan Continent; the one he refined was an event that occurred on Rainfall Star.

Yang Kai knew better than anyone how difficult it was for a Pill Cloud to appear! This was not something human effort could reliably achieve. Nowadays when he refined pills the chance of producing Pill Patterns was large—around two or three in ten—but over all those years only a single Leaving Flame Pill had ever produced a Pill Cloud.

That had been forged while pushing his own limits, almost to the point of death.

From the Spiritual Pills obtained in the cavern Yang Kai also knew the owner must have been an extraordinary master alchemist in life, otherwise he would not have produced so many pills with Pill Patterns.

He had originally assumed the pill forged in that man's last moments would at least bear Pill Patterns, yet the truth was far more shocking than he had imagined.

It was, astonishingly, a Spiritual Pill born with a Pill Cloud!

And from the medicinal potency and energy fluctuations emanating from within it, it was plainly a Void King-Grade Pill.

That person had been truly formidable; Yang Kai felt secretly stunned.

A single Void King-Grade Pill was already of considerable value, let alone a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill born with a Pill Cloud.

And one that had been tempered by tens of thousands of years of accumulation!

Yang Kai drew a cold breath; such a Spiritual Pill could no longer be judged by ordinary standards. The normally composed Yang Kai found his face twitching and his hand trembling slightly.

As everyone knows, once a Spiritual Pill bears Pill Patterns it can exist indefinitely without decay and its efficacy doubles. If it bears a Pill Cloud, the efficacy doubles again, and over time the Pill Cloud will continue to absorb Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth to nourish the pill, making its potency ever greater.

The longer the time, the greater the efficacy.

The reason the pill Yang Kai had taken then could evolve his Warm Spirit Lotus was precisely because of thousands of years of accumulation and sedimentation, which made its potency terrifying; when he swallowed it he almost burst apart, fortunately the Warm Spirit Lotus absorbed most of the effect.

But compared to the pill now before him, that earlier one was simply incomparable; to say nothing of rank, the accumulation of time alone made that older pill pale in comparison.

What did tens of thousands of years even mean?

Yang Kai suddenly felt his mind reel; that he had the luck to obtain such a heaven‑defying object was almost beyond belief.

Everything taken from that hidden valley paled before this Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill.

After shock and excitement Yang Kai could only smile wryly.

What astonishing medicinal effects might this Spiritual Pill contain? Setting aside its uses, with his current cultivation he could not possibly ingest it.

To swallow it rashly would have only one ending—his body would explode!

Even Void King-Grade experts might be unable to withstand the pill's potency.

With that thought, Yang Kai's excitement gradually calmed; the immediate task was to first figure out what this pill did, at the very least to determine exactly what it was.

Squinting into the Spiritual Pill Yang Kai found its interior surprisingly crystal clear, flowing with a kind of translucent substance, and within it a filament-like thing darted about as if alive.

No way… Yang Kai was stunned.

This Spiritual Pill was actually close to becoming sentient.

That filament-like existence was evidently the result of centuries of accumulation and sedimentation; give the pill a little more time and perhaps it could truly awaken, gaining intelligence and becoming an unconventional being.

Pills becoming sentient was only theoretical, not even a legend; Yang Kai had not expected he would one day witness the correctness of that theory.

Unfortunately, since it had fallen into his hands, someday it would be put to use, and there would be no true chance for it to genuinely awaken.
