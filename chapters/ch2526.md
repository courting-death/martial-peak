## Chapter 2526 — Life Origin Fruit

Ju Tianqing gritted his teeth so hard it seemed they might shatter, his face twisted with fury as he glared at Yang Kai. "Kid, don’t push people too far! Leave some room for others—one day, our paths may cross again."

Seeing this, Zu Hong also snarled, "That's right! Even if you're skilled in space power, you're still just one person. If Brother Ju and I join forces, we might still have a chance. Even if we really can't beat you... don't think we can't self-destruct!"

Yang Kai curled his lip and said, "You make it sound like you even have a chance to self-destruct."

As he spoke, his expression grew solemn. His hands moved rapidly, forming one mysterious seal after another, and a bizarre aura suddenly filled the air.

"Kid, what are you doing?" Ju Tianqing's face changed dramatically, instinctively sensing danger approaching, and he couldn't help but shout in alarm.

Yang Kai's voice was cold: "What am I doing? Obviously, I'm about to unleash my ultimate move and wipe you both out. Let me tell you, once I use this technique, you won't have any chance to fight back—you're doomed. If you really want to self-destruct, you'd better hurry, or you won't get another chance!"

"Hiss..." Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong both sucked in a cold breath, stumbling backward.

Yang Kai spoke with deadly seriousness, his face full of killing intent, and they were terrified. But self-destruction is something no one does unless absolutely desperate; most of the time, it's just talk, meant to intimidate.

They hadn't expected this kid to be completely unmoved, even boasting about unleashing some ultimate move...

But the seals he was forming truly were unfathomable. Even with Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing's sharp eyes, they couldn't see through them. One thing was certain: this move was powerful.

"Brother Zu, let's fight him!" Ju Tianqing gritted his teeth, his face set with determination.

"Alright!" Zu Hong knew there was no way out now. Yang Kai was pressing them relentlessly, clearly intent on killing them. If he and Ju Tianqing kept hesitating, they'd never win; only by fighting to the death did they have a chance at survival.

As they spoke, both men fiercely surged their Emperor Yuan, their auras crackling.

The wound on Ju Tianqing's shoulder, under the force of his power, spurted blood even more violently. Who knows how much he'd lost—his face was as pale as paper.

In a flash, both their auras reached their peak.

From within the Myriad Beasts Seal came countless roars of strange beasts, while the Starfire Burning Sea Blade hummed incessantly, its blade light flickering unpredictably.

Yang Kai's hands suddenly paused, then he slowly pressed forward, his face solemn and dignified. He chanted in a low voice, "The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream!"

Time seemed to freeze in that instant.

Rumble...

The Years Like a Shuttle Seal manifested as a radiant, full sun, completely enveloping Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong. Their eyes widened in shock as visions of time’s passage and the cycles of the world flickered within them. In that instant, it was as if they had lived countless lifetimes.

Their peak auras faded with the passage of time, their skin rapidly aged, their qi and blood weakened, and even their hair turned white.

In just a moment, the two went from their peak to decrepit old men, their eyes lifeless, looking as if they could die at any time.

The Great Emperor of Time's divine ability involves the laws of time. How could the heavily wounded Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong resist? Back when Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he used this move against the Soul Descended Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Now that he's reached the Emperor Realm, his strength was far greater than before.

With one move, the two completely lost the ability to fight.

"Get in here!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, his eyes flashing. As his divine sense swept out, he collected the two powerless men into the Small Xuan Realm.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, the Incarnation had long been waiting impatiently. As soon as Yang Kai threw the two in, it surged its power, reaching out with one hand and roaring viciously, "Heaven Devouring Battle Art!"

The fate awaiting Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing was nothing but being sucked dry and turned into husks.

Time resumed its flow, and the small world returned to tranquility.

Within the medicine garden's barrier, Gao Xueting's beautiful eyes were full of shock, unable to recover for a long time.

Earlier, the Years Like a Shuttle Seal had affected her too, causing a moment of confusion. When she came to, Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing had vanished.

All she saw was Yang Kai turning and flying toward her.

Gao Xueting was dumbfounded, instinctively opening the medicine garden's barrier.

The power of this barrier wasn't complicated to control; otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to hide here so quickly.

"Elder Gao, how are your injuries?" Yang Kai rushed to her side, asking anxiously.

Gao Xueting looked up at him, her pretty face showing a complex expression as she sized him up, as if seeing him anew.

A few years ago, this young man's strength was far below hers, but now, it seemed she truly had to look up to him...

"Elder Gao..." Seeing Gao Xueting silent, Yang Kai couldn't help but call out again.

Gao Xueting finally withdrew her gaze, coughed lightly, and said, "Though it's not light, it's nothing serious. I'll be fine after some rest. What about those two? Did you turn them to dust?"

But even if they were turned to dust, there should be some trace left.

The two seemed to have simply vanished into thin air.

"They're dead." Yang Kai grinned. "No need to worry about them, Elder Gao. Two pieces of trash, not worth pitying."

Gao Xueting finally relaxed, nodding, and sighed, "You've grown a lot—more than anyone expected."

Yang Kai scratched his head, "It's all thanks to the guidance and kindness of my seniors that I've achieved what I have today."

Gao Xueting replied calmly, "You had to work hard yourself too. It doesn't have much to do with others."

As she spoke, she coughed a few more times.

Yang Kai quickly said, "Elder Gao, your recovery is most important. I'll stand guard for you here."

"Alright." Gao Xueting didn't say more, immediately closing her eyes and focusing on her healing.

Earlier, when Yang Kai was fighting Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing, if she had even a bit of strength to use, she wouldn't have just sat by. Clearly, her injuries were truly severe.

Now that the threat was gone, she couldn't afford to waste any more time.

Gao Xueting's breathing soon steadied.

Only then did Yang Kai have time to look around.

This small world was now completely sealed by him. Without his permission, no one could enter, so Yang Kai didn't need to worry about Gao Xueting at all.

And this ancient medicine garden greatly piqued his interest.

Looking around, he saw there were two medicine gardens here, each with at least three hundred Spiritual Herbs planted. All of these Spiritual Herbs were Imperial-Grade and at least ten thousand years old, making Yang Kai so excited he could barely contain himself.

"Wow! Seven-Colored Mist Ganoderma—this is the main ingredient for refining Emperor Transformation Pills, and it even produced a Little Mist Ganoderma. This one must be at least fifty thousand years old."

"Heavenly Profound Thunder Flower! The stamens are golden—this, this..."

"Shaking Light Bodhi Fruit—how can it be as big as a fist? How did it grow like this?"

"Primordial Dragon Saliva Grass—wasn't this supposed to be extinct..."

"Nine-Curve Azure Radiance Flower..."

Each stalk of a Spiritual Herb, in Yang Kai’s eyes, was like a beautiful woman stripped bare, swaying gracefully and revealing her most enchanting side. The sight filled him with delight and excitement, his eyes practically glowing with greed.

As an alchemist, nothing was more blissful than this—fields of mature Spiritual Herbs laid out before him, free for the picking. Only an alchemist could understand this feeling.

He kept darting back and forth through the medicine garden, waving his hands in excitement. If he weren't afraid of disturbing Gao Xueting's healing, he'd probably be laughing madly.

So many Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs occupied just two gardens; there were actually more than a dozen gardens here, but the rest had surely been harvested by Gao Xueting and the others.

In other words, most of the Spiritual Herbs were in Gao Xueting, Ju Tianqing, or Zu Hong's spatial rings.

What he saw was only a tiny fraction.

And among the Spiritual Herbs he did see, many were legendary divine medicines thought to be extinct, yet here they still thrived.

"Hmm?" Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed, his gaze locking onto a fruit tree about half as tall as a person. The tree shimmered with light, as if carved from the finest jade—beautiful, exquisite, and crystal clear.

On the tree were three pure white blossoms and a fruit the size of a fist.

The fruit's shape was extremely peculiar—it looked like a tiny person shrunk countless times, with limbs, body, and head all complete. Even the head had clearly defined facial features.

Yang Kai's eyes instantly burned with excitement, his heart surging with shock as he cried out, "Life Origin Fruit!"

There was actually a Life Origin Fruit here!

Yang Kai rubbed his eyes hard, making sure he wasn't mistaken—this was definitely a Life Origin Fruit, exactly as described in the jade slip left by Third Disciple Gongsun Mu of Great Emperor Miaodan.

The Life Origin Fruit was the main ingredient for refining Life Origin Pills.

And the Life Origin Pill was a heaven-defying spiritual pill that could rebuild a physical body.

If a martial artist was killed but their divine soul survived, they could use a Life Origin Pill to restore their body and live again.

Even the Everlasting Tree didn't have this effect. The Everlasting Tree could heal flesh and bones, revive the dead, and even grant immortality, but it couldn't let a divine soul rebuild a body.

This shows just how heaven-defying the Life Origin Fruit's effect was.

Like the Warm Spirit Lotus and Everlasting Tree, the Life Origin Fruit only existed in ancient records—no one had ever seen one in person.

Yang Kai never imagined that in this ancient medicine garden, he would be lucky enough to see a Life Origin Fruit.

Having a Life Origin Fruit meant he could refine a Life Origin Pill, and with that, he could finally fulfill the promise he made to Tian Yan.

In the Divine Roaming Mirror, the senior Tian Yan, whose strength rivaled a Great Emperor, has always been a spirit body since his birth, never having a physical body. When Yang Kai was training in the Divine Roaming Mirror, he told Tian Yan that one day he would find a Life Origin Fruit and refine a Life Origin Pill for him, so he could experience having a body, break free from the mirror's constraints, and see the outside world.

Tian Yan seemed very interested in this, but how could a Life Origin Fruit be so easy to find?

And now, one had appeared right before Yang Kai's eyes.
