## Chapter 778 — I Refuse

Yang Kai had heard rumors about the Four Great Demon Generals; they were the Demon Race’s top experts, each possessing earth-shattering talents and overwhelming magic.

The four each held sway over the eastern, southern, western, and northern sectors of the Demon Domain, safeguarding its foundations and keeping this land secure. They rarely interacted with one another, yet for some reason the only woman among them, Xueli seemed notably at odds with the other three generals.

There were even whispers that the Demon Lord himself didn’t much care for her.

So the territory she guarded was comparatively desolate; whether in the richness of Heaven-and-Earth Energy or in the abundance of earthly resources, it could not match the others.

Yang Kai couldn’t recall exactly where he’d first heard the rumors, but now that he’d seen things for himself, they didn’t seem baseless.

Xueli’s city was Sand City, near the Sand Sea — a suitably bleak place — and her relations with Gou Qiong were indeed as strained as people said.

Still, she had clearly secured and held the post of Demon General through her own means and methods; a woman like her was not to be taken lightly, so Yang Kai kept every bit of caution about her.

He behaved obediently and quietly in the palace every day, giving no sign of mischief.

Gou Chi, however, had foolishly tried to escape. He was caught red-handed before he’d gotten far and was hung up and savagely beaten by the experts at Xueli’s side, left near death.

He spent more than a month convalescing before showing any real recovery.

Having seen the consequences firsthand, Yang Kai grew even more wary and careful.

A little over a month later, while Yang Kai was meditating in his room, he suddenly heard footsteps outside; his expression tightened and he slowly opened his eyes to watch the doorway.

After a moment, the door was pushed open and the demon expert who had earlier delivered messages for Gou Qiong strode in, calling to Yang Kai, "Get out here — the Lady wants to see you!"

Yang Kai rose and followed him outside.

The messenger walked ahead, glancing back at Yang Kai and emitting a low chuckle. He seemed to have found something amusing, and there was an odd glint in his eyes.

Yang Kai frowned, sensing at once that something was off, but he didn’t ask; as a prisoner under supervision, there was nothing he could learn by questioning, so he avoided making trouble for himself.

Before long the man led Yang Kai into a grand hall.

In front of the hall sat a broad chair draped with a thick, dark-red fur blanket that radiated luxury. Xueli reclined there, her graceful curves laid bare beneath her garments. She propped her cheek in her hand, eyes closed as if resting.

High-grade incense burned in the center of the hall, filling the space with a pervasive fragrance.

An Ling’er, dressed in a maid’s attire, stood beside Xueli looking ill at ease.

When she saw Yang Kai arrive, An Ling’er’s eyes brightened and she shot him a worried look; Yang Kai merely shook his head slowly to signal he was unharmed.

Since being captured and brought here they had not seen each other again. Yang Kai had remained in his room while An Ling’er was kept as a servant by Xueli. In Sand City’s palace the only two humans were Yang Kai and An Ling’er, so she naturally pinned all her hopes on him, afraid he might come to harm.

Seeing him safe, An Ling’er breathed a quiet sigh of relief and gave Yang Kai a furtive smile, careful not to make a sound.

Yang Kai scanned the hall and noticed Gou Chi and another demon standing there as well; both wore expressions of terror and apprehension, like mice before a cat.

"Lady, everyone is present," Xueli’s subordinate reported softly.

Xueli gave a faint nod, then slowly opened her dreamy, liquid eyes. She glanced down, rose leisurely, and stretched.

As she moved, her short upper robe rode up, revealing a flat, pale belly and a delicate navel, a temptation laid bare.

No one dared meet her gaze except Yang Kai, who watched her intently.

Xueli’s sharp eyes immediately fixed on Yang Kai; her glare felt scorching, and Yang Kai felt a prickling pain across his face, but his expression remained calm and unchanged.

She did not seem inclined to make an issue of such a small thing; parting her red lips, she said coolly, "Gou Qiong has replied."

Gou Chi trembled, pressed his dry lips together, and looked up at Xueli with twitching features as he asked in a low voice, "What’s his attitude?"

"Heh…you’re his son who fell into my hands. What attitude can he have? Ah, your father paid a sufficient ransom and bought you back."

Hearing that, Gou Chi’s expression shifted between relief and dread.

He was glad to finally leave Xueli’s custody, but terrified of the beating he’d surely receive at home — the conflicting emotions painted his face in a way that made his shame all the more vivid.

"What about me?" the other demon asked softly.

"You’re among those redeemed as well." Xueli nodded slightly and smiled with a meaning look toward Yang Kai. "Gou Qiong bought you all back — including this human girl."

An Ling’er froze for a moment, joy rising in her features.

Gou Chi and the other demon looked surprised at this, both glancing at Yang Kai before lowering their heads with complex expressions.

Yang Kai frowned, showing no joy; instead his face darkened as he said in a low voice, "Are you demon folk really so generous and magnanimous?"

"Huh?" Xueli raised a graceful brow and laughed suddenly. "Gou Qiong isn’t generous — just this once!"

"The ransom he paid — it wasn’t small, right?" Yang Kai stared intently. Even facing one of the Four Great Demon Generals, he showed no fear or timidity, his demeanor steady.

"Not small, but certainly not trivial either. It’ll irritate Gou Qiong for a while!" Xueli smiled and inclined her head, watching Yang Kai with interest and a new respect. Few before her had been as composed as he was; even Gou Qiong’s son cowered. Compared to that, Xueli found the human oddly intriguing.

At the very least he was bold — more so than many demon folk.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod, then turned and looked at Gou Chi, asking, "Brother Gou Chi, since Elder Gou Qiong has gone to the trouble of paying for you this time, what do you have to say?"

"Ah?" Gou Chi froze, avoiding Yang Kai’s direct gaze, his eyes flickering as he mumbled, "I have nothing to say…"

He spoke with an air of guilt.

"Really nothing to say?" Yang Kai’s mouth curled into a faint, cold smile as he pressed on.

Gou Chi slowly shook his head.

The demon beside him kept his head bowed and said nothing.

An Ling’er watched with puzzlement, not understanding why Yang Kai’s attitude toward Gou Chi had grown distant and cold.

Xueli and her subordinate, however, looked on with amused smiles, unwilling to interrupt the scene.

"Fine!" Yang Kai grinned, "Then Brother Gou Chi and I will part here — haha, what a short-lived friendship…"

The remark left Gou Chi mortified; his face flushed crimson.

Yang Kai ignored him and turned to Xueli, speaking seriously: "Senior, if I told you I refuse Gou Qiong’s ransom on my behalf, would you kill me?"

"Oh?" Xueli’s eyes flashed with a mix of approval and surprise as she snapped, "You refuse? You actually refuse?"

"Yes, I refuse."

Xueli burst into a bright, tinkling laugh, a flourish of coquettish charm that made her bosom tremble.

Her attendant smiled mildly and regarded Yang Kai with a look that suggested she had seen something remarkable.

After a moment Xueli’s smile subsided and she spoke softly: "Logically, if you refuse Gou Qiong, I lose some gain and should kill you — why have I kept you alive all this time otherwise? But…that ransom that reached me wasn’t meant to be returned, and by refusing it you have, in effect, slapped Gou Qiong in the face…so I’ll spare your life."

Yang Kai’s face hardened, his expression grim.

Xueli’s words were sly; she’d framed him as opposing Gou Qiong. Though a trivial matter, for a proud figure like Gou Qiong it would be a loss of face that might provoke fury — gifting a ransom only to be refused would make the world sneer at him.

A Demon General ridiculed by a human would surely enrage Gou Qiong.

Even if the truth was otherwise.

"Fine, I’ll grant your request." Xueli’s face turned serious as she waved to Gou Chi and the other demon, "Be gone. If you’re still within the range of my Divine Sense after half an incense stick’s time, don’t blame me for being ruthless!"

No sooner had she spoken than Gou Chi and the other demon burst into streaks of light and sped out of the palace without looking back. In the blink of an eye they were several hundred zhang away, tapping their full strength as they fled.

Xueli wasn’t joking — her Divine Sense remained locked on them, and if she could still sense them when the time was up, she would indeed kill them.

She was a woman whose heart was as venomous as a serpent’s!

"You humans are shrewd," Xueli said with a sneer. "But since you refused Gou Qiong’s ransom, you must prove you’re worth keeping alive. Sand City doesn’t raise deadweight!"

"So you won’t let me go," Yang Kai retorted.

"Let you go?" Xueli scoffed. "Humans who enter Sand City only have one path left — death! Yet you seem different. I don’t want to kill you now, but don’t disappoint me, or I’ll make you suffer fate worse than death."

With that she rose, as if to leave.

"Senior…" An Ling’er cried out, pleading in her eyes, "Could you give us a moment to speak?"

Xueli frowned but did not refuse, and she turned and left, apparently granting them the time.
