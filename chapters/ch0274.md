## Chapter 274 — Xiao Fusheng

The striking red characters boldly proclaimed the dominance and extraordinary spirit of Yao Wang Valley.

Only those from Yao Wang Valley would dare to erect such an imposing stone tablet in front of their own door.

There was no one guarding the foot of the mountain, and Qin Ze led everyone to begin their ascent.

Dong Qingyan walked alongside Qin Ze, followed by three disciples of Yao Wang Valley, while Yang Kai trailed behind with his hands clasped behind his back.

The three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley looked at Dong Qingyan with envy, admiration, and even affection, while they regarded Yang Kai with disdain, not deigning to even exchange a word with him.

Alchemists were generally a group of individuals who were not good at socializing and held themselves in high regard.

The alchemists of Yao Wang Valley were even more so!

Dong Qingyan, born of noble lineage and possessing natural beauty, naturally garnered their attention. Although Yang Kai had passed the test set by Master Xiao and qualified to join Hidden Cloud Peak, he was essentially just a lowly attendant guard, and they would not lower themselves to interact with him.

They remained silent, and Yang Kai, like a quiet gourd, continued to ascend while secretly observing.

On the other hand, Dong Qingyan was like a sparrow, chattering non-stop since stepping onto the rugged mountain path, anxious and excited to soon enter the sacred land in her heart and meet the revered senior.

Qin Ze was not talkative and mostly remained silent, but when faced with Dong Qingyan's inquiries, he answered each one carefully without showing any signs of impatience.

Listening to their conversation, Yang Kai learned some things.

The Hidden Cloud Peak lineage had only one alchemist, Xiao Fusheng, stationed there for decades. Besides the two maidservants who attended to him, there were no others.

Moreover, these two maidservants were ordinary people who had never practiced cultivation.

Xiao Fusheng had devoted his life to alchemy, never marrying or accepting disciples, until this year when he changed his mind and decided to pass on his lifelong knowledge.

Thus, the test today came to be.

"Why did Master suddenly change his mind?" Dong Qingyan asked curiously.

Qin Ze's expression darkened. He did not answer but pondered for a moment before saying, "What my master thinks, I dare not speculate. One day, you can ask him yourself."

"Oh."

The first half of Hidden Cloud Peak was unremarkable, with only rugged rocks and clear mountain forests in sight. Occasionally, some wild animals like rabbits and roe deer appeared, posing no danger.

However, in the latter half, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged forth, refreshing and invigorating, with many rare flowers and herbs growing openly, swaying in the wind in a dazzling array.

"With so many herbs, isn't anyone sneaking up to gather them?" Dong Qingyan wondered, having seen no one guarding the mountain forest.

"Who would dare!" Qin Ze snorted coldly. "Who would dare touch the herbs of Yao Wang Valley? Their entire clan would be exterminated!"

This statement, filled with killing intent, made Dong Qingyan stick out her tongue in response.

The herbs planted in the mountain forest were certainly not too precious; it was clearly not worth offending Yao Wang Valley over them.

Half an hour later, they reached the mountain peak, where a row of houses stood. There were not many, only about seven or eight, and more than half of them appeared to be newly built.

They should be the residences prepared by Xiao Fusheng for his disciples.

Upon arriving here, Qin Ze stopped and turned to the three disciples of Yao Wang Valley, saying, "You all wait here."

Upon hearing this, the three immediately put on a flattering smile and said, "Master Uncle, we want to go in too."

"What do you want to go in for?" Qin Ze replied unhappily.

One of them, with a look of longing, said, "Since we entered Yao Wang Valley, we have only seen Master Uncle Xiao from afar. Now that we are here... Hehe."

Qin Ze frowned and pondered for a moment before nodding, "Fine, but you all must remain silent. My master does not like to be disturbed."

"Yes, we promise not to speak." The three immediately became excited.

Yang Kai observed the situation and noticed that the three wore expressions of joy mixed with awe, and even Qin Ze adjusted his expression.

It seemed that Xiao Fusheng's reputation among the alchemists far exceeded his expectations.

Even these disciples of Yao Wang Valley took pride in merely seeing him.

Under Qin Ze's lead, the group walked straight toward the row of houses.

Before they could get close, two beautiful women approached them. Both were voluptuous and stunning, with a hint of charm and grace in their demeanor, smiling gently.

At first glance, the two women appeared to be only in their mid-twenties.

In reality, both had already passed forty.

Twenty-five years ago, they had come to Hidden Cloud Peak to serve Xiao Fusheng, and back then, they were only sixteen or seventeen.

These two beautiful women were ordinary people who had never practiced cultivation, yet they still maintained their youth and beauty, looking better than many martial artists, all thanks to Xiao Fusheng's methods.

Seeing the two women approach, Qin Ze quickly cupped his fists, not daring to show any disrespect, and respectfully said, "Ladies, please report to Master Uncle that I have brought the people he wanted."

"Is it these two?" One of the women, dressed in a moon-white long dress, smiled as she looked at Dong Qingyan and Yang Kai.

"Greetings, Senior!" Dong Qingyan understood the etiquette and quickly bowed with Yang Kai.

The woman chuckled lightly, "Just call me Aunt Xiang; this is Aunt Lan."

Dong Qingyan giggled and obediently bowed again.

Aunt Xiang continued, "There’s no need to be formal here; treat it like your own home. You two will be staying here for a long time. If you’re too formal, it will be uncomfortable for you and for us."

The other woman, Aunt Lan, smiled and said, "When we first came to Hidden Cloud Peak, we were about your age. Twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye."

Seeing their friendliness, Dong Qingyan gradually relaxed her nervousness.

"Ladies, Master Uncle..." Qin Ze waited for them to finish their pleasantries before respectfully inquired.

"Master is currently refining pills. The news from the foot of the mountain has already reached him. You all can return for now. Once Master finishes refining that batch of pills, he will meet with them," one of the women replied.

Upon hearing this, not only did the three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley look disappointed, but even Qin Ze appeared somewhat disheartened.

"Thank you, ladies!" Qin Ze quickly composed himself, cupping his fists and leading the three disciples of Yao Wang Valley away.

After they left, the two beautiful women waved to Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan, smiling as they arranged their accommodations.

For many years, Hidden Cloud Peak had only had the three of them, and since Xiao Fusheng often secluded himself to refine pills, disappearing for days on end, the two had relied on each other for companionship. Now that Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan had arrived, it brought new life to the place, and they were naturally delighted.

Hidden Cloud Peak was unlike other isolated peaks; there was nothing to be overly cautious about, and there were no strict rules, everything was quite free.

After arranging accommodations for Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan, the two women left.

They stayed at Hidden Cloud Peak for three days, yet Xiao Fusheng still did not show up. Only the two beautiful women frequently came to check on Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan, asking about their well-being.

On the third day, just as Dong Qingyan was absentmindedly wondering when Xiao Fusheng would emerge, a powerful wave of energy suddenly emanated from not far away.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly as he exchanged glances with Dong Qingyan, quickly rushing out of the house.

The two beautiful women had also come out, staring blankly at a certain house.

This was Xiao Fusheng's residence.

In less than a moment, the door opened, and an elderly man with white hair and a face full of wrinkles, appearing to be in his sixties, walked out. His expression was serene, but at this moment, his brows were tightly furrowed as he held a golden-yellow pill, frowning as he examined it.

Dong Qingyan immediately grew anxious.

The person she had always revered was now right in front of her, and her feelings were beyond words.

Yang Kai was also observing this legendary figure in the alchemy world, and he was astonished to find that this man emitted no fluctuations of Yuan Qi at all; he looked just like an ordinary old man, plain to the extreme.

However, Xiao Fusheng could not possibly be an ordinary person; at the very least, he was a master of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a sense of respect. To be able to conceal his essence to such an extent, this Xiao Fusheng was not simple!

"There's no pill pattern, no pill pattern... What use do I have for a pill without a pattern?" Xiao Fusheng muttered in pain, letting out a long sigh.

Yang Kai glanced at the pill in his hand and noticed that it was full of spiritual energy; even from several zhang away, he could smell the fragrance of the pill. It was round and plump, clearly a high-grade pill above Heaven-Grade.

Yet now, this pill was being dismissed by Xiao Fusheng as worthless.

"Master," Aunt Xiang softly called out, "the people have arrived."

"En?" Xiao Fusheng finally snapped out of his deep thoughts, casually tossing the pill to one of the beautiful women before eagerly turning his attention to Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan.

"En, not bad, not bad!" He circled around Dong Qingyan a few times, repeatedly praising her.

At this moment, Dong Qingyan stiffened her face, becoming serious, not daring to move.

After circling Yang Kai a few times, Xiao Fusheng suddenly frowned, "Also not bad, but the killing intent is too strong!"

Yang Kai's heart trembled.

Xiao Fusheng, however, casually waved his hand, "You two, extend your hands."

Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan obediently extended one hand, and Xiao Fusheng flicked his fingers onto their wrists, examining them for a while. A smile spread across his old face, his eyes glinting with a profound light as he looked at Yang Kai, "You faked it during the test!"

Yang Kai was taken aback, then awkwardly chuckled, "Senior's insight is like a torch."

Dong Qingyan was stunned and quickly defended Yang Kai, "He didn't fake it! He took that poison pill and forced out the poison gas; how could he have faked it?"

Xiao Fusheng smiled and said, "I'm not saying his qualifications are lacking; on the contrary, his qualifications might be better than yours. It's just that he deliberately delayed forcing out the poison gas, clearly not wanting to stand out too much."

"Ah!" Dong Qingyan was dumbfounded.

The beautiful women's eyes also sparkled with surprise as they looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai forced a smile, "Senior, how did you see through it?"

Xiao Fusheng chuckled, brushing off the dust from his clothes, "The test I set up, do you think I wouldn't know the ins and outs of it?"
