## Chapter 360 — I Don't Know What Title to Give

Xiang Chu said this phrase with great power, uplifting the spirits.

Leiguang and the people from Feihong Courtyard were originally downcast, but upon hearing this, their expressions instantly brightened. Xie Rong and Li Fu looked at Yang Kai with a mixture of pride and hatred, as if they were already imagining his plight at the end of his rope.

“Well said!” A hearty laugh came from not far away.

Everyone was taken aback and quickly turned to look in that direction.

A hundred zhang away, several Treading Cloud Steeds galloped towards them, graceful as the wind.

Treading Cloud Steeds, a Third-Tier Demonic Beast, are not particularly powerful but excel in stamina and speed! Additionally, they are gentle by nature, making them perfect for riding.

Each Treading Cloud Steed can travel thousands of li in a day, and an excellent one can cover ten thousand li effortlessly. Their speed rivals even that of some in the Divine Roaming Realm, and they do not consume True Essence.

Therefore, prominent families usually tame a few Treading Cloud Steeds for transportation. However, this kind of Demonic Beast is not abundant, with each worth hundreds of thousands of taels of silver, making it too costly for all but the top-tier forces to maintain.

In a sense, Treading Cloud Steeds represent strength and status.

Three Treading Cloud Steeds approached. The leader appeared to be about the same age as Xiang Chu, extraordinary in stature and powerful; behind him were two experts at the eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

In an instant, they closed the distance of a hundred zhang.

“It’s been months since we last met. Xiang bro, your temper seems to have improved!” The young leader laughed heartily. He did not dismount but sat high atop the Treading Cloud Steed, looking down at everyone. However, his eyes showed a slight seriousness and surprise when they landed on Yang Kai.

Such a fierce demonic aura, he certainly could not ignore.

The two experts following him in the Divine Roaming Realm also glanced frequently at Yang Kai, secretly channeling their True Essence just in case.

“This guy is called Nan Sheng!” Fang Ziqi, aware of Yang Kai’s limited experience, quickly leaned in to explain, “He is the young master of the first-class Nan family, on par with Xiang Chu. The Nan and Xiang families have intermarried for generations, so their relationship has always been good. Be cautious around him; he is much more overbearing than Xiang Chu and quite difficult to deal with.”

“Understood.” Yang Kai nodded slightly. Xiang Chu appeared to be an insidious character who said one thing and meant another, while Nan Sheng seemed to speak his mind directly.

Xiang Chu’s dark expression lightened somewhat upon seeing this person, as he smiled and cupped his fist, saying, “Brother Nan, what brings you here? Aren’t you stationed at the front lines a few hundred li away?”

The Xiang family controls the frontline near Taifang Mountain, while the Nan family governs another line a few hundred li away; both are first-class families and qualified for that.

Nan Sheng grinned widely. He dismounted from his Treading Cloud Steed and said, “Didn’t the decisive battle finish two days ago? The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu said we could go back, and passing through here, I sensed something unusual, so I came to check it out. I didn’t expect a good show; why haven’t you all left yet?”

As he spoke, he sized up Yang Kai.

Xiang Chu’s expression grew awkward and he said, “We are executing our final mission today. I planned to inform everyone about this good news after returning, but there have been some unforeseen events here. I haven’t had the chance to tell anyone yet.”

The people from Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower were all stunned.

The decisive battle had concluded two days ago!

If it weren’t for overhearing this from Nan Sheng, they would still be in the dark!

How could the martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land possibly launch a raid on their camp two days after the battle had ended? 

What commander would go looking for trouble?

Yet at this moment, trouble arose on Yang Kai’s side, indicating there was clearly something unspeakable going on.

Instantly, many key points became clear to everyone.

“Unexpected developments…” Nan Sheng nodded slightly, frowning as he looked at Yang Kai, casually pointing his finger, “It’s him, right?”

“Indeed.” Xiang Chu nodded.

“Demonic being, heh, interesting.” Nan Sheng pinched his chin, appearing to assess a commodity as he looked at Yang Kai, “Such a young demonic being possesses this dense killing intent; it seems his cultivation method is not simple.”

“Quite extraordinary indeed.” Xiang Chu said with a serious expression.

Nan Sheng was slightly taken aback. It was rare for him to see Xiang Chu with such a solemn expression, prompting his curiosity, “Why?”

“Two experts at the second stage of the Divine Roaming Realm were killed by him!”

“What?” Nan Sheng’s expression changed dramatically, and the two Divine Roaming Realm experts behind him were equally shaken.

“Brother Xiang, you must be joking!” Nan Sheng was stunned for a long time before shaking his head with an incredulous smile, “He only seems to be at the sixth stage of the True Essence Realm; how could he kill two in the Divine Roaming Realm?”

“The bodies are right here; how would I joke with you? Every dead person here is his doing.” Xiang Chu forced a smile.

One of the Divine Roaming Realm experts behind Nan Sheng stepped forward and said softly, “Young Master, we cannot underestimate this person; his vitality is extraordinarily vigorous, unlike ordinary individuals; moreover, that black Jiao Dragon beside him is also quite peculiar.”

Since even his own family’s Divine Roaming Realm expert was this serious, Nan Sheng immediately withdrew his previous nonchalance and asked softly, “If I were to face him, what are my chances of winning?”

The Divine Roaming Realm expert pursed his lips, uncertain how to respond.

“Speak frankly!”

“Absolutely no chance!” The Divine Roaming Realm expert said with a stiff expression.

Nan Sheng gasped sharply, finally reevaluating Yang Kai. Even among the younger generation of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, only a few opponents would leave him without a chance of winning, but now the emergence of such a young demonic being showcased similar talent and strength. Wasn’t that saying his aptitude and power were comparable to those few from Zhongdu?

Squinting slightly, Nan Sheng said in a deep voice, “For such a dangerous person, it’s better to kill him directly; leaving him alive will surely bring endless troubles later.”

Xiang Chu nodded, “I think so too.”

“Then why hesitate?” Nan Sheng asked, looking confused.

Xiang Chu sighed, “I can't bring myself to kill certain people.”

As he spoke, his gaze intently rested on the Sisters from the Hu Family, affectionately, without any hint of concealment.

The Xiang family and the Nan family had intermarried for generations, and Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng had grown up together, almost like brothers; with one look, Nan Sheng already understood Xiang Chu's feelings.

Nan Sheng also understood Xiang Chu's personality and methods. Shifting his thoughts, he grasped many aspects.

Some things were inconvenient for Xiang Chu to say, but Nan Sheng could express them.

***, passing through unexpectedly and even needing to help this brat, who has several beautiful wives at home, and he is still not satisfied! A wave of frustration filled Nan Sheng's heart.

However, this pair of twins was quite intriguing; no wonder they caught his fancy.

Thinking this, Nan Sheng also joined in, casually pointing at the Sisters from the Hu Family and asked, “Ladies, do you want to live or die?”

Hu Jiao'er snorted coldly, “Who would want to die if they could live?”

“Then good. Step aside; this doesn’t concern you. Brother Xiang just needs to kill that brat.” Nan Sheng slightly nodded, taking charge.

The Sisters from the Hu Family shook their heads in unison, firmly standing by Yang Kai’s side.

Nan Sheng was utterly astonished, inwardly cursing. So the two women that Xiang Chu liked already had someone else they cared for? No wonder there was such a commotion.

So that’s how it is!

Now, Nan Sheng understood everything; the fight played out here was hidden.

Adjusting his expression, Nan Sheng asked, “Do you wish to save his life?”

The Sisters from the Hu Family’s expressions darkened, and after a moment’s pause, they nodded slightly.

“Then that makes things easier.” Nan Sheng laughed, “You two, marry my brother Xiang, and I, Nan Sheng, will ensure his safety!”

This statement shocked everyone.

Xiang Chu waved his hands repeatedly, “Brother Nan, that’s not possible. I do have intentions toward these two ladies, but killing the demonic being is a serious matter; how can we confuse the two?”

Nan Sheng's face turned stern, “Why not? You can make decisions here; I can make decisions in my matters. Let's settle it this way.”

He turned to the Sisters from the Hu Family and asked, “How do you two ladies feel about this?”

“Wishful thinking!” Hu Jiao'er decisively rejected.

Nan Sheng’s expression soured slightly, with a hint of arrogance and disdain in his eyes as he said, “You two seem to be disciples of a second-rate sect. I, my brother Xiang, come from a first-class family, with power and influence, plus I am handsome—marrying him wouldn’t be a slight to you, would it? Just two women; why act so high and mighty? Sooner or later, you'll need to get married. If a first-class family’s young master doesn’t marry you, who else would? To be favored by my brother Xiang is your fortune!”

Nan Sheng’s words were harsh, infuriating the Sisters from the Hu Family.

“Just like that, it’s either he dies or you two marry my brother Xiang. Think carefully about your choice. There’s only enough time for an incense stick to burn; if the time is up, begging me will be useless. If anyone else dares to cause trouble, they will be killed without mercy!”

After saying that, he stood aside with his head lowered, watching coldly.

Throughout the entire event, Xiang Chu had said only one sentence and remained silent thereafter.

With things developing in this manner, even the Sisters from the Hu Family, no matter how dull they were, could react now.

“So that was your intention.” Hu Jiao'er looked at Xiang Chu with disdain, “Everything has been aimed at Yang Kai, and using this opportunity to coerce us, right?”

Xiang Chu maintained a calm expression and replied, “If Jiao'er thinks that way, it must be a misunderstanding on your part.”

Nan Sheng couldn’t help but roll his eyes, thinking how this guy was still so adept at putting on an act. If it were him, he would have been straightforward and taken action long ago.

For the women of a second-rate sect, he would have just taken them without hesitation; what could they do?

“Whether it’s a misunderstanding or not, you know in your heart!” Hu Jiao'er sneered.
