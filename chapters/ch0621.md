## Chapter 621 — Just Playing Around

Yang Kai scratched his head. He had thought that more than one hundred and fifty Crystal Stones was a decent fortune, but when it came time to use them he discovered they were still far too few.

"Don't look at me, I don't have any Crystal Stones on me." Shui Ling said helplessly. She had been living in Zhongdu for over two years; the Crystal Stones she brought with her had long since been exhausted.

Yun Xuan had been listening from the side; only now did she bite her lip and say, "I have a piece of Kongchan Jade."

Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment.

"I'm not using it anyway, I'll give it to you." Yun Xuan said as she reached into the Spatial Pouch at her waist and produced a fist-sized block of jade-white stone, translucent and pure.

Yang Kai frowned, hesitated for a moment, then took it and said, "Consider it a loan from you."

"No need." Yun Xuan smiled faintly.

Master Ma looked at Yang Kai and then at Yun Xuan, somewhat puzzled as to why Miss Yun appeared so favorably disposed toward this youth, so generous as to give away such a valuable material.

From a remote corner a youth had come; did he possess any value worth investing in? Master Ma pondered.

They handed the Kongchan Jade and the Ice‑Flame Star Sand to Master Ma. He took them, cleared his throat, and said, "You're not a disciple of my Duao Alliance; by rights the fee to refine and repair a Secret Treasure should be raised by twenty percent…"

Saying this, he glanced at Yun Xuan and smiled slightly, "However, for Miss Yun's sake, this time I'll only charge you a hundred Crystal Stones. You should have that much, right?"

The youth plainly looked poor; Master Ma did not dare demand too much, lest Miss Yun lose face.

Yang Kai nodded, produced one hundred Crystal Stones, and handed them over.

Master Ma displayed a satisfied expression and said, "Come back in ten days. I'll return you a brand new Secret Treasure; I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"

"Then we will take our leave." Yun Xuan nodded slightly and led Yang Kai and Shui Ling back the way they had come.

Once outside the Secret Treasure hall, Yang Kai finally asked, "That piece of Kongchan Jade — how many Crystal Stones is it worth?"

Yun Xuan smiled without answering. Shui Ling, however, quietly made a gesture toward him.

Yang Kai's face darkened.

He had no valuable items to offer Miss Yun as compensation. He would not expose the Wan Yao Ling Ye, and the Ice‑Flame Star Sand had already been handed to Master Ma. He had originally intended to set some aside for Shui Ling, but now that was impossible.

After all, Shui Ling was a minor princess of the Water Divine Hall; she probably would not care about such gains and losses.

"I will repay you." Yang Kai reiterated. He disliked owing favors, especially to those he did not know well. Yun Xuan's goodwill was plainly due to Shui Ling.

He knew his own position well. Yun Xuan would not go so far as to give away such valuable material merely to ingratiate herself with him.

"I said it's unnecessary, you…" Yun Xuan pursed her lips and laughed coquettishly, shaking her head, "Alright then, if there's nothing else, let's go back."

"I still want to buy a few things." Yang Kai said.

"Oh? What do you want to buy? I'll take you there." Yun Xuan asked with interest.

"Some medicinal herbs."

"To buy herbs?" Yun Xuan asked, then her beautiful eyes brightened, "Are you an alchemist?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "No. I'm only interested in alchemy and want to study it."

Shui Ling was dumbfounded. She had spent a fair amount of time with Yang Kai but had never seen him refine a pill. She did know he was close to Xia Ningshang, who had deep attainments in alchemy, but for someone who had never touched alchemy to say this was puzzling.

"Just playing around." Yang Kai smiled.

Since there was nothing else to do — and Master Ma had said the bone shield could not be collected for ten days — Yang Kai naturally wanted to use this time to do something useful.

Refining pills was something he had always wanted to try but had never had the time to do.

"No Divine Roaming, no pill refining," was the teaching of Xiao Fusheng of Hidden Cloud Peak in Yao Wang Valley. Yang Kai had already advanced to the Divine Roaming Realm and thus met that requirement.

In the past he had never worried about acquiring pills; with his Little Senior Sister around any pill could be produced. But now he was alone in the Tongxuan Continent, Shopkeeper Meng and the others were out of contact, and Yang Kai had to plan for his own future.

Having a skill is always better than having none.

"I don't understand you at all." Shui Ling shook her head.

"Then come with me. I'll take you to buy the herbs. What kind of herbs do you want?"

"The lower the grade the better!" Yang Kai said seriously.

Yun Xuan was stunned. "Lower‑grade? You haven't refined pills before, have you?"

Only apprentices just entering the path of alchemy would choose the lowest‑grade materials to practice with.

"He really hasn't!" Shui Ling smiled.

"So you're truly just playing around." Yun Xuan laughed and, not obstructing him, led Yang Kai and Shui Ling off toward one direction in the city.

The farther they walked, the more remote the area became; the goods they passed were of increasingly low grade, and even the martial artists coming and going were no longer the high‑caliber figures seen earlier.

Yang Kai knew this must be the trading district for Duao City's lower‑level warriors and low‑grade materials.

Before long the three arrived at a medicine shop filled with all manner of low‑grade materials, a dazzling array. Many apprentice alchemists and apprentice refiners came here to acquire materials for practice.

The materials were low grade and cheap, but because the volume required was large the business here was quite brisk.

Under Yun Xuan's guidance, Yang Kai spent fifty Crystal Stones to purchase a large quantity of low‑grade herbs and left thoroughly satisfied.

Back at Yun Xuan's team's residence, Yang Kai closed the door, set up a formation outside the room, and, full of spirit, began his path in alchemy.

He was well versed in the essence and mysteries of alchemy.

Over the years, the pieces of information he had gleaned from the True Alchemy Formula had given him a grasp of alchemical knowledge that even surpassed Xia Ningshang's.

The construction and function of spirit formations, the selection of herbs, the control of timing, the experience and insights of the alchemical masters — and so on — none stood above him in understanding.

What Yang Kai lacked was practical, hands‑on experience.

Moreover, the attributes of his True Yuan and Divine Sense were quite well suited to alchemy.

His blazing True Yang Yuan Qi made it easier to coagulate and bring forth the medicinal potency of the materials.

In short, in the art of alchemy Yang Kai possessed many innate advantages others could not match. While he could not be compared to Xia Ningshang's Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, his conditions were far better than most other alchemists.

He emptied all the low‑grade materials he had purchased from the Black Book Space and took out that small censer.

That censer had appeared when the third page of the Black Book was unsealed. After peering into the mysteries of the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai realized it was more than an ordinary censer.

It was also a pill furnace.

The censer and the True Alchemy Formula should coexist, complementing one another, yet for some reason the True Alchemy Formula had been hidden within the relic of Dan Sheng in Yao Wang Valley. Had it not been for that accident, Yang Kai might have missed the formula's mysteries entirely.

The Black Book's original owner seemed intent on preventing Yang Kai from walking the path of alchemy and had no intention of passing the True Alchemy Formula down.

But as it turned out, his plan had failed.

Yang Kai reached out and stroked the small censer, pouring his True Yuan into it and guiding it along a set route so his True Yuan wandered through the censer.

Soon lines of light flickered across the censer's surface, and as the lights appeared the little censer suddenly expanded, becoming as large as a water jar.

Yang Kai retracted his hand and nodded with satisfaction.

The size of a pill furnace, to some extent, can directly reflect whether an alchemist's technique is refined.

The larger the furnace required, the poorer the alchemist's skill, for when refining a pill the alchemist must inscribe various spirit formations within the furnace with True Yuan, allowing those formations to exert their functions, to meld and bring forth potency, and to allow the materials to interact and finally condense into a pill.

A masterful alchemist, no matter how small the furnace, can inscribe formations precisely without error and can control the timing.

A water‑jar‑sized furnace suited Yang Kai for practice. Such a large furnace offers a slightly higher margin for error; pouring in a little more True Yuan would not be disastrous.

Recalling the composition of a certain pill, Yang Kai found the corresponding herbs among the low‑grade materials, set them aside in order, then formed hand seals and poured his True Yuan into the furnace.

Soon a simple spirit formation took shape inside the furnace.

Because he was practicing, Yang Kai chose a formation that increased the chance of success; it was a basic formation and not overly complicated.

He had the ability to control both the formation's emergence and its stability.

Inspecting the formation within the furnace, Yang Kai was extremely satisfied.

He placed the selected low‑grade materials into the furnace in sequence, pouring in True Yuan as he went, using his blazing True Yang Yuan Qi to condense their effects.

During the process, the precious insights and experiences of those alchemical masters recorded in the Pill‑Refining Scripture gradually surfaced in Yang Kai's mind, allowing him to compare them with the situation before him.

Those alchemists had also once known nothing of the Way of Pill Refinement, their understanding once a complete blank.

Yet through their own effort and talent they had climbed step by step to heights worthy of reverence.

Yang Kai controlled everything with great care, for the amount of True Yuan poured in directly affected the condensation of potency. Pouring too much could burn the materials; pouring too little would leave their potency incomplete and fail to form a pill.

Alchemy is an exceedingly delicate craft, with strict demands on the control of one's True Yuan.

Under the influence of Yang Kai's True Yuan, each herb melted and fused together, producing changes that filled him with delight.

However, just as Yang Kai thought success was within reach, black smoke suddenly billowed from the furnace, and the smell of burning quickly filled the room.

Yang Kai stopped pouring True Yuan and frowned.

He knew this batch of pill refining had completely failed. His True Yuan pouring had still been slightly off; he had used a little too much force, and the materials had been burned to cinders.

Removing the charred remains from the furnace, Yang Kai did not hastily begin again; instead he calmed himself and reviewed the sensations he had just experienced, comparing them with the correct method.
