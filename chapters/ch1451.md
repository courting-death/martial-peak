## Chapter 1451 — Hidden Grotto

One day, if Yang Kai could successfully refine a Void King-Grade pill, it would mean his alchemical skill had reached a pinnacle—the summit of the Star Domain!

He did have some Void King-Grade medicinal materials on hand, gathered back when he first set foot in the Star Domain and fell into misfortune on the Floating Continent; these years they had remained unused because his pill-refining skill wasn't yet sufficient.

But such things are never unwanted; the more, the better.

Especially for an Upper-Level Origin-Grade alchemist attempting to ascend to Void King-Grade, the road would be arduous and would consume a great many materials. Thinking of this, Yang Kai worked even harder at gathering.

Time passed. Although this valley held several plots of medicinal fields and had planted at least a thousand spiritual herbs, with four people gathering together the work went fairly quickly. Half a day later, Yang Kai straightened and looked around, finding that the valley's medicinal fields had been almost entirely harvested, leaving only a little; the three women from Ice Heart Valley were still busy over there.

He smiled faintly, but had no intention of interfering; instead he stood in place and waited.

With nothing better to occupy him, Yang Kai cast his eyes about the valley. This place appeared to be a hidden grotto left behind tens of thousands of years ago. Since it was a hidden grotto, there should be signs of habitation—but earlier, when everyone had rushed in, they had been distracted by the array of spiritual herbs and had not inspected carefully.

Yet now, as Yang Kai looked, he found no living quarters here at all, not even a single house.

Could it be...

Yang Kai wore a pensive expression and glanced toward the nearby cliff face. Upon closer inspection he did indeed find something; after a moment he shifted his figure and approached a smooth section of rock.

He reached out and tapped the cliff—nothing seemed amiss—but Yang Kai was no greenhorn who could be fooled by such a trick. He continued to lightly rap the stone with his fingers, listening for sound from within, while sending his Divine Sense to probe inward.

Before long Yang Kai's face brightened. Without hesitation he slammed his palm against a certain spot on the cliff.

He did not use Saint Yuan for that strike, yet when his palm hit the place a thunderous rumble came from inside the rock. Immediately the smooth wall split open, revealing a black passageway.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and strode inside without hesitation.

The passage within the cliff wasn't wide—only about three chi, barely enough for two to walk side by side—but it wound and twisted, giving an impression of depth and seclusion.

Yang Kai walked fully a li or two inward before some faint light began to filter forward from ahead.

Seeing this, his expression turned serious and his pace quickened considerably.

After a short while he entered a stone chamber. The room was not large—only some twenty or thirty zhang across—and simply furnished: a stone table, a stone chair, and a stone bed. Nothing else.

But the moment he arrived, his gaze was immediately drawn to a particular spot.

There stood a pill furnace about half a person tall, quietly rooted to the ground. The furnace looked extremely ancient, an air of desolation issuing from within. Judging by its material and make, it was evidently of high grade—undoubtedly a Void King-Grade pill furnace!

Beside the furnace lay a skeleton, seated in a cross-legged posture; from the position it had died in, it seemed the person had been pouring Saint Yuan into the furnace as they died.

This person had been refining a pill even as they breathed their last!

Yang Kai immediately pieced together the truth, and when he thought of the many spiritual herbs planted in the valley, the identity of this person became clear.

An alchemist!

Only an alchemist would plant so many medicinal materials in their grotto. From the posture at death it was clear this person had been obsessed with refining pills—otherwise they would not have been refining at the point of death.

Whether they had succeeded, however, remained unknown...

With that thought, Yang Kai curiously sent his Divine Sense into the furnace. The probe showed that there indeed lay a pill within the furnace.

The person had actually succeeded! A surge of respect rose in Yang Kai. Though he did not know whether the grotto master had died from overexertion while refining or had perished after striving to complete a final wish, such single-minded dedication inspired Yang Kai.

Yang Kai refined pills for the sake of cultivation, but this person—regardless of whether they had been good or evil, male or female—had evidently treated pill-refining as more important than life itself, hence the scene before him.

While he was moved, faint footsteps sounded from outside. Yang Kai's brow lifted; without thinking he plunged his hand into the furnace, took the pill, tossed it into a jade bottle, and put it into his Spatial Ring.

The whole movement was smooth and effortless; Yang Kai had not even a moment to look at the pill's grade.

When he finished, a beautiful figure had already appeared behind him.

"Little brother, could this be the grotto belonging to the owner?" the Ice Heart Valley woman asked upon arriving, casting a casual glance and immediately exclaiming in surprise.

"It should be," Yang Kai replied with a slight nod, maintaining a calm exterior.

"Oh! A pill furnace—so this person was an alchemist in life?" the woman said, delight flooding her face as she hurried to Yang Kai's side and inspected. She found no signs of disturbance and her gaze was quickly drawn to the Spatial Ring on the skeleton's hand, her face showing obvious desire.

“After you, Madam!” Yang Kai, quick to read her expression, naturally understood what she was thinking. With an easy smile, he gestured for her to proceed.

The woman's expression showed a hint of embarrassment but she did not refuse. She inclined her head and said, "Very well, then I shall not be polite."

Saying so, she secretly summoned Saint Yuan to protect herself and reached for the Spatial Ring.

Unexpectedly there was no danger. She easily grabbed the ring and sent her Divine Sense inside, her face instantly filled with glee.

After a while she reluctantly tossed the Spatial Ring to Yang Kai, saying, "Young brother, you have a look too!"

Yang Kai took it and likewise swept his Divine Sense through. Retrieving his Divine Sense, he pondered for a moment and then said to the woman, "Let's split the contents evenly. You have no objections, madam?"

"Heh heh, as agreed beforehand, I naturally have no objection," the woman said with a forced smile.

"Very well then, let's divide these items." Yang Kai said, and without ceremony he began taking items from the Spatial Ring.

There were many Saint Crystals—tens of millions worth—mostly Upper-Level quality.

Such wealth would be staggering to ordinary martial artists, but considering the ring's owner's profession, it was not unexpected. Alchemists are always well-off.

The Saint Crystals were easy to divide; Yang Kai and the woman split them in turn, and soon they were settled.

But the main event was yet to come: beyond the Saint Crystals the ring contained many jade bottles—hundreds in all, large and small.

Yang Kai took the jade bottles out one by one and laid them before them, while the woman's beautiful eyes watched without blinking, as if afraid Yang Kai would pull a trick.

What was in the jade bottles was obvious without stating.

Since the ring's owner had been an alchemist, the bottles must contain spiritual pills. Thus when the hundreds of jade bottles were set out, the woman's breathing grew noticeably rapid.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, "Madam, although these bottles likely contain pills, after so long it's uncertain how many remain effective; perhaps they are all ruined. Better not to expect too much."

Upon hearing this, the woman's excitement visibly cooled, and she nodded slightly. "Young brother, you are right—let's inspect them first."

"Madam, please go ahead!" Yang Kai gestured.

The woman nodded and lifted a jade bottle, opened it, and poured out seven or eight pills. But when those pills came into view, disappointment showed on her face.

Those seven or eight pills had become lumps like clods of earth, utterly lacking fragrance and entirely bereft of medicinal effect!

The pills were indeed all ruined.

"Unlucky!" the woman laughed self-mockingly, her eyes moist as she looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai casually picked up another jade bottle, opened it, and poured out seven or eight pills. When these appeared, the two of them instantly brightened.

Among them one pill gave off a heady scent and glowed fiery red, its surface marked with vein-like patterns resembling a human meridian.

Pill patterns!

Only pills that grow pill patterns can be stored long-term without losing efficacy. Pills without patterns will see their effects fade with time, no matter how well stored.

Though only one of the seven or eight pills was usable, it was a promising start, and that pill's grade was clearly high. For a moment the woman could not identify exactly which pill it was.

"It's a Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill!" Yang Kai raised his brow in surprise.

"What?" the woman changed color. "Young brother, you aren't mistaken—is this the Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill?"

She clearly had heard of the pill's name before.

"Yes, I would not be mistaken; I myself am also an alchemist and know a bit more than most about pills. This is certainly the Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill!" Yang Kai explained.

The woman sized Yang Kai up and said in astonishment, "My eyes were poor—I did not realize young brother was an alchemist. Please forgive my earlier offenses."

Learning Yang Kai's alchemist identity noticeably changed her attitude, for the status of an alchemist was far higher than that of an ordinary martial artist.

"Heh heh, madam overstates it. I refine pills only as a pastime, not as mastery—just some experience," Yang Kai said modestly.
