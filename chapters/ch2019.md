## Chapter 2019 — Delivering a Message

"Great‑Grandmother, don't listen to his nonsense. If it weren't Lu Baichuan who invited him, why would he come to my Zhang Family at this time!"

Before the old matron could speak, the fat martial artist Yang Kai had bound suddenly barked a shout.

Yang Kai smiled wryly.

The old matron glared hard at the fat martial artist and snapped, "Do you think you can boss me around while I'm handling matters?"

The fat martial artist flinched and immediately protested that he dared not.

The matron then turned her gaze back to Yang Kai, swept him with her Divine Sense, and upon detecting that his cultivation far exceeded hers, her expression shifted slightly. "Your cultivation is profound. If you were truly invited by Lu Baichuan, you would not waste words on us. Very well, I believe you. I only wish to know precisely why you have come to my Zhang Family?"

"I came on another's behalf, Old Madam. Please look." Yang Kai said as he tossed a Spatial Ring toward the old matron.

She caught it, scrutinized Yang Kai, and then poured her Divine Sense into the Spatial Ring.

The next moment her face went ashen and her body trembled as if struck; she spat blood, her already aged features growing even more withered.

"You dared to ambush her?" the fat martial artist roared in fury.

It was hardly surprising he misunderstood—since the matron had changed only after receiving the ring, anyone might think Yang Kai had tampered with it to attack her.

The other women hardened their faces, looking at Yang Kai with righteous anger; their internal power surged, and some, growing impatient, even produced Secret Treasures, poised to strike.

Facing such a band of women, Yang Kai felt his scalp prickle; he took a step back to put some distance between them.

"Stop!" the matron suddenly cried out.

The women obeyed. Though displeased with Yang Kai's conduct, at the matron's command not one dared act.

"Great‑Grandmother, are you all right? Are you hurt?" the young maiden who had been supporting the matron asked anxiously, repeatedly stroking the old woman's back.

The matron shook her head, lifted her eyelids, and looked at Yang Kai with no hostility—only grief. In a desolate voice she asked, "May I ask, Young Brother, where did you obtain this Spatial Ring?"

Yang Kai moved his lips and transmitted words into the matron's ear.

She listened in stunned silence, staggered, and then gave a bitter laugh. "Fate… Although I suspected it, I did not expect it to be so."

"Mother, what happened?" a middle‑aged beauty with cultivation at the First Stage of the Void King Realm asked.

"Look at this," the matron said, handing the ring to the woman.

The woman examined it carefully and paled. When she probed the ring's inner space with her Divine Sense, tears flowed down her face.

As a relative of Zhang Gaoxuan, she recognized the items in the Spatial Ring. Now that Zhang Gaoxuan's ring had returned while he was missing, anyone could guess his fate.

Yang Kai watched this unfold, moved inwardly, but did not press; he simply stood and waited quietly as the Zhang Family absorbed the news of Zhang Gaoxuan's likely demise.

Though the others did not know the specifics, seeing the matron's and the woman's reactions, suggestions formed in their minds, and one by one their expressions darkened.

After a long while, the matron drew a deep breath and said to Yang Kai, "Esteemed guest, pardon my rudeness before—please come in and speak with us."

"Very well. I also have something to give you," Yang Kai nodded.

Under the matron's and the middle‑aged woman's guidance, Yang Kai was led into a great hall within the estate.

The others remained waiting outside; only the matron, the middle‑aged woman, and the young maiden entered. The maiden, who served the matron, never left her side and watched Yang Kai with curious eyes.

Once servants had presented tea, the matron said, "Young Brother, there was a misunderstanding earlier. Given the Zhang Family's misfortune, please do not take offense."

"It's nothing. Old Madam, please accept my condolences." Yang Kai bowed his head.

"You said you had something to give—what is it?" the matron asked.

"This." Yang Kai produced a jade slip and handed it to the matron. "Before his death, the Zhang Family head recorded some information with his Divine Sense. Old Madam can read it herself."

The matron received it, probed it with her Divine Sense, and then passed it to the middle‑aged woman without a word.

After she finished examining it, the woman ground her teeth and spat, "It was indeed that old thief Lu Baichuan who killed my husband! Mother, I will avenge him!"

Only then did Yang Kai realize the middle‑aged woman was Zhang Gaoxuan's wife, and that the matron was his mother.

Losing a son breeds tremendous grief; yet the matron had managed to compose herself quickly, which drew Yang Kai's quiet admiration.

"Vengeance must be sought, of course. But do you have the means?" the matron asked coldly.

"I may not match that old thief, but even if I die I will bite off a piece of his flesh!" the woman ground her teeth, her eyes full of hatred.

"Bold words," the matron sneered. "You may find you cannot even die as you wish and will only suffer humiliation."

At that the woman's face drained of color.

"Sit back down!" the matron struck her cane and ordered with authority.

The woman had no choice but to obey, collapsing back into her seat, her eyes hollow.

Yang Kai sighed and said, "Old Madam, may I ask whether, besides Brother Zhang's misfortune in the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda, there is any other matter?"

The matron's face darkened and she nodded. "You have seen through it, Young Brother. Our household has suffered greatly."

After a moment of silence, the matron recounted the recent calamities that had befallen the family.

In the Fenglin City region, the Zhang and Lu families had long been close; their ancestors came to Fenglin City together and built their legacies, forming ties over generations.

When the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda opened this time, the two family heads, Zhang Gaoxuan and Lu Baichuan, entered together.

After the Pagoda opened, the younger members of both families agreed to venture together for experience.

Unexpectedly, it was all a plot orchestrated by the Lu family.

In that perilous place the Zhang family's heirs were slaughtered or grievously wounded, while the Lu family returned unharmed. The Zhang Family was left largely comprised of women; the two male martial artists had been spared only because they were in seclusion at the time—otherwise there might have been no male Zhang heirs at all.

When the Pagoda closed, only Lu Baichuan returned; Zhang Gaoxuan was nowhere to be seen.

Lu Baichuan then abandoned his previous courtesy and began to press the Zhang Family, demanding one of his sons be married to Zhang Ruoxi.

With the Zhang Family head missing, they could not consent, and the matron, already distrustful of the Lu family's actions during the trial, refused outright.

Lu Baichuan tore off his pretence and tried to seize Zhang Ruoxi by force, even fighting openly at the Zhang residence.

Lu Baichuan and Zhang Gaoxuan were both at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; with the Zhang Family so bereft, they were no match. If not for the matron employing a family secret art and taking forbidden medicines to raise her strength, and together with the remaining family power, temporarily repelling Lu Baichuan, the Zhang Family might have been annihilated.

Now that Yang Kai had returned with the jade slip containing Zhang Gaoxuan's last words, the matron knew her son's death had indeed been caused by Lu Baichuan.

All previous doubts were suddenly resolved.

The matron's grief and hatred were plain to see.

Yang Kai listened in silence.

He thought this was a common method of one family engulfing another: with male heirs few, a marriage tie could be forced to absorb the weaker house, and eventually the Zhang Family would vanish from Fenglin City.

Yet he still harbored doubts.

Why would two families close for centuries suddenly turn on one another? There might be other factors at play, but he did not press further.

"Old Madam, since you have read the jade slip, you must be aware of the agreement between me and the Zhang Family head," Yang Kai said.

The matron nodded. "Gaoxuan made it clear in the jade slip: as long as you remain in Fenglin City, you will, within your ability, fulfill three requests from our Zhang Family, and once the Dao Origin Fruit is refined into a pill you will deliver a Dao Origin Pill to our Zhang Family!"

"Dao Origin Fruit?" the middle‑aged woman cried in alarm. "Did my husband obtain a Dao Origin Fruit?"

"Yes," Yang Kai nodded. "Zhang Gaoxuan did obtain a Dao Origin Fruit in the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda. It is now in my possession; it was part of our agreement."

The matron glanced at the woman and snorted coldly, "Possessing treasure invites envy. Our Zhang Family cannot protect such an item, and now it belongs to this Young Brother."

The woman composed herself and said respectfully, "Mother, your admonition is understood."

The matron turned to Yang Kai and said, "Young Brother, rest assured: regarding the Dao Origin Fruit, only the four of us know. Thank you for coming to honor your promise; I am grateful and hold great respect for your character, and will not trouble you further."
