## Chapter 258 — Birth of Divine Sense

In this foreign land, there were neither sun nor moon, and the passage of time was unknown. Most of the time, Yang Kai relied on his instincts to deduce how long it had been.

After cultivating in the white mist for about half a month, Yang Kai finally successfully advanced to the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm!

This was not solely the result of his hard work; it was also due to the absorption of over eighty Blood Beads obtained when he parted ways with Chen Xueshu and the others.

Most of these Blood Beads were from Demonic Beasts, with only five belonging to True Yuan Realm experts, containing extraordinary energy.

Having absorbed such a vast amount of energy and after half a month of cultivation, it was natural for him to advance. Moreover, he had significantly solidified his foundation at the Ninth Stage, heading straight towards the True Yuan Realm.

During this half month, Yang Kai had gradually grown accustomed to the pain in his mind, even able to ignore it. Although the sensation of pain still existed, it was no longer sufficient to affect him.

As he repaired the damage, his Divine Sense gradually grew stronger, and his perception expanded immensely.

After half a month, Yang Kai began searching for a way out.

Since cultivating Divine Sense required no effort from him, the surrounding white mist would attack on its own, and the Warm Spirit Lotus would actively repair itself. Whether he cared or not, the outcome would be the same.

After exploring for several days, he still found himself surrounded by white mist, with no path ahead and no one behind.

The situation was dire, and Yang Kai felt a sense of urgency in his heart. He even activated his Wings of Yang Flame, yet still could not escape this strange place.

One day, while exploring, Yang Kai suddenly sensed some changes in the white mist around him. This subtle change was so faint that it would have gone unnoticed without careful investigation. It was only after his perception had strengthened that he was able to detect it; otherwise, he would have missed it half a month ago.

He paused his steps and observed closely.

After a while, Yang Kai confirmed that the white mist around him was slowly gathering towards a fixed direction. Although he did not know why this was happening, after searching for so long, he finally made a discovery and would not let any clue slip by.

Following the direction of the flowing white mist, as he ventured deeper, the speed of the mist's movement increased, faintly accompanied by the sound of wind, as if something ahead was absorbing the mist.

Yang Kai remained vigilant, moving cautiously and slowly closer.

In a short while, a whimpering sound reached his ears, resembling cold wind rushing through a hole.

His spirit was focused to the utmost, and his perception was heightened to its limit. Yang Kai carefully approached the source of the sound.

Moments later, he frowned as he spotted a uniquely shaped stone standing not far from him. The direction the white mist flowed towards was a small hole on this stone.

The stone seemed to have a mouth, actively sucking in the white mist.

After confirming there was no danger, Yang Kai gradually relaxed and approached with a calm demeanor. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that the stone was hollow; the white mist flowed in from above and exited through a small hole below, creating the whimpering sound. It was quite peculiar.

Curiously circling the stone, Yang Kai realized it was not ordinary.

The surface of the stone bore traces of having been attacked, with only faint scratches, showing no signs of cracking.

These marks were undoubtedly left by someone attacking it. Anyone who could reach this place must at least be a True Yuan Realm martial artist. Yet, the attacks from a True Yuan Realm martial artist had only left faint scratches; this stone was certainly remarkable.

If it were an ordinary stone, it would have been shattered to pieces by a True Yuan Realm martial artist's attack.

Having formed a plan in his mind, Yang Kai tested an attack on the stone and found it to be true. The palm strike he unleashed with all his strength could not even budge it.

Although he knew this stone was a treasure, Yang Kai could only sigh in frustration. Such a large stone must weigh at least several thousand pounds, if not more, and he certainly could not carry it away.

As he sighed, Yang Kai's gaze was drawn to the lower part of the stone, and he slowly crouched down.

Under the small hole from which the white mist flowed, there was a tiny pit, about the size of a soybean. At this moment, a drop of crystal-clear liquid, resembling amber, was present in this pit.

Leaning closer to sniff, he was greeted by a fragrant aroma that invigorated his spirit, far surpassing the comfort he felt when the Warm Spirit Lotus repaired his soul.

A treasure! Although Yang Kai did not yet know what this drop of liquid was, it was undoubtedly a treasure, one that would greatly benefit his soul!

Looking at the drop, Yang Kai's eyes were filled with greed.

He extended a finger, carefully controlling his Yuan Qi, and extracted the drop of amber liquid from the pit.

Before he could examine it closely, the surrounding white mist suddenly surged, entering the small hole above the stone at a speed several times faster than before.

However, this time, the mist that entered the hole did not come out again. Instead, under the influence of some mysterious force, it all poured into the tiny pit, disappearing without a trace.

Yang Kai observed everything with astonishment.

Gradually, it seemed that a layer of mist formed within the soybean-sized pit, and a thread of amber-colored essence began to condense at the bottom.

Could it be that this drop of liquid he held was formed from the white mist under these natural conditions?

Though it was just a guess, given the current situation, Yang Kai estimated it was highly likely true.

Initially, he wanted to store this drop of treasure, but now that he knew it could be formed again, he was less concerned.

After some thought, Yang Kai directly swallowed the drop of amber liquid.

It tasted sweet, like nectar, and he distinctly felt the liquid transform into a surge of energy that flowed directly into his Dantian, disregarding the burning of True Yang Yuan Qi, racing up through his meridians towards the top of his head.

In an instant, he felt as light as a feather, as if floating in the clouds, with an indescribable sense of comfort spreading from within. Every part of his body, every cell, rejoiced.

His mind was clearer than ever before!

Feeling, vision, and hearing were all amplified many times over in that moment.

Looking around, Yang Kai could even see every blade of grass and tree over a hundred zhang away.

In this place shrouded in clouds and mist, he could previously only see about ten zhang away, and even that was blurry. But now, his visual ability had increased tenfold!

His hearing and other senses had also significantly improved!

Knowing he had consumed something extraordinary, Yang Kai did not dare to be negligent. He quickly sat cross-legged, maintaining his focus, and began to refine the energy from the drop of amber liquid.

As the energy spread and was absorbed, more and more benefits followed. First, he could sense the traces and movements of the external world’s energy flowing into his body, and he could grasp the dynamics of his internal organs.

After this wave of sensation passed, a strange, indescribable feeling arose in his mind, somewhat itchy, as if an invisible barrier was obstructing his consciousness, making him want to scratch but unable to reach it. Yang Kai felt a surge of frustration, helpless and furious.

This layer of barrier even shielded his own perception.

This state persisted for a long time until suddenly, the barrier was broken through.

The itchy sensation was instantly replaced by a refreshing feeling, and Yang Kai felt his spirit undergo an indescribable cleansing and elevation.

His original perception simultaneously evolved and upgraded, transforming into an invisible eye that rapidly contracted and then exploded outward.

Wherever it passed, centered around himself, the surrounding white mist and every blade of grass and tree were vividly imprinted in his mind, clear as day.

In a radius of two to three li, nothing was missed.

Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, a strange look flashing across them as he fell into deep thought.

After a long while, he revealed a peculiar smile, his eyes shining brightly.

“Di Mo... I fear I have cultivated Divine Sense!” Yang Kai said softly.

“What?” Di Mo exclaimed in shock, “Young Master, you can't be mistaken, right?”

“No, I truly have cultivated Divine Sense,” Yang Kai replied, his smile growing more pronounced as he recounted his recent experiences and observations.

Upon hearing this, Di Mo was nearly rendered speechless, staring at Yang Kai in awe for a long time.

“If this is true... then it must be Divine Sense without a doubt!” Di Mo’s tone was filled with shock and admiration. To see everything around him with closed eyes—what else could it be but Divine Sense?

Before reaching the Divine Roaming Realm, martial artists relied on their perception to sense the movements around them. This perception was quite ethereal and could be considered a kind of instinct, but this instinct could be strengthened through training. It utilized one’s own strength, hearing, vision, and sometimes even required the combination of the surrounding air's aura to deduce nearby situations.

Perception was not infallible and could easily lead to errors. However, before reaching the Divine Roaming Realm, this was the only method available to gain unseen information.

Advancing to the Divine Roaming Realm was different; one cultivated Divine Sense, and with a thought, it spread out, revealing the surrounding situation clearly, as if seen with one’s own eyes.

Compared to the ethereal perception, the power of Divine Sense was undoubtedly much stronger. This strength was not only reflected in scouting for enemies; a powerful Divine Sense could also be used to attack, catching opponents off guard.

However... Divine Sense could only be cultivated by experts of the Divine Roaming Realm. What realm was the Young Master in? He was merely at the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm!

There was a significant gap of a Realm and a Stage like a watershed in between!

Even though Di Mo had witnessed Yang Kai's mystery and strength countless times during their time together, he found it hard to accept at this moment.

“Since the Young Master has cultivated Divine Sense, then you must also have a Sea of Consciousness?” Di Mo asked.

“No!” Yang Kai replied, puzzled. He was aware of the Sea of Consciousness and had carefully examined it for a while, confirming that he did not possess one.

“How could that be?” Di Mo exclaimed, pondering for a moment before asking, “Young Master, can you see clearly inside your body, especially in your mind? You have a Warm Spirit Lotus in your mind; if you can see it, it means you already have a Sea of Consciousness.”

“I can’t see it,” Yang Kai frowned. “It seems I can only observe external situations.”
