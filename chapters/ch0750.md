## Chapter 750 — Court of Divine Battle

After a moment's observation to give everyone time to prepare, the Cheng elder once again brought his great hand down.

Whistles and hisses filled the air as countless violent energies thundered against the invisible barrier; determined to break it quickly and search the palace beyond, this time no one held back — even Yang Kai exerted a sliver of his true ability.

If the barrier were in pristine condition, with the cultivation levels present here, even decades of effort would likely not have sufficed to breach it.

But this ancient ruin had stood for too many years; its sealing formations had long since weakened, and this barrier was no exception.

When a second, denser wave of strikes slammed into it, the barrier caved inward far more than before, and this time it seemed to have reached its limit.

Crack...

Dozens of faint fissures split across the air, and they quickly spidered outward until still more cracks appeared before everyone's eyes.

The crowd cried out in astonishment and watched intently, every pair of eyes brimming with anticipation.

With a crisp shattering like glass breaking, the invisible barrier abruptly ruptured.

The moment the barrier gave way, as if anticipating the chance, every cultivator present sprang into action; without waiting for the Transcendent elders to issue orders, they all used their mobility arts and lunged forward.

The Transcendent leaders did the same. Experts of the Seven Families Alliance reached greedily toward the sphere before their bodies had even arrived, eager to snatch it into their hands.

Suddenly, a torrent of overt and covert infighting erupted among the people who had just been working together.

True Yuan surged and cultivators shoved and elbowed, each terrified of falling behind.

Yang Kai remained motionless, watching the shifting situation with cool vigilance; the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land likewise did not move, and many others of cautious temperament stood their ground.

They knew their strength was insufficient; charging in might not secure the mysterious treasure, and instinct warned them of danger ahead. Better to let others test the waters first.

Sure enough, before those who rushed forward could reach the glowing orb, a pure white aura suddenly expanded outward from the sphere, carrying a strange, uncanny energy that flashed like lightning.

The charging cultivators' faces changed; even prepared as they were, the aura left them momentarily unready.

No one reacted in time — as the aura appeared, it wrapped around them.

In an instant their movements stiffened and they pancaked to the ground like tumbling gourds, utterly devoid of strength to resist.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; without thinking he retreated at speed.

As the aura swept over the front-line cultivators, Yang Kai sensed streams of energies of varying strengths being stripped from their bodies and absorbed into the sphere.

Even with Yang Kai's speed, he could not fully outrun the aura's pursuit; only a short distance after his retreat the white glow had already enveloped him.

His soul quivered; his Sea of Consciousness churned violently. Yang Kai felt the ground and sky tilt and had the illusion his soul was about to be peeled away.

He would not be careless. He steadied his posture, held his breath, and stabilized the turmoil within his soul.

Hastily looking around, he saw that those cautious cultivators who had refrained from scrambling were not spared — every one of them, like Hai Wangu and the rest, lay fallen on the ground.

Even the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had not escaped.

She seemed to endure for a while; before collapsing she glanced faintly at Yang Kai and her lips quivered, as if trying to speak.

Yang Kai guessed she had been pleading for help.

There was no time to attend to her. Yang Kai himself was barely holding on as the mysterious aura swallowed him, feeling his soul gripped by an unseen hand seeking to pull it out of his Sea of Consciousness.

His mind shook; he had no idea what profundity lay within this force, and he plunged his spirit deep into his Sea of Consciousness.

The World-Ending Demon Eye flared open instantly, yet even that could not avert the calamity.

In less than ten breaths, Yang Kai's vision blurred and his soul slipped free from his Sea of Consciousness, entering a vast, white-washed realm.

One apparition after another manifested before him, each face filled with panic and shock as they looked around without understanding.

These figures were all spirit-body manifestations — the very cultivators who had been gathered earlier — every one of them, a hundred or so souls, stood there.

“Hey!” A shout sounded from the side. Yang Kai turned alert and saw the Saintess hiding in a neglected corner, beckoning to him.

He frowned and, urged by her, walked over.

She too was a spirit-body now, half-illusory, revealing her true form now that disguises were gone.

“Do you know where this place is?” the Saintess asked softly as she scanned their surroundings.

“How should I know?” Yang Kai frowned; he had guesses but could not be sure.

“You seemed to withstand this longer than anyone. Your true power is more than Seventh Stage Divine Roaming, isn’t it?” the Saintess said, scrutinizing him, surprise flashing across her beautiful eyes. “Eh — your spirit-body is…”

Standing closer to Yang Kai, she sensed a scorching aura radiating from him.

Yang Kai glanced at her coldly.

The Saintess smiled and pursed her lips. “Relax, I won't blab. You must have cultivated some special soul technique, right?”

“In a manner of speaking.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, not elaborating. Normally he hid his Divine Sense Fire; even when using Divine Sense in battle, as long as he did not unleash Divine Sense Fire others could be deceived. But with his spirit-body drawn from the Sea of Consciousness, traces of scorching remained.

He cast a sidelong look at the Saintess and felt a flash of astonishment.

Her corporeal body possessed a mysterious force that had blocked Yang Kai’s probing, so he had not known her true cultivation before. Now, in spirit-body form, her level was plain to see.

First Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

She was not much older than him yet already at that level — the Nine Heavens Sacred Land truly was formidable.

“I think we'd better watch each other's backs, don't you agree?” the Saintess suggested. She had assumed a large group could handle a dive like this, but repeated unexpected dangers had made her realize the ancient ruins contained threats she could not withstand alone.

Now that their spirit-bodies were trapped here, she naturally wanted an ally.

“I don't take on liabilities,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head.

The Saintess snorted. “You're arrogant as hell. You haven't seen what I can do — how do you know I’d be a burden? Maybe you'll be my burden. If danger comes, who'll be looking after whom?”

“Then show me what you can do,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “If I’m impressed, I’ll consider teaming up.”

The Saintess's face chilled and she huffed, unwilling to speak further.

Though she had little contact with male peers growing up, she never expected to meet someone so obnoxiously proud as Yang Kai.

He behaved as if he were the greatest under heaven and others were beneath him.

Insufferable.

While the two spoke, the Seven Families Alliance and their summoned warriors whispered among themselves, trying to make sense of the situation.

“Look up there!” a cry rang out and everyone raised their heads.

In the white void a few golden characters shimmered brilliantly.

Court of Divine Battle!

The four characters were bold and vigorous, etched not by ordinary means but carved in Divine Sense itself.

Even after countless years, the grave majesty radiating from those characters had not dimmed; a single glance struck terror into the onlookers, who quickly averted their eyes as if further gazes would annihilate their spirit-bodies.

“Court of Divine Battle? Could this be a place for Divine Sense combat?”

“Then the sphere might be a Divine Soul Secret Treasure?”

“Were our spirit-bodies drawn here to fight?”

Voices rose and fell as everyone pieced together the implications, matching Yang Kai’s own suspicions.

Hai Wangu waved his hand and commanded calm: “If this truly is inside a Secret Treasure and our spirit-bodies have been forced here, then to escape we must first find an exit. Meanwhile, search for any hidden mechanisms!”

On his orders the crowd split up and began searching.

The white void seemed vast and empty, but once they moved it became clear the space was bizarre.

No matter how far they walked they could not break free of the few-li radius; they kept circling within the same area.

They searched and searched but found no suspicious traces, and morale sank.

The Transcendents of the Seven Families also scoured the area, their Divine Sense streaming outward, but no matter how they probed, the white space felt like a sealed chamber with no corner unguarded, imprisoning them and sealing every exit.

“Have you found anything?” the Saintess suddenly returned to Yang Kai’s side, as though the earlier unpleasantness between them had been blown away into the clouds.
