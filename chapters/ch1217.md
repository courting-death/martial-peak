## Chapter 1217 — Snow Silkworm Silk

Snow silkworms are rare; they can only survive in extreme cold. The larvae do not spin silk at first — only after two or three hundred years do they mature and begin to spin, once every ten years in tiny amounts. To refine a Secret Treasure from such silk requires at least centuries of accumulation.

That a woman named Daiyuan could possess a Secret Treasure forged from Snow Silkworm Silk made Yang Kai look at her with newfound respect.

She was acquainted with Wei Guchang and Xuan'er and held such a precious item — her status could not be low.

While Yang Kai pondered her background, Daiyuan had already reached the edge of the lava lake. Her brows knitted as she stared at the molten sea, probing it constantly with her Divine Sense. After a long while she solemnly produced her Snow Silkworm Silk Secret Treasure.

She flicked a finger and a hair-thin, almost invisible strand of snow-white silk snapped out from her fingertip, flying a dozen or so zhang.

But that distance was far from enough; the Turtle Shell holding Wei Guchang and the others sat at least thirty zhang from shore. The silk fell halfway and plunged into the lava, where the ice-cold force within it collided violently with the searing heat, white steam billowing up and rendering a vast area nearly impassable.

Daiyuan's face grew even graver. Holding the silk's end, she poured Saint Yuan into it to resist the lava's force while guiding her Snow Silkworm Silk to extend toward Wei Guchang and the others.

Everyone watched tensely; the five on the Turtle Shell were especially anxious.

Although Snow Silkworm Silk is an ice-attribute Secret Treasure, whether it could withstand the molten heat was uncertain. After all, the Secret Treasures belonging to Wei Guchang and the others had been damaged here more than once; nearly every person had one or two Secret Treasures burned, some even Origin-Grade.

If even a treasure like Snow Silkworm Silk could not break the lava blockade, then they truly could only wait to die.

Amid the roiling steam, Daiyuan bit her red lip and executed some shifting seals. The cold within the silk suddenly surged, suppressing the lava's heat.

Crackling sounds rang out.

Visibly, an icebound path sprouted across the lava lake. Only a finger's width, it nonetheless stretched toward Wei Guchang and the others at great speed.

Everyone rejoiced. They could clearly see that the frozen path was produced by the ice energy within the Snow Silkworm Silk freezing the lava, with the slender strand of silk concealed inside the ice.

In the blink of an eye the ice path extended about ten zhang, but then its advance abruptly slowed.

Yang Kai, who had been watching Daiyuan closely, noticed an abnormal flush pass across her face — she was clearly faltering.

Sure enough, the ice path crawled forward more and more slowly. When only ten zhang remained between it and the Turtle Shell it could not move another inch; worse, it began to rapidly melt.

The five waiting on the Turtle Shell paled. Wei Guchang and Xuan'er recovered their composure more quickly, but the other three Yingyue Hall disciples fell into fresh despair.

They had assumed rescue would be easy and placed great confidence in Daiyuan; seeing her struggle made their hearts churn.

Across the thirty-odd zhang, Daiyuan and Xuan'er exchanged anxious looks. Xuan'er was not so worried for her own safety as she was fearful Daiyuan might do something to seriously damage her Yuan Qi.

Daiyuan bared her silver teeth, a look of resolve crossing her face. She bit through her own tongue and a spray of blood misted onto her Snow Silkworm Silk, instantly turning the pure white thread crimson. The icy aura exploded in intensity, freezing the melting path anew, and the previously stalled silk finally shot forward again, re-freezing the lava along its route.

Yang Kai's brow tightened as he watched Daiyuan. After she spat her Essence-Blood he acted.

He could see that even if Daiyuan damaged her own Essence-Blood to drive the silk, she might not be able to deliver the strand into Wei Guchang's hands. Even if she did, given their present condition they could not grasp the silk to save themselves.

This silkworm thread was unimaginably sharp and cold to the bone — something Wei Guchang, in his current state, could never hope to withstand.

So he had to go. Riding the ice path born of the silk, Yang Kai was confident he could make it across.

The frozen trail surged toward the Turtle Shell. Yang Kai moved like thunder, stepping onto the path and sprinting across.

Seeing this, a trace of feeling flickered in Wei Guchang's eyes. Clever as he was, he knew Yang Kai's intent and only warned, "Brother Yang, don't underestimate the Snow Silkworm Silk. Even if Daiyuan Junior Sister isn't targeting you, that cold and edge are not easily borne."

"I know," Yang Kai replied lightly. He had already reached the path's end; now it was only about five zhang from the Turtle Shell, though its speed had again slowed.

Yang Kai did not wait for Daiyuan to guide the Secret Treasure. He gathered a layer of jet Demonic Flame about his body and thrust a hand toward the path's end.

Crack! He tore a hole in the ice path, and when he withdrew his hand he was holding a glowing length of Snow Silkworm Silk.

Everyone gaped; even Daiyuan was struck dumb by Yang Kai's wild action, her eyes full of astonishment and disbelief.

Ordinary martial artists couldn't even touch the silk without their bodies going rigid from the cold. Yet Yang Kai actually gripped it — his hand was not frozen or severed; only droplets of golden blood trickled from between his fingers.

Daiyuan was no ordinary woman either. After a brief shock she reacted and fully cooperated, causing her Snow Silkworm Silk to extend without cease.

Earlier it had been difficult for her to extend the silk within the lava because of the searing heat's interference. Now that Yang Kai held it, she could easily employ all manner of techniques.

The Snow Silkworm Silk shot out endlessly. Yang Kai gripped one end while stamping on the lava to form a Vast Heaven Shield beneath his feet. He leapt from the ice trail, stood on his shield, and immediately took another stride.

Each time his foot fell another Vast Heaven Shield formed to catch him, only to shatter as he moved on. The scene was unbearably tense — the five Yingyue Hall disciples watched Yang Kai with clenched nerves, fearing one misstep would send him into the lava.

With only five zhang to go, Yang Kai took a dozen or so strides and landed upon the Turtle Shell. Wei Guchang and the others had already made room for him.

Once on the shell Yang Kai nodded to Wei Guchang, then bound the Turtle Shell with the Snow Silkworm Silk. When he was satisfied it was secure he looked at Wei Guchang and said, "I can bring two people back. Who goes with me?"

Wei Guchang didn't hesitate, pointing to the tall woman and the younger-looking male disciple: "Take them back."

Xuan'er also inclined her head in agreement.

Yang Kai nodded, grabbing one of them with each arm. Standing on the Turtle Shell he signaled to Daiyuan on the shore. Daiyuan's expression turned solemn; with Saint Yuan she snapped the Snow Silkworm Silk taut and Yang Kai stepped onto it, returning along the strand.

Using the Vast Heaven Shield as stepping stones was only a makeshift measure. The lava's temperature was so extreme that even the shield could only appear for an instant; one slip and he'd fall into the lake. Yang Kai had risked everything to dash over; on the return he would rather be slashed and bloodied by the silk than attempt that desperate leap again.

The male disciple tucked under Yang Kai's arm looked deathly pale, eyes wide, staring fixedly at the molten sea beneath them.

The tall female clung to Yang Kai tightly, her body pressed close; the fullness of her chest showed astonishing resilience. Her eyes were shut — she would rather perish in a muddled stupor than face the lava.

Men and women react to danger in starkly different ways.

In an instant Yang Kai was back on shore and set the two Yingyue Hall disciples down. Both panted heavily; the woman patted her heaving chest, relieved to have survived.

After Yang Kai returned, Daiyuan tried to drag the Turtle Shell but found it rooted in the lava as if it had grown there. No matter how she poured Saint Yuan into it, she could not budge it.

Helpless, she looked at Yang Kai's bloodied feet with a pleading expression.

Of all those present she needed someone who could stretch the Snow Silkworm Silk into a straight line to form a simple passage. Wei Guchang and the others were spent and could not get ashore themselves; the only one who could save them was Yang Kai.

Yet Yang Kai had clearly suffered some wounds, and Daiyuan hesitated, uncertain whether sending him again would cost him his feet.

The woman had clearly underestimated Yang Kai's resilience. The silk's sharpness had indeed cut him, but it could not deliver a mortal blow.

The wounds on his hands and soles had already been restored; Golden Blood's restorative power was exceptionally strong, and even the chill within the Snow Silkworm Silk had long since been driven from him. It no longer affected him in the slightest.
