## Chapter 390 — Return to Zhongdu

The little movements orchestrated by the two Blood Servants were naturally undetectable to Yang Kai's keen senses.

The speed of their advance slightly slowed, and after the two of them caught up, Yang Kai turned his head to glance at them, his expression indifferent as he asked, "Are you curious?"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian both nodded seriously.

"What’s there to be curious about?" Yang Kai replied with a casual smile, his demeanor as calm as ever, showing no signs of regret or remorse.

"Young Master, how could you just let Miss Qiu go? The Qiu Family's influence is not weak; if they could lend a hand in the battle for succession, whether in resources or talents, it would be assured!" Tu Feng directly inquired without any hesitation.

Both he and Tang Yuxian had already made up their minds that as long as the family allowed the Blood Servants to participate in the battle for succession, they would follow Yang Kai, no longer maintaining their previous detachment and turning a blind eye to Yang Kai's actions.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, replying gently, "Qiu Yimeng still has her reservations. She doesn't dare to take a stand right now; even if I put forth all my efforts, the outcome would be the same."

"Is that so?" Tu Feng expressed shock, his face reflecting disbelief. "But it appeared that she showed great interest in you all along, and she seems to quite like you. She spoke highly of you in front of me and Yuxian."

"Indeed," Tang Yuxian slightly nodded in agreement.

"Like me?" Yang Kai looked at Tu Feng in astonishment, laughing in disbelief. "Tu Feng, if you truly think that, then you are too naive!"

Tu Feng was no longer a young boy; hearing Yang Kai say that made his face flush slightly.

"Perhaps, my performance may have caught her attention, showing that I am better than many other young men." Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, exuding confidence. "But that doesn't mean she likes me."

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian frowned slightly, still not fully convinced by Yang Kai's reasoning.

Yang Kai smiled gently, "What kind of person is Qiu Yimeng? She is the young lady of the Qiu Family, the foremost among the younger generation of the Qiu Family! Let me ask you, is someone of her status able to make her own decisions for the future?"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian thought for a moment, their brows knitting together.

Qiu Yimeng, pursued by countless admirers, was undoubtedly a prominent figure in Zhongdu.

Yet, despite the flood of suitors, Qiu Yimeng remained chaste, never engaging in any romantic entanglements with any young men in Zhongdu.

The reason was simple: the Qiu Family's patriarch, Qiu Shoucheng, had stated that anyone wishing to marry Qiu Yimeng would have to merge into the Qiu Family!

At first glance, this seemed like Qiu Shoucheng cherishing his daughter, not wanting her to leave the Qiu Family.

However, in reality, the Qiu Family did not wish to miss out on an opportunity to draw in potential support for their own family!

In short, Qiu Yimeng's future was not in her hands. In all likelihood, she was destined to become a pawn in a marriage alliance that would benefit the Qiu Family.

Moreover, the ideological education she had received since childhood was probably rooted in the supremacy of the family.

Her personal feelings, marriage, and childbearing matters would all be arranged by the Qiu Family, leaving her without the power to decide.

Given that education, how could she easily choose to stand with Yang Kai before the battle for succession even began? If she made such a rash decision, the Qiu Family would certainly not recognize it!

"Don't believe me?" Yang Kai tilted his head, gazing at the two Blood Servants.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian remained silent.

"Her not returning to Zhongdu with us is the best evidence!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly. "If she truly decided to ally with me, she wouldn't care what others thought."

"So don’t say whether she likes me, for she has always viewed me as a potential ally, as the legitimate disciple of the Yang Family! Just as a possibility…" Yang Kai's expression turned serious, "If someone is more outstanding than me, I believe the Qiu Family will undoubtedly make them my enemies!"

The two Blood Servants couldn't help but feel a sense of gravity in their hearts. Although they felt Yang Kai's perspective was somewhat extreme, they had to admit that children of prominent families often did not prioritize romantic feelings.

Having been nurtured in the family’s atmosphere since childhood, they always considered the interests of the family and themselves first, while matters of romance were secondary!

"Understood," Tu Feng slightly nodded.

Not being in their position, they couldn’t meddle in family affairs. Although the Blood Servants were powerful, they indeed found it challenging to comprehend the mindsets of those young masters and ladies from noble families.

Yang Kai nodded to himself, feeling calm, and chose not to say more.

An hour later, the three finally arrived at Zhongdu.

The city of Zhongdu was immense, naturally having countless city gates.

Before the three stood the South Gate!

There were no bustling commoners or an overwhelming number of martial artists; the gigantic South Gate stood there like a massive beast's mouth, shrouded in tranquility, with only a few capable martial artists standing guard, scanning their surroundings with relaxed expressions.

This South Gate was not for just anyone to pass through.

It was exclusively reserved for the Yang Family in Zhongdu.

Each of the Eight Great Families had their own dedicated city gate.

Once one entered the gate, it led directly to the path that connected to the Yang Family.

Aside from members of the Eight Great Families, no one else was allowed to use these gates and passages; violators would be killed without mercy!

The guards stationed at the South Gate were merely family members put there for show; they had no tasks to perform, hence they were quite relaxed.

When the three approached the gate, the guards snapped to attention, their expressions serious as they looked their way.

Upon spotting the tokens at the waists of the two Blood Servants, they all cupped their fists in greeting, showing reverence and respect.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian maintained indifferent expressions, avoiding eye contact, and followed closely behind Yang Kai, striding into Zhongdu!

Once the three had passed, the guards dared to glance back, their expressions filled with uncertainty.

"Which young master has returned? He looks quite young, only seeming to be about seventeen or eighteen years old."

"A seventeen or eighteen-year-old young master... Is it the youngest one?"

"Isn't the youngest master said to be unable to cultivate? He might still be an ordinary person! Yet, why does he seem so steady, almost extraordinary?"

"Whether he's ordinary or not is none of our business; just keep an eye on the gate."

"Right, don’t say these things behind their backs; it would be bad if a master from the family hears us. Speaking of which, isn’t this the first young master to return?"

"Yes, the others haven't returned yet!"

...

Yang Kai and the two Blood Servants walked through the passage for less than the time it takes to burn a stick of incense when they encountered a large group of people idly waiting ahead.

This group was quite large, numbering around ten people. Leading them was a stout, round-faced man, standing less than six feet high, his big belly jutting out as he paced back and forth. It seemed he had been walking for quite some time, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead, and he occasionally wiped his face and neck with a handkerchief.

Suddenly seeing the three approach, the stout man froze for a moment before his face broke into a broad grin. He hurriedly tucked away the handkerchief, straightened his expression, and prepared to welcome them.

Yang Kai and the two Blood Servants stopped about five zhang away from the rotund man, who looked at them with a frown of confusion.

This man evidently was not from the main Yang Family but an outside relative, and his strength wasn’t particularly high. However, since he was waiting here, it was clear it was an arrangement from the family. Yang Kai was unsure what the family was up to.

“Esteemed guests, thank you for your long journey!” The stout man first gave a grand bow to Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, his squinty eyes almost closing in a smile as he turned to look at Yang Kai, curiosity shining in his gaze. “Esteemed guests, forgive my lack of discernment; may I ask which young master this is?”

Tu Feng, expression unchanged, said calmly, “This Young Master is the son of the Fourth Master.”

The stout man’s expression showed slight surprise; the young masters rarely appeared at home, so it was no wonder he did not recognize him. Tu Feng naturally had no intention of pressing the matter.

The stout man displayed a slightly surprised expression, as though he hadn't expected that the first to return to the family would be the Young Master, but he quickly gathered himself. He and the people behind him cupped their fists together, bowing deeply, and said, "I am Yin Tianyou, a third-ranked steward, here on the family's orders to warmly welcome the Young Master back to the clan. Young Master, your journey must have been arduous these past few years!"

A third-ranked steward held an intermediate position within the Yang Family, neither too high nor too low. However, the stout man Yin Tianyou's strength was rather unimpressive and probably did not stem from a martial background.

Given the size of the Yang Family, they needed various capable individuals to help manage affairs, and these people did not necessarily have to be the strongest; their talents in different fields were what mattered.

However, which role Yin Tianyou played in the family was a mystery, since he had been assigned to await the returning young masters.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly as he smiled warmly at Yin Tianyou and said, "You've worked hard, Steward Yin. Have you been waiting here for several days?"

Yin Tianyou was greatly surprised to find Yang Kai so amiable. His small eyes widened in excitement, a broad smile spreading across his face as he humbly replied, "It is my honor to await the young masters' return; even if I had to wait many more days, it would not be troublesome."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and inquired, "What arrangements does the clan have for us?"

The Yang Family was different from ordinary families; the trials faced by the legitimate offspring were almost ruthless, so the elders within the family wouldn't typically demonstrate kindness to the juniors.

In the past, when the legitimate children of the Yang Family returned, they would go directly back to their residences, with no one waiting to greet them.

But this time, a third-ranked steward was waiting here, clearly indicating the family had made other arrangements.

Catching the hint in Yang Kai’s question, Yin Tianyou couldn’t help but feel surprised. "Young Master, you truly possess great insight, which I respect."

Tu Feng coldly interjected, "No need for flattery; just answer the Young Master’s question directly."

"Understood," Yin Tianyou still wore a smiling face, displaying no hint of embarrassment, as he straightened his posture and said, "The clan has instructed that the Young Masters returning to the family are not to rush back to their residences; instead, they must first pay a visit to the Transformation Dragon Pool." 

"The Transformation Dragon Pool!" Tu Feng exclaimed, astonished.

Yang Kai's expression mirrored the surprise, while Tang Yuxian's eyes sparkled with brilliance, filled with excitement.

It seemed that no one had anticipated that the family had prepared such a grand welcome for the returning young masters.
