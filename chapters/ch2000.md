## Chapter 2000 — Scam

A mysterious beam of light suddenly shot forth from the Dragon Ascension Altar, its aim fixed on the retreating figure.

The man's face changed dramatically; without a second thought he fled even faster, his body flashing with light as if he had unleashed every defensive power he possessed.

But no matter how fast he ran, he could not outrun the altar's power; within the span of a single breath the beam had closed in on him and pierced his body. The countless layers of defense he had relied on proved as fragile as paper in the face of that light.

"Ah..." A miserable scream rang out as he crashed to the ground with a thud, his flesh and bones smashed to pieces like those earlier warriors slain by the beam—an utterly tragic death.

The surrounding people all went pale with shock.

After all, from the moment Yang Kai acted until these two died one after another, barely three breaths had passed.

In the brief span of three breaths, two peak experts of the Void King Realm at the first tier had consecutively fallen. Whatever Secret Treasure or technique Yang Kai had used was proof of his might and of how untouchable he was.

In an instant, the gazes of the fighters near Yang Kai changed tone, filled with dread and apprehension. They deliberately put distance between themselves and him, signaling that they did not wish to make an enemy of him.

This outcome was exactly what Yang Kai intended. With a flick of his wrist he sheathed the Soul-Severing Blade and strode forward brazenly, treating the surrounding fighters as nothing—insolent to the extreme.

Suddenly, a high, resonant roar burst forth from the crowd—part dragon's cry, part beast's bellow.

Faces shifted in alarm. Everyone turned toward the sound's origin. The next moment, their expressions froze.

At that spot, a man in brocade who looked to be about thirty had somehow invoked a secret art; his whole body turned an intense crimson, as though he had been roasted like a giant prawn, radiating waves of heat. Above his head a scarlet illusory jiao appeared.

The jiao's phantom nearly solidified, baring fangs and claws. With a slight motion it suddenly shot downward and dove into the man's body.

In the next instant, the man's aura surged abruptly, and the qi radiating from him carried faint traces of draconic majesty.

"Duan Tianci! It's Duan Tianci!"

Someone shouted in surprise.

"Is he the City Lord's legitimate son?"

"It was said that when he was a child he once stumbled upon a rare opportunity and obtained the full soul of a jiao—so it was true... This is troublesome; with that jiao soul aiding him, the resistance to his advance will be greatly diminished."

Many fighters began shouting, some with unwillingness etched on their faces, others with envy, but more with apprehension.

Yang Kai immediately discerned the man's identity.

It turned out to be Duan Tianci, the legitimate son of City Lord Duan Yuanshan; the jiao phantom was evidently the soul of the jiao he had obtained years before, summoned by secret arts to counter the altar's overwhelming dragon pressure.

Although a jiao was not truly of the dragon clan, it still carried a trace of True Dragon blood; at this place and time it was perfect for resisting the dragon's oppressive might.

Duan Tianci was a patient man—he had kept this advantage hidden until he was close enough to the Dragon Ascension Altar to act first; he clearly had a grand plan.

But he was not the only one with such designs.

Just as Duan Tianci unleashed the jiao-soul to empower himself, a nearby youth roared, and a semicircular shield like a great bell materialized around him—a defensive dome in the shape of an enormous bell.

The attacks from the surrounding fighters struck him but did not faze him; his gaze burned as he stared at the treasures atop the Dragon Ascension Altar and took step after step forward.

None of those attacks could break his defense; all were repelled.

"It's the Immovable King Bell of the Blazing Fire Hall! This man is Zong Zijin, the Blazing Fire Hall's heir!"

A fighter recognized the man and the Secret Treasure he employed.

"A Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level defensive Secret Treasure—the Immovable King Bell?"

"That's cheating, how can we fight that?"

Many Void King Realm fighters protested angrily.

Although Zong Zijin's cultivation could not fully unlock the Immovable King Bell's power, that bell was still a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level defensive Secret Treasure—far beyond what an ordinary Void King Realm fighter could shatter. Only a dozen people striking together with all their strength might pose a threat.

Zong Zijin strode forward while glancing coldly at those attacking him, sneering, "I shall remember you all; when this matter is settled, I will pay you a proper visit!"

At his words, many Void King Realm faces turned suddenly pale.

"Young Lord Zong, it was a misunderstanding—my sight failed me earlier, I did not recognize you and I offended you; please forgive me. If you had announced your name sooner, I would never have attacked!" A Void King bowed hastily, terrified Zong would settle scores later.

"Me too, Young Lord Zong—old grudges should be resolved, not fostered. There's no need for you to press this."

Zong Zijin sneered repeatedly as he continued forward, then said lightly, "Very well, if it's a misunderstanding, we'll let it be. But... if anyone dares harass me again, I will not go easy on them."

"We wouldn't dare."

"Young Lord Zong, forgive us!"

The fighters were overjoyed.

Zong Zijin clearly understood this was not the time to bicker; pressing them too far and forcing a fight to the death would only hand the advantage to others, so he did not press his luck.

Aside from Duan Tianci and Zong Zijin, Yang Kai's movement was the swiftest.

By now he had exerted a little of the Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power to resist the invisible dragon pressure, so in a sense he was the most comfortable of the three.

The three advanced while assessing one another; sparks flashed in their exchanged glances.

Yet Yang Kai felt bitter inside; there was no joy. Unlike Duan Tianci and Zong Zijin, he had no patron and no background—if he tried to seize all the treasures atop the Dragon Ascension Altar by force, he would become a target for every eye.

He considered letting Duan Tianci or Zong Zijin make the first move, to share some of the pressure.

He quickly dismissed the thought—no matter how many treasures he took, people would still watch him. If that was the case, he might as well go all in.

Just as he made up his mind, Duan Tianci suddenly made a series of hand seals and struck his own body several times; with those few touches his already formidable aura surged violently.

He even went so far as to drain his own strength to invoke a secret art of immense power.

Then he laughed loudly and, with astonishing speed, leapt forward several zhang, appearing right beside the Dragon Ascension Altar!

Seeing this, Yang Kai's heart skipped a beat, and Zong Zijin's face also changed as he gritted his teeth and accelerated.

"All of it will be mine!" Duan Tianci laughed as he reached out and seized a longsword-shaped Secret Treasure.

Among the dozen or so treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar, that longsword looked the finest—radiant light flowed across its body, giving it an otherworldly sheen; clearly not an ordinary item.

Duan Tianci was cautious; as he took the longsword he scanned the surroundings and quietly circulated his inner power, prepared for anything.

To his astonishment, he lifted the longsword with ease.

He was stunned by the result, but more than anything else he was overjoyed.

As he prepared to place his first haul into his Spatial Ring, something unexpected occurred.

Before the longsword had been away from the Dragon Ascension Altar for even a breath, it warped and turned into a withered twig—the form vanished and its spirit was gone...

A breeze blew and the twig snapped in two, falling to the ground.

Duan Tianci's smile froze on his face.

The expressions on the faces of the many onlookers were a spectacle—doubt, astonishment, schadenfreude, and thoughtful consideration all mixed together...

"This... this... is this fake?" After a long while Duan Tianci roared in resentment, flinging the half-broken twig aside and grabbing at a hammer-shaped Secret Treasure.

The second treasure he took likewise turned into an ordinary stone as soon as it left the Dragon Ascension Altar.

"Illusion! This is an illusion! We've all been deceived!"

A cry of alarm rose from the crowd.

No one needed that warning; almost everyone realized the truth.

Duan Tianci had taken those two treasures openly before many eyes—no opportunity for trickery or swapping existed—so the only explanation was that the treasures atop the Dragon Ascension Altar were not real, but grand illusions cast to create a visual deception.

In an instant the fighters who had been advancing halted, their faces full of embarrassment.

No one had expected such an outcome.

The Dragon Ascension Altar—the stuff of legend where one leapt the dragon gate to become a dragon—turned out to be a colossal fraud.

Yang Kai stood dumbfounded.

When Duan Tianci used his secret art to surge forward he had been anxious, but now this theatrical scene caught him off guard.

Suddenly his expression shifted; he closed his eyes and then opened them again.

No one noticed that his left eye had become a golden vertical pupil.

The next moment he dashed forward.

Elsewhere, Zong Zijin also reached the Dragon Ascension Altar; he exchanged a look with Duan Tianci, repeatedly lifting treasures from the altar only to cast them aside in utter dismay.

Those once-promising manuals and techniques all proved to be utterly ordinary; they were of no real use—thrown to the ground they crumbled to dust and blew away at a puff of wind.

Soon Yang Kai joined in.

He picked up a jade bottle, opened it, cursed in annoyance, and tossed the bottle aside.

Before long, through the combined inspection of the three, every item atop the Dragon Ascension Altar proved to be false.

"How could this be?" Duan Tianci murmured in disbelief, unable to accept the result.
