## Chapter 423 — I’m Going Out for a While

The two powerful figures of the Huo Family both assumed that the Blood Servants had betrayed the location of their hiding place.

But Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head and chuckled softly, "Those two Blood Servants are currently healing their injuries and have no time to care about other matters. Besides, it wasn’t me who discovered you two. I’m not that capable yet."

"Then..."

"Heh. This junior will take her leave now." Qiu Yimeng did not say more, only smiling faintly.

Miss Qiu was intelligent and cunning; although she had restrained herself somewhat in front of Yang Kai, she still behaved this way with others.

At this moment, she did not choose to expose the truth, leaving some mystery for those two. That would only serve Yang Kai better.

After Qiu Yimeng left, the two men stared at the fine wine in their hands and sighed in frustration.

They also knew exactly who had guided Qiu Yimeng, but they really could not imagine that Yang Kai possessed such profound skills.

"What do we do now?" one of them frowned deeply.

The other also looked grim and shook his head, "This is bad. We took two pots of wine from that person, tonight—"

"Brother Kai, you really are insidious," one said.

There is a saying that when you eat from someone's hand, you cannot talk badly of them; when you take something from someone, you become indebted. Though it was only two pots of wine, they were personally delivered by Miss Qiu, a token of sincere goodwill. If tonight danger befell Yang Kai’s residence, could they just stand by?

If it had been others delivering the wine, or even Yang Kai himself, these two could have righteously refused. But they could never decline Qiu Yimeng.

"But the family head has not allowed us to participate in the succession war yet. Moreover, in previous succession wars, other families would send Divine Roaming Realm experts of the seventh or eighth stages, even top-tier fighters weren’t a big deal. But the Eight Great Families do not deploy experts above the fifth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. If we acted rashly and were discovered… how would we save face?"

"Why not just send the wine back?" one proposed.

The other nodded in agreement, "Sure, you send it."

"Get lost!" The retort was instantaneous.

To return the wine was to slap Miss Qiu’s face. Who would do such a foolish thing?

They exchanged glances and shook their heads, sighing. Those two pots of fine wine were now hotter than red-hot iron tongs to hold.

Helpless, one of them divided a pot and swallowed it. The wine no longer tasted mellow, only bitterness and helplessness filled their mouths.

Time passed slowly. The sun set, the moon rose, and the stars twinkled like hanging gems, clustered brilliantly.

The once bustling War City suddenly fell silent.

Tens of thousands of eyes were focused intently on the movements within the residences of the Eight Great Young Masters.

Traces of Divine Sense interwove throughout the War City, monitoring all directions. Those with powerful strength spread their senses boldly, comprehensively understanding the surrounding situations.

In the city's heart stood the Fengshen Hall.

This majestic palace housed eight elderly men with white hair, each seated cross-legged at eight corners.

These eight were as tranquil as still water, each circulating cultivation methods, outwardly indifferent but in fact their Divine Senses permeated every corner of the city.

They belonged to the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. Each one was a top-tier expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

The Yang Family’s succession war was unfolding in War City. Countless young heroes from across the land gathered here, with almost every contender being a leading figure of their own faction. The stakes were immense.

Therefore, at the start of every succession war, the Eight Great Families would each dispatch an expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm to remain stationed in War City — to both supervise the outcome of the war and safeguard the young contenders.

Otherwise, if a strongman from the Cangyun Evil Land came and wiped them out, the loss would be immeasurable.

These eight were aged over a hundred years; the eldest reaching two centuries. Almost half-buried in their coffins, they neither meddled in family matters nor the affairs of the world, focusing solely on cultivation and martial arts comprehension.

They sat there without interfering in the succession war, only monitoring victory or defeat and protecting War City from treachery.

They cared not who won or lost.

At their stage of cultivation and age, their sole desire was to unravel the mysteries beyond the Divine Roaming Realm during their lifetime — their only pursuit.

Within the residences of the Eight Great Young Masters, some were restless, some anxious, others ready to watch from the sidelines, like tigers watching each other fight, hoping to claim the spoils.

The strength each held varied, as did their mindsets.

As night deepened, there was no movement from the Eight Great Young Masters’ residences, leaving many watching impatiently.

Yang Kai stood on the central hall of his estate, hands behind his back, posture sharp as a sword, gazing at the command flag hanging above the hall.

This command flag was a crucial token in the succession war.

There were two ways to defeat a contender in the succession war.

One was to capture the rival contender directly, causing them to lose their qualification.

The other involved the command flag.

If someone took this command flag, the corresponding contender would also lose their qualification.

Moreover, this command flag had to be hung right above the central hall — it could not be carried on the person.

This was the Yang Family tradition, likely intended to offer the contenders an additional strategic element and to test their wisdom and cunning.

The hanging command flag served as a constraint for the Yang Family contenders because they had to assign someone to guard it constantly, preventing any theft.

They must protect their own flag while scheming to seize others’. The succession war was a battle of intellect and courage.

Staring at the large character "Kai" on the flag, Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Behind him, Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family, Huo Xingchen of Zhongdu’s Huo Family, and Xiang Tianxiao, the Second Young Master of the Xiang Family, arrived together.

These were the only allies Yang Kai could currently rely on, all gathered here.

"Brother Kai, have you prepared to hand over your Golden Feather Eagle to me yet?" Huo Xingchen grinned mischievously, fanning himself lazily. "But let me warn you first, if anyone attacks you later, I’m the first to surrender. Don’t expect me to help."

Qiu Yimeng shot him a cold glare, "If you speak again, I’ll beat you into a cripple and throw you outside."

"Hey, hey! You’re a woman, don’t be so violent, alright?" Huo Xingchen pouted.

Xiang Tianxiao said solemnly, "I’ll cooperate with whatever defense the Xiang Family arranges."

"Whatever." Yang Kai glanced at him lightly.

Xiang Tianxiao frowned but said nothing further, turning to leave. He was apparently going to arrange his own men. Though relatively strong with four Divine Roaming Realm experts, his forces were still lacking against true elites.

But this was only the first day of the succession war. Other contenders might not yet wield strong enough forces, so Xiang’s men could still be useful.

"At this point, it’s time to tell me your plan, isn’t it?" Qiu Yimeng beamed playfully. "Are your hidden allies finally going to reveal themselves?"

Yang Kai shook his head, "I have no hidden allies. Everyone you see is all the strength we have now."

"Really?" Qiu Yimeng’s expression shifted slightly.

"No trick this time!" Yang Kai was serious.

"So, how do we defend?" The young lady of the Qiu Family suddenly grew anxious. Though the two Blood Servants were formidable, how much combat power could they really count on? Adding in the Xiang Family and Autumn Rain Hall forces, none seemed strong enough.

The opponent only needed to bring out two Divine Roaming Realm experts at the seventh or eighth stage, and they could easily take this place.

Right now, the Yang Family had at least three such experts!

"You can still regret it now," Yang Kai said icily, casting her a look.

Feeling his gaze, Qiu Yimeng furrowed her brows but suddenly smiled, "No, I trust you."

"Heh, I don’t trust you at all," Huo Xingchen laughed as he headed outside. "I’m off to find some bird feed. If we get the eagle, I need to feed it well."

He vanished after saying that.

When only the two remained in the hall, Yang Kai suddenly spoke, "I’m going out for a while."

Qiu Yimeng’s face changed sharply, and she exclaimed, "Going out? What do you intend to do?"

"What do you think?"

The young lady of the Qiu Family looked at Yang Kai in disbelief, mouth slightly open, as if he were joking. Yet Yang Kai’s expression was perfectly calm, no hint of jest.

"Are you serious?"

"Of course I am," he said. "In the succession war, capturing an opponent brings great benefits. Tonight is the first day, and surely someone will be eliminated. This is an opportunity!"

If capturing an opponent weren’t worthwhile, no contenders would recklessly attack others at such cost and risk—for fear of losing their own command flags.

Securing a Yang Family contender or snatching a command flag could be traded to the Xiang Family for many resources for one’s own use.

"You must be crazy," Qiu Yimeng shook her head, staring at Yang Kai incredulously. "With the forces you have, you don’t even have enough to defend properly, and you want to take the initiative? Tell me, who will you take with you? My Autumn Rain Hall members? Xiang Family people? Or those two Blood Servants?"

The first two would be ineffective outside; the last two left undefended would leave the residence hollow, easily defeated.

"Just me," Yang Kai frowned.

"I don’t agree!" Qiu Yimeng’s anger surged, her chest heaving as she glared fiercely at him.

Yang Kai suddenly laughed and cast a glance at her full bosom, saying, "I’m not asking for your opinion, just telling you. When I act, I don’t need others to talk back."

Qiu Yimeng’s expression instantly darkened. She clenched her teeth until they cracked.

After a long silence, she took a deep breath and said, "Fine. Since you’ve decided this, I won’t say more. But if you lose tonight, you can consider that Qiu Yimeng has gone blind for following a man like you."

"Women, don’t speak in ways that cause misunderstandings," Yang Kai sneered coldly. "Besides, who wins or loses isn’t certain yet."
