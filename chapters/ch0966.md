## Chapter 966 — Gathering in the Nine Heavens

News that the Tianzang Elder, Li Rui, had arrived at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land spread through the Nine Peaks like a gust of wind on wings.

Many disciples across the Nine Peaks dropped what they were doing and hurried toward the area around the Reception Hall, craning their necks and peering about in hopes of catching a distant glimpse of the master to boast about.

All of this sprang from Xu Hui blurting out Elder Li's name without thinking.

When Yang Kai and the five masters escorted Elder Li and Zhai Yao into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Xu Hui quickly asked Yang Kai to confirm the visitor's identity—after all, he was the Sacred Land's chief elder and could not be disrespectful to a guest.

Upon learning that the man was the Tianzang Elder, Xu Hui barked an exclamation on the spot and finally understood why Yang Kai had rushed out to greet him, and why the five highly-ranked masters behaved like students in his presence.

Under heaven, only Elder Li possessed such qualifications; only he could command that level of reverence from the five masters.

And so the news spread.

Thousands of the Sacred Land's disciples packed the Reception Hall so tightly not even water could seep through.

“Each generation brings forth its own talents. Thousands of years ago, the Demon Race had the Great Demon God, a hero of his age. And now, among the Human Race, there is Elder Li, a remarkable figure of this generation.”

The three races—humans, yao, and demons—stood opposed and hostile, yet if anyone could make members of any of the three treat one another with courtesy, apart from the Tianzang Elder there was no other candidate.

Even Changyuan, the Demon Sovereign, and several Great Lords of the yao did not dare show any disrespect before Elder Li.

It was a pity that Elder Li was like a dragon whose head was seen but not its tail, with no fixed abode, and few ever glimpsed his true appearance. For many years no word of him had been heard. That time in Fuyun City, Elder Li had quietly gone to the City Lord’s Mansion, without alerting too many people.

Rumor had it he had long since passed away, to the regret of many.

Nobody expected that today he would come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land of his own accord.

“What are you all staring at? Not doing your chores? Keep loitering here and I’ll scoop your eyes out!” Xu Hui strode out of the main hall with a cold face and shouted angrily.

The thousands of disciples were startled and scattered like birds and beasts.

Within the grand hall, Yang Kai gave an embarrassed smile. “I must have made Elder Li laugh. Don’t worry—I’ll make sure none of my disciples disclose your whereabouts.”

“No matter, no matter!” Elder Li waved his hand kindly, showing he did not mind. “When I traveled before I hid my name and did not wish others to know my trail, but this time… I actually hope someone knows I am here.”

“Why is that?” the Sacred Land's elders and alchemists in the hall asked, puzzled.

Elder Li fell silent for a moment; his expression turned grave and measured as he said, “I've heard a number of strange reports in recent times—apparently those rumors have been spreading from here?”

“Yes.”

“Those reports…”

“Are true!” Yang Kai nodded.

“So it is.” Elder Li sighed softly and said slowly, “I've also heard that Changyuan and several Great Lords of the yao have taken action, but most of the human powers remain on the sidelines watching?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai's expression grew much heavier. “Hearsay is unreliable; seeing is believing. They haven't personally witnessed certain secrets like Changyuan and the yao's Great Lords have, so they aren't fully convinced—understandably.”

After a pause, Yang Kai added, “But it's not entirely the case. My sect, Tianxiao Sect, and Dragon-Phoenix Palace, Twin Pavilion, and the Duao Alliance have all sent word in recent days saying they'll dispatch people as soon as possible.”

“But how many experts can those few sects closely tied to you muster? At that point they may well become a laughingstock to the yao and demons. Right now, the human race is the strongest on the continent and the incident occurs on human territory, yet in the end it will be the yao and demons who throw their full strength into spreading the news—what manner of shameful spectacle will that be!”

“There's nothing I can do; I can't force others to act in such matters!” Yang Kai said helplessly.

“Young friend Yang, do you know which is the greatest force in the world?” Elder Li suddenly asked with a smile.

“The greatest force?” Yang Kai was stunned and thought carefully. “The Nine Heavens Sacred Land has progressed well and is one of the top powers; my sect, Tianxiao Sect, is also notable, but how does one compare such things?”

“Indeed—there are many blessed lands and sacred places across the continent where top experts remain reclusive for long stretches and no one knows if they live or die,” He Feng chimed in.

“Elder Li, which greatest force are you referring to?” Du Wan asked in puzzlement.

Elder Li laughed heartily and did not answer directly; instead he said slowly, “Young friend Yang, I've heard much about the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's rise. It's said your ascent was spurred by a miraculous alchemist, making the Sacred Land ever more prestigious—gradually surpassing its former standing.”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded, his eyes suddenly bright as he began to grasp the force Elder Li had in mind.

“A single remarkable alchemist can already drive martial artists seeking pills to grovel and plead, rushing here in droves. But what if you add up all the alchemists across the world?”  

“The Alchemists' Association!” Yang Kai exclaimed sharply.

Elder Li smiled and nodded. “If the Alchemists' Association intervenes, I believe those powers and the world's experts will make the right choice.”

“Elder Li has come for this?” Yang Kai looked at him, excited.

“Indeed. Since the day my name became known, this old man has lived freely in the mortal world, ignoring worldly affairs. For a thousand years I’ve done little for this continent, yet countless people have revered and worshiped me, which leaves me uneasy at heart. Now that there’s an opportunity, I naturally won’t let it pass. Though I’ve long stayed out of sight, I believe this old man still has a bit of influence left.” Elder Li smiled and nodded.

“Then I'll go to the Alchemists' Council now and notify them to send people!” Hong Fang jumped to his feet.

“No need—before I came here I already informed the Alchemists' Council and also contacted some old friends long out of touch!” Zhai Yao said with a confident smile. “I think it won't be long before many arrive.”

Inside the hall, everyone looked at one another with excitement.

Whether those people came willingly or reluctantly, as long as they came, the three races joining forces could soon deal with the Bone Race problem.

“Thank you, Elder Li!” Yang Kai said seriously.

“No, it is I who should thank you for caring for the world. Young friend Yang, you have run between the three races, showing concern both for the populace and for the wider realm; I admire you.” Elder Li praised Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pondered and then said solemnly, “Elder Li, you have misunderstood my running between the three races and informing the great powers—I was not acting on lofty righteousness and had no intention of saving the world.”

“Oh? Then why are you so zealous? As far as I know, you are the one who initiated the chain of contact and brought the yao and demons together.”

“Mm. Because I want to settle the matter of the Bone Race as quickly as possible, and then go on with my own affairs. If the Bone Race isn’t dealt with, I’ll always have worries at my back,” Yang Kai replied earnestly.  

Elder Li fixed him with a long gaze and did not ask what he intended to do after the Bone Race was handled; instead he laughed, “Whatever your motive, it is a good thing. When later generations study history and trace events today, they will remember Yang Kai and the name of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.”

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile.

Ten days passed. No human experts had arrived to lend aid, but instead the Saint-Grade alchemists from the Alchemists' Council showed up.

These alchemists were reclusive and noble, usually visited by others seeking them out, yet today they came as if by prior agreement, pouring into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land all at once.

Because the Tianzang Elder was here!

They had come drawn by his reputation, each one excited and full of fervor.

Over the next few days Saint-Grade alchemists from many regions continued to arrive.

Learning the news, they moved faster than the human experts coming to assist.

Within just over ten days, nearly thirty Saint-Grade alchemists had gathered at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—almost ninety percent of all Saint-Grade alchemists on the continent!

The remaining ten percent were on the way.

With the Saint-Grade alchemists' arrival, the human experts from various powers also began to arrive.

Among them were several top fighters at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm!

Each of those masters was over a thousand years old and old acquaintances of Elder Li; when he summoned them, they came without hesitation.

Behind each of those masters stood a respectable force, and their disciples and descendants came to the Nine Peaks with them.

Chu Lingxiao of the Tianxiao Sect arrived with four Senior Aunt and Uncles.

Chu Lingxiao seemed to know several of the elders, and their meeting was lively.

Each one praised Yang Kai before Chu Lingxiao, saying how promising the young man was.

As time went on, more and more Human experts gathered at the Nine Peaks. None of them were below the Transcendent Realm—every single one was Transcendent or already entered the Saint Realm.  

The Alchemists' Council had spoken: if any great power refused to show face this time, the Council would not honor them in the future; not only would they lose access to alchemical services, they would not be able to buy a single Spiritual Herb or Spiritual Medicine from the market.

The world trembled and the great and small powers hesitated no longer; they mobilized at full strength.

They could afford to offend others, but they dared not offend the alchemists of the world—especially with the Tianzang Elder personally involved; no one wished to defy such a public disgrace.

Without pills to assist them, warriors would have a hard road ahead.

Moreover, coming to assist was not without benefit: the Alchemists' Council promised that once this matter was settled, all alchemists under the Council would provide free alchemy services for three years, including the Saint-Grade alchemists who seldom intervened.

Few would pass up such a tremendous reward.

The entire Nine Peaks quickly became bustling and lively; experts came and went like fish in a river, continuously.

Under introductions from Elder Li and Chu Lingxiao, Yang Kai got acquainted with several of the top experts.

A month passed in a flash; at the horizon there appeared a murderous, ominous aura like a collapsing mountain bearing down, and from the other side a towering wave of yao qi surged rapidly forward.

The experts within the Nine Peaks all turned to the sky with grave expressions.

Yang Kai's eyes lit up; he called out, “The yao and demons have come!”
