## Chapter 1854 — No Time to Spare

Seeing Yang Kai behave so shamelessly and give him no face, Jiang Changfeng's expression turned awkward; he could not press the matter further. After all, he had been the one to presumptuously attempt to probe Yang Kai with his Divine Sense, and never expected the other's methods to be so strange that he had been taken at a disadvantage.

He drew a deep breath to steady the surging qi and blood in his chest, forced down his anger, and said, "Friend, are you the Purple Star's Third Venerable One?"

Yang Kai glanced at him with no intention of answering, instead strolling to the table, picking up the sliced Qishan Yunwu tea and pouring himself a cup. He took a light sip, a look of satisfaction on his face, and did not hesitate to praise, "Good tea, good tea!"

Jiang Changfeng’s face grew so dark it seemed as though a layer of frost might form upon it. He knew full well the other man’s words were deliberate, payback for what had just happened. To be treated with such disregard left him unable to maintain his dignity. Though no outsiders were present to witness it, he was, after all, a Void King Realm master — when had he ever been looked down upon like this? With a cold snort, he said, “This Elder is Jiang Changfeng, the Eighth Elder of Purple Star. Friend, are you my Purple Star's Third Venerable One?”

Yang Kai lazily dug a finger in his ear, leaning back in the chair with a playful smirk as he drawled, “‘Elder’? You think you’ve earned the right to call yourself that before me? And who told you we were friends?”

"You…" Jiang Changfeng flew into a rage, his whole body trembling with fury.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "Knowing I'm the Purple Star's Venerable One yet still showing such disrespect—did all those years you’ve lived go to the dogs?”

From the moment he realized the visitor was Jiang Changfeng, Yang Kai's mood soured. With the top not setting a straight example, the bottom would be crooked; he had already seen Jiang Chao's behavior and understood that Jiang Changfeng was no better.

Seeing Xia Jingwu and the others cowed and pressured by Jiang Changfeng only made Yang Kai angrier.

The members of the Commerce Guild had also been dragged into the affair because of him, so Yang Kai naturally intended to give them a lesson. Hence his tone was far from friendly.

Whoever bore the Purple Star Command Token was a Purple Star's Venerable One, a position of great prestige not below the sect's top three Elders. Jiang Changfeng was only the eighth-ranked elder; by protocol he should have shown proper deference to Yang Kai. Yang Kai used that rule as he pleased, and however enraged Jiang Changfeng might be, he had no recourse.

So when Yang Kai spoke, however his anger burned, Jiang Changfeng could only restrain himself.

Taking another deep breath to quell his temper, Jiang Changfeng's eyes flicked, and he said, "You claim to be a Venerable One — but only those who hold the Command Token personally granted by the Sect Lord are our Purple Star's Venerable Ones. To date the Sect Lord has only granted it to two people. From what I know, you are not among those two!"

Yang Kai shot him a glance, then pulled out the Purple Star Command Token and flung it straight at his head. His tone was utterly arrogant as he said, “Open those dog eyes of yours and take a good look—tell me, does this Command Token look fake to you?”

Jiang Changfeng fumbled to seize the token, turning it over and over to examine it. After confirming it was genuine, a trace of doubt showed on his face. "This Command Token is indeed genuine, but... why did none of our Purple Star elders receive word of a Third Venerable One appearing? When did the Sect Lord give this Command Token to you?"

"None of your damn business," Yang Kai sneered. "What? Eighth Elder, do you think your Sect Lord needs to report his actions to you?"

Jiang Changfeng's face changed drastically. He hurried to say, "I would never say that — the Sect Lord's affairs are not for me to inquire about."

"If you have no right to inquire, why are you still nagging?"

Jiang Changfeng's expression changed several times, but he swallowed his anger and, holding the token with both hands, approached Yang Kai. In a deep voice he said, "The token checks out. It can be confirmed that you are indeed our Purple Star's Third Venerable One. I apologize for my previous offense; please forgive this old man."

Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance and continued sipping his tea, slurring his words, "You think I relish being your Purple Star's Venerable One? If it weren’t for Zi Long’s incessant begging, I wouldn’t have bothered accepting this damned Command Token. What a joke.”

Jiang Changfeng gaped in astonishment, staring at Yang Kai in shock. He could not tell whether the other was boasting or truly telling the truth; the matter was beyond verification.

It was hardly dignified to keep holding the token. Seeing Yang Kai refuse to take it, Jiang Changfeng respectfully set the token on the table and retreated.

"Eighth Elder didn't come here just to verify my identity, did he?" Yang Kai spat a tea leaf, looking at him indifferently.

Jiang Changfeng's heart jumped; he had nearly forgotten the reason he had come while squabbling with this man. He immediately sobered and said, "Venerable One, I come by order of the Great Elder."

"The Great Elder?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes. The Great Elder was pleased to hear that our Purple Star has produced another Venerable One, and so ordered me to request that you come to the inner city for a meeting."

"Not interested!" Yang Kai curled his lip.

"What?" Jiang Changfeng stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

"Can't you understand plain language? I said I'm not interested. You may leave."

Cold sweat broke out on Jiang Changfeng's brow. Stammering, he said, "Venerable One, I mean— the Great Elder has sent for you!"

"I heard you. So what?"

So what? Jiang Changfeng suddenly realized his earlier humiliation had not been in vain: this inexplicably brazen Venerable One even refused to yield to the Purple Star Great Elder, so why should he bother about an Eighth Elder?

The thought set his mind at ease somewhat.

But he had been ordered to come, and Jiang Changfeng could not simply turn back. Frowning, he said, "Venerable One, the Sect Lord is not currently stationed in Purple Star City. All affairs here are handled by the Great Elder. Your refusal might be ill-received."

"What's so ill-received?" Yang Kai smiled at Jiang Changfeng.

Jiang Changfeng thought, You know exactly what you're doing — refusing to give the Great Elder face is not a good idea.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "I am a Purple Star's Venerable One and not subject to Purple Star commands. Even if Zi Long wishes to see me, he must come in person and call on me. If he wants anything of me, he must negotiate with me in person. Go back and tell Gongsun Liang that if he wants to meet me, he must come himself! I don't have time to listen to his bullshit!"

The Gongsun Liang Yang Kai mentioned was Purple Star's Great Elder, Gongsun Liang, who possessed the formidable cultivation of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Jiang Changfeng's eyes widened; he finally comprehended how overbearing this Third Venerable One was. Fear and, strangely, a little secret pleasure filled his heart.

"Get out!" Yang Kai saw Jiang Changfeng still lingering and impatiently ordered him. His voice carried Divine Sense, causing Jiang Changfeng's body to tremble and his face to show terror. He hastily cupped his hands, "In that case, I will take my leave — Venerable One, farewell!"

With that he hurriedly retreated.

"Wait!" Yang Kai suddenly called again.

Jiang Changfeng paused, turned back, and awkwardly asked, "Does the Venerable One have further instructions?"

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "This is the first time. Given it's your first offense, leave some Saint Crystals as compensation. Go back and tell Gongsun Liang this: if another fool comes to the Commerce Guild and acts wantonly, scaring my friends, then some Saint Crystals won't be enough. I will personally go to the inner city and have a long talk with him."

He put heavy emphasis on the words 'have a long talk.' A feral smile crossed his face.

Jiang Changfeng was stunned for a moment, then as if he finally understood Yang Kai's meaning he asked with a strange expression, "You want me to leave some Saint Crystals behind to compensate those outside?"

"You injured people. Do you expect to walk away without consequence?" Yang Kai taunted. "If you refuse to leave Saint Crystals, that's fine too — if you can take one of my moves and live, you're free to go."

Jiang Changfeng was terrified. Although his contact with Yang Kai had been brief, he had seen that this man's arrogance was backed by power. At his own First Stage he could not possibly contend. He might not die taking a move, but he would surely be wounded.

After weighing the matter, Jiang Changfeng had no hesitation. He took some Saint Crystals from his Spatial Ring and angrily said, "I will obey the Venerable One's orders. I will faithfully relay your words to the Great Elder!"

"Better be that way!" Yang Kai grinned wickedly, fearless and insolent.

Jiang Changfeng snorted coldly and swept his sleeve, departing.

After Jiang Changfeng left, Yang Kai furrowed his brow and fell into thought.

He suddenly felt that beneath Purple Star City's calm surface some fierce currents were stirring.

Earlier, when he had gone out with Hua Youmeng, they had encountered people from the Hengluo Commerce Guild clashing with Purple Star, and later someone privately sought to curry favor with him. Back at the Commerce Guild, Jiang Changfeng had again been waiting.

All these signs suggested Purple Star City might be on the verge of changing.

"Sir…" Hua Youmeng entered and, seeing Yang Kai deep in thought and silent for a long while, called out worriedly.

"What is it?" Yang Kai looked up at her.

"These Saint Crystals…" Hua Youmeng pointed at the Saint Crystals scattered across the floor in a daze. Though she had not counted them exactly, there were at least three hundred thousand Saint Crystals, piled together and emitting a bright radiance that dazzled the eyes.

"Yes, these are the Saint Crystals Jiang Changfeng left as compensation for your Uncle Xia and the others. Tell them to come and divide them among themselves," Yang Kai explained with a smile.

"Compensation…?" Hua Youmeng froze, astonished.

"Yes. Elder Jiang's pressure earlier seriously frightened your Uncle Xia and the others. Jiang Changfeng's conscience is prickly; he left these Saint Crystals to calm them."

Hua Youmeng immediately wore a look of amused disbelief. Sharp as she was, she knew these compensations had been won by Yang Kai on Uncle Xia's behalf. Jiang Changfeng, an Eighth Elder of Purple Star, arrogant and haughty, would never have bothered over ordinary warriors' lives unless forced.

Seeing through it, Hua Youmeng looked at Yang Kai with gratitude, "Thank you, Sir."

"By the way, Chairwoman Hua, may I trouble you for a favor?"

"Whatever you need, Sir, simply tell me and the whole Commerce Guild will do its utmost. Also… you need not call me Chairwoman any longer; I cannot bear the title — just call me by my name." At the end she blushed slightly and lowered her head.

Yang Kai cleared his throat and said, "I want you to help me inquire whether there have been any unusual stirrings within Purple Star City lately. You have some channels inside the city; perhaps you can find some clues."

"Unusual stirrings?" Hua Youmeng's brows knit, but she did not press further. She straightened and said, "Rest assured, Sir, I will do my best!"
