## Chapter 671 — Conditions

Every grievance has its head, every debt its owner; the man who had deceived them was already dead, and Yang Kai had never intended to trouble the two women — besides, he also needed people to help gather information.

Hearing Yang Kai say this, Ji Meng was overjoyed and cried out, "Really?"

Yang Kai nodded. "But I have conditions!"

"What conditions?" Ji Meng asked anxiously. Survival was paramount; she had decided that no matter how outrageous his demand, as long as it did not harm Zhu Yingyue, she would agree.

"Isn't a lifesaving favor supposed to be repaid by offering one's body?" Yang Kai stroked his chin and asked with a lecherous grin.

Ji Meng's expression turned ice-cold. Although she had mentally prepared herself, she had not expected this man to actually make such a shameless demand!

Angry inside but daring not to show it, she forced herself to fend off the Ice Crystal Wolf's ice shards and cried in a girlish voice, "I don't mind, but... don't you set your sights on Zhu Yingyue!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked at her with some surprise. He had only been joking and had no real intention of harming the two women. From their conversation during their second meeting they did not seem malicious; rescuing them posed no problem.

"Are you going to act or not? If you don't, we'll die and you won't get a thing!" Ji Meng had reached her limit. As she spoke, the Ice Crystal Wolf's patience seemed to have run out; its assaults grew ever fiercer. With the means Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue possessed they could not hold it off — if Yang Kai remained a bystander, they would surely be doomed.

"Coming." Yang Kai shook his head and leisurely drifted down from the air.

The massive demonic beast leapt in from a distance, its fangs bared with murderous intent, a foul stench assaulting them. Zhu Yingyue screamed in fright, tears spilling from her eyes.

Not knowing what to do, she suddenly felt light; the next moment she found herself hoisted onto someone's shoulder, the surroundings rushing past as she hastily shut her eyes.

Ji Meng had the same experience; before she could react, Yang Kai had already lifted her in his arms.

Like wind and lightning the loathsome Ice Crystal Wolf pursued fiercely from behind, yet the distance was gradually being stretched. Ji Meng stole a glance and kept urging, "Hurry, it's catching up!"

Yang Kai snorted coldly. "You make it sound easy; that's already my top speed."

Ji Meng fell silent. Watching the Ice Crystal Wolf fall farther behind, she couldn't help breathing a sigh of relief.

After a time, the Ice Crystal Wolf finally ceased its pursuit and stopped where it stood, howling at the sky — a cry full of unwillingness and fury.

At a certain spot in the boundless snow mountains, Yang Kai stood in place looking bored, watching the two disheveled women as they busied themselves.

They seemed experienced at living in the snow; they quickly dug a pit in the drifts that was spacious inside and solid on the outside.

Before long, a snow cave had been made.

Ji Meng glanced back at Yang Kai warily and, a little weakly, said, "We're going to change clothes and apply some healing salves. You stand out here and do not come in — and do not peep, or I'll gouge your eyes out!"

"Hey, you're mine now, aren't you? What's the harm in me taking a look?" Yang Kai teased.

"You..." Ji Meng fumed, grinding her teeth for a moment before snapping angrily, "I'm fine, but Yingyue isn't!"

Saying that, the two women slipped into the snow cave one after another. After a short while came the rustling of fabric — clearly they were removing their blood-stained clothes.

Yang Kai looked utterly astonished; he suddenly felt the pair did not seem to intend to renege.

She wouldn't really offer herself just like that, would she? Yang Kai wore an expression of bitter amusement — if she clung to him, it would be a real headache.

He chastised himself for being so foolish; how could he have proposed such a self-entangling condition?

After waiting nearly half an hour, Ji Meng's call finally came from within: "You can come in now."

Yang Kai gave a carefree smile, walked up to the cave entrance, and ducked inside.

Inside was indeed spacious, and not cold or damp; compared with the outside, the snow cave gave a surprising sense of warmth.

The two women had taken care of themselves and changed into clean clothes, a sight that made Yang Kai's eyes light up.

When they first met, Qi Chao had stood before them and Yang Kai hadn't noticed their appearances; at their second meeting they had been in tatters and bloodstained, their true faces obscured.

Now the taller one's figure was proud and her beauty striking; the smaller one was exquisitely petite and quite adorable.

But at this moment the taller beauty glared at Yang Kai with displeasure, as if she could tear him limb from limb, her teeth bared. The petite beauty shrank to one side, timidly watching and appearing very fragile.

"Hello." Yang Kai greeted them and sat cross-legged opposite.

"I thought you were so capable; it turns out in front of an Ice Crystal Wolf you can only flee." Ji Meng sneered in a cutting tone.

Seeing Yang Kai so calm and composed before, apparently without a trace of fear in front of a Seventh-Tier demonic beast and even chattering casually, Ji Meng had mistakenly thought him formidable — but in the end she was sorely disappointed.

This man was merely a bit faster; he didn't even have the courage to face the Ice Crystal Wolf head-on.

"Whether I fled or not, I still saved you." Yang Kai said indifferently.

Before strangers, he was unwilling to reveal his true strength.

A Seventh-Tier demonic beast equated to the Transcendent Realm; if he had killed it outright in front of the two women, he would very likely have exposed his combat prowess.

Until he was certain of their identities and temperaments, Yang Kai would not take that risk.

"In any case, thank you for saving us," Ji Meng suddenly said with genuine feeling, and as she spoke she reached out to touch Zhu Yingyue.

Zhu Yingyue was still somewhat shaken and reacted a bit strongly; when she perceived Ji Meng's intention her face flushed and she said softly, "Thank you."

"It was nothing, don't mention it." Yang Kai felt considerably more at ease.

"Also, about that earlier matter, we must apologize," Ji Meng said, biting her lip with difficulty. "When Qi Chao deceived you we meant to warn you, but we didn't know your background or your purpose for entering the Ten-Thousand-Li Snow Mountains, and we didn't know your strength, so..."

"It's all right. When traveling one must remain cautious," Yang Kai chuckled. "That man is dead anyway; let's leave it at that."

Ji Meng nodded lightly, suddenly finding this man easy to speak with — not at all as cold and heartless as he had seemed before.

"We are disciples of the Leiguang Divine Cult. My name is Ji Meng; she is Zhu Yingyue. And you?" Ji Meng introduced them and looked to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave his name.

"Which faction are you from?" Ji Meng asked with curiosity.

"I have no sect or school — I'm alone."

"No way?" Ji Meng showed surprise. "By your methods you don't seem like someone without backing. You may not be the strongest, but you are quite talented."

Being able to rescue two people from the Ice Crystal Wolf's frenzied attacks — Ji Meng felt Qi Chao couldn't have done it. How could a solitary cultivator without guidance be so formidable?

"How did you get lost in the snow mountains? Where were you headed?" Ji Meng continued to ask, clearly wanting to learn more about Yang Kai.

"I accidentally wandered in and couldn't find a way out. Where to go... I haven't decided. I'll go where there are people," Yang Kai said casually.

"Oh." Ji Meng nodded and explained, "Although the Ten-Thousand-Li Snow Mountains do not strictly belong to any one faction, there are only two or three forces nearby, and our Leiguang Divine Cult is one of them. Basically, the area we're in falls under the Cult's jurisdiction; many disciples enter the mountains searching for opportunities, hoping to find rare herbs and valuables. If you have nowhere to go, you might come with us."

Yang Kai glanced at the two of them, knowing her invitation was not out of affection nor to fulfill the previous promise, but because they were badly injured and needed someone to protect them.

"All right!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Thank you!" Ji Meng relaxed and a radiant smile spread across her face.

For the next few days the three traveled together.

The snow mountains stretched endlessly and the journey was long; with the two women wounded their pace was naturally slow, and as they walked they would occasionally search for herbs buried under the snow, causing further delays.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry — having someone to guide them was far better than wandering aimlessly.

After three or five days they had put distance between themselves and the perilous regions of the mountains.

While on the move, Yang Kai suddenly stopped and peered into the distance. After a moment he said to Ji Meng, "It looks like people from your Leiguang Divine Cult are coming from that direction."

"Really?" Ji Meng was elated, looking up, but she couldn't see anything.

"Mm, they wear the same garb as before — golden robes."

"Then those must be my Cult's people." Ji Meng squeezed Zhu Yingyue's hand; the tension she'd held for days eased somewhat, and Zhu Yingyue smiled brightly.

Yang Kai frowned. "If they discover there's an outsider like me over on this side of the mountains, there will probably be trouble, right?"

Ji Meng's expression showed a flicker of concern, then she said, "It's fine. If you go with us there won't be any trouble."

"Still no, we'll meet again." With that said, Yang Kai didn't look back and swiftly streaked to one side.

Ji Meng had no time to stop him; in an instant Yang Kai's figure was gone.

"Ah..." Zhu Yingyue stared in surprise at the direction Yang Kai had vanished and, a little downcast, asked, "Why did he leave just like that?"

Ji Meng stood there with a complicated look, thinking for a moment before she ground her teeth and said, "That bastard — he was lying to me all along, making me worry for so long!"

"What did he lie to you about?"

"He said I should offer myself to him; I thought he meant it..." Ji Meng's cheeks flushed; now it seemed his words had only been a joke.

If Yang Kai had truly intended that, how could he simply leave like that?

"He's not a bad person." Zhu Yingyue giggled. "Sister Ji, are you smitten? If you chase after him now, you might still catch up."

"Don't be ridiculous." Ji Meng puckered her lips.

However, this man truly was not so bad. After these few days together Ji Meng found he was not as detestable as he had appeared before.
