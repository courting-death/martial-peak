## Chapter 979 — Phoenix Nest Unsealed

The Phoenix Nest was a frozen expanse; biting cold seeped through the thicket, and a white mist hung over the forest like an otherworldly realm.

The Phoenix Empress’s legacy lay hidden within this grove, and after millennia no one had truly obtained it.

Only those who cultivated cold-attributed techniques would occasionally train near the Phoenix Nest, taking advantage of the local conditions.

The Youhan Grotto-Heaven, which long harbored ill intent toward the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, had its sectal foundations set not far from the Phoenix Nest, born and sustained by the Nest’s pervasive chill.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged in a spot inside the Phoenix Nest, ice seeping into him and obstructing the circulation of his Saint Yuan.

Even having reached the Saint Realm, he could feel in the world a profound intent and energy unlike the ordinary; that intent and energy influenced heaven and earth, pervading all things, frosting his hair and clothes.

If Su Yan were here, she could simply rotate the Dual Cultivation Technique and absorb all the cold power within the Phoenix Nest.

But she could not come.

Yang Kai kept trying, releasing his divine sense to perceive that intent, hoping to accept it into himself.

After all, this journey to the starry sky might last an indeterminate age; if luck favored him and he found Su Yan, he could hand over the Phoenix Empress’s hidden legacy here to her and help boost her strength.

Yet Yang Kai could not be certain he could accomplish it.

The chill and that profound intent were utterly antagonistic to the True Yang Technique he cultivated and differed entirely from the attribute of his Saint Yuan.

All he could do was attempt patiently and not force the matter.

Time passed. Yang Kai sat inert within the Phoenix Nest for half a month and made no progress.

However, the influence of the cold had helped stabilize the Saint Realm he had just ascended to.

Having only just broken into a major realm, the worst thing was to greedily rush forward.

The cold pressed on him, forcing his blazing Saint Yuan to resist; while it consumed his inner power, he felt how the Saint Realm and his Saint Yuan differed from before.

He gained much. Remaining in that state and emptying his mind unexpectedly matched the true method for consolidating a realm, making his Saint Realm cultivation increasingly firm and his Saint Yuan ever purer and more robust.

The effort he had put in during this period had given him a buffer, laying the foundation for consolidating his realm. The power within his body was also steadily growing stronger, as he gradually comprehended the mysteries of the Saint Realm.

During this time, the golden dragon pattern on his body never ceased to move. Within the Phoenix Nest it seemed to receive some peculiar nourishment; rather than calming, it grew eager, itching to burst out of Yang Kai’s body and fuse with the chill.

The Dragon Emperor and the Phoenix Empress were the two pillars of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, their wills intertwined as one.

The golden dragon pattern contained tremendous power—Dragon Emperor’s ultimate legacy—so it was natural for something to be unusual while within the Phoenix Nest.

Another half month went by, yet the Phoenix Nest remained mute.

Throughout that time Yang Kai sent his divine sense outward, trying to fathom the Nest’s secrets.

But he failed.

After a whole month of fruitless effort, Yang Kai had to give up.

He concluded he could not carry off the ultimate legacy sealed here.

Just as he opened his eyes to leave, the Nest’s cold suddenly changed in an unusual way, linking with the golden dragon pattern on his body and forming a subtle connection.

Yang Kai’s body stiffened; recalling his previous actions, he held his breath and sealed his power, letting the golden dragon pattern roam his flesh.

The connection sharpened, and Yang Kai’s eyes brightened as understanding stirred within him.

The immense chill within the Phoenix Nest was converging in one direction—and that direction was not far in front of Yang Kai.

Gradually the millennia-old frost that had blanketed the Nest began to thaw, yet a small area before Yang Kai remained paradoxically thick with cold.

It seemed all the chill had gathered there.

A phantom of an Ice Phoenix appeared before Yang Kai.

Noble and resplendent, pure white and crystalline like jade, flawless as an ethereal being untouched by the world.

It made Yang Kai think of Su Yan.

Their auras so matched as to seem born of the same source.

Hu Jiao’er had once likened Su Yan to an ice doll, and the comparison wasn’t wrong—anyone meeting Su Yan’s first impression would be that; her coldness only melted in Yang Kai’s presence.

It became as hot as fire, enough to burn the hardest rock.

A dragon’s roar resounded across heaven and earth. The Ice Phoenix phantom lifted its head in challenge; the phoenix’s cry echoed the dragon’s song.

Yang Kai reached out with one hand and regarded it tenderly, as if looking upon Su Yan.

He offered the Ice Phoenix phantom his most sincere invitation.

The phantom gazed into him as if possessing life and wisdom; it peered into Yang Kai’s heart and saw the vivid image occupying his soul, discerning how important she was to him.

It answered.

Its glorious body shattered like an avalanche, like a collapsing snow mountain and a surging tsunami, fiercely rushing toward Yang Kai.

He remained still, allowing the cold to surge into him; ice formed on his sturdy flesh in an instant, the cracking of the ice ringing continuously.

The enormous chill flooded in, seeming to want to freeze him solid in a single moment.

His blazing Saint Yuan erupted instinctively to resist the invading cold; Yang Kai hastily suppressed it and withdrew all his Saint Yuan into his Dantian.

His teeth trembled and his limbs turned blue; within a single instant Yang Kai was frostbitten.

The vast chill poured in without cease; only after a long while did the residual cold in the world finally vanish.

Yang Kai’s taut, trembling body suddenly relaxed; the oppressive cold that had nearly overwhelmed him dissipated.

Something seemed to have entered his body and was coursing along his skin, leaving a cool sensation that braced him with renewed vigor.

He loosened his clothes and looked down to find a pattern of a dragon and a phoenix chasing and frolicking together in harmony.

Each of those patterns contained power enough to shatter heaven and earth.

Yang Kai smiled in satisfaction, a little surprised.

He had come only to try, not expecting true success, yet the outcome exceeded his expectations.

The Phoenix Empress’s ultimate legacy had indeed responded to his invitation and entered his body.

Closing his eyes to feel it, he sensed the Phoenix Empress’s aura taking his body as a temporary vessel and resting there.

It was a foreign thing—though vast in power, Yang Kai could not employ it; all he could do was safeguard it in place of Su Yan for the time being.

After further verification that the Ice Phoenix pattern would not harm him, Yang Kai rose satisfied and strode out of the Phoenix Nest.

Sunlight bathed the land. The Phoenix Nest was unsealed.

The frozen wastes that had existed for thousands of years finally began to thaw today.

He went to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace and told Chen Zhou about the Phoenix Nest, then bade him farewell, summoned the Star Shuttle, and sped toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

When he returned to the Sacred Land, Xu Hui and the others had already come back.

The entire Sacred Land had been joyous and bustling to this day.

Yang Kai gathered his friends and relatives and told them of his plan to go to the starry sky.

To his surprise, they did not react strongly to the news, as if they had long known.

Yang Kai glanced at Li Rong and understood she must have mentioned it beforehand to prepare everyone mentally.

“Have you decided?” Meng Wuya asked softly.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“If you’ve decided, there’s nothing more to say. Travel carefully; you needn’t worry about things here—this old man will look after them for you.” Meng Wuya inclined his head.

“Thank you, Shopkeeper Meng.” Yang Kai replied earnestly; with Meng Wuya’s words he could leave with peace of mind.

Now that the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was on the right path, whether he remained as its Saint Lord mattered little; Yang Kai’s only real concern was the family and friends living in the old site of the War Soul Hall, but as long as Meng Wuya stayed, they would never be bullied.

“Go scout ahead; perhaps one day this old man will come to see you, and I’ll surely find you then.” Meng Wuya smiled.

“I’ll be waiting.”

Quiet sobbing came from the side. Dong Suzhu’s eyes were swollen and she looked at Yang Kai pleadingly, as if she didn’t want him to leave.

More than a decade ago Yang Kai left Zhongdu and never returned; there had been no news of him.

Only recently had the family been reunited.

Before Dong Suzhu could enjoy the family happiness and talk properly with her son, Yang Kai was about to embark on a new journey—into the boundless starry sky.

How could she bear to let him go?

Fourth Master Yang, a man of iron will, had tiger-like eyes wet with tears, his gaze full of reluctance.

Yang Kai felt deep guilt and was about to speak comfortingly when Fourth Master Yang said in a stern voice, “Go. Your father supports you and believes in you!”

Yang Kai’s body trembled and he bowed heavily.

With Fourth Master Yang’s words he was reassured and could cast off his burdens to do what he wished.

“Before you go, you should have a proper talk with Ningshang.” Meng Wuya sighed. “She’s been shut in her room all these past two weeks.”

“I know.”

Night came; the moon hung like a bright disk.

In the Saint Lord Courtyard, Yang Kai strolled up as An Ling’er walked out; she froze on seeing him, then smirked toward an inner bedchamber and left with a malicious little smile, clearly delighted.

Yang Kai shot her a glare, straightened his clothes, and went to Xia Ningshang’s room.

Outside the door, Du Wan and four other masters clustered together, calling and coaxing into the room with solemn concern, each speaking earnestly.

The room remained silent.

“Good evening, masters.” Yang Kai cleared his throat and drew their attention.

In the dark, five pairs of eyes turned toward him, looking rather displeased.

“You brat…” Chang Bao’s pudgy flesh trembled as he assumed an air of seniority and began to scold: “Truly ungrateful in the midst of blessing! Miss Xia is such a person—having her favor is your luck, and yet you let her be hurt? It angers me!”
