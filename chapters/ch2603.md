## Chapter 2603 — The Third Disciple in Chaos

“Master is still alive...” Third Disciple staggered, a look of immense relief spreading across her face before she burst out laughing. “Master... Master, where are you?”

As she spoke, Third Disciple suddenly began to cry again, looking like a lost child who couldn’t find her way home.

Yang Kai’s face darkened at once, realizing that the Third Disciple’s state was rather unstable, her mood shifting unpredictably.

Whoosh—

In a flash, Third Disciple appeared behind Yang Kai, tear stains still on her face, but now grinning as she said, “So you were here, Master! Shall I comb your hair for you?”

As she spoke, she actually reached out and began carefully combing Yang Kai’s messy hair strand by strand.

What was happening? Yang Kai probed the Third Disciple with his Divine Sense and found that although her mind was chaotic, her expression had calmed as she carefully tended to his hair, lock by lock.

Had she mistaken him for Senior Bing Yun?

Her mind was clearly confused—Yang Kai's build was nothing like Bing Yun's, not even the same gender—so such a mistake was proof of the Third Disciple's severe mental disarray.

An idea struck Yang Kai. He suddenly put on a stern face and said in a deep voice, “Rebellious disciple, do you know your mistake?”

At these words, the Third Disciple, standing behind him, shuddered, her face filling with fear. She hurried around to face Yang Kai, dropped to her knees, bowed her head, and trembled, “Please, Master, enlighten me!”

She really had mistaken him for Senior Bing Yun.

Delighted inside, Yang Kai kept a stern expression and scolded, “I have safely returned to Ice Heart Valley, yet why have you remained outside? Has the allure of the outside world disturbed your Dao Heart, making you linger and forget to return?”

Third Disciple replied in a trembling voice, “Disciple wouldn’t dare. I was outside... I was outside because...”

She stammered for a long time but couldn’t say why she’d been outside, as if she’d forgotten what she’d been doing all along. A look of confusion slowly appeared on her dirty face.

Yang Kai secretly thought this was bad. If she kept thinking, things might get troublesome again. He immediately barked, “Since you dare not, then follow me back to Ice Heart Valley and serve at my side from now on. Without my order, you are not to leave!”

The confusion on Third Disciple’s face vanished instantly. She respectfully replied, “Yes, disciple obeys!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. “Very good, rise.”

“Thank you, Master!”

“Stand aside. I need to circulate my energy to heal. No one is to approach during this time!” Yang Kai instructed again.

Third Disciple obediently followed the order, moving to the side. Her beautiful eyes were full of vigilance as she looked around, as if guarding Yang Kai.

Seeing her like this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh. He hadn’t meant to take advantage of the Third Disciple, but she was so unpredictable that if she ran off again, who knew if he’d ever find her. Using this method to settle her down was for the best.

He quietly observed the Third Disciple for a while. Seeing no signs of madness, Yang Kai finally began circulating his cultivation to refine the Phoenix Blood Fruit in his body.

This time, his injuries were severe. The pain in his flesh was one thing, but more than a dozen bones were broken, especially his legs, which had been shattered in a single blow from Shi Huo. His internal organs were also filled with clotted blood, his body a complete mess inside.

Fortunately, his physical constitution was extremely strong, and the Golden Blood’s recovery ability was formidable. Otherwise, with such injuries, an ordinary person would be barely clinging to life, if not dead already.

As Emperor Yuan circulated, the medicinal effects of the Phoenix Blood Fruit gradually spread, and his broken bones slowly knit together. His bruised and swollen face also began to recover.

The Phoenix Blood Fruit truly deserved its reputation as a holy medicine. Even before the spiritual fruit’s effects were fully spent, Yang Kai already felt he was out of danger.

Only the newly mended bones would still need some time to fully recover.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai opened his eyes and glanced at the Third Disciple, finding her still standing guard for him.

Ten li away, led by the three Saint Venerables, a crowd of Yao Kings, Saint Envoys, and even the Stone Spirit Race were all silently watching from afar, each with a different expression and complicated feelings.

Especially Xie Wuwei, who had been forced to become Yang Kai’s soul slave earlier. He was still full of resentment, thinking Yang Kai was too despicable. If not for Yang Kai kicking him while he was down, he would never have handed over his soul brand willingly.

But now, Xie Wuwei no longer dared think that way.

Didn’t he see the three Saint Venerables treating Yang Kai with utmost respect? During his healing, none of them dared disturb him, and they even issued orders for all Yao Kings and Saint Envoys to remember Yang Kai’s face and treat him as they would a Saint Venerable in the future.

Even the Saint Venerables didn’t dare act arrogantly before him—what was a Yao King like him worth?

Xie Wuwei was convinced, truly convinced. At the same time, he was deeply regretful. If he’d known that the little girl with Yang Kai was a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher, he would have tried to get on her good side long ago.

If he had, maybe when that Heaven’s Punisher descendant entered the Blood Gate, she would have taken pity and brought him in too, letting him inherit the power of a Divine Spirit. But now, the Heaven’s Punisher descendant had already entered the Blood Gate, bringing a Stone Spirit to inherit Tai Yue’s power, while he could only watch with envy.

The more he thought about it, the more Xie Wuwei’s heart ached with regret.

“Third Disciple, call over those three Saint Venerables and the Stone Spirit Elder,” Yang Kai suddenly ordered.

Third Disciple bowed and set off toward the group ten li away, while Yang Kai walked alone to the Mountain and River Bell lying on the ground, examining it closely as if searching for something hidden on its surface.

Forced to remove his Soul Brand from the Mountain and River Bell, this ancient treasure from the Primordial Era had become ownerless again, and no one had touched it since it fell here.

Ten li away, the Third Disciple flew over. At a glance, her clothes were tattered, her pretty face dirty, almost unrecognizable.

Many eyes watched her curiously, unsure of her identity.

Xie Wuwei, however, knew Yang Kai had been searching for the Third Disciple and had seen her image before, but now was not the time to say anything.

“By Master’s order, the three of you and the Stone Spirit Elder are requested to come over,” Third Disciple said, her gaze sweeping over Fan Wu and the others, her tone calm.

“Master...” Fan Wu and the others were startled, not knowing what was going on.

They knew Yang Kai’s cultivation well—he was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm—while this dirty woman was at the Second Stage. Why would she call Yang Kai ‘Master’?

Yet, from her tone and demeanor, she didn’t seem to be joking.

Full of doubts, Fan Wu could only smile and nod. “Thank you, miss.”

After speaking, he started to walk over, but quickly remembered something, turned to the Stone Spirit Elder, and gestured, “Elder, after you.”

The Elder chuckled, understanding Fan Wu’s caution, and made a gesture for the three Saint Venerables to go together with him.

In no time, the four of them, led by Third Disciple, arrived at the former battlefield.

“Master!” Third Disciple called out, indicating she had brought the people, then respectfully stood aside.

Yang Kai nodded and stepped forward to greet them.

“Sir Yang!” Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou all cupped their fists in greeting, forcing smiles onto their faces.

But Yang Kai didn’t even glance at them, walking straight to the Stone Spirit Elder and greeting him with a smile. “Elder!”

Fan Wu and the others looked awkward but could only step aside in embarrassment.

“Sir Yang!” The Elder dared not act arrogantly now. With Yang Kai’s close relationship to the Heaven’s Punisher descendant, no living being in the Ancient Land would dare be disrespectful to him.

Yang Kai pressed down the Elder’s cupped fists and sighed, “Elder, as you’ve seen, though today’s events were a bit turbulent, I did not fail in my mission. Xiaoxiao has now entered the Blood Gate, and with Ruoxi’s help, he will surely inherit Tai Yue’s power in time.”

Although the Elder had already heard the story from Fan Wu and the others, hearing it from Yang Kai himself still made him tremble with excitement. “Sir Yang, my Stone Spirit Race will never forget your great kindness.”

“You’re too polite, Elder!” Yang Kai smiled. “Although Xiaoxiao is a member of the Stone Spirit Race, I raised him myself and wish him well. There’s no need to stand on ceremony between us.”

The Elder’s eyes lit up. “For Shi Jiu to become your disciple, Mister Yang, is the greatest fortune of his life, and a blessing for my Stone Spirit Race as well.”

Yang Kai said, “Elder, rest assured. From now on, in this Ancient Land, the Stone Spirit Race will never be disturbed again, and no one will force you to do anything you don’t wish to do...” At this, he glanced sidelong at Fan Wu and the other two, snorting, “What do you three think?”

Fan Wu quickly replied, “Sir Yang is right. From today on, the Stone Spirit Race will never be disturbed again. We will warn all our subordinates that within a million li of the Stone Spirit Race’s territory, no one is to trespass. Any violators will be killed without mercy!”

Luan Feng and Cang Gou nodded in agreement, clearly having no objections.

Yang Kai snorted, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and looked at the Elder. “Elder, are you satisfied with this? If not, we can discuss it further. The three Saint Venerables are reasonable people—if you have any requests, just tell them.”

Fan Wu hurriedly said, “Yes, yes, Elder, if you have any requests, just say the word. If we can fulfill them, we certainly will.”

The Elder laughed, “That’s enough, that’s enough. Our Stone Spirit Race is few in number—a million li is more than enough space.”

He looked deeply gratified, clearly very pleased with the outcome. Of course, he knew Fan Wu’s generosity was all for Yang Kai’s sake. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have given even ten thousand li, let alone a million.

The Elder was also full of emotion. Before coming here today, he was prepared to die trying. Who could have imagined such a joyful ending?

The Stone Spirit Race now had a powerful backer, and Shi Jiu was about to become the Divine Spirit Tai Yue.

With the Stone Spirit Race thriving, the Wood Spirit Race, who lived alongside them, would also prosper, free from future troubles. This was the life the Elder had dreamed of for countless years but never achieved.

But now, Yang Kai had resolved it all with just a few words.
