## Chapter 75–76 — Shopkeeper Meng Arrives

“That’s exactly it!” Su Xuanwu sneered coldly. “Why was Wei Zhuang wearing a defensive secret treasure during his spar with Su Mu? Doesn’t that break sect rules? How should this be dealt with?”

Before Yang Kai’s punishment was even mentioned, Su Xuanwu had already lumped Wei Zhuang in with him, causing the Grand Elder’s expression to flicker in surprise, uncertain how to respond.

“If Wei Zhuang truly defeated Su Mu by his own skill, then it’s only because Su Mu’s cultivation is lacking. Now Wei Zhuang, relying on his secret treasure’s protection, dares to humiliate my grandson. Senior Brother, do you take me Su Xuanwu for a fool?” Su Xuanwu roared angrily, slamming his palm down on the armrest of his chair, shattering it into pieces.

Wei Xitong had no choice but to lower his tone. “Second Junior Brother, calm yourself. That defensive secret treasure was indeed a gift from me to Wei Zhuang. I only wished to provide him with some extra protection, never imagining the boy’s arrogance would lead him to rely on it during sparring. This fault lies with Wei Zhuang.”

Then, with a sharp command to the hall below, “Wei Zhuang, why haven’t you apologized to Junior Brother Su Mu and admitted your mistake?”

Wei Zhuang was obedient enough and immediately cupped his fist toward Su Mu. “Junior Brother Su, this time it was Senior Brother Wei’s fault. I offer my apologies on his behalf. I hope you, with your magnanimous heart, will not take offense.”

“Hmph!” Su Mu turned his head away, refusing to respond.

But with things said to this point, what could Su Xuanwu do?

The Grand Elder continued, “Wei Zhuang is at fault, but Yang Kai’s mistake is far graver. Wielding a divine weapon, he nearly killed Wei Zhuang. If not for timely intervention by the Law Enforcement Hall disciples, Wei Zhuang would likely be dead now. This matter is serious; Yang Kai must be severely punished as a warning to others!”

Fourth Elder Zhou Fei and Fifth Elder You Zizai nodded repeatedly in agreement.

Second Elder sneered, “So Wei Zhuang breaks sect rules and a mere apology suffices, but Yang Kai must be severely punished? Is it because Wei Zhuang is your grandson, Senior Brother, that he enjoys special privileges? If so, how can the Lingxiao Pavilion elders maintain any authority before the disciples?”

Wei Xitong’s expression turned serious. “Second Junior Brother, your words are mistaken. Yang Kai’s offense and Wei Zhuang’s cannot be equated. Wei Zhuang only wore a defensive secret treasure to protect himself, never intending harm. Yang Kai, however, wielded a killing secret treasure with intent to kill. The difference in severity should be clear to you!”

Su Xuanwu asked, “May I ask, Senior Brother, who saw Yang Kai wielding a killing secret treasure? If such a weapon existed, why did the Law Enforcement Hall fail to find it on him? Fourth Elder, does your Law Enforcement Hall have any report on this?”

The Law Enforcement Hall was under Fourth Elder Zhou Fei’s command. Hearing this, he shook his head. “No report, but many witnesses saw Yang Kai holding a blood-red dagger. This cannot be fabricated. If not for the weapon’s immense power, Wei Zhuang’s Xiuyun Chainmail would not have been destroyed.”

Su Xuanwu snorted coldly, circulating his primordial qi. Suddenly, a slender longsword formed at his fingertips, shimmering with power.

“If that’s the case, then am I also wielding a weapon right now?” Su Xuanwu glared at the three elders opposite him.

“This is merely a subtle use of primordial qi, hardly a weapon,” Fifth Elder You Zizai slowly shook his head.

“Second Senior Brother means to say that Yang Kai, only at Open Origin Realm, Third Stage, can already manipulate primordial qi to such a degree?” Fourth Elder Zhou Fei smiled faintly at Su Xuanwu.

This was laughable. Only when a warrior reaches the True Essence Realm can their primordial qi transform into true essence and condense into a tangible weapon. Yang Kai, a mere Open Origin Realm Third Stage, was worlds away from such ability.

“I never said he controlled primordial qi to that extent. Have you forgotten about martial techniques?” Su Xuanwu snorted.

“Impossible. Even if he used some strange martial technique, a mere Open Origin Realm Third Stage warrior cannot break through Xiuyun Chainmail’s defense,” Wei Xitong shook his head repeatedly.

“There is nothing impossible in this world. It only means you elders have been trapped in Lingxiao Pavilion’s power struggles for too long, your thinking ossified and outdated!”

This harsh remark caused Wei Xitong’s expression to darken. “Second Junior Brother, must you defend Yang Kai so fiercely?”

“So what if I do!” Su Xuanwu suddenly stood. “This matter is merely a sparring match between juniors, yet you insist on making a fuss. Fine, I will satisfy your unreasonable demands. Either punish Yang Kai and Wei Zhuang together—they both broke sect rules, no exceptions—or let this matter drop.”

“No!” Wei Xitong refused outright. “Even if Yang Kai used martial techniques to break through Xiuyun Chainmail, he is young but ruthless and cruel. If his cultivation advances, he will surely fall to the dark path. Lingxiao Pavilion cannot tolerate such a person!”

“He’s only at Open Origin Realm. How can you know he will fall to the dark path? Do you, Senior Brother, possess foresight?”

“Second Senior Brother...” Fourth Elder Zhou Fei was about to speak but was cut off by Su Xuanwu’s angry shout, pointing a finger at him. “Fourth Elder, before the Sect Leader went into seclusion, he appointed you to oversee the Law Enforcement Hall. Look at what the Law Enforcement Hall has done these years! Where is fairness and justice? If the Law Enforcement Hall only suppresses dissent and aids power struggles, what use is it? Tomorrow, I will report to the Sect Leader and ask for its abolition! Damn it, what a joke!”

Fourth Elder was scolded speechless, unable to retort, feeling deeply aggrieved.

“Second Junior Brother, what if I insist on expelling Yang Kai from Lingxiao Pavilion?” Wei Xitong asked coldly.

“You dare!” Su Xuanwu refused to yield.

“Fine, then let us follow the Sect Leader’s original rules and hold a vote. Once the elders decide, I trust you will have no objections?”

“Heh, a vote?” Su Xuanwu laughed loudly. “Senior Brother, do you take me for a fool? If a vote is needed, why bother voting?”

“This won’t do, that won’t do. What exactly do you want? Do you even respect the Sect Leader’s rules?” Wei Xitong’s anger flared as well.

The Elder Hall was thick with tension, on the verge of erupting into violence.

“Calm down, calm down. Have some water, everyone calm yourselves,” the Third Elder, who had remained silent, interjected.

The Third Elder was mild-tempered and usually did not involve himself in disputes, though he sided with Second Elder. His name matched his habit: He Beishui, “Drink Water!”

Whenever friction arose among the elders, he would offer this advice, though it rarely helped.

“No!” The Grand Elder and Second Elder shouted simultaneously, glaring at each other, neither willing to yield.

The Third Elder sighed and drank alone.

As the elders argued, a sudden voice came from outside the door: “Disciple has urgent matter to report to the elders!”

Fourth Elder furrowed his brow and quickly said, “Enter!”

Normally, disciples dared not interrupt elder meetings. Such an arrival meant a serious matter had occurred.

The elders all paused their quarrel.

The disciple entered, and Fourth Elder Zhou Fei asked, “What is it?”

“Reporting, Elder. Someone broke into the Law Enforcement Hall’s Forest Prison and rescued the troublemakers Yang Kai and Li Yuntian. They are now confronting Senior Brother Jie Hongchen at the prison gate.”

“What?” Fourth Elder stood immediately, the others showing shocked expressions.

“Who is so brazen as to break into the Forest Prison to rescue prisoners?”

The Lingxiao Pavilion disciple dared not answer, only casting a timid glance at Su Xuanwu.

Su Xuanwu’s heart skipped a beat, a bad premonition stirring.

The Grand Elder took it all in calmly, already suspecting the truth. He instructed, “Speak.”

“It was... Su Yan, Senior Sister Su Yan!”

At these words, the Grand Elder’s smile deepened with meaning. Fourth and Fifth Elders also glanced oddly at Su Xuanwu, while the Third Elder continued sipping his water.

Su Xuanwu’s expression twisted with rage, grinding his teeth. “Are you sure? The one who broke into the Forest Prison was really Su Yan?”

The Law Enforcement Hall disciple shivered, hastily replying, “I saw clearly. I know Senior Sister Su Yan’s name well. If Second Elder doubts, you may go see for yourself!”

“No need.” Su Xuanwu waved his hand and closed his eyes to divine. Moments later, he truly sensed a pure chill from the Forest Prison—an aura only Su Yan could possess in the entire Lingxiao Pavilion.

The girl was reckless and brazen!

“Second Junior Brother, what is your opinion on this matter?” The Grand Elder smiled, sipping tea, waiting for Su Xuanwu to withdraw his divine sense before speaking calmly.

At this moment, the Grand Elder was confident.

If before neither side would yield, now there was a breakthrough.

The Forest Prison was the Lingxiao Pavilion’s place to detain errant disciples. Regardless of Yang Kai’s guilt, once imprisoned, he must remain there until the matter was resolved.

Now, Su Yan had rushed in and pulled him out. Such reckless bravery violated sect rules gravely.

If mishandled, even Su Yan would be punished!

Wei Xitong knew Su Xuanwu would never allow Su Yan to be implicated. Since that was so, he had to concede, and the one to be sacrificed would naturally be Yang Kai.

None of the five elders knew Yang Kai personally. The reason for making such a fuss was mainly to seize control within Lingxiao Pavilion.

Now, the Grand Elder felt victory was within reach.

Once this matter spread, disciples would naturally believe the Grand Elder’s faction controlled the Pavilion’s decisions and direction, achieving their goal.

Su Xuanwu’s face was dark as he struggled internally before finally speaking bitterly, “Senior Brother, do as you will.”

With Su Yan as a bargaining chip, Su Xuanwu had no heart to continue the fight. To protect Su Yan from punishment, Yang Kai had to be sacrificed.

Better to preserve the green mountains than burn all the firewood; there would be chances to regain ground later.

“Old Ghost!” Su Mu’s eyes widened in disbelief at this.

“What did you call me?” Su Xuanwu was furious at the siblings.

“Grandfather! You can’t do this!” Su Mu quickly corrected himself.

“This matter is none of your concern!” Su Xuanwu glared fiercely.

“Senior Brother Yang saved my life. You cannot abandon him. If you do, you are ungrateful!”

“Shut up!” Su Xuanwu’s face flushed red. Though unwilling, he was powerless now.

To silence Su Mu’s protests, Su Xuanwu sent a finger strike through the air. Su Mu froze like a statue, unable to speak or move, forced to watch and listen.

“I’ll deal with you when we return!” Su Xuanwu snorted.

“Heh!” The Grand Elder smiled with satisfaction. “Since Second Junior Brother has no objections, the matter is settled.”

He then addressed the disciples below, “Order passed down: Trial Disciple Yang Kai has repeatedly broken sect rules, acting with ruthless cruelty. The Law Enforcement Hall has captured him and returned him to the Forest Prison. The elders will decide his fate later. As for Su Yan... considering her youth and ignorance, and that this is her first offense, no punishment will be given. What say you, fellow elders?”

No one objected.

“Very well!” The Grand Elder waved his hand, and a token flew down, landing in the disciple’s hand.

The Elder Token commands absolute obedience. With it, Su Yan dared not act rashly again.

“Yes!” The Law Enforcement Hall disciple accepted the order and quickly withdrew.

Moments later, a sudden, sharp scream came from the entrance, followed by the sound of a body falling. The elders’ expressions changed, rising to investigate, when a voice called out from outside.

“Such great authority you elders wield,” said an old man with thinning white hair, slowly entering. He carried the previously dispatched Law Enforcement Hall disciple, now unconscious, and had even seized the Elder Token.

The old man approached the kneeling Wei Zhuang and Su Mu, casually kicking Wei Zhuang aside. “Move, don’t block the way!”

Wei Zhuang was sent flying with a cry of pain.

The five elders’ faces grew grave. Wei Xitong squinted at the newcomer. “Shopkeeper Meng?”

The man was none other than Meng Wuya of the Contribution Hall.

The five elders were puzzled by this figure.

Over a decade ago, he suddenly appeared at Lingxiao Pavilion. His connection to the Sect Leader was unknown, yet he took residence within the Pavilion, overseeing the Contribution Hall. The elders had inquired about him many times, but the Sect Leader was always vague, leaving them baffled.

Yet all knew Meng Wuya was a formidable expert, one not inferior to themselves.

Fortunately, he had no apparent ambitions and spent his days quietly in the Contribution Hall, so the elders paid him little mind.

But today, he had come uninvited to the Elder Hall.

Wei Xitong felt an unusual pressure facing Shopkeeper Meng, even greater than when confronting the Sect Leader. Thus, he dared not neglect him.

Smiling, Wei Xitong asked, “Shopkeeper Meng, what brings you to our Elder Hall?”

Meng Wuya said nothing, only smiling as he fixed his gaze on Su Xuanwu. The latter felt inexplicably uneasy, wondering why he was being stared at.

“Do you truly believe your decision is correct?” Meng Wuya suddenly asked.

“What?” Su Xuanwu was taken aback.
