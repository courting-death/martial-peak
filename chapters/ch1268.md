## Chapter 1268 — Departure

Inside a pavilion on Dragon Lair Mountain, Daiyuan sat by the second-floor window, resting her chin on her hand as she stared down below, her face full of anxious, wavering emotion.

Dragon Lair Mountain had always been peaceful and quiet; only a few dozen martial artists lived here. Although their cultivation levels were not high, they were exceptionally diligent, spending most of their time secluded in cultivation, with only the guards occasionally pacing about to check the surrounding area.

Today was the three-day deadline she and Yang Kai had agreed on. Daiyuan had woken from meditation at dawn and sat here restless, hoping to spot Yang Kai's figure below.

Even though she knew it was likely wishful thinking, she still clung to a last thread of hope.

The sun had already risen, and the warm sunlight bathed the land, adding a faint, dreamlike beauty to Dragon Lair Mountain. This place was indeed an excellent spot for cultivation and quiet living — hardly any worse than her own Thousand Illusion Peak back at Liuli Sect.

She really couldn't understand how these people had turned an ordinary mountain into such a place. She'd heard this place had once been neglected, but now it had become a renowned Sacred Land nearby; many unaffiliated martial artists came by reputation, hoping to join and find a place to settle.

Yet the martial artists here did not accept outsiders, nor did they intend to grow large; they merely lived and cultivated for themselves.

That was a wise approach—after all, they were right under Yingyue Hall's watchful eye; if they truly intended to expand, Yingyue Hall would never stand idly by.

Thinking of this, Daiyuan couldn't help but smile wryly. With Yang Kai in command, given his shrewdness and means, he certainly wouldn't do anything that would dig his own grave; she realized she'd been needlessly worried.

After indulging in a few idle thoughts, her mood settled considerably. She looked up at the sky—it was well into the morning—and then down again, but there was still no sign of the figure she hoped to see.

Daiyuan sighed softly, knowing she had likely waited in vain. There was no resentment or unwillingness, only a bitter smile at the corner of her mouth. Just as she, full of disappointment, turned to leave, her expression suddenly changed. She turned back.

In an instant Daiyuan's eyes brightened; surprise and joy shone in them as she stared downward at a figure who had appeared without her noticing.

"Miss Daiyuan, good morning!" Yang Kai stood below, smiling cheerfully as he greeted her.

Daiyuan froze for a moment, but quickly regained her composure and gave Yang Kai a slight nod. "Good morning, Junior Brother Yang Kai. Please wait a moment—I will come down at once!"

Saying that, she swiftly turned and headed down from the pavilion; though her expression was steady, her slightly hurried steps betrayed her inner nervousness.

She didn't know what answer Yang Kai would give. If he intended to refuse her, there was no need to come so early, right? Besides, his evasiveness a few days earlier had been obvious; even if he refused, she wouldn't be surprised.

But if he had agreed, what was his reason? She had no confidence in being able to persuade him.

Her heart fluttering with worry, Daiyuan soon reached the pavilion's first floor. Seeing Yang Kai, her eyes fixed on him and for a moment she didn't know what to say.

"Miss Daiyuan, do you have anything to pack? If not, let's set off right now!" Yang Kai said, a warm, breezy smile on his face.

"Ah?" Daiyuan was stunned and stood rooted to the spot.

Yang Kai chuckled, "What, Miss Daiyuan, weren't you going to accompany me to Liuli Sect? Has the scenery of Dragon Lair Mountain bewitched you into wanting to stay? If that's the case, you could stay a few more days."

"No, no!" Daiyuan snapped back to herself, hurriedly waving her hand, eyes brimming with delight. "The scenery here is lovely, but I have no heart to enjoy it—it's just..."

"You're wondering why I agreed to go with you?" Yang Kai said with a half-smile, seeing through her doubts.

Daiyuan's face showed a trace of embarrassment. She had asked Yang Kai to go to Liuli Sect, and now that he had readily agreed, her previous suspicion felt improper.

"It's simple," Yang Kai said with a prepared explanation. "Since returning from Flowing Flame Sandland I secluded myself for half a year; I feel it's time to go out and see the world. I'm currently at a bottleneck in cultivation and don't want to shut myself away. You know my background, so I'm curious about the major Sects on Dark Star; this is an opportunity to get up close, and I don't want to miss it—it's good to broaden one's horizons."

Hearing this, Daiyuan's doubts vanished and she smiled broadly. "I see. Although our Liuli Sect is not weak on Dark Star, in terms of sect prestige and might it is inferior to the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect. If you ever have the chance to visit them you'll see Liuli Sect's shortcomings. But Junior Brother Yang Kai has reached a cultivation bottleneck again—truly astonishing talent."

Daiyuan meant this sincerely. When they acted together in Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had only been at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm; whatever he had encountered after they parted had allowed him to break through to the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, and now reaching the peak of the Second Stage was still astonishing.

It seemed the opportunities Yang Kai had gained in Flowing Flame Sandland were indeed considerable; otherwise his cultivation could not have advanced so rapidly, Daiyuan thought to herself.

But upon reaching a bottleneck, one ought to travel around.

With that in mind, Daiyuan smiled: "I have nothing to pack; let's set off. Liuli Sect isn't close—even by Space Array it would take a month."

"No matter, this trip is mainly to clear my mind, time isn't an issue. By the way, I forgot to tell you—it's not just me going; Yang Yan will accompany me. Is that convenient?" Yang Kai suddenly changed his tone and asked.

"Yang Yan? That's no problem." Daiyuan agreed at once without hesitation. Turning to look around, she saw Yang Yan in a black robe standing not far off, like a dark, delicate blossom.

Yang Kai took the initiative to explain, “This Senior Sister of mine has quite the interest in formations, so she insisted on coming along to see how your sect’s arrays are arranged — hoping to learn something from them. You know how women are… ahem — I couldn’t talk her out of it, so I had no choice but to bring her with me.”

Yang Kai had meant to say that women tended to be troublesome, but realizing mid-sentence that he shouldn't, he swallowed the rest. Even so, Daiyuan shot him a mildly reproachful glance, making him feel embarrassed.

He had been momentarily thoughtless and forgotten that Daiyuan was a woman too.

Still, Yang Yan's external identity was indeed Yang Kai's Senior Sister—something Yang Kai had mentioned to Qian Tong before.

Daiyuan agreed readily; Yang Kai did not hesitate. He beckoned Yang Yan over, and the three of them all produced their Star Shuttles, turning into streaks of light as they shot out from Dragon Lair Mountain.

Although Yang Kai and Yang Yan had left, Wu Yi remained in charge. With the array Yang Yan had set up beforehand and the token left to Wu Yi, Dragon Lair Mountain would remain safe unless faced with an overwhelmingly powerful assault. Besides, there were no enemies at present, so there was little to worry about.

Soon the three arrived at Tianyun City.

When Daiyuan had come before she had flown directly from Liuli Sect, without using any city's Space Array, so when she said three days earlier that no one knew of her arrival here, it wasn't false—neither Wei Guchang nor Xuan'er, both in seclusion, had any knowledge.

It was precisely because flying from Liuli Sect had consumed so much time that she had arrived here a month ago.

Fortunately, Yingyue Hall and Liuli Sect maintained good relations, and Daiyuan held a certain position within Liuli Sect, so using Tianyun City's Space Array wasn't difficult; after paying a sum of Saint Crystals as a fee, the Space Array opened for them.

Passing through several city Space Arrays, Daiyuan then led with her Star Shuttle, urging Yang Kai and Yang Yan to speed onward.

The three moved like a thunderbolt in speed, but the journey itself was rather monotonous.

Daiyuan was not one who enjoyed conversation; had she not needed something from Yang Kai, she wouldn't have deliberately made friends with him back in Flowing Flame Sandland. Yang Yan seemed shy by nature, always shrouded by her black robe as if afraid of showing her face. Thus, aside from Yang Kai speaking a few words, the two women remained silent, heads down as they hurried on.

Seeing this, Yang Kai sensibly kept silent as well, continuing to refine the Golden Blood Threads within him while secretly spurring his Artifact Spirit and the Origin-Grade refining furnace to hasten the refinement of the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl.

He did not waste the time on the road, making full use of every moment.

The more he refined the Golden Blood Threads, the more intrigued he became by the Demon Blood Sect's Demon Blood Threads technique; having obtained only half of that tailor-made secret technique left him deeply regretful.

However, his friendship with Deng Ning of the Demon Blood Sect had left a sliver of opportunity; in the future it would not be impossible to acquire the remaining half of the technique, though that would require him to become far stronger first.

Time slipped by; amid the three travelers a month flashed past, the journey uneventful and without disturbance.

One day, while Yang Kai sat upon his Star Shuttle silently refining the Golden Blood Threads and urging the furnace's power, Daiyuan—who was leading the way ahead—suddenly paused and her Star Shuttle came to a stop.

Seeing this, Yang Kai drew back his attention and, together with Yang Yan, halted behind her to peer forward. Ahead lay a faintly visible stretch of mountain range with nothing extraordinary, and Yang Kai realized Liuli Sect should be located within those mountains.
