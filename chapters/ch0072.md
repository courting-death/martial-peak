## Chapter 72 — What a Grand Array

A series of swallowing sounds echoed through the room.

“Senior Brother, what should we do?” one of them asked nervously, fearing that if they continued to strike, they might truly kill this Yang Kai.

“This bastard is a madman!” the Qi Movement Realm disciple growled through clenched teeth, his eyes trembling slightly. “Enough! If he dares to come at us, we strike back! This time, we must knock him unconscious!”

“Agreed!” the other four replied in a disheveled chorus.

Just as the five remained on high alert, an inexplicable chill rose from the depths of their hearts. Immediately, the temperature within the sealed chamber dropped significantly.

Crackling sounds came from all directions. Startled, the five turned their heads to see a thin layer of frost forming on the walls and floor.

“What’s happening?” one of them muttered, shivering involuntarily.

With a thunderous crash, the chamber door was kicked open.

“Who goes there!” the Qi Movement Realm disciple barked, turning to face the intruder. His mouth fell open in shock, unable to close it no matter how hard he tried.

Despite the sudden cold that filled the room like the dead of winter, a fine layer of cold sweat appeared on the man’s forehead as he stared blankly at the figure standing in the doorway—a woman. Stammering, he managed, “S... Senior Sister Su Yan!”

“Senior Sister Su Yan?” The other four’s faces changed drastically as they followed his gaze. There stood a woman of peerless beauty, her countenance cool and aloof, clad in pristine white robes.

She was like a pure white snow lotus blooming atop an eternal, unmelting mountain, descending upon the mortal world with an aura of cold nobility. Her gaze swept over the five, and an unexplainable sense of shame welled up within them, forcing them to lower their heads involuntarily.

Su Yan had just hurried back from Black Wind Trade City, with no time to investigate the situation. Assuming Su Mu had also been imprisoned in the Forest Prison, she had rushed over in haste. Upon sensing signs of battle here, she came to see for herself.

What she saw upon entering the chamber made her heart tremble.

Inside were six people: five were Enforcement Hall disciples—one at Qi Movement Realm, Second Stage, and four at Open Origin Realm. The other was a bloodied and battered figure, his clothes torn and tattered, staggering but standing firm. Yet in his eyes burned an unyielding will.

That person... she had seen before.

Yang Kai! Once, Su Mu had brought him to Black Wind Trade City. He was the one who had defeated Cheng Shaofeng’s trial disciple!

Extending her Divine Sense, Su Yan probed lightly and was even more astonished. Yang Kai’s body was covered in wounds. Though none were fatal, given his strength, he should have long since collapsed. How resilient must his will be to keep him standing despite such grievous injuries?

In mere moments, Su Yan understood everything that had transpired within this chamber. Her usually calm heart now stirred with an unfamiliar fire.

With a flash, she was by Yang Kai’s side, supporting him with one hand. Icy cold primordial energy flowed into his body, stabilizing his internal and external injuries.

Strangely, the chill seemed to soothe Yang Kai’s turbulent qi and blood, calming them rapidly. His dazed spirit cleared considerably.

A pure fragrance lingered in the air. Yang Kai turned to look at Su Yan beside him. His previously grimacing face softened. Though she was not tall—half a head shorter than him—at this moment, Yang Kai felt a peace he had never known.

It was as if standing alone on a vast, empty snow mountain, surrounded only by refreshing coolness, with all worldly clamor fading away. With her by his side, Yang Kai unconsciously harbored a desire to walk hand in hand with her and retreat into the mountains.

“Who struck you?” Su Yan’s voice was calm and cold.

The five Enforcement Hall disciples trembled. They looked at one another, then lowered their heads and admitted, “All of us did.”

Before Su Yan, even lies felt like blasphemy. Her noble, imposing aura left them no choice but to speak truthfully.

Su Yan nodded slightly. “Very well.”

Without another word, she helped Yang Kai to his feet and turned, stepping out of the chamber.

Only after Su Yan’s figure disappeared did the five exhale heavily, feeling as if they had narrowly escaped death.

But before they could fully rejoice, each suddenly felt a chill at their chest. Looking down, they saw frost forming there, quickly spreading into an ice flower half the size of a palm.

With a shattering sound, the five ice flowers simultaneously exploded. The five gasped, faces pale, collapsing to their knees. They felt their Yuan Qi vanish with the shards of frost, and severe injuries spread across their bodies.

“So powerful! No wonder she’s the top of the Three Sects!” the Qi Movement Realm disciple said, trembling with lingering fear.

He had no idea when Su Yan had struck; the attack had come so silently and suddenly.

If not for her calm nature, today’s encounter would have been far more than a mere injury. With her strength, taking their lives would be as easy as crushing snails between fingers.

Outside the chamber, Yang Kai continued to stagger forward step by step. Hearing the commotion behind him, he turned in surprise and asked Su Yan, “You attacked them?”

Su Yan blinked her long lashes. “Yes. Are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” Yang Kai nodded. “By the way, bring Li Yuntian and the others out as well.”

“Su Mu?” Su Yan inquired.

“Unknown,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “He wasn’t imprisoned here. He should have been sent back. Those people dare not harm Su Mu.”

Hearing this, Su Yan finally breathed a sigh of relief.

The two proceeded deeper into the Forest Prison until they reached where Li Yuntian and the others were held. The group was stunned to see Yang Kai and Su Yan appear together, so close. They were so shocked they forgot to breathe.

Heavens! If only I could be that close to Senior Sister Su Yan, even death would be welcome! Li Yuntian and the others were envious to the point of desperation.

“Come out,” Su Yan waved her hand, breaking the prison door’s lock.

“Ah…” the group responded absentmindedly, then foolishly stepped out, their eyes darting constantly between Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Even Su Yan’s composed nature faltered slightly under their gaze.

“Let’s go. I’ll lead you out.” Su Yan’s face remained cold and beautiful as she supported Yang Kai, walking ahead with Li Yuntian and the others following.

Before long, they emerged from the Forest Prison. The bright light made everyone squint, but outside, nearly a hundred Enforcement Hall disciples stood in tight formation, encircling the exit.

“What a grand array!” Yang Kai sneered. “Senior Sister, this must be set up to deal with you.”

Su Yan said nothing, merely casting a cold glance over the crowd as she continued to support Yang Kai forward.

Wherever they passed, no one dared to block their way. All the Enforcement Hall disciples who tried to intercept them scattered in fear, willingly opening a path.
