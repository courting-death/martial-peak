## Chapter 370 — Take Care of Yourself

"You see it’s fine, then it’s fine! I trust you!" Yang Kai casually nodded.

"How generous you are." Qiu Yimeng huffed angrily, "If something goes wrong later, don’t come looking for me. Your fellow disciple may seem good, but compared to you, he’s far behind, like picking the tallest one among the short ones, I can only let him manage."

Luo Xiaoman beside her nodded vigorously, agreeing with her sentiment.

Although she harbored no good feelings towards Yang Kai, even fearing him to some extent, one could not deny that this man stood out among his peers.

His temperament, focus, determination, and strength were all significantly superior to others.

"You should know your fellow disciple better than I do. If you find him unsuitable, then just replace him," Qiu Yimeng said carelessly.

"No need to trouble yourself. Rebuilding the Sect is not a big deal, just let him manage it," Yang Kai slowly shook his head, then raised his eyes to glance outside, smiling lightly, "He’s here!"

Qiu Yimeng paused for a moment before hearing Jie Hongchen’s voice shouting from outside, "What are you stopping me for? I want to find Miss Qiu."

"Miss Qiu is currently discussing important matters with my young master and cannot let you in!" Tu Feng stood at the door, indifferently stating, his face icy.

Jie Hongchen couldn’t help but laugh, leisurely sizing up Tu Feng, "Your young master? Ha… What young master are you talking about, you aren’t referring to Yang Kai, are you? Have you made a mistake? This is my Lingxiao Pavilion’s territory, where can I not enter?"

While talking, he tried to barge in.

"You can’t enter!" Tu Feng remained firm at the entrance, showing no sign of yielding.

Jie Hongchen’s expression darkened, whispering, "Considering you came with Yang Kai, I’m giving you face. Don’t overestimate yourselves, get out of the way, or don’t blame me for being ruthless."

Tang Yuxian immediately revealed a charming smile, one that was quite intriguing.

Tu Feng coldly stared at Jie Hongchen. His expression did not change in the slightest.

Inside, Qiu Yimeng was smiling at Yang Kai, seemingly trying to read his expression for any clues.

"Let him in." Yang Kai frowned. No matter what, Jie Hongchen was a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, once a prominent figure within the Sect, yet now acting so foolishly. Yang Kai felt some loss of face.

Upon receiving the command, Tu Feng finally stepped aside.

Jie Hongchen snorted coldly, flicked his clothes, and strode arrogantly into the room.

Upon seeing the situation inside, his expression froze.

He noticed Yang Kai was actually sitting at the table with Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, a treatment he had never experienced.

Every time he came to see Qiu Yimeng, he always stood respectfully at the door, saying just a few words before being dismissed by her.

Why did Yang Kai get to sit here?

His heart filled with doubts and frustration, but he put on a smile. Jie Hongchen politely greeted, "Good to see you, Miss Qiu, Miss Luo."

"Mm." Qiu Yimeng lightly acknowledged, smiling sweetly, "You came at just the right time, my junior brother is discussing the reconstruction of Lingxiao Pavilion, and he seems to have some ideas to share with you."

"Oh?" Jie Hongchen chuckled lightly, narrowing his eyes to look at Yang Kai, "I’m curious what my junior brother has to say?"

His tone was casual, with a hint of provocation.

Qiu Yimeng quickly arranged her posture, showing a watching-the-show expression.

This was quite amusing; this fool still hadn’t realized Yang Kai’s true identity. Not only was he boasting in front of two Blood Servants, but he was also attempting to target a direct descendant of the Yang Family.

No matter how foolish someone was, they wouldn’t be this foolish, right?

Yang Kai frowned, saying, "I have no opinions on the matter, but I do have a request."

Jie Hongchen chuckled, "A request?"

"Yes."

In front of Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, Jie Hongchen couldn’t erupt in anger; he could only pretend to be magnanimous, nodding, "Let’s hear it."

"Rebuild everything in the Sect according to the original layout and deployment; all the buildings should be exact, not deviating even a bit. Senior Brother has lived in the Sect for so many years, familiar with every tree and every blade of grass here, supervising this should be achievable," Yang Kai stated.

Jie Hongchen's face twitched slightly. Yang Kai’s tone didn’t suggest negotiation but rather commanded him, which naturally made him uncomfortable.

Now that was quite a request!

Just as Jie Hongchen was about to retort, Yang Kai continued, "If manpower is lacking, then recruit from the nearby Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower, using the name of Miss Qiu, and afterward, give them some compensation."

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but roll her eyes but said nothing.

Jie Hongchen was stunned, not understanding why Qiu Yimeng didn’t seem to have any intention of rebutting.

"If you lack funds and resources… send a message to Zhongdu, let Miss Qiu arrange for you. The Qiu Family is affluent and won’t mind these matters, right?" Yang Kai smiled at Qiu Yimeng.

"Shameless!" Qiu Yimeng gritted her teeth in anger.

Jie Hongchen finally felt a sense of absurdity, his expression shifting constantly; at this point, if he didn’t see the issue, he truly was a fool.

This Junior Brother of Yang seemed to be in quite a different relationship with Qiu Yimeng. Otherwise, how could he make such statements without any response from her?

Rebuilding a second-rate Sect, while it may not be a big deal for the Qiu Family, would still require some financial and material resources.

Yang Kai determined this with just a few words? If he had no connection with Qiu Yimeng, how could she possibly agree?

Jie Hongchen’s heart surged with waves of shock, unconsciously realizing that his junior brother was no longer the same as before.

"Additionally…" Yang Kai lightly tapped his fingers on the table, taking some time before speaking in a deep tone, "Issue a call to gather all our scattered disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion from all over the world…"

"To come home!"

The last two words, Yang Kai spoke with absolute conviction, like a great drum striking within the hearts of everyone present, causing everyone to tremble involuntarily.

Only those who had lost their Sect and had no one to rely on knew how alluring the words 'come home' were.

The room fell silent, and Qiu Yimeng’s expression also grew serious.

"Does Senior Brother have anything else to add?" Yang Kai raised his gaze, turning to Jie Hongchen.

Jie Hongchen instinctively shook his head, "No."

During this time, he had focused on showing off and trying to impress Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, giving little thought to the plans and matters for rebuilding the Sect; where would he have anything to say?

"Then it’s settled," Yang Kai concluded decisively.

Jie Hongchen stared blankly for a long moment before suddenly regaining his wits, turning to Qiu Yimeng, "Miss Qiu, this…"

Qiu Yimeng’s expression was displeased as she said, "Didn’t you hear clearly?"

"I heard it clearly. But… can my junior brother be the master?" Jie Hongchen asked incredulously.

Qiu Yimeng smiled, "If he can’t be the master, then no one in the world can be."

Jie Hongchen felt a lightning bolt strike him, standing there dumbfounded, his eyes trembling as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had already risen indifferently, walking towards the door. As he passed Jie Hongchen, he suddenly halted. His voice low, he said, "Senior Brother, if you dare to do anything that betrays the Sect or your fellow disciples again, I will make you regret being alive in this world!"

Jie Hongchen felt a chill run down his spine, from head to toe!

Qiu Yimeng didn’t even glance at him as she followed Yang Kai out.

As Luo Xiaoman was about to step out, she was quickly called back by Jie Hongchen.

"What do you want?" Luo Xiaoman looked at him suspiciously, feeling sorry for the fool.

"Luo girl, my junior brother… what’s his background?" Jie Hongchen whispered, his lips dry.

Luo Xiaoman bit her red lips, stealing a glance outside before softly saying, "Direct descendant of the Yang Family from Zhongdu, take care of yourself!"

After speaking, she hurriedly chased after them.

Jie Hongchen suddenly felt his legs go weak, falling to the ground with a thud. In an instant, he broke out in a cold sweat.

Yang Family from Zhongdu, direct descendant!

Such a few simple words, yet they echoed like thunder in Jie Hongchen’s ears, almost blurring his consciousness.

So, the seemingly unremarkable junior brother, who didn’t seem too strong, was actually such a significant figure!

How ridiculous that he had targeted him over the years, even attempted to harm him.

What qualification did he have to oppose him? What qualification did he have to compete for favor?

He must have known about all the past events, but why hadn’t he killed him yet?

Being let off so lightly, Jie Hongchen felt no joy; instead, his heart turned to ashes!

Such treatment and coldness were even more painful than being killed!

He let him go because he felt he was no longer qualified to contend with him.

Would a fierce tiger care about a mere ant’s provocation?

"Hehe…" He nervously laughed a couple of times, and Jie Hongchen suddenly realized that he was indeed a complete failure in this life.

In Dragon Confinement Ravine, a hundred zhang deep.

Inside Yang Kai’s cave abode.

A group of people flew in.

Gazing at everything familiar and the various arrangements, flashes of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang’s faces appeared in Yang Kai’s mind.

The Sect was destroyed, and this place was the only one preserved intact.

Within the cave, there still seemed to linger the fragrance of the two women, and on the stone bed, various traces of intimacy with Su Yan were still left.

The little senior sister once slept there; no matter what happened, she would never wake when asleep, and even when taken advantage of, she would remain unfazed.

How could Yang Kai not know she was feigning sleep? Her highly shy nature made it difficult for Xia Ningshang to face Yang Kai’s teasing.

As for Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai wasn’t worried; she had been at Yao Wang Valley’s Hidden Cloud Peak, learning alchemy with Xiao Fusheng. With Meng Wuya guarding her, she must be quite safe.

But what about Su Yan?

Since their last parting, there had been no further news of her.

Where had she gone?

As if sensing Yang Kai’s heavy mood and longing in his eyes, the two Blood Servants, along with Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, quietly stood at the entrance, not disturbing him.

He walked inside, sitting on the smooth stone bed, gently stroking its surface as memories flooded his mind.

Once he left, it might be difficult to return here again.

Once he leaves, the outcome of the struggle for the heir in Zhongdu would be hard to predict.

In turmoil, it was only at this moment that Yang Kai realized how much he liked this place.
