## Chapter 1830 — Why Worry the Sect Won't Flourish

Ye Xijun had actually set out from Dark Star and arrived at Qingmu Star, which took Yang Kai by surprise.

He frowned and pondered, his expression shifting.

Seeing him like that, Ghost Ancestor and Yue Xi did not dare disturb him.

After a moment Yang Kai suddenly rose and hurriedly said, "Elder, come back to the Sect with me!"

"I'd be honored!" Ghost Ancestor chuckled. Although he had only just joined Lingxiao Sect and been appointed by Yang Kai as the Grand Elder, he had never actually visited the Lingxiao Sect before; naturally he wanted to see it for himself and establish an imposing image and aura of authority.

He wanted, too, to taste what it felt like to be admired and worshipped by ten thousand people.

"Sect Master, after Senior Luo Lan returned earlier she came to the temporary palace once and told the disciples that if the Sect Master returned you must go to Qingmu Palace, or wait here for her to come," Yue Xi hurriedly reported when she saw Yang Kai preparing to leave.

"There's no need to wait; Luo Lan coming to find me should be nothing serious." Yang Kai paused in thought, shook his head, and said, "Tell her that if there's a chance I'll go see her."

She probably only wanted to thank him; after all, in the Medicine Valley of the Lost Realm he gave her a tremendous favor—without the spatial imprint he gave her she could not have moved freely through the valley.

Yang Kai did not know how much she had gained, but it was certainly not little.

"Yes! Farewell, Sect Master! Farewell, Grand Elder!" Yue Xi stood and called aloud.

"You've worked hard. Take this little thing and play with it." Ghost Ancestor said as he casually tossed out an object. Yang Kai did not see clearly what it was, but it was likely a Secret Treasure.

Yue Xi's voice came from behind: "Thank you for the Grand Elder's gift!"

A moment later the two arrived again at the palace where the Great Space Array had been set up; under the reluctant gazes of the sisters He Zao and He Miao they activated the array and teleported to Dark Star.

"Old man truly has ill luck," Ghost Ancestor grumbled incessantly. "Following you brings so much wandering—just when I haven't had a moment's rest, I must endure this unpleasant trip again." Instantaneous teleportation across countless li was not something everyone could appreciate, and experiencing it repeatedly in a short span was hardly enjoyable.

Yang Kai gave a light laugh and ignored him. The next instant the two figures vanished.

They arrived on a mineral-rich mining star from Qingmu Star; to return to Lingxiao Sect they still had to take another teleport.

After landing on the mining star, Yang Kai did not disturb the disciples who were extracting ore. He quietly released his Divine Sense to verify they were safe, then immediately activated the Space Array again.

After repeating this a number of times, by the time they returned to Lingxiao Sect's great plaza Ghost Ancestor's face had turned ashen and he was staggering.

He had not cultivated spatial power like Yang Kai, and so the uninterrupted long-distance teleports had truly taken their toll.

Fortunately his cultivation was profound; otherwise he really would not have held up.

On the plaza some disciples were on duty; when they saw Yang Kai they were overjoyed and cried out, "The Sect Master has returned! The Sect Master has returned!"

These disciples were the earliest warriors who had followed Yang Kai, originally of the Haike Family. Over the years each had made substantial progress; rising talents like Wu Yi and Yu Feng were already close to grasping the mysteries of the Origin Returning Realm, and most of the rest had reached the Saint King Realm.

One must remember that in the past the strongest fighters of the Haike family had barely reached the Saint King Realm; had they remained in the family their whole lives they might never have broken through to their current levels. But after following Yang Kai, in only two or three decades they had achieved such success.

The duty disciple ran to a large bell at the side and pushed the striker forcefully to ring it.

Dong, dong, dong, dong...

The bell's sound reverberated across the eighty-one peaks of Lingxiao Sect, spreading to every corner of the Sect.

The next moment the whole Sect surged with excitement; from the towering peaks figures shot forth, racing toward the plaza.

Seeing Yang Kai's puzzled look, the duty disciple hurriedly reported, "The two Sect Master's wives issued an order: if the Sect Master returns strike this bell to inform them."

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded lightly, turned his gaze toward the direction of Ice Grace Peak, and his expression softened as a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

He could sense that Su Yan was already hastening toward them from Ice Grace Peak.

On another peak, Pill Treasure Peak, the Little Senior Sister's figure also appeared, riding the wind.

Figures crowded on the other peaks as well.

Ghost Ancestor looked on delightedly, doing his best to rein in the malevolent aura about him to leave a good impression.

In a short while a radiant figure descended from the sky: a robe whiter than snow, skin like polished jade, deep watery eyes fixed on Yang Kai as if to convey long-held longing.

If it was not Su Yan, then who could it be?

The Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang then alighted beside Su Yan, full of affectionate feeling and shy charm.

Ghost Ancestor's eyes brightened and he chuckled low, "Kid, your luck with beauties is impressive..."

At the same time he was secretly startled; with his sight he could discern certain signs—these two women were not only peerless beauties but each carried a power that unsettled even him.

Moreover, both of the girls were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors; especially the white-robed girl, whose aura was far above ordinary Origin Returning Realm strength—her icy presence even affected his Saint Yuan, sharp and biting.

The girl in green, while not oppressive, possessed a hidden power within that was nevertheless not to be underestimated.

This Sect seemed deeper and stronger than he had imagined, and a sense of recognition rose in Ghost Ancestor's heart.

After all, he was an expert of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. Although enticed into joining by Void King-Grade alchemists, if Lingxiao Sect were full of unremarkable fighters he would feel out of place.

Seeing the scene now, he was instantly filled with hope for the Sect's future.

"Boy, gone so long and you finally know to come back," a low rebuke sounded—only one person dared address Yang Kai that way.

Yang Kai turned and gave a light laugh, "Father."

Fourth Master Yang's face was stern. Though scolding, his eyes showed the relief of a burden lifted; Yang Kai had been away for a year or two, and as his father he had naturally worried whether Yang Kai had suffered setbacks or hardships. Seeing him safe and sound, the man felt a great weight lift from his heart.

Dong Suzhu shot Fourth Master Yang a glare and said, "Enough, the son is grown—why do you meddle so much? You have no ability yet boss everyone around; what kind of father are you?"

Fourth Master Yang gave an embarrassed smile. "An old fortuneteller in Zhongdu told me I was a late bloomer—said I would only come into my greatness later. Well, perhaps the time hasn't come yet; when it does, I'll soar and astonish the world..."

Dong Suzhu gave him a sideways look, disbelief plain on her face.

Fourth Master Yang made a poor show of it and glared at Yang Kai with eyes full of plaintive grievance.

The plaza was lively and noisy; it seemed every return of Yang Kai could win the passionate welcome of the crowd.

Ghost Ancestor, having been left standing aside for a long while with no one paying him heed, cleared his throat to attract attention. "Cough, cough... the Sect shows such cohesion. Why worry it won't prosper? It comforts me greatly," he said.

He had expected that arriving as a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert would bring the disciples' reverence and worship, but Yang Kai had stolen all the attention. The slight rankled.

"Yang Kai, this is..." Ling Taixu asked suspiciously, looking Ghost Ancestor over with a grave expression.

Ling Taixu now possessed the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation; the experts who had come from Tongxuan Continent, like Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya, had reached this level through steady accumulation. With their cultivation they could not probe the depths of Ghost Ancestor, and they wondered where Yang Kai had brought back such an inscrutable expert.

"Right, I forgot to introduce him—this Ghost Ancestor will in future be our Lingxiao Sect's Grand Elder!" Yang Kai straightened his expression, pointed at Ghost Ancestor, and announced loudly.

"Grand Elder?" The crowd murmured, astonished, studying Ghost Ancestor with uncertain eyes.

Even someone as powerful as Ye Xijun had only held the rank of Great Elder in the Sect. Lingxiao Sect had not been established long and had no Grand Elder position; suddenly having one now made everyone feel a bit curious.

After the curiosity came speculation about Ghost Ancestor's true realm.

If he was to be Grand Elder, a position second to none, he must possess convincing strength—surely stronger than a Great Elder, who was the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Could this old man be...

Void King Realm? A collective astonishment rose in everyone's hearts.

"The Grand Elder has the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. Across the Star Domain he is counted among prominent experts; his joining is the Sect's good fortune," Yang Kai declared. As soon as he spoke, the plaza fell so quiet one could hear a pin drop; every face was filled with shock as they stared at Ghost Ancestor, many showing signs of fanatic worship.

It truly was the case: a Void King Realm expert, and a Second Stage of the Void King Realm at that!

Dark Star was no longer a closed cultivation star; the information Qian Tong and the others had brought back from the outside had already spread throughout the star, and the disciples naturally understood what the Second Stage of the Void King Realm signified.

It represented strength that could stand at the pinnacle of the Star Domain's power—aside from a handful of reclusive immortals, the Second Stage of the Void King Realm was the highest most could hope to reach in the Star Domain.

That the Sect could attract such a mighty figure to join was astonishing.

For a time the disciples felt as if in a dream, unable to believe their ears.

"Heh heh, Sect Master is too courteous; joining Lingxiao Sect is my honor," Ghost Ancestor chuckled with satisfaction. He did not show arrogance; he slowly released the aura of a Second Stage of the Void King Realm so the disciples could feel his might, then smiled and said, "Since I serve as Grand Elder of this Sect, I vow to advance and retreat with the Sect to my death. While I live, the Sect will endure; whoever wishes to deal with the Sect, first ask whether I consent. However… one man’s strength is limited. I alone cannot support the heavens.. The Sect’s future prosperity will depend on everyone’s effort!”
