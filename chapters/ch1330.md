## Chapter 1330 — Settle Accounts

“You dare kill a Xie Family disciple?!” Xie Quan’s face darkened with fury when he saw that the burly man had truly been killed.

“If I kill, then I kill—what are you going to do about it!” Yang Kai’s expression twisted into a snarl, Demonic Flame wrapping his body like an ancient slaughtering god descending, a cold light flashing in his eyes.

As he spoke, a pulse of Saint Yuan shot into the Void King-Grade forging furnace floating in midair; the furnace whirled around, and from its spinning belly odd little tongues of flame burst forth, taking the shapes of Fire Birds that swarmed out in a sky-darkening torrent.

Those Fire Birds were like shrunk-down Artifact Spirits, indistinguishable in appearance, yet neither in size nor might could they compare to true Artifact Spirits. This was the fire-type Spiritual Qi stored within the Void King-Grade forging furnace—this furnace had been baked in the Earth Lung Fire Vein for tens of thousands of years and was no mere mortal thing. Yang Kai used to only need to release an Artifact Spirit against foes, but facing so many Origin Returning Realm cultivators this time he dared not be careless, and even tapped into the furnace’s might.

The Artifact Spirit fire-birds unfurled twin wings at once; countless fireballs formed leisurely and plummeted down like a plague of locusts.

With the two sides cooperating, the faces of many Origin Returning Realm cultivators paled as they scrambled to evade.

Tianyun City, already consumed by blazing infernos, suffered even worse; within a hundred zhang all shops and houses were burned to cinders, the ground charred and desolate, and a dozen-some martial artists who failed to escape were slain on the spot.

A cascade of Shi descended from the heavens, and Xie Quan’s face turned savage as he snarled, “Kid, those two old men fled—let’s see how a Saint King Realm escapes now!”

Dozens of layers of Shi stacked and overlapped, each piling onto the next until Yang Kai felt as if every step forward would be agonious. Two golden threads leapt to action, madly slicing through those invisible forces, greatly reducing their potency. Yang Kai took another step—after that stride his figure blurred; every Origin Returning Realm cultivator present could no longer make out where he had gone.

Yang Kai even used spatial power; though he did not tear the space outright, that step had already broken free of spatial constraints.

When his figure reappeared, he was already behind Xie Quan.

“Brother Xie, be careful!” Yang Kai’s sudden appearance made the goat‑bearded elder cry out in alarm.

Xie Quan’s face also went pale; a white mist suddenly spread through his body, wrapping him so his form could not be seen. Yang Kai snorted coldly and shot a golden thread that wrapped toward the white mist.

There came a faint popping sound. Accompanied by Xie Quan’s scream, the white mist that cloaked him condensed and then burst apart, revealing his hidden form once more.

But when everyone saw what lay before them, they were struck dumb.

Xie Quan stood there ashen-faced, staring blankly at a golden thread jutting through his chest and belly, shock and dread written across his face; he did not dare move.

The other end of the golden thread, however, was wrapped around Yang Kai’s fingertip.

He had been subdued so effortlessly by Yang Kai! Not even Xie Quan himself had expected it. He only knew the golden thread was fiendishly strange and razor sharp—his protective Saint Yuan could not hold back its intrusion, or else the thread would not have pierced him and allowed someone to so easily take him down.

A shrill bird cry sounded again as the ten‑zhang-long Artifact Spirit Fire Bird circled above Yang Kai; its keen eyes spun like wheels. Any Origin Returning Realm cultivator it fixed upon went deathly pale—though their earlier skirmish with this Artifact Spirit had been brief, everyone could see its terror: in single combat none could match it, and even united they could hardly subdue it. The strength of this Artifact Spirit approached, if not equaled, the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

“You dare move and you die!” Yang Kai’s voice was like a cold wind blowing out of the Nine Nether Purgatory, brushing Xie Quan’s ear and sending a chill into his heart.

Seeing Xie Quan obediently stand frozen, a trace of satisfaction flashed across Yang Kai’s face. He looked up at the other Origin Returning Realm cultivators and said coldly, “I told you I came for two things today. The first is done—now for the second.”

“What do you want?” Xie Quan said bitterly.

“Return to me all the Saint Crystals Dragon Lair Mountain paid before and those you seized!” Yang Kai snorted.

“Your Saint Crystals are in my Spatial Ring—take them if you want.” Xie Quan gritted his teeth; under pressure he had no choice but to bow his head.

Yang Kai glanced at his finger; another golden thread flew out, twined once around Xie Quan’s finger, and in the next moment the finger and ring flew back into Yang Kai’s hand.

Blood spurted. Xie Quan’s face went white as he gritted his teeth against the searing pain but still dared not make a move.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept the ring briefly; a sneer crossed his face as he coldly said, “Isn’t this quantity a bit light?”

Light? It was nearly half missing. The materials Dragon Lair Mountain ordered from Yingyue Hall were worth twenty million Saint Crystals, yet the ring held only ten million—where had the rest gone?

Xie Quan fell silent and cast his gaze toward the goat‑bearded elder Ma Xinyuan. Yang Kai immediately understood—they had split the Saint Crystals brought by Yu Feng; the missing half was likely on the goat‑bearded elder. His eyes turned cold as he stared at Ma Xinyuan.

The latter hesitated, unwilling and resentful—the sum was a hard thing to give up; it was ten million Saint Crystals! If not for that amount, the people of Yingyue Hall wouldn’t have helped the Xie Family to deal with Yang Kai—the hall’s internal struggles were intense and there weren’t many who could be spared.

Seeing he seemed reluctant to return the Saint Crystals, Yang Kai’s face grew grim. Another golden thread shot out and wrapped around Xie Quan’s shoulder.

Blood sprayed; Xie Quan’s arm fell to the ground. Everyone’s faces went pale in shock—none would have expected this kid to be so ruthless, striking such a grievous blow without a word.

Yet Xie Quan still showed grit: after having a finger cut off earlier without protest, now losing an arm he still did not cry out, only staring at Ma Xinyuan with a feral look, his dry lips moving as he rasped, “Brother Ma, you won’t stand by and watch him tear me apart, will you?”

Hearing that, Ma Xinyuan knew he could not keep that ten million Saint Crystals. After all, the Xie Family still had Xie Li in Yingyue Hall, who ranked higher than him—if Xie Quan were killed by Yang Kai, Xie Li would surely come after him.

He bit his teeth, took off his Spatial Ring, retrieved his possessions, and tossed the ring to Yang Kai. He spat bitterly, “Kid, the rest of the Saint Crystals are here—take the goods and release him, or don’t blame us for fighting to the death!”

They had expected an easy win this time but hadn’t foreseen an Artifact Spirit would ruin their plan, nor that this peculiar Yang Kai would so mysteriously subdue Xie Quan with such ease.

As they cursed Xie Quan’s carelessness in their hearts, they also grew wary of Yang Kai.

If he could so stealthily take Xie Quan, perhaps he could also kill men like them—Ma Xinyuan had to admit his strength was not that much greater than Xie Quan’s.

Could this really be a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm? Ma Xinyuan doubted whether Yang Kai had concealed his true cultivation, for the man appeared at ease and might still have more tricks.

Taking the ring Ma Xinyuan had thrown, Yang Kai inspected it and, satisfied it was truthful, nodded coldly. After pocketing both rings he ignored Ma Xinyuan’s threats and said lightly, “I’ve recovered my Saint Crystals—now let’s settle another account.”

“What do you want now?” Ma Xinyuan’s face turned dark.

“Don’t play the fool, old man!” Yang Kai chuckled low. “You detained Dragon Lair Mountain’s disciples and even beat and lashed them—do you think I’ll let that slide? Do you think I’m so soft‑hearted?”

Ma Xinyuan’s face darkened with fury as he bellowed, “So that’s how it is, huh? Then what about you, brat—you destroyed so many shops and businesses in Tianyun City and killed more than a dozen of our disciples! Shouldn’t we settle that score with you as well?”

“That’s your own doing. Dragon Lair Mountain has dealt honestly with your hall these past two years and never defaulted on Saint Crystals, yet you broke your word. Even if this were exposed to all heaven and earth, no one would side with you!”

“What will it take for you to be satisfied?!” Ma Xinyuan’s face sank like water.

“Compensation.” Yang Kai’s words were terse as he snorted, “If you won’t compensate, then we’ll see whether you can bear the consequences!”

“You’re threatening me!” Ma Xinyuan’s face twisted.

“Yes!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him. “I’ll count to three—if you don’t agree, I act. One—”

Seeing Yang Kai so aggressive and actually beginning to count, the Origin Returning Realm cultivators’ expressions chilled; anger and helplessness warred in their hearts. They were all only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—having so many of them they’d thought they could crush Dragon Lair Mountain, but events were beyond their control.

“Two—”

At that number Xie Quan cried out in alarm, “Brother Ma—”

Ma Xinyuan looked at him from afar, his expression flickering as he said, “Brother Xie, your men captured them and your men injured them—this has little to do with Yingyue Hall, right?”

Xie Quan’s face froze; a wave of sorrow rose within him. He knew Ma Xinyuan spoke true—this affair had been chiefly the Xie Family’s doing—but Ma Xinyuan’s words cut deep; after all, the Xie Family’s move had been directed by Yingyue Hall’s upper echelons to test Qian Tong’s reaction. Ma Xinyuan should not have been so detached.

“Three!” Yang Kai finished counting and grinned savagely. “Looks like you really won’t compensate—since that’s the case, I’ll settle it myself!”

As he spoke, the golden threads in his hand trembled; amidst a flash of golden light the restrained Xie Quan fell silent and became a heap of shredded flesh.

The stench of blood spread; every Origin Returning Realm cultivator stood agape, their expressions utterly horrified.
