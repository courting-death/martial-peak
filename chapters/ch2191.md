## Chapter 2191 — Success

At this moment, even with Liu Yan's help, whether this batch of Supreme Mystic Pills would succeed was still uncertain.

However, if he truly succeeded in refining them, it would surely bring a tremendous improvement to his Alchemy Dao.

After working for a long while, Yang Kai finally let out a gentle breath.

At present, all the medicinal ingredients had been placed into the cauldron. All that remained was for him to control the heat and manipulate the spirit array. Once the time was right, he could condense the pills.

Only then did he have a chance to speak; his voice was deep: "I advise all of you not to have any ideas about that root!"

Although he had been refining pills just now, he had not stopped observing his surroundings.

He could clearly see that quite a few people were eyeing that root with interest, but since they were unsure whether they truly needed it, none dared to act rashly.

"Oh? And why is that?" Zhuang Bufan asked in confusion upon hearing this.

Yang Kai's expression was solemn as he said, "That root is the very origin of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. If it is left behind, perhaps within a hundred years, another Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus will appear in this Star Realm for a fated person to obtain. But if it is taken... then for ten thousand years, there will be no such spiritual medicine in this world. Who knows when it will appear again."

"Is that so?" Lan Xun's eyes sparkled with surprise. With all her knowledge and experience, she had never heard such a rumor.

"Just trust me!" Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

"It's none of my business!" Wuchang suddenly shouted, "What happens ten thousand years from now is for those in ten thousand years to worry about. Since you no longer need this root, I'll take it!"

"Don't you dare!" Yang Kai snapped, turning to glare angrily at Wuchang. He suddenly reached out and placed his hand above the Ink Jade Cauldron.

At his movement, all the martial artists' faces changed dramatically; they watched him nervously, unsure what he intended to do.

"If you dare touch it, I'll destroy this entire batch of spiritual pills right now!" Yang Kai shouted coldly, his expression utterly calm.

"Hey, hey..." Xia Sheng's mouth twitched uncontrollably as he looked at Yang Kai in surprise. "Brother Yang, is this really necessary? It's just a root. If Brother Wuchang wants it, let him take it. There's no need to threaten him with the Supreme Mystic Pills."

He really didn't know what had gotten into Yang Kai, to the point of threatening Wuchang over such a thing with the Supreme Mystic Pills.

He had to realize that this move threatened not only Wuchang, but everyone present who was waiting.

If he wasn't careful, he would incur the wrath of the crowd.

Yang Kai ignored them and said, "If anyone comes within three zhang of that root, I'll destroy the medicinal liquid immediately. I'm not joking!"

At these words, Wuchang truly didn't dare to move again.

Although the root looked extraordinary, it was certainly not as valuable as the Supreme Mystic Pills. If angering Yang Kai over it, the loss would outweigh the gain.

"Wuchang, calm down!" Xiao Chen was startled and quickly called out to Wuchang.

Wuchang froze in place, his gaze cold as he stared at Yang Kai, enunciating each word: "You... dare threaten me!"

"It's not a threat..." A strange look flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he said slowly, "I just want to leave a bit of hope for those who come after."

Off to the side, Lan Xun pursed her lips and smiled. "I've heard that most alchemists, when harvesting rare spiritual medicines, never wipe them out completely. They always leave a sliver of life for the medicine if possible, and never pick those that aren't mature... I used to doubt this, but now it seems it's true."

Yang Kai said, "The predecessors plant the tree, and the later generations enjoy the shade. The reason we can encounter this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus today may well be because a master left the root behind a hundred years ago. Since others left us hope, we can't be too ruthless, or it would go against the cycle of the Heavenly Dao."

At these words, Lan Xun's beautiful eyes lit up, and she seemed lost in thought.

"Besides..." Yang Kai continued, "this root doesn't possess the miraculous effects of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. At most, it can slightly temper Origin Qi and Divine Sense. All the true essence of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is now in the cauldron. Brother Wuchang, are you sure you want the root and not the Supreme Mystic Pills?"

Wuchang's face was ashen. In truth, after hearing Yang Kai say the root was of little use, he no longer wanted to pick it. But with so many eyes on him, he couldn't back down and could only stand there with a fierce look on his face.

Just as they were speaking, the root suddenly trembled, transformed into a burst of multicolored light, and disappeared from everyone's sight, as if it had never existed.

"This..." Xiao Chen was dumbfounded at the sight.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, "Well, now that the root is gone, let's see who can find it again." Pausing for a moment, he added, "By the way, if you pick the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus before it matures, this is what will happen."

At these words, many people broke out in a cold sweat, secretly relieved that someone knowledgeable was present. Otherwise, if they had picked it before it matured, it would have all been for nothing.

Turning his head, Yang Kai continued to focus on controlling the heat and inscribing the spirit array.

Wuchang stood awkwardly in place for a while, snorted coldly, and a trace of fierceness appeared on his face. Who knew what he was thinking.

Gurgle, gurgle—the sounds from within the Ink Jade Cauldron never ceased.

As time passed, more and more people grew restless. As their gazes drifted and met, a strange and complex atmosphere gradually spread atop the mountain peak.

It seemed everyone was waiting for the moment the Supreme Mystic Pills would be completed. When that happened, the scene would spiral out of control.

Yang Kai was well aware of this, but he remained calm and focused all his efforts on refining the pills.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai's expression grew solemn. All the Origin Qi within his body surged forth like a tide, pouring unreservedly into the Ink Jade Cauldron. At the same time, he rose to his feet, his hands moving swiftly as he formed a series of intricate seals. Strands of energy, visible to the naked eye, condensed into clear talismanic marks, each one streaming into the Ink Jade Cauldron and vanishing from sight.

"He's gathering the pills!" someone whispered, and the atmosphere instantly grew tense. The sound of heavy breathing all around revealed everyone's excitement and anticipation.

This was the final step of alchemy. If handled well, this batch of spiritual pills would be a success. If not, all previous efforts would be wasted.

Yang Kai's hands danced like butterflies, his expression solemn. Large beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, and he looked as if he had just been fished out of water—his clothes were soaked, and his face was slightly pale, clearly exhausted.

Even so, his movements remained orderly and extremely steady.

"This pill-gathering technique... is truly marvelous!" Lan Xun's eyes sparkled as she stared intently at Yang Kai's actions.

Although it was her first time seeing the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Technique, it didn't stop her from sensing something unique from this pill-gathering method. Every movement and every talismanic mark contained mysteries, in harmony with the Heavenly Dao, making her dizzy with wonder.

As Yang Kai moved, a faint aura of the Heavenly Dao spread out, making everyone feel heavy.

The Nine Heavens Profound Pill Technique, after all, was a method infused into Yang Kai's mind by the Great Dao Pill Tone. It was born of heaven and earth, containing ultimate truths. It was only natural that Lan Xun found it so profound.

Even with her First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, Lan Xun could see this. Naturally, the many Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artists present could as well.

For some reason, as Yang Kai performed the pill-gathering technique, many martial artists unconsciously became immersed in its profundity. The earlier tension and anticipation faded away without them noticing.

Suddenly, Yang Kai roared, "Condense!"

It was as if he had used up all his strength. As he spoke, he brought his hands together, his body swaying slightly.

At the same time, a series of crisp chimes rang out from within the cauldron.

Simultaneously, rays of rosy light burst forth from the Ink Jade Cauldron.

The pills were complete!

In that instant, everyone realized—the Supreme Mystic Pills had been refined!

In that instant, everyone activated their Origin Qi, rushing toward Yang Kai to snatch the peerless spiritual pills that could lead straight to the Emperor Realm.

At that very moment, heaven and earth buzzed. A muffled thunderclap suddenly sounded above everyone's heads.

An astonishing pressure, as if from the heavens, descended, making it hard to breathe and freezing everyone in place.

Looking up, they saw that at some point, dark clouds had gathered overhead. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, the vast Heavenly Might making everyone feel insignificant.

"Pill tribulation!" Lan Xun cried out in alarm, panic flashing in her beautiful eyes for the first time.

"So it really came!" Yang Kai shouted.

Before the Supreme Mystic Pills were completed, he had already suspected that this batch would draw a pill tribulation.

The effects of the Supreme Mystic Pills were simply too heaven-defying, and naturally, the laws of heaven and earth would not tolerate them. Once they appeared, the omnipresent laws would try to destroy them!

Judging by the ferocity of this pill tribulation, it was likely even more intense than when a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artist advanced to the Emperor Realm. How could a few spiritual pills withstand it? With a single strike, they would be reduced to ashes. Even with his full protection, whether he could block the tribulation was uncertain.

At that point, all their efforts and hopes would turn to nothing.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai slapped the cauldron and moved his Divine Sense.

In the next instant, Liu Yan turned into a streak of fire, shooting out from the Ink Jade Cauldron and was immediately taken into the Small Xuan Realm by Yang Kai.

While no one was paying attention, Liu Yan had already swept all the Supreme Mystic Pills from the cauldron.

At this moment, everyone's minds were focused on the pill tribulation. Who would notice Liu Yan's actions? Even if they saw Yang Kai's artifact spirit return, they would never guess she had taken all the Supreme Mystic Pills.

Soon, something happened that left everyone astonished.

The pill tribulation that had been gathering in the sky began to dissipate for some unknown reason. The rolling dark clouds scattered, and the terrifying lightning and thunder gradually faded away.

In less than ten breaths, everything returned to normal, leaving only a group of martial artists with lingering fear, looking at each other in dismay.
