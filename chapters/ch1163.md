## Chapter 1163 — Everyone's Gone Mad

Jubao Tower holds an auction every two to three years, but rarely has any auction been as fiercely contested as today's.

The martial artists watching in the hall gaped with mouths agape, unable to close them for a long time; the numbers shouted from the private rooms made them feel as if in a dream, unbelieving.

If not for happening to attend this auction, they would never have known that these great forces possessed such astonishing depth of foundation.

After sixty million, many of the big shots in the private rooms sighed and withdrew from the competition.

That sum was a watershed, enough to make eighty percent of the forces on Dark Star look on in despair.

In the Liuli Gate room, Yin Sudie's face was full of shock; when others had bid up to fifty million, Liuli Gate had already given up in advance. The middle-aged woman sitting beside Yin Sudie sighed heavily and forced a wry smile: "Just enjoy the show."

“Second Matron, have these people gone mad? No matter how valuable an Origin Condensing Pill with Pill Patterns is, it can’t possibly be worth this much! Why are they all so crazed?” Yin Sudie turned to the middle-aged woman beside her and asked.

It wasn't only Yin Sudie asking; the young elites in the private rooms all asked the same question. None of them understood why their elders were spending so much to bid for a single Origin Condensing Pill.

An Origin Condensing Pill can only raise a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm martial artist's chance to breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm; it's not a Void Ascension Pill. If it were a Void Ascension Pill that could help a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner breakthrough to the Void King Realm, then these prices would make sense. But this is plainly just an Origin Condensing Pill!

Fang Tianzhong, Qu Changfeng, Wei Guchang, and Xuan'er all looked to their elders, hoping for an explanation.

In the Yingyue Hall room, after Qian Tong called out sixty-five million, he took a moment and said: "Do you think everyone's bidding for just an Origin Condensing Pill? You are mistaken. This Origin Condensing Pill bears Pill Patterns; it can absolutely enable a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm practitioner to successfully breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm. If its true value ended there, it wouldn't be so expensive—at most two or three million Saint Crystals. Its real worth is the rumor that it can unlock a martial artist's full potential. Think about it: if such an effect truly exists, then after consuming this Origin Condensing Pill, that cultivator's future training would go smoothly. Perhaps after reaching the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm they could break Dark Star's shackles and ascend to the Void King Realm!"

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were both shaken; the former exclaimed in horror: "Elder, you mean to say they're not bidding for a pill that makes Origin Returning Realm experts, but for a chance to become a Void King Realm expert?"

"Exactly!" Qian Tong nodded solemnly. "You younger generation don't understand the pill's true value, which is not your fault. But our older generation has studied the Void King Realm for hundreds, even thousands of years; earlier predecessors spent even more time seeking paths to the Void King Realm. Taking an Origin Condensing Pill with Pill Patterns is one possible method. Whether it truly works, no one knows. Yet even if it's merely a sliver of hope, we must fight for it!"

There are no Void King Realm practitioners on Dark Star; if one appears, that Void King Realm cultivator could dominate the entire Dark Star! For that possibility, what are tens of millions of Saint Crystals? If you can dominate Dark Star, those Saint Crystals can be retrieved at any time.

"Disciple understands," Wei Guchang bowed slightly.

Qian Tong glanced at him and smiled. “The Origin Condensing Pill can only be taken by cultivators at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Everyone bidding right now is doing so to prepare for their sect’s younger disciples. In our Yingyue Hall, only you and Xuan’er qualify to take it. But your aptitude surpasses hers, so if we manage to win it, that pill will be yours — you needn’t worry about that.”

Wei Guchang grinned. “This disciple doesn’t think that way. Whether I take it or Xuan’er takes it, it’s all the same.”

He was sincere, without any pretense. He exchanged a glance with Xuan'er and they smiled at each other—everything was understood without words.

Qian Tong nodded with satisfaction; he had faith in these two disciples. He believed that even if the pill were won, they would yield to one another and never fall out as senior and junior fellow disciples over a single pill.

Only... whether they could actually win the bid was something Qian Tong doubted.

Only five houses remained in the bidding: Star Emperor Sect, Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, Sea Hall, and Yingyue Hall; the other forces had all lost qualification.

If Qian Tong hadn't collected so many passage fees earlier, Yingyue Hall would have already quit. Even so, he wasn't confident. The Origin Condensing Pill's price had reached sixty-eight million, and he only had, at most, eighty million Saint Crystals available—soon approaching the limit he could bear.

Qian Tong frowned with worry and cast a look at Luo Qing, standing beside him, wanting to beat the bastard again.

Feeling the elder's ill intentful gaze, Luo Qing couldn't help but shrink his neck; he had no idea what he'd done to offend the elder—today the elder seemed particularly displeased with him.

"Seventy million!" A deep bidding voice came from the Battle Sky Alliance room—some big shot of the Battle Sky Alliance; someone of Qu Changfeng's generation had no right to call such bids.

"Seventy-five million!" The Battle Sky Alliance's bid was immediately countered; room A-1 matched decisively, with no hesitation.

In room C-13, Yang Kai was secretly moved; even though he'd prepared mentally, such prices still made his heart tremble.

Like Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, he couldn't understand why these people were so frenzied—nearly irrational. He thought Jubao Tower would sell the final lot, the Origin Condensing Pill, for more than the Dragon-Slaying Whip, but this was absurdly exorbitant.

He had once again misjudged the value of what he'd brought.

Given the situation, Yang Kai believed the fault wasn't his; there must be things he didn't understand.

How could he have known that martial artists on Dark Star, in pursuit of the Void King Realm, would conceive of using Origin Condensing Pills bearing Pill Patterns to develop a cultivator's potential?

He privately rejoiced that he hadn't formed Pill Patterns on both of the Origin Condensing Pills—when preparing for the auction he had deliberately made one ordinary Origin Condensing Pill and one with Pill Patterns.

His original intention was merely to pocket some Saint Crystals so Yang Yan could buy material for forming formations, yet he had netted a staggering fortune.

"Yang Kai, you better not tell us that this Origin Condensing Pill is yours." Wu Yi bit her red lip and glanced at Yang Kai, asking softly.

"Heh..." Yang Kai forced a dry laugh, unsure what to say.

Wu Yi and Yang Yan both covered their small mouths, their eyes full of joy and shock; compared with the price of this Origin Condensing Pill, the more than ten million Saint Crystals they'd previously obtained was nothing.

The auction continued; a rare flush appeared on Yan Pei's stern face as he stood on the dais, smiling affably.

Only five factions were still bidding, each going all out. When the price reached eighty million, Sea Hall and Yingyue Hall had to withdraw one after another, with deep sighs emanating from their rooms.

Such prices had surpassed what they could bear.

With those two forces gone, only Star Emperor Sect, Battle Sky Alliance, and Leitai Sect remained to contest, and almost all eyes focused on those three rooms.

Their bids were no longer as high as before; the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect even deliberated for quite a while before calling the next price.

room A-1, belonging to Star Emperor Sect, continued to raise the price decisively, displaying their boldness and ample wealth.

Yang Kai had long noticed that room; from start to finish they seemed to have only bought Origin-Grade secret treasures and pills.

After asking Wu Yi, he learned that the room belonged to Star Emperor Sect.

Moreover, according to Wu Yi, although the Star Emperor Sect was one of the top powers on Dark Star, its members rarely showed themselves in public. It was said that there weren’t many people in the entire sect — most of them remained in seclusion, cultivating atop Star Emperor Mountain.

The name derived from their founder having received some inheritance from a Star Emperor, and they all styled themselves disciples of the Star Emperor.

Generally they did not pick fights with other forces; they were comparatively peaceful.

But no one dared underestimate them, for rumors said they had many top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

After another incense stick's time, the Origin Condensing Pill's price climbed to ninety million, offered by Leitai Sect.

"One hundred million!" room A-1 immediately raised the price by ten million, showing enormous resolve and courage.

In Leitai Sect's room, the bidder gave a bitter smile, knowing that even if he raised the price further, Star Emperor Sect would snatch it. He could only announce: "Leitai Sect withdraws from the competition!"

No sooner had he spoken than the Battle Sky Alliance also announced their withdrawal.

Spending one hundred million Saint Crystals for a hope to ascend to the Void King Realm, and with no guarantee of success—if it did work it would at least take centuries. Who knew what might occur in those centuries? Perhaps other paths would be discovered.

After weighing the options, Leitai Sect and Battle Sky Alliance naturally ceased bidding.

Yan Pei knew no one was richer than Star Emperor Sect; he stepped forward and called out three times, and the auction concluded with Star Emperor Sect's final victory.

From the various private rooms came successive voices congratulating the Star Emperor Sect on winning the final auction item, while Jubao Tower’s staff went to their room to handle the exchange of payment and goods.

Yan Pei stood on the dais and announced the auction's perfect end, thanking the great forces for attending, which earned applause and polite exchanges.

People in the auction hall rose and left in turn; the experts in the private rooms also departed.

Yang Kai and his two companions remained. Qian Tong had said not to leave immediately after the auction because he had more to say; Yang Kai also wanted to speak with Qian Tong, so they stayed.
