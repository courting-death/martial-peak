## Chapter 1668 — Return to the Dark Star

In the depths of the Star Domain, a pitch-black Void King-Grade warship sailed onward, moving swiftly toward a certain direction entirely on its own, without the need for anyone to steer it.

Inside the warship, only a few martial artists kept watch over the surroundings.

Yang Kai was not among them; he had entered the Xuan Realm Pearl.

This was a journey home.

Dark Star had become the new home for the people from Tongxuan Continent.

It had been one year since they left Chi Lan Star, and for that year the warship had followed the Star Chart Yang Kai had drawn, voyaging safely and steadily.

Occasionally minor troubles arose, but after volleys from the Crystal Cannons the road ahead cleared and nothing impeded their passage.

Few could dare provoke a Void King-Grade Warship—its might was simply overwhelming.

Within the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang continuously refined Spiritual Pills, expending vast wealth and material to raise the cultivation of those from Tongxuan Continent.

The combined strength of humans, yao, and demons had risen dramatically; Saint-Grade martial artists were everywhere, and the former top experts of the three races had reached the Second or Third Stage of the Saint King Realm—their power had not merely increased a little.

It was a case of slow accumulation yielding sudden growth. The circumstances on Tongxuan Continent and Dark Star differed: the former suffered from a lack of Spiritual Qi which capped advancement, while the latter was held back by suppression of the laws.

Now, within the Small Xuan Realm, Spiritual Qi was rich and plentiful and cultivation supplies were abundant; the cultivators from Tongxuan Continent naturally achieved excellent development and rapid improvement.

With people like Yang Xiuzhu explaining cultivation secrets, it would be strange if they did not progress quickly.

Each day the atmosphere inside the Xuan Realm Pearl was jubilant; every day someone broke through their shackles and rose to the next Stage.

Yang Kai granted special treatment to those of his closest kin.

Everyone had selfish desires—Yang Kai was no exception.

His parents, his Grandmaster, the Patriarch, and those few Senior Aunts and Uncles, as well as Di Mo and others—all were personally attended to by Yang Kai. He refined Heaven-Defying Spiritual Pills for them, altered their bodies, opened their meridians, and thoroughly enhanced their potential and talents.

In a palace, at a second-floor window, a graceful figure stood at the ledge; a breeze stirred her hair as she gazed vacantly at the distant plaza, her eyes fixed on a tall, heroic youth with gentleness, a trace of wistfulness lingering in her gaze.

"Sister Qiu." A voice called from behind; Qiu Yimeng drew back her eyes and turned to see a pair of twin sisters approaching together—Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er.

"You've come?" Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly and gathered herself. "Sit."

Hu Jiao'er glanced at her thoughtfully, then at the plaza outside; spotting the tireless figure there, she sighed: "It seems the gap only grows. I wonder if in this life I can ever catch up to his pace."

"Yes, the more we cultivate, the farther he seems," Hu Mei'er said, her expression dimming.

Qiu Yimeng pursed her lips and smiled. "Little Sisters, why lose heart? Your peerless technique already leaves me behind in many ways—you both have reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, while I have only just entered the Saint King Realm."

"That may be, but I heard he has already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm," Hu Mei'er worried. "Only Su Yan and Xia Ningshang can accompany him now. I don't know how they cultivated—each of them has attained the Origin Returning Realm. A few days ago Xia Ningshang even broke through to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. It's maddening to think about."

"They have their own opportunities. We merely need to work hard ourselves. Don't aim to catch his pace—just don't let him pull too far ahead," Qiu Yimeng counseled.

"Sister Qiu truly has a steadfast heart," Hu Jiao'er said, moved, looking at Qiu Yimeng with admiration.

Qiu Yimeng smiled. "Since we chose to follow him off Tongxuan Continent, we should have resolve; if we were to despair, we might as well stay and be rulers on Tongxuan Continent. What do you say, little sisters?"

Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er exchanged a glance and both nodded solemnly.

"Enough idle talk. Come with me; I've arranged to meet other talented youths from the yao and demon races—this time the younger generation of our three races will have a proper contest. Only through competition does one grow." Qiu Yimeng rose and beckoned them.

Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er hurried to follow.

……

Life within the Xuan Realm Pearl passed without incident; time flashed, and another year slid by.

One day, Yang Kai was dual-cultivating with Su Yan, their palms pressed together as Saint Yuan flowed between them without restraint.

Suddenly he seemed to sense something and opened his eyes.

"What is it?" Su Yan opened her eyes too and asked with suspicion.

"It seems we have arrived." Yang Kai grinned.

"At last?" Su Yan brightened. "This stretch has been long indeed."

"Yes. Dark Star is very remote. Without a Void King-Grade Warship we could not have left. Come, let's go see."

"Good—call Ningshang as well."

After informing Xia Ningshang, the three instantly appeared aboard the warship.

Immediately a disciple of Lingxiao Sect stepped forward to report, "Sect Master, Dark Star is ahead—we have finally reached home."

His face was exuberant.

Unlike those from Tongxuan Continent, he was a disciple of the Haike Family and was born on Dark Star; having accompanied Yang Kai for at least seven or eight years, he naturally longed for his homeland.

"Please, Sect Master, instruct us!" the Lingxiao Sect disciple asked respectfully.

"Disembark."

"Yes!"

In the next moment the warship plunged toward the vast Cultivation Star; in no more than a quarter of an hour it pierced the atmosphere and the enchanting landscape below came into view.

Yang Kai did not allow the warship to continue its voyage; he left it with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, sealed the ship inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, and descended in a Star Shuttle.

The Void King-Grade Warship was too conspicuous—unless absolutely necessary Yang Kai did not want it exposed to the eyes of the world.

Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, newly arrived, inhaled the rich Spiritual Qi of the place with delight, their faces full of surprise as they drew exaggerated breaths.

"Junior Brother, what city is that below? It's immense," Xia Ningshang pointed and asked.

"Er… I'm not sure either." Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly. Though he had spent much time on Dark Star, the place was vast and he could not recognize every city.

Xia Ningshang smiled and ceased pressing him.

"Ah…" Yang Kai's expression shifted; he studied the outline of the city below and then laughed heartily. "I know this place."

"What place?"

"Tianyun City!" Yang Kai pointed down. "Look over there—do you see that mountain range? When I first came to Dark Star I made my start in Dragon Lair Mountain; later it was besieged and after a great battle the mountain was ruined, so we relocated to the Lingxiao Sect."

Following his gesture, Su Yan and Xia Ningshang indeed saw a broken, desolate little range.

Perhaps because Yang Kai had once stayed there, both of the women regarded the mountain with affection.

"What a coincidence," Su Yan said with some feeling.

Yang Kai had first set foot on Dark Star there, and this return found him inadvertently arriving at the same place—history had overlapped in a striking way.

"Truly fate. Come on, let's go down— I know Tianyun City's city lord and can borrow their Space Array." Yang Kai waved his hand and prepared to descend.

The city lord of Tianyun City was Fei Zhi Tu; had he not fallen in cultivation due to injuries last time, he might have left Dark Star with Yang Kai like Qian Tong.

So many years had passed; Yang Kai did not know whether Fei Zhi Tu's cultivation had recovered.

When Yang Kai had been weak, Fei Zhi Tu had treated him well, and Yang Kai remained grateful.

At that moment a violent burst of energy fluctuations erupted from somewhere below.

"Junior Brother, someone's fighting," Su Yan perceived and pointed out the direction to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai turned to look and his expression froze in astonishment and puzzlement.

"How could it be them?"

Though separated by hundreds of li, with Yang Kai's current Divine Sense he could instantly discern the identity of one of the combatants.

It was none other than Yingyue Hall's elite disciples Wei Guchang and Xuan'er.

These two were rising stars of Yingyue Hall and famed young talents across Dark Star. Years later, their cultivations seemed to have advanced further; together they could unleash terrifying might far surpassing the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

But those fighting them were even stronger: more than ten Origin Returning Realm experts, even with some at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, formed a siege around Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, leaving them no chance to escape.

How could it be them? Yang Kai could not fathom it.

This was near Tianyun City, within Yingyue Hall's sphere of influence; Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were the hall's future pillars—Wei Guchang was a disciple of the former Hall Master and Xuan'er was Qian Tong's disciple, their status was extraordinary.

Who would dare attack them within Yingyue Hall's territory?

Yang Kai instinctively felt something was amiss, as if something major had occurred on Dark Star during the years of his absence.

"Do you know them?" Su Yan asked.

"Yes—let's go see." Yang Kai's face darkened as he led Su Yan and Xia Ningshang swiftly toward the scene.

Several hundred li away, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er fought desperately, their opponents five Origin Returning Realm experts.

Even though Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were capable, being outnumbered left them strained; they had apparently endured many recent battles, weakening their Saint Yuan and making their breaths a little feeble.

If not for the moonlike Secret Treasure suspended above Wei Guchang's head, those enemies would long since have rushed forward and slain them.

That moonlike Secret Treasure, driven by Wei Guchang through secret arts, emanated a soft radiance that manifested in myriad forms—both offensive and defensive—and at each critical moment it had saved the lives of Wei Guchang and Xuan'er.
