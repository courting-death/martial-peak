## Chapter 1001 — Brother, It's Really Good to See You

The floating continent, inexplicably suspended in midair, was bizarre; its mountains were clear, its waters beautiful, and the scenery exquisite, with Spiritual Qi so abundant it pressed upon the senses.

A dense haze cloaked the sky above the entire continent—Spiritual Qi condensed into mist once it reached a certain saturation.

Clear springs gushed from a nearby peak; the water was sweet and crystalline, immensely nourishing. It seemed not ordinary water but a kind of spiritual liquid.

About a hundred or so martial artists from the Purple Star and the Sword Alliance had been stranded here. After a great battle, the two sides each sought a place and sat to recover.

They soon discovered, to their surprise, that their recovery proceeded several times faster than usual—this place's Spiritual Qi was simply too abundant. Each one felt inexplicably elated, thinking that surviving such a calamity must bode well, and they absorbed the surrounding Spiritual Qi with vigor.

Only the seven-colored, uncanny sky made their hearts tremble with unease.

The heavens swirled with seven-colored vapors; no sun, moon, or stars could be seen. It was completely different from the places these warriors had previously lived, and the sight left them somewhat at a loss.

After a day, most of the martial artists had largely recovered. They had brought many Spirit-Grade Pills with them, and combined with the rich Spiritual Qi here, minor wounds were basically healed.

Lü Guichen of Purple Star suddenly came over to the Sword Alliance side. Under a cluster of hostile, wary gazes, he strolled calmly toward Yue Xi.

Sensing the footsteps, Yue Xi slowly opened her eyes; when he drew near she spoke, "What is it?"

Lü Guichen indicated the nearby peak with a gesture and said meaningfully, "Aren't you curious what that senior's true identity is?"

"Curious? And what of it?" Yue Xi replied indifferently, showing little interest.

But how could she not be curious? All day she had been racking her brains over that old man's identity and had drawn no conclusions. She believed Lü Guichen was thinking the same thing—his coming to see her was proof enough.

"That pitch-black banner the senior used shouldn't be some nameless trinket, but I can't think of any Secret Treasure used by an expert in the past thousand years that resembles it. Do you have any ideas?" he asked.

"I don't. I can't identify that banner either," Yue Xi said, shaking her head.

"So it seems... how about the two of us join forces and make some inquiries?" he suggested.

"Join forces with you?" Yue Xi curled her lips in disdain. "Wouldn't that be like bargaining with a tiger for its skin?"

"You can't put it like that," Lü Guichen said, unconcerned. "Right now your Sword Alliance people and my Purple Star people are both stranded here. There is a senior of absolute strength at this place; by rights we should at least pay him a visit."

"You think he'll see us?" she asked.

"I don't know, but matters are made by people. At minimum we should probe his temperament. That won't harm your Sword Alliance people," Lü Guichen urged.

Yue Xi frowned and pondered.

She knew what Lü Guichen said was not wrong, yet a part of her still resisted allying with this enemy.

Pressed by the present situation, she could not refuse his proposal. After a long moment she nodded slightly. "Very well. I'll go with you to pay a visit to that senior."

"Don't worry—this time I won't pull any tricks. You saw that senior's strength; I won't act recklessly." Lü Guichen smiled bitterly. A master of that level was almost on par with a Star Lord; even if ten of him combined, he believed they still wouldn't stand a chance.

Yue Xi issued a few orders to the Sword Alliance members, rose gracefully, and together she and Lü Guichen walked toward the peak where the old man resided.

Once the two had gone a distance, the sisters He Zao and He Miao exchanged a glance and, without drawing attention, moved closer to where Yang Kai sat.

What happened yesterday left them feeling remorseful, and they had been wanting to apologize to Yang Kai and to comfort him—ask him to wait a few more days until Yue Xi recovered and could help lift the restriction inside his body.

But He Zao had keenly sensed that their master distrusted Yang Kai, so she avoided speaking with him in front of their master to prevent deepening that misunderstanding.

Only now did she find a suitable opportunity.

They had just set off when the martial artist Wei Wu suddenly blocked their path, smiling as he asked, "Where are the two junior sisters off to?"

He Zao frowned. "Just taking a walk."

Wei Wu smiled and volunteered, "Let Senior Brother accompany you."

"No!" He Zao replied sharply, clearly displeased.

Wei Wu shook his head. "Junior Sister, Master just said we must not act without permission. No one knows what hidden dangers lie here. You two are Master's cherished ones; if something happened who would be held responsible? Let Senior Brother accompany you as escort; if anything occurs, Senior Brother can buy you some time."

He struck a grim, willing-to-die-for-you pose—chin up, chest out—putting on an air of maturity and reliability.

"Didn't that senior say there was no danger here yesterday?" He Miao blinked her big eyes.

"Who knows whether what the senior said was true? The depth of his strength may make this place safe for him, but that does not mean it's safe for us. Precisely because we don't understand the mysteries here, Master went with Lü Guichen to gather information."

"Senior Brother, tell me straight—does Master suspect Yang Kai's origin and identity?" He Zao asked, her beautiful eyes bright as she looked at Wei Wu.

"Why would you say that?" Wei Wu looked taken aback.

"It’s just a feeling. Master seems unwilling for us to have too much contact with Yang Kai, and when we brought Yang Kai here yesterday... Master seemed to have done something to him," He Zao said candidly, recalling Yang Kai's frightened and angry expression.

If Master hadn't secretly done something, he certainly wouldn't have gotten so angry.

Wei Wu chuckled. "You're overthinking, Junior Sister. What sort of person is our Master—why would she bother with such a minor character? Besides, whatever Master does is for our good. Enough talk—if you want to stroll, let Senior Brother accompany you; I was also planning to look around nearby."

"No need, we don't want to go." He Zao shook her head and returned to her original spot, sitting cross-legged once more with He Miao.

Wei Wu pinched his nose in helplessness and could only sit and meditate to pass the time.

The movement hadn't escaped Yang Kai's watchful eyes. Though the place was temporarily safe, he was alone; caution was never a bad idea.

Especially that vile woman Bi Ya from Purple Star—she’d been eyeing him like a predator. If not for the deterrence of that mysterious old man, she likely would’ve already made her move against him.

So he kept tabs on the two camps' movements. He saw Lü Guichen and Yue Xi depart together, and he also saw He Zao and He Miao attempt to approach him only to be intercepted by that male martial artist.

Although he could not make out all the details, he had a rough idea of what was happening.

Suddenly a strange sound came from not far off. Yang Kai turned, startled, then with an odd expression rose and moved toward it.

After a moment he came to a patch of shrubs and called in a low voice, "Shen Tu?"

Shen Tu's head popped out from one side of the bushes. He secretly waved to Yang Kai, then hurriedly ducked back inside.

Yang Kai couldn't help but smile as he walked up to him and frowned, "What are you doing?"

"Hiding from those people," Shen Tu whispered, grinning. "Brother, it's so good to see you. I thought we were done for; I didn't expect we'd both survive. We're truly fortunate."

Having said that, he panted heavily, his face pale.

Yang Kai then noticed that Shen Tu's injuries from yesterday's calamity were far worse than his own: a dark bloodstain covered his abdomen, his clothes were torn, and something had apparently pierced him and been ripped out. Ribbons of torn flesh and blood marked his square face, making him look horribly mangled.

"You're in bad shape!" Yang Kai squatted down.

Shen Tu's face contorted as he complained, "Damn it, I didn't think much of it at first, but now that you point it out I do look miserable. Why are you completely unscathed?"

"Luck, perhaps. How did you end up like this?" Yang Kai shrugged.

"I don't know," Shen Tu babbled. "When the warship was destroyed I was knocked unconscious. When I woke up I found myself here. Luckily the shard didn't pierce my vital organs, otherwise you'd be burying me right now." He grinned through the pain, cold sweat pouring down his face.

"You didn't take any pills?" Yang Kai asked in surprise, seeing that Shen Tu hadn't received proper recovery.

“All my things were looted long ago by those Purple Star bastards—what pills could I possibly still have? Even my Secret Treasures are gone. If I still had one, I wouldn’t be in this damn state.” Shen Tu fumed in frustration. “Brother, you got any pills?”

Yang Kai nodded, feigned taking something from the spatial ring on his hand, but in truth withdrew a healing Saint Pill from the Demon God's Secret Codex.

"Oh— a Saint Pill with Pill Patterns?" Shen Tu's eyes lit up. He snatched the Saint Pill, as if such a Pill were a rare boon, and without hesitation swallowed it. Gasping, he said, "Give me some time—I should recover."

"You sit and meditate; I'll watch over you," Yang Kai offered.

Now that the two were on the same side, helping him with a small favor was only natural.

"Shouldn't we move farther away?" Shen Tu asked anxiously, glancing toward the distance. "What if someone from Purple Star or the Sword Alliance spots us..."

"Don't worry," Yang Kai said. "They won't dare act rashly right now."

"What do you mean?" Shen Tu asked, puzzled.

He seemed to know nothing about the old man who had appeared yesterday—he must have been unconscious when the old man showed up.

Yang Kai promptly recounted the old man's appearance. Shen Tu listened, his expression flickering; he murmured, "If that's true, that old geezer is at least at the Origin Returning Realm cultivation—no, perhaps even higher."

He muttered to himself, his expression shifting through a marvelous array of emotions.
