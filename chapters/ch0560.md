## Chapter 560 — Sacred Land Attacks

Yang Kai had already said all he needed to say; what else could Li Yuanchun respond?

Though inwardly he knew Yang Kai was planning to use them as unpaid bodyguards, he had no choice but to agree, smiling pleasantly as he said, “Very well then.”

Those from overseas paid no heed to the Eight Great Families, nor Cangyun Evil Land, for their roots were not in the Inland!

Meanwhile, nearly a thousand li away from War City, dust swirled and faint shadows revealed countless figures and bizarre Demonic Beasts.

Leading them was a massive, broad-shouldered Demonic Beast, atop whose back a man stood serenely, gazing indifferently in the direction of War City.

The man was around forty or fifty years old, unremarkable in appearance, dressed simply in a green robe. Yet his eyes always gleamed with a sharp light, his expression calm but commanding respect without raising his voice.

He was Yang Bai, the Evil Lord of Cangyun Evil Land!

Before anyone had seen this man, the world imagined the Evil Lord as some three-headed, six-armed demon, fierce as a hellish specter. Only those who had met him knew Yang Bai was no different from an ordinary person, even bearing an exceedingly common visage.

Without witnessing his methods personally, none would believe such a man could seize control of the entire Cangyun Evil Land with a single strike.

Over twenty years ago, Yang Bai had trained under Ling Taixu of Lingxiao Pavilion, but due to a narrow mind, he cultivated an unknown forbidden technique and fell into a demonic state of Qi Deviation. This led to a fierce battle with his senior brother, Yang Yingfeng, and their master Ling Taixu. Yang Yingfeng was gravely wounded, plagued by a lingering illness for over a decade. After this catastrophe, Ling Taixu grew disheartened and withdrew from sect affairs.

Years later, Ling Taixu personally captured Yang Bai back to Lingxiao Pavilion, stripped him of all cultivation, and abandoned him in Dragon Confinement Ravine to die.

Unexpectedly, fortune smiled upon Yang Bai there; he gained tremendous opportunities within the ravine, mastering extraordinary abilities. Upon breaking free, he battled the entire Lingxiao Pavilion, killed an elder, severely wounded Ling Taixu, and then departed triumphantly.

Since then, he emerged as the lord of Cangyun Evil Land.

Behind Yang Bai, six figures closely followed, occasionally glancing at him with eyes full of reverence.

These six were the Six Great Evil Kings of Cangyun Evil Land — five men and one woman.

Each bore a distinct and grotesque appearance.

Some rode fierce Demonic Beasts, some were enveloped in green poisonous mist, others exuded chilling Yin energy and ghostly aura, some possessed beastly, muscular physiques, and a few flickered in and out of visibility wrapped in crackling lightning.

The only one appearing relatively normal was the lone woman, the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo.

Even she possessed a peerless charm unlike any mortal, with a bewitching beauty that could captivate any soul at a glance.

Not even the other five Evil Kings dared meet Shan Qingluo's eyes directly.

After ascending beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, her allure had only grown more potent. Though the five kings were stronger in cultivation and strength, none could afford to be careless lest they fall victim to her charms.

The six employed their own means—riding beasts or commanding their powers—to keep pace with Yang Bai.

Behind them, experts from Cangyun Evil Land numbered endlessly, all of the Divine Roaming Realm, some even at its peak.

Countless Demonic Beasts of strange shapes accompanied them, each at least Fifth-Tier in strength, many Sixth-Tier, and even a Seventh-Tier beast!

This Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast was the giant Spider Mother Yang Kai had encountered before, able to communicate with others using Divine Sense.

Now it served the Thunder Beast King. Though the Beast King had not tamed it, they reached an agreement, and naturally, the Spider Mother had joined this campaign to Zhongdu.

Given the misdeeds Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo had committed in the Spider Mother’s Nest, the Spider Mother bore a great enmity toward Shan Qingluo. Yet, intimidated by the strength of Evil Lord Yang Bai, it dared not act rashly.

Had Yang Bai not been present, the Spider Mother would have surely attacked Shan Qingluo.

“Master, we’re only eight hundred li from War City,” the Yinming Ghost King suddenly spoke. “I request permission to scout ahead and gather information.”

Yang Bai’s expression remained unchanged. Calmly flying forward, he did not respond.

“Ghost King, after only half a day without killing, are you already itching to start?” the Destruction Poison King chuckled sideways.

The Yinming Ghost King let out a low, eerie laugh. “Poison King, you know me best. I’ve heard War City is teeming with experts. Last time they barged into our Sacred Land to stir up trouble, they left without the courtesy of repayment—so this time, I’ll deliver them a generous gift in return.”

The Poison King said, “When it comes to killing, I’m still better. Master, let me go first.”

The Ghost King shot back without yielding, “Your poisons may be formidable, but my little ones are legion. When it comes to killing, I’ll not lose to you in the slightest.”

As they spoke, the eerie sound of wailing and howling emerged. Terrifying, agonized faces appeared on the Ghost King’s body—those were human souls trapped and unable to escape inside him.

“Go if you wish,” Yang Bai said indifferently, making no attempt to stop them.

“Thank you, Master!” Both Ghost King and Poison King exclaimed in delight and launched forward with great speed.

“I’m going too,” the Lightning Shadow King said, lightning flickering around him as he disappeared in an instant.

“What the hell? You’re all going?” a thunderous roar issued from a huge, bear-like man, glaring fiercely. “If you all rush ahead, what the hell am I supposed to kill when I get there?”

The Overlord King stomped the ground, making the earth quake with such power it felt apocalyptic, swiftly catching up.

“Heh heh... I’ll join the fun too,” the Thunder Beast King said as he urged his mount forward, followed by a pack of various Demonic Beasts, breaking away from the main group.

In the blink of an eye, five Evil Kings had set out together, leaving only Shan Qingluo trailing behind Yang Bai.

“Qingluo, aren’t you going?” Yang Bai glanced back at her.

“I’m not. They’re enough,” Shan Qingluo shook her head slowly.

“That’s for the best. Those are too bloodthirsty; they won’t get far on the path of martial cultivation.”

Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Bai in surprise, not expecting such criticism of the five.

“By the way, that maid of yours, Bilo... she’s been missing these days,” Yang Bai said casually.

Shan Qingluo’s delicate body trembled as she quickly controlled her breath and replied calmly, “I sent her to handle something.”

“Hmm,” Yang Bai nodded lightly.

Shan Qingluo’s heart was filled with anxiety, fearing more questions, but surprisingly, Yang Bai said no more, as if it was a casual inquiry.

Only then did she exhale in relief.

Gazing distantly toward War City, the Enchantress Queen silently wished that brat would leave quickly. This large-scale Sacred Land campaign was not something a mere War City could withstand.

Shan Qingluo even doubted Zhongdu could hold out.

Yang Bai’s progress in strength was terrifying. When he first arrived in Cangyun Evil Land, subduing the Six Evil Kings, Shan Qingluo could still gauge the limits of his cultivation. Now that she herself had broken beyond Divine Roaming, she could no longer see through him.

His power was absolutely fearsome—no one in Zhongdu could stop him!

Feeling carefully, Shan Qingluo was shocked to find Yang Kai still at War City, showing no sign of leaving, which made her heart anxious.

Even at over eight hundred li, no one beyond Divine Roaming could sense something so distant.

But Yang Kai bore the Soul Pursuit Seal Shan Qingluo had planted on him long ago. Because of this seal, Shan Qingluo could track his whereabouts no matter where he was—even at the edges of the world.

Shan Qingluo's heart held feelings for Yang Kai; planting the Soul Pursuit Seal was meant to prevent his escape but had proven useful.

What was that brat doing? Why was he lingering so long? Bilo should have reached the destination and delivered the message.

War City, Yang Kai’s residence.

Everyone was prepared.

All had realized the gravity of the situation, and no one objected when Yang Kai insisted they leave at once.

Just then, Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen returned, having followed Yang Kai’s instructions to report the news to the seven in Fengshen Hall.

“How did it go?” Yang Kai asked.

Qiu Yimeng’s face darkened as she shook her head painfully. “They don’t believe us.”

Yang Kai snorted, “They have death looming and still don’t realize it. Foolish beyond measure! No matter what they think, I’ve done all I can. What will you two do? Return to Zhongdu, or...?”

“Go with you!” Qiu Yimeng hurriedly said.

“Then let’s go.” Yang Kai gestured and said no more. Time was precious; this was no moment for argument. Though Yang Kai thought it best if they returned to Zhongdu since they were young heirs of great families and had no need to wander with him.

Under Yang Kai’s lead, the group marched out grandly.

Outside, since moments ago, voices continuously shouted threats, demanding all forces at Yang Kai’s residence depart immediately.

The shouting kept up even now.

At the sudden appearance of so many warriors emerging from Yang Kai’s mansion, the heralds were taken aback, mistakenly thinking Yang Kai planned some great action and quickly raised alarms.

In the next instant, countless experts arrived, blocking their path.

Though the Seven Great Families Coalition had suffered heavy losses in last night’s battle, their foundations remained solid. Gathered together now, the scene was still imposing and crowded.

“Young master, what are you trying to do?” Kang Zhan of the Kang Family parted the crowd carefully and approached.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, considered for a moment, then said, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you. The people from Cangyun Evil Land, led by the Evil Lord, are rushing this way. If you don’t want to die, leave War City and return to Zhongdu at once.”

Kang Zhan stared at Yang Kai, seeming not to understand.

A long moment later, he chuckled bitterly, shaking his head, “Young master, what do you mean by that...?”
