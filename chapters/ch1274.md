## Chapter 1274 — Blood Zhi Mushroom

Although he received Daiyuan’s praise, Yang Kai still felt somewhat puzzled. In terms of merging and controlling medicinal effects, he did perform quite well—but those five Origin-Grade alchemists of the Medicine Pill Sect surely were no worse; their age and experience alone spoke for it. Yet Daiyuan had come specifically to seek his help instead of theirs—there must be some hidden reason behind it.

He did not press for answers; he knew Daiyuan would tell him when the time came.

Seeing Yang Kai listening intently, Daiyuan pursed her lips in a smile and continued, "If it were only a matter of finding a pillmaster like that, it wouldn't be difficult. The hard part is gathering the materials needed to purge the toxin."

"Oh? What materials are needed?" Yang Kai asked.

"There are many materials, but the previous resident here collected most of them over many years and managed to assemble about ninety percent. The most difficult to find was the Yin Pool, and that predecessor actually found one and expended a great deal of effort to bring it back to Qianhuan Peak. The reason I asked you to come with me, Junior Brother, is because that Yin Pool can't be moved; otherwise I wouldn't have forced you to travel so far."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and finally understood why Daiyuan had insisted he accompany her to Liuli Gate. Yin Pools were exceedingly rare—only places where yin energy gathered and ghostly chill prevailed had any chance of producing them. Though useless to most martial artists, to those steeped in yin-and-evil they were treasured grounds, for the pure yin energy within a Yin Pool could rapidly raise the power of any such practitioner.

Yang Kai had only heard of them and had never had the chance to see one with his own eyes.

"Because Thousand Illusions Glaze is not restrained by the Five Elements, to purge its glaze toxin one must have something like a Yin Pool. After refining the effects of countless medicinal ingredients and merging them into the Yin Pool's water, using that water as a conduit to pour into my body, there will be a chance to extract the glaze toxin," Daiyuan explained softly.

Yang Kai listened and nodded. Given his level of alchemy and knowledge, he did not fully grasp every inner detail, but the method sounded correct.

After a moment's thought he asked, "If that predecessor found a Yin Pool and even brought it back to Qianhuan Peak, why didn't she remove the toxin herself?"

"She was still missing one final thing," Daiyuan answered with a bitter smile. "What she lacked was the Blood Zhi Mushroom."

"The Blood Zhi Mushroom?" Yang Kai's spirit jolted. "The kind that can be used to make the Blood Zhi Pill capable of bringing the dead back to life?"

Shock spread across his features as if he'd heard something incredible.

"Yes, the very Blood Zhi Mushroom used to make the Blood Zhi Pill!" Daiyuan nodded lightly and flipped her hand; a delicate wooden box suddenly appeared in her palm. She opened it, and in front of Yang Kai lay a fist-sized thing that looked partly like lingzhi and partly like a mushroom. It was not only oddly shaped but wholly crimson; upon closer inspection it seemed as if blood flowed within it, and it gave off a sharp, pungent scent.

Yang Kai received it with a grave expression. He reached out and lightly prodded it, then examined it carefully for a while before nodding, "Indeed, it's a Blood Zhi Mushroom. Its medicinal age is at least three thousand years, and... it appears to have been harvested not long ago. This came from Flowing Flame Sandland, didn't it?"

"You truly can't be fooled, Junior Brother," Daiyuan smiled faintly. "Thanks to your good fortune, this very Blood Zhi Mushroom is my harvest from the Fourth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland."

Yang Kai's expression shifted; her luck was no joke. Treasures in the Fourth Stage were extraordinarily rare—he had only managed to collect a few clusters of Purple Jade Fruit on one trip—yet Daiyuan had found a Blood Zhi Mushroom, and of all things it was exactly what she urgently needed. It seemed that after he left, Daiyuan had spent much effort searching for a Blood Zhi Mushroom, and the reason she came with him into the Fourth Layer was likely to look for this very thing.

At last she had achieved her wish.

"What do you intend to do with this Blood Zhi Mushroom?" Yang Kai closed the box, returned it to her, and asked.

Daiyuan was silent for a moment, rubbing the wooden box before sighing. "To be frank, Junior Brother, although the method for driving out the toxin was created and perfected by the predecessor who lived here, she did not have complete confidence in its success. The Thousand Illusions Glaze toxin has already penetrated all parts of my body, so purging it will inevitably greatly deplete my Yuan Qi; dying from the attempt is not impossible. This Blood Zhi Mushroom is the guarantee to preserve that sliver of life."

Yang Kai frowned. "If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to refine it into a Blood Zhi Pill?"

"The Blood Zhi Pill..." Daiyuan forced a wry smile. "Junior Brother, as a pillmaster you surely understand the rank of the Blood Zhi Pill: it is an Upper-Level Origin-Grade pill. It's not something the pillmasters on Dark Star could produce. If we were in the outside world you came from, that suggestion might work. But... or rather, Junior Brother, are you an Upper-Level Origin-Grade pillmaster?"

"No!" Yang Kai shook his head. He was currently a Lower-Level Origin-Grade pillmaster, though with effort and without worrying about wasting ingredients he might have a chance to produce a Middle-Level Origin-Grade pill. An Upper-Level Origin-Grade pill, however, was impossible. After a pause he said, "What I mean is, if you are not in a hurry, you could wait some days; perhaps a more reliable method will appear, or someone might be found to refine the Blood Zhi Pill."

He did not dare say he could refine it himself. Although Yang Kai believed it would not take many years before he rose to an Upper-Level Origin-Grade pillmaster, he could not promise it now.

"I cannot wait," Daiyuan said with a bitter shake of her head. "If I could wait, I wouldn't have been so desperate to ask you for help. After the Thousand Illusions Glaze cultivation, depending on how my body absorbs the glaze, my realm will have to advance accordingly. At most I can delay for half a year. After that, whether I wish it or not, I must attempt to break into the Origin Returning Realm. If I succeed there may be a slim chance of survival; if I fail, given my current level I will be unable to suppress the glaze toxin, and death would be inevitable. Although directly consuming the Blood Zhi Mushroom will greatly reduce its effect and ruin this natural treasure, there is no other option for now."

"There's truly no other way?" Yang Kai frowned deeply.

"None!" Daiyuan smiled gently. "Thanks for your concern, Junior Brother, but since I've decided, I have long made my peace. Whether this attempt to purge the toxin succeeds or fails, at least I will have tried. Compared to the predecessor who once lived here and the elders who suffered from the Thousand Illusions Glaze before, I'm far luckier, so I will not complain."

Yang Kai let out a soft sigh and stopped trying to dissuade her; instead he nodded, "If you've made up your mind, then so be it. Wherever you need my help, I will do my utmost."

Daiyuan was overjoyed at his words and thanked him gratefully. "Then thank you, Junior Brother. I'll now tell you exactly how to help me purge the toxin. Listen carefully, for once we begin I may not have the energy to remind you."

"Mm."

Daiyuan then recited the purifying method and all the details in turn. These methods and particulars were conceived by the predecessor of Liuli Gate and perfected during her lifetime, so to Yang Kai they seemed reasonable, and he felt great admiration for that predecessor.

Yet while explaining the specifics and procedures, Daiyuan's cheeks flushed and her eyes rippled with moisture; her voice dropped and she looked restless. Though her appearance was not striking, the shy charm that occasionally flashed in her eyes added to her allure.

Yang Kai finally understood why Daiyuan had been reluctant to tell him the particulars before—the purification required some intimate physical contact.

No wonder Daiyuan blushed while explaining; any woman describing where on her body to condense medicinal effects for a man would show a similar expression.

After all, once such actions were carried out, awkward moments were inevitable.

Though Yang Kai had never met that Master Xiao of Liuli Gate, he was certain the master must be an old man; otherwise Daiyuan would not have spoken of inconvenient matters.

Of the five masters from the Medicine Pill Sect, four were likewise old men and only one was an old woman.

Compared with facing those old men, Daiyuan would naturally prefer Yang Kai; after all, he was a striking and extraordinary young talent, and her reluctance toward him would be weaker. If possible, she would have preferred the old woman from the Medicine Pill Sect—both being female would carry fewer taboos.

But she couldn't pay such a cost.

Yang Kai considered this inwardly, piecing together Daiyuan's hesitations and reservations, and guessed that since she herself was a pillmaster, she had probably prepared for the upcoming detox by working on her alchemy.

It's a pity she hadn't had much time to grow in alchemy; now she was only a Saint King-Grade pillmaster and of little use.

Though Daiyuan spoke with a hint of shyness, Yang Kai’s expression remained calm and indifferent, showing no unnecessary emotion. He simply listened with full concentration, unwilling to miss even the smallest detail. Seeing his composure, Daiyuan gradually relaxed as well. As the saying goes—“a healer must not shy from propriety.” The situation between her and Yang Kai now was somewhat akin to that between a physician and a patient.

With that thought, Daiyuan's expression slowly returned to normal.

They spent the entire night in explanation; at key moments Yang Kai would proactively ask questions, and Daiyuan, knowing the matter's gravity, answered him in full.

At dawn Daiyuan finished her explanation, and Yang Kai had the detox procedure firmly committed to memory, knowing exactly when to do what.

"Junior Brother, have you remembered everything?" Daiyuan looked at him and asked. Though she had stayed up through the night, she showed no trace of fatigue; instead she seemed spirited, perhaps stirred by the fact that she had arrived at the most important turning point of her life.
