## Chapter 1611 — Soul and Spirit Annihilated

Yao King Feng E had never treated the survival of Xue Lian's body as anything important.

He put on a show of engaging Yang Kai in a close-quarters death struggle precisely so that, the moment Yang Kai's mind relaxed, his Spirit Body could rush into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and usurp his flesh.

He nearly succeeded!

His Spirit Body had, as he wished, broken into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness; now he only needed to devour Yang Kai's Spirit Body to occupy Yang Kai's body and enjoy the many marvels contained within.

Feng E had that confidence. Though he had lain dormant for tens of thousands of years and, with the passage of time, his soul power had steadily weakened, nearly dissipating, but a scrawny camel is still larger than a horse—his Divine Sense strength still could not be casually compared to an ordinary Origin Returning Realm expert's.

Otherwise he would not have so quickly usurped Xue Lian's body in such a short time.

Xue Lian, after all, was an elite of the Origin Returning Realm.

But when he rashly stormed into this scorching Sea of Consciousness world, he vaguely sensed that something was wrong.

"Mutated Divine Sense!" Feng E cried out.

"How amusing." Yang Kai looked at him calmly and did not rush to act; that indifferent tone sounded as if he were chatting with a friend.

Feng E frowned and glanced around; soon his gaze was drawn to a treasure isle in the center of the Sea of Consciousness radiating seven-colored light. In an instant his eyes rounded and his expression filled with disbelief; he pointed tremblingly and said, "Could that be the legendary Warm Spirit Lotus?"

"You know the Warm Spirit Lotus?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Mad Croc’s expression darkened. “This King has drunk more water than you’ve walked roads. You think I wouldn’t have heard of a heaven-and-earth treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus?”

That brat actually had a Warm Spirit Lotus! What astonished him most was that this Warm Spirit Lotus had taken a seven-colored form.

With such a peerless treasure nourishing the Sea of Consciousness, no wonder the boy's Divine Sense was absurdly strong and his Sea of Consciousness so condensed. Rumor had it the thing could constantly nourish a cultivator's soul and enlarge soul power; the short-term effect might not be obvious, but over extended time the results were remarkable.

It could save a martial artist countless years of bitter cultivation!

Tens of thousands of years ago when Feng E had been alive he had certainly heard of the Warm Spirit Lotus, but he had never had the fortune to see one. He had never expected that tens of thousands of years later, while attempting to usurp Yang Kai, he would behold one with his own eyes.

He did not know whether this seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus had been acquired by the boy already in that form, or whether it had evolved from the boy's own mind.

The former possibility was likelier! The Warm Spirit Lotus's evolution was exceedingly arduous—how could it evolve into a seven-colored form so casually?

The kid's luck was outrageously sky-defying, Feng E thought with mixed feelings.

He had become a Yao King through innate bloodline talent and repeated fortunate encounters; through struggle he had achieved his former status and strength. But compared to Yang Kai, those fortunes he had obtained were rubbish.

He greedily gazed at the seven-colored Treasure Isle, took a deep breath as if to steady his excitement, turned his head and solemnly looked at Yang Kai, bellowing, "Brat. I really underestimated you. It looks like a fierce battle will follow; whether you die or I perish remains to be seen!"

The other's soul power was not below his current level, and with the Warm Spirit Lotus supporting him, Yao King Feng E no longer had complete confidence that he could devour Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

He regarded the opponent as someone who could confront him head-on.

"I think the latter possibility is more likely." At these words, Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his face serene and untroubled—he was supremely confident and showed not the slightest sign of respecting Yao King Feng E.

"You brat are too arrogant; it's time you received a lesson, so you won't underestimate the heroes of the world."

"Don't believe me?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at him, a mocking smile on his lips. "Fine, I won't waste words. The sooner I kill you, the sooner it's over."

As he spoke, Yang Kai raised a hand and pointed at the sky.

Feng E did not know what Yang Kai intended to do and looked up suspiciously.

An extremely strange oval object came into view; in its center there was a seam that at first glance resembled a tightly closed eye, mysterious and unfathomable.

With Yang Kai's pointing, that seam slowly split open.

Immediately a sliver of golden light bloomed forth.

The golden radiance grew and grew until it formed a pillar of light descending from the high heavens, enveloping Yao King Feng E's Spirit Body within.

Within that golden light there seemed to be interwoven five-colored aurora.

A most wondrous power wrapped Feng E's Spirit Body, rendering him unable to move, as if bound by that very light.

"What is this?" Feng E screamed in terror.

When exposed to the golden light, he sensed something amiss: his soul power felt like snowflakes under the scorching sun, rapidly evaporating and dissolving. This discovery terrified him and he fought with all his might.

The golden light waned somewhat, and the five-colored aurora woven within it seemed to show signs of being unable to fully restrain Yao King Feng E.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, showing surprise.

The World-Ending Demon Eye was the Great Demon God's innate Divine Skill, able to produce Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light, which exerted an exceedingly powerful suppressive effect on souls; Yang Kai had used it countless times with unfailing success.

Although the Great Demon God had only reached the Saint King Realm in life, his innate Divine Skill now belonged to Yang Kai, and the potency of the Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light rose along with Yang Kai's strength.

Moreover, the current Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light also carried the power of Glazed Light.

Glazed Light had the effect of restraining the body and confining the soul; united with Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light the two became even more devastating.

Even so, they could not obliterate Yao King Feng E in a single blow, which showed how pure and vigorous his soul power was.

But that was understandable—after all, Feng E was a Yao King-level expert; if he were so easily killed, that would be unreasonable.

Yang Kai sneered. He made no physical move, but with a thought the rolling, roaring, flame-like seawater surged from all directions, forming massive waves that slammed toward Yao King Feng E's Spirit Body.

In an instant the ground where Feng E stood was enveloped in fiery red Divine Sense energy.

"No!" Feng E's wail rang out; within the sea of fire he struggled desperately, and one after another powerful Soul Techniques erupted, firing in all directions.

"Feng E, here I am the master! You dared to come here; you've dug your own grave!" Yang Kai roared, fiercely urging his own soul power to press down on Feng E.

Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light, Glazed Light, and Divine Sense Fire—three forces struck together, and the Sea of Consciousness instantly turned upside down.

Feng E's screams and howls were endless, sounding utterly tragic. But no matter how he struggled he could not escape the golden light, and under it his soul power dissolved at a terrifying speed; his breath grew ever weaker.

As time passed, his cries grew faint and his resistance ever feebler.

In the end he gave no response at all. When Yang Kai waved and calmed the churning Divine Sense and withdrew the World-Ending Demon Eye's power, only a ball of Spirit Essence energy remained in the sky above the Sea of Consciousness—Feng E's soul and spirit had been completely annihilated!

Yang Kai gazed at that mass of energy, his eyes burning hot.

This was what remained after Feng E had been strangled out of existence. It contained his comprehension of the Martial Dao and his insights into Domain!

It was the life-long accumulation of a Third Stage Void King expert.

Its value was incalculable.

If he could absorb that energy completely, Yang Kai estimated he would gain tremendous growth and very likely save himself many years of cultivation.

Thinking this, he could no longer hold back. His Spirit Body slipped out of his Sea of Consciousness and, after glancing around, he moved before the fallen yao prodigies—Xue Lian and the rest. He extracted their Inner Cores and Spatial Rings, then summoned a wave of Demonic Flame to burn their corpses to ash before turning around and diving back into the cave.

Xue Lian, Mi Tian, Lie Feng—all were famed on Di Chen Star and formidable Origin Returning Realm experts; they essentially represented the highest combat strength of the Origin Returning Realm.

Their Inner Cores were naturally extremely valuable.

Yang Kai did not use their corpses to condense Blood Beasts; now his methods against enemies were numerous, and Blood Beasts were not an urgent matter.

Three Inner Cores equivalent to peak Ninth-Tier demonic beasts—if used wisely as Dan Guides, they could certainly refine three Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills!

He decided to use the three Inner Cores to refine pills; Inner Cores of this caliber were rare.

In the cave Yang Kai sat cross-legged, savoring and absorbing the essence from that pure energy. His face at times brightened with joy, at times showed bewildered astonishment, fluctuating constantly.

A hundred li away from the Blood Prison, inside that stone pavilion.

Luo Hai kept his eyes tightly shut and remained motionless.

But his Divine Sense wandered the void, sweeping over the entire Blood Prison.

Though he could not perceive everything clearly, he could still detect some general developments.

At present his Divine Sense had been entirely cast toward the Yao Hill.

It seemed he had discovered something; since half an hour earlier his body had been trembling slightly and a fierce turmoil churned in the depths of his heart.

Because of the requests from the old woman surnamed Lei and the others, he had been watching Yang Kai's movements.

He had sensed Yang Kai entering the Yao Hill and had also sensed the disturbances there.

He had likewise detected the disappearance of the aura from the Void Mind Crystal hidden in the Yao Hill.

The Void Mind Crystal had lain there peacefully for tens of thousands of years with no trouble. Yang Kai's entry into the Yao Hill causing such a change—what could that indicate? Luo Hai almost immediately saw through the truth.

The Void Mind Crystal had been taken by Yang Kai!

That was a treasure even Luo Hai had coveted. He concealed the excitement in his heart so as not to reveal a flaw, but inwardly he began to scheme.

A Void Mind Crystal left by a Yao King-level expert was something he would never let go; it might be the key to his advancement to the Third Stage Void King, perhaps even allowing him to break through his current shackles and reach the supreme pinnacle.

Back when Third Stage Void King experts fell in the Blood Prison, there had been not just that one Yao King but three in total; yet the other two's Void Mind Crystals had long ago been taken, leaving only that Yao King's Void Mind Crystal, particularly troublesome and unattainable.

The dense yao qi shrouding the Yao Hill made any human Origin Returning Realm hesitant to approach.

This time someone had finally succeeded in obtaining it—how could Luo Hai let it pass?
