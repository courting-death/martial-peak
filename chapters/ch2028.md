## Chapter 2028 — Ink Jade Cauldron

Yang Kai and Kang Siran had barely taken their seats and exchanged a few words when three gong strikes resounded through the hall, and a short, white‑bearded old man suddenly leapt onto the auction platform.

He dressed eccentrically: his clothes were ragged, his hair a mess, his nose reddened from drink, and a large bluish gourd hung at his waist; at a glance one might think him a beggar eking out a living on the streets.

Once the old man stepped onto the stage he let out a loud, hearty laugh and, as if no one else existed, grabbed the gourd at his waist, flipped open the lid, and tossed a mouthful of strong wine down his throat.

After several gulps he, in full view of everyone, gave a resonant, satisfied belch; his eyes narrowed as a look of contentment crossed his face, as if he could die in that moment with no regrets.

A scent of wine spread quickly through the hall.

Yang Kai watched dumbfounded, his eyes nearly popping out.

He had attended a few auctions back in his native Star Domain, but those auctioneers were always either solemn and steady or alluring and graceful — never had one been as singularly eccentric as the old man on the platform.

"Pillmaster Yang hasn't been in Fenglin City long; he probably doesn't know him," Kang Siran laughed. Before Yang Kai could speak he added, "This man is one of Fenglin City's two deputy city lords. No one knows his exact name; he calls himself the Drunken Old Man, and everyone calls him that."

"One of the two deputy city lords? Then isn't he of the Dao Origin Realm?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"That's right — First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm — but it's hard to judge his exact strength. Rumor has it his true power isn't inferior to Lord Duan's; he may well fight above his apparent level," Kang Siran said.

Yang Kai nodded, then let out a low chuckle. "Letting him preside over the auction—will that really be fine? He already looks halfway drunk."

Kang Siran chuckled, "Don't be fooled by his appearance — the Drunken Old Man has quite a reputation in Fenglin City. He often stands up for the weak and parts with his wealth for righteous causes; he's a good man."

Yang Kai understood and nodded: "If that's so, then there shouldn't be any problem."

The old man, having finished savoring the wine, finally came to his senses, narrowed his small eyes, scanned around, cupped his fists and said, "Who this little old man is, ten out of ten of you here should know — no, if you don't it's fine. This little old man didn't come to court any of you; I came to preside over the auction, so you needn't stare at this little old man, just stare at the items up for auction."

At these words many cultivators in the hall laughed out loud; Yang Kai also found the man amusing — he displayed none of the lofty airs of a Dao Origin Realm expert, instead he was remarkably down-to-earth and approachable.

"Ah, this little old man is a lazy sort, so I really didn't want to come to this auction, but the City Lord tempted me with fine wine and I fell for it. The City Lord truly is devious, vile. In short, I'm impatient; when you bid later be decisive, otherwise this little old man won't wait — I still need to go sunbathe," the Drunken Old Man said as he paced the platform.

Hearing him say that, many people's expressions turned grave.

"Alright, enough idle talk — the auction begins now," the Drunken Old Man called, then gestured behind him.

From behind the platform a maid from the City Lord's residence immediately stepped up carrying a jade plate; upon it sat a pristine porcelain bottle, so by the looks of it the first auction item was undoubtedly a pill.

"Ancient Spiritual Pill — one bottle of Divine Condensation Pill, three pills total, auctioned together. Starting bid thirty thousand Source Crystals; each increase no less than one thousand. Begin," the Drunken Old Man announced and waited.

"Divine Condensation Pill — right off the bat a Divine Condensation Pill? What other good things will follow?"

"They say that after taking the Divine Condensation Pill one can temper the power of Divine Sense, making Divine Sense far stronger — whether that's true I don't know."

"This is a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Spiritual Pill. Our Fenglin City's alchemists generally can't make this."

At the mention of the Divine Condensation Pill the cultivators present instantly grew excited; Divine Sense concerned every cultivator's safety, and a stronger Divine Sense could be miraculous for concealment, escape, searching, or combat — the pill would be useful to anyone.

"Thirty thousand!"

"Thirty-two thousand!"

"Thirty-five thousand!"

Bids rose in waves; even those in private rooms joined in, and before long the bottle's price broke past fifty thousand Source Crystals.

It wasn't until someone cried out sixty thousand Source Crystals that there was a brief lull.

"Sixty thousand — one, two, three. Very well, this bottle of Divine Condensation Pill belongs to the friend who just bid; please bring your Source Crystals to the back for settlement. Next item!" the Drunken Old Man declared.

The old man, who had been standing on the platform with his eyes closed, suddenly ratified the transaction at rapid pace, not giving others time to react before moving on to the next item.

"This…"

"Too fast."

"Is this an auction or some kind of forced sale?"

"The Drunken Old Man really acts unpredictably!"

The hall erupted into uproar and debate; it seemed no cultivator had experienced such an auction. In past auctions the auctioneer would repeatedly ask if there were higher bids, fearing the item would sell for too little, but the Drunken Old Man appeared not to care about that at all.

He only wanted to finish presiding over the auction quickly so he could go sleep and sunbathe.

For a while the cultivators who had hesitated and not bid felt extreme regret, while the fellow who had obtained the bottle for sixty thousand stood up with a delighted look and rushed to the back to settle, as if he'd scored a huge bargain.

After witnessing the Drunken Old Man's impatience, the rest had their passions stoked; whenever they came across something they wanted they no longer hesitated, and their bids grew faster and faster for fear the Drunken Old Man would close the sale before they could raise their hands.

As a result, the auction moved at an astonishing speed: in less than half an hour more than forty items were sold.

Such a pace would have been impossible at the auctions Yang Kai had experienced before.

Pills, secret treasures, cultivation methods, secret arts — each item appeared in turn. Some were submitted by cultivators themselves, but the vast majority had been brought out from inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

These relics from the ancient battlefields naturally sparked a frenzied scramble, driving the auction hall into a white‑hot uproar.

Yang Kai also took a quick look over the prices of those items.

An ordinary Dao Origin-Grade secret treasure cost seven to eight hundred thousand Source Crystals, and if the grade was slightly higher, prices of a million or several million were normal.

He had thought that with a million Source Crystals as a baseline he would have some confidence, but now he realized — he was still short.

"Dao Origin‑Grade, Lower‑Level — the Tiger‑Guard Battle Armor! One million eight hundred thousand Source Crystals — going once, going twice, going three times! The friend who bid, please bring your Source Crystals to the back to settle the item. On to the next auction piece…" the Drunken Old Man finished, then stepped back and stood motionless.

A maid stepped forward from backstage carrying a jade plate that bore a mysterious auction item draped in red cloth. The object couldn't be seen clearly, only that it stood about half a chi high.

When the maid drew near, the Drunken Old Man suddenly let out a knowing chuckle and looked meaningfully downwards. "This item is exceedingly precious; it should have been the finale, but at my insistence it appears early. I imagine many of you have guessed what it is — well then, let's begin."

With that he pulled the red cloth from the jade plate, and the true form of the auction item was revealed to all.

It was, startlingly, a furnace—small enough to be lifted with one hand. The cauldron gleamed jade‑green, its surface carved with dragons and phoenixes, lending it an exceptionally noble air, and an austere, ancient aura emanated from it.

The Drunken Old Man took up the furnace with one hand and chuckled. "What material forged this Ink Jade Cauldron the City Lord and I studied for days and still could not determine. We only know it is an alchemical furnace and that it is Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level."

A cry of astonishment rang out below: "A Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemical furnace!"

Although many fine items had appeared at this auction, treasures of Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level were still few and far between.

In particular, because this item was an alchemical furnace, its traits naturally stirred alchemists into a craze.

Alchemists tended to be extremely wealthy; a good alchemical furnace could drive them to spend their entire fortunes in competition. Moreover, the great sects and families always sought to cultivate their own alchemists, so this Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemical furnace would surely tempt them.

With a good furnace an alchemist could improve pill success rates and possibly refine pills ordinarily impossible to produce, so the value of such a furnace was self-evident.

Even Yang Kai, who had not yet bid, felt his gaze burn upon seeing the furnace; his Divine Sense leapt toward the platform to probe it closely.

Many others did the same; countless Divine Senses flowed from all directions within the hall and converged, creating a lively bustle.

"Does Pillmaster Yang want this furnace?" Kang Siran observed with a faint smile.

"I would like it, but…" Yang Kai smiled wryly and shook his head. "I probably won't be able to snatch it."

Kang Siran pondered for a moment and said, "How do you know you can't win if you don't try? All right, Pillmaster Yang, bid when the time comes; if your Source Crystals are insufficient, I'll lend you some."

"We'll see then," Yang Kai said noncommittally.

He knew Kang Siran had also brought many Source Crystals to compete for that Dao Origin Fruit; if his own business caused Kang to miss out, Yang Kai would feel embarrassed.

Although he liked that alchemical furnace, it wasn't indispensable.
