## Chapter 1975 — Incinerating the Four Directions

The Luanfeng hatchling was destined to have nowhere to run; surrounded by so many martial artists, where could it flee? The remaining question was who would subdue it.

But judging from the crowd's unyielding aura, they certainly would not reach any good conclusion in a short time.

Sure enough, those still alive argued and quarreled on the spot for an hour and produced no good plan; the situation remained deadlocked, the air thickening as if a second battle were about to erupt.

Throughout the entire process, the Luanfeng hatchling lay on the ground, issuing soft trills.

Hidden thirty li away, Yang Kai frowned; he no longer had the patience to continue waiting.

Once those people decided the Luanfeng's ownership, the next target would very likely be Mo Xiaoqi, for her value seemed hardly any less than that of the Luanfeng hatchling.

Just as Yang Kai prepared to withdraw, his skin suddenly tightened, and an inexplicable sense of crisis and horror surged up into his heart.

This made him knit his brows; he did not know what had happened to cause such a feeling.

Turning his head to look the other way, he found Mo Xiaoqi had apparently noticed as well; she was now peering about furtively.

Suddenly the sky darkened, as if clouds had obscured the sunlight overhead; a massive shadow covered the earth, and at the same time the air temperature rose sharply, causing the verdant trees of Yuqing Mountain to begin to wither and burn.

From above came a high, piercing cry that rang through the clouds.

Yang Kai was startled and looked up; the next moment he froze completely in place.

In the sky, an existence identical to the Luanfeng hatchling was flapping its wings, flying overhead.

But this being was countless times larger than that hatchling — literally a magnified version of the Luanfeng hatchling.

Where it passed, the sky was left scorched; space shattered, and an unimaginably vast oppressive aura struck downwards like a collapsing mountain, pressing Yang Kai until his bones cracked audibly.

“Luanfeng! Ancient Divine Spirit?” Yang Kai cried out.

This was a truly mature Luanfeng, the formidable existence that only appeared in legends — an unrivaled overlord capable of contending with true dragons!

Yang Kai groaned inwardly; although he had long suspected that if there was a hatchling there must be a mature Luanfeng, he had never imagined such a mature Luanfeng would appear before his eyes.

Merely the intimidation from that enormous body almost rendered Yang Kai immobile, not to mention its pitch-black flames burning across its form, flames sufficient to destroy a realm.

His eyes trembled violently; he tried to move a finger but found he was utterly powerless, only able to watch the Luanfeng streak past overhead.

Thirty li away the Luanfeng hatchling gave urgent, mournful cries, hoisting its extremely weak body to its feet and calling to the heights as if a lost child had found its parents.

Hall Master Luo, Elder Jiu, Chen Shiqi and the others all froze in place; when that shadow that blotted out the light descended above them everyone knew disaster had come, beads of sweat rolled down their brows as each desperately pushed at their power, trying to flee.

But under the suppression of the Ancient Divine Spirit's pressure they were like children, utterly helpless.

Dao Origin Realm experts were like this; those of the Void King Realm and Origin Returning Realm were even more fragile.

Several of the weaker Origin Returning Realm practitioners even coughed up blood and died.

The Luanfeng circled in the air, seemingly having seen its child's tragic condition; its eyes suddenly ran blood-red as a violent aura radiated from its body, sweeping the four directions.

It hung in midair, opened its beak, its abdomen drew in and then swelled, and world-annihilating black flames rolled down like a tsunami from the sky.

“No!” Hall Master Luo shouted, but the next moment he was consumed by the black flames and instantly reduced to nothingness.

Where the black flames passed, nothing remained; of the more than two hundred martial artists still alive, not one escaped — all were burned to death and their souls obliterated.

Black fire shot into the sky; even a hundred li away it could be seen clearly — the flames seemed intent on burning heaven and earth themselves, monstrously cruel.

The land had been reduced to scorched earth, not a blade of grass surviving; within a ten-li radius it had become a Death Domain, and that Death Domain was still rapidly encroaching outward.

Thirty li away Yang Kai felt his spine go cold; seeing those black flames blazing toward him like thunder, he dared not hesitate and unleashed his Golden Sacred Dragon origin power to resist the Luanfeng's violent pressure, finally regaining a little freedom.

The next moment he produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and hid within it.

The instant Yang Kai vanished into the Xuan Realm Pearl, the black flames incinerated the spot where he had been hiding; had he been just a moment slower, he would have followed Hall Master Luo and the others to their end.

“Damn it!” The moment he hid in the Xuan Realm Pearl Yang Kai suddenly remembered he had forgotten Mo Xiaoqi.

Although Mo Xiaoqi carried a Secret Treasure of great power, before the Ancient Divine Spirit's peerless burning flames she likely had little ability to resist; it had been too sudden and he had had no time to consider her.

Thinking it over now, even if he had gone out to save her it was probably already too late.

Yang Kai felt a flush of regret.

Although he and Mo Xiaoqi could not be said to have any deep relationship, the girl's simple, guileless nature made him feel ashamed to have let her be swallowed by the black flames.

He hoped heaven would watch over the good.

Yang Kai thought inwardly, though he knew this possibility was vanishingly small.

Yuqing Mountain burned; black light shrouded a hundred li around, and all living things were exterminated.

Only then did the Luanfeng flying in the sky flicker and suddenly take the form of a young woman, hair in a bun, bearing a cold and lofty temperament and dressed in sumptuous clothing.

Her beautiful eyes bore not a shred of feeling, only icy murderous intent.

Only when she looked at the Luanfeng hatchling on the ground did she reveal a rare trace of gentleness.

The Luanfeng hatchling likewise shifted its shape, suddenly turning into a child-like figure of about three or four years old, its hair tied into a little topknot, chubby and robust.

The young woman hooked out a hand; a mysterious force wrapped the child and lifted it up to her.

The young woman shot the child a sharp glance, as if scolding him, but the boy only giggled and scrambled into her arms with hands and feet. He settled into a comfortable posture, shut his eyes, and soon fell into a deep, snoring sleep.

The young woman sighed softly, cradling the child with one arm as she vanished with great speed; before leaving she frowned and glanced toward the direction where Yang Kai had been, seeming somewhat puzzled.

...

Only after a full ten days did Yang Kai quietly emerge from the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The moment he appeared he felt waves of unbearable heat rising from all directions, and it was more than heat — there was a force mixed in that seemed capable of burning souls.

Yang Kai was greatly alarmed and leapt into the air.

He looked down and his heart was struck with dread.

Yuqing Mountain, centered on that day's battlefield, burned with black flames for a hundred li around; though ten days had passed they showed no sign of extinguishing, especially the ten-li center, where the black flames exuded an annihilatory aura — it would likely be impossible for anything to grow there for hundreds if not thousands of years.

There were no corpses on the ground; all bodies had been burned clean, with not even dust remaining.

He looked again toward the place where Mo Xiaoqi had hidden and his face darkened.

That place seemed to have been touched by the black flames; the burning light there was especially dark, and Mo Xiaoqi was nowhere to be seen.

The girl... likely had little chance of survival, Yang Kai thought inwardly.

If there had been a chance he surely would not have stood by and let her die, but at that time they were not close, life and death turned in an instant, and he had had no time to consider much.

Is this destiny? If Mo Xiaoqi hadn't jabbed him, they wouldn't have been separated so far — had she been at his side then, Yang Kai could have brought her into the Xuan Realm Pearl with him.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai prepared to leave.

But at that moment he suddenly seemed to notice something and his gaze fixed on a direction.

There seemed to be something left behind over there.

Before the Luanfeng's annihilating black flames, whatever could remain was certainly no ordinary thing; his face brightened and he hurried over.

When he drew near he finally saw clearly what it was.

It was a feather, about two chi long, not black but radiating a fiery red glow, quietly lying in a corner.

A Luanfeng feather? Yang Kai raised his brow and hurried forward.

He did not dare to grab it rashly; instead he used Golden Blood Threads to draw it to himself.

Surprisingly, the Luanfeng feather was not hot; through the Golden Blood Threads Yang Kai felt no threat, as if it were an ordinary object, but on careful sensing one could detect the peerless ferocity and terrifying power rippling within the feather.

This was a fine treasure!

A Divine Spirit's feather — if handed to an excellent artificer it could certainly be forged into an extraordinary Secret Treasure, perhaps even an Imperial Treasure! After all, this already counted as top-tier forging material.

Yang Kai inspected it for a moment and happily put it away.

This trip to Yuqing Mountain had not been without gain; from Mo Xiaoqi he had obtained the ice-attributed Purple-Green Twin Swords and he had also picked up a Luanfeng feather — compared with the time spent, such gains were exceedingly plentiful.

It was a pity about Mo Xiaoqi...

Yang Kai sighed inwardly, steadied his mood, and flew outward.

His destination was Fenglin City!

Upon entering the Star Realm he had been seized by Kou Wu and forced into the Biyu Sect; he had not had time to savor the many wonders of the Star Realm, so he still looked forward to the nearby Fenglin City.

He was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and the power in his body had not yet fully converted into Origin Qi, so he lacked the qualification to break into the Dao Origin Realm; therefore his immediate task was to convert his power.
