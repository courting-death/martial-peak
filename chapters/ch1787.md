## Chapter 1787 — I Will Follow You All the Way

“That’s right, brat, obediently take out everything you just collected, throw it on the ground, then kneel and kowtow a few times to admit your guilt; I guarantee when the treasure light fades I won’t strike you and will spare your life!” Xu Wei also shouted from the side.

The two Void King Realm experts had never suffered such a loss of face and now hated Yang Kai to the bone, but it comforted them that the Seven Luminaries Divine Light would soon recede; after putting up with Yang Kai for a full half an hour, the moment of reckoning was finally at hand, and both men felt indescribable satisfaction.

Once the Seven Luminaries Divine Light withdrew, what use was Yang Kai’s mastery of Spatial Power?

The moment the two Void King Realm experts unleashed their Domain might, he would be trapped like a bird with its wings clipped!

If they captured Yang Kai, they would not only avenge their humiliation but also claim the Wudao Flower, Questioning Heart Orchid, and Heavenly Infant Grass he had just gathered.

They privately awaited that moment with great anticipation.

“You think you’ve got me?” Yang Kai looked disdainfully at Zi Long, then at Xu Wei. To both men’s surprise, his face showed not the slightest panic but rather a look of absolute confidence, as if he felt no fear at all.

Zi Long frowned, uncertain whether Yang Kai was merely bluffing or truly had some backing.

“Boy, what trick are you scheming now? I advise you to cooperate obediently with me; only then will you have a chance to live.” Xu Wei barked in a deep voice.

“Laughable—how could the world contain an fool like you?” Yang Kai snorted, then, suddenly a little bored, said, “Forget it, I’m too lazy to play with you. The Seven Luminaries Divine Light should be withdrawing soon; I’ll be off first—wait here and take your time!”

Saying that, Yang Kai lightly waved his hand.

“Off first?” Zi Long’s brow creased even deeper, and a terrifying conjecture suddenly rose in his mind: could this brat...

Before the thought finished forming, his eyes widened in astonishment. Staring at Yang Kai’s movement, his face registered utter disbelief; he could hardly trust his own eyes.

He saw Yang Kai turn, take a step into the crack in space, and then his figure vanished.

The brat actually slipped into the spatial fissure!

Zi Long drew in a cold breath!

On the other side, Xu Wei’s mouth gaped open as well. He seemed to want to say something but couldn’t get a word out; the shock on his face was no less than Zi Long’s.

“He, he, he…” Zi Donglai was already babbling incoherently, pointing toward the direction where Yang Kai had disappeared. He couldn’t form a complete sentence for a long time.

“Elder Xu!” After a long moment, Zi Long finally drew a deep breath, his face dark as he said, “It seems we have underestimated his attainment in Spatial Power.”

Xu Wei nodded, his expression grave. “Indeed. To dare charge so recklessly into a spatial rift—this boy’s mastery of Spatial Force may not be unmatched by those who come after, but I fear it’s already beyond any who came before.”

“Elder Xu, I needn’t say it: you also know how terrifying a warrior who masters Spatial Power can be. He is now at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if he finds an opportunity to ascend to the Void King Realm, then in the future…”

“There is no future for him—I'll find a chance here to kill him!” Xu Wei’s face grew hard and vicious.

Zi Long nodded with satisfaction. “If that is so, our personal grudges can be set aside for now. I will also spare no effort to hunt him down and wipe him out in this Lost Realm.”

Both men realized how terrifying Yang Kai might become and trembled inwardly; they would not allow him to continue growing and resolved to end his life within the Lost Realm.

In a few words they reached agreement and temporarily formed an alliance.

At that moment, Zi Donglai, who had not yet calmed, suddenly cried out and pointed behind Xu Wei: “He, he…”

Zi Long was taken aback and turned to look where Xu Wei stood; the next instant his pupils snapped narrow and he shouted, “Danger!”

Hearing the shout, Xu Wei reacted—before he could turn, a voice he both knew and loathed cried out from behind him: “Hahahaha, grandson, Grandpa’s here to teach you a lesson!”

It was Yang Kai!

Xu Wei’s face changed drastically; he never imagined Yang Kai could emerge from the spatial fissure behind him and launch a sudden attack.

A scorching force struck from behind, accompanied by a gust of wind in his ear.

Xu Wei cursed inwardly, fiercely summoned his Saint Yuan, and formed a thick protection over his back; he then spun around to face Yang Kai.

His movement was quick, but Yang Kai was quicker.

Xu Wei’s Saint Yuan had only just been mobilized when he felt a fist strike his back, a punch bearing terrifying power that nearly shattered his protective Saint Yuan.

Fortunately, his cultivation was one realm higher than Yang Kai’s; otherwise, that single punch alone would have been enough to rob him of all fighting ability.

Even so, the blow was not easy to take—Xu Wei felt his qi and blood churn in his chest, his face paled, and his body staggered forward.

And just a short distance ahead was the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, the very thing everyone avoided as though it were a deadly plague!

“Oh no!” Xu Wei cried out, cold sweat pouring down; he didn’t hesitate—he directly released his Void King Realm Domain Field, bit his tongue to draw Essence-Blood, and stomped his feet hard on the ground.

In an instant his feet plunged three zhang into the earth, and his forward motion came to an abrupt halt.

Hissss……

A piercing noise rang out as Xu Wei’s face filled with despair.

Though his reaction had been swift and all his actions reasonable, he still could not fully stop his forward momentum; one arm was grazed by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light and searing pain shot through it. Before long the flesh on that arm was corroded away at frightening speed, leaving bare white bone and exposed meridians.

That was not all—Yang Kai, standing behind him, had already launched a second strike.

Sensing Yang Kai’s murderous intent, Xu Wei flew into a rage and gritted his teeth, shouting, “Boy, do not underestimate me!”

As he spoke, his body burst with dazzling radiance; with sizzling sounds, waves of terrifying energy shot out from every pore on his body.

Yang Kai’s face instantly turned solemn—he realized Xu Wei was risking everything and could not press the attack. He quickly withdrew, and deployed his Golden Blood Threads to form a blood-shield in front of him.

Clang, clang, clang… a series of impacts rang out as Yang Kai was struck by successive waves of force that disrupted his qi and blood.

He looked at the near Xu Wei, gave a faint cold snort, ceased his assault, and drifted backward in a leap, falling into the spatial fissure behind Xu Wei.

Just as his figure was about to disappear, his cold words reached the ears of Zi Long and Zi Donglai: “I will hide in the fissure and follow all the way—gentlemen, you surely won’t be too lonely.”

Hearing those words, Zi Donglai shivered involuntarily, his soles cramped; the next moment he immediately turned and stared hard at the spatial fissure behind him with eyes wide.

As if terrified Yang Kai might suddenly leap out from it again.

Yang Kai’s presence had become his complete nightmare!

“Ah…” Xu Wei’s scream rang out; in that instant the Seven Luminaries Divine Light’s terrifying corrosion had eaten through half his arm and was rapidly spreading toward his shoulder.

He gritted his teeth, his face contorted, frantically using his Saint Yuan to resist the damage inflicted by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

But however he strove, he found it was all in vain.

Seeing matters grow ever worse, Xu Wei made a grim decision and slashed at his own shoulder.

The severed arm fell to the ground, and a spray of fresh blood burst from his shoulder.

Waves of excruciating pain hit him; Xu Wei’s face went deathly pale and his body swayed. He immediately reorganized his power to staunch the bleeding and shoved several Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring into his mouth.

He didn’t even dare to sit cross-legged to refine them—he turned at once and, like Zi Donglai, kept a wary eye on the spatial fissure behind him to prevent Yang Kai from striking again.

Though Yang Kai’s sneak attack hadn’t killed him, it had crippled one of his arms—still a noteworthy result.

The atmosphere was as heavy as iron; Xu Wei and Zi Donglai alike dared not draw a breath, their minds strained to the utmost.

Even Zi Long did not relax in the slightest, and he split off Divine Sense to watch the situation behind the spatial fissure...

Time had never passed so slowly.

When the sounds of drawing breath came from the depths of Medicine Valley and the Seven Luminaries Divine Light receded like a tide, Zi Donglai finally exhaled hard as if pardoned and at once left the fissure’s vicinity to reach a relatively safe spot.

Xu Wei did likewise.

He would be haunted by that bite for a lifetime—glancing at a spatial fissure made him feel as if some loathsome creature might pop out and ambush him at any moment.

But... even though the Seven Luminaries Divine Light had withdrawn and the immediate threat of Yang Kai’s ambush was gone, Xu Wei’s crisis was not over.

He stood there pale as paper, watching Zi Long not far off with vigilance; his Saint Yuan silently coalesced as he assumed a posture ready to flee at any moment.

Although he and Zi Long had just reached a temporary accord to cooperate against Yang Kai, he had not forgotten the hatred between the Abandoned Nest and Purple Star, nor the gap in their positions and cultivation.

If Zi Long struck him now, Xu Wei reckoned his odds of survival would be slim.

At his prime he might have hoped to escape death at Zi Long’s hands, but in his present state... it was difficult!

“Elder Xu, I advise you not to think of running!” Zi Long said coolly. “You should know something of my Purple Qi Long River Technique; with my methods, you are not in a position to resist.”

Xu Wei let out a wretched laugh, cursing furiously in his heart—truly, the more one fears something, the more certain it is to happen.

Zi Long clearly intended to strike while his opponent was down; he had no intention of letting Xu Wei walk away—if he tried to flee, Zi Long would certainly act.
