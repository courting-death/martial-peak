## Chapter 826 — Maggots That Cling to Bone

Only after running for dozens of Li did Yang Kai gradually relax.

He hadn’t even caught his breath when his face suddenly changed. He snapped his head toward one direction. There, within a gray shroud of mist, a handkerchief‑like Secret Treasure was streaking toward him. As it spun, the exotic beasts emblazoned on it seemed to come alive, roaring in unison as they charged out, ferocious and surging.

Hot on the handkerchief’s heels, a rainbow streak flared. The keen aura pressed so hard that the hairs all over Yang Kai’s body stood on end.

He didn’t dare be careless. He hurriedly cast the Vast Heaven Shield—one of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.

A shield of dazzling gold swiftly took shape before him.

The beasts pouring from the handkerchief couldn’t stop their charge and slammed into the Vast Heaven Shield one after another, each bursting into motes of light and vanishing.

The rainbow streak that followed struck the Vast Heaven Shield dead‑on with a crisp ring and was bounced back.

The Vast Heaven Shield shattered at the same time. Yang Kai grunted, then looked grimly toward the source of the attack.

There, Zhang Ao laughed aloud. “Brat, you still dare show yourself? Heaven itself helps me!”

Cao Guan caught the rainbow light in his hand; it resolved into a resplendent longsword. Wu Jie hovered like a specter behind the two, wordlessly sizing Yang Kai up.

The three had thought there was no hope of capturing Yang Kai this time and were about to withdraw and make plans—when Yang Kai swaggered right out of the Nine Peaks.

Overjoyed, they struck at once, intent on subduing him in one go.

What they hadn’t expected was that even without borrowing the Nine Peaks’ power, Yang Kai blocked Zhang Ao’s and Cao Guan’s first wave without a scratch.

Only then did they realize everyone had underestimated Yang Kai’s own strength.

“Let’s see where you run now! This place is a hundred Li from your Nine Peaks. Even if you want to beg that Great Yao Lord for help, it’s impossible,” Cao Guan crowed.

“You’re really a pain,” Yang Kai said, staring at the three with open impatience.

He hadn’t expected them to dare linger here.

He had assumed that after the yao struck, they would slink back to their sects and hole up. Who’d have thought that after everyone else had left, these three forces would still be here, waiting by the stump for a rabbit.

Three in the Saint Realm—one of them at Second Stage. Yang Kai didn’t rate himself their match. At his current realm and with his methods, at most he could trade blows with a First Stage Saint—and not necessarily win.

There seemed to be an essential difference between the Saint Realm and the Transcendent Realm. After all he’d seen and experienced, Yang Kai had sensed as much.

Still, it wasn’t realistic for them to capture him, either. So he stood there calm and unafraid.

“Heh, brat, the road to heaven you wouldn’t take; the gate of hell you barge through. Submit quietly and you’ll suffer less,” Zhang Ao said coldly. As he spoke, his Divine Sense seeped toward Yang Kai without a sound, trying to shake his mind and sap his will to fight.

Yang Kai stood unmoving, letting Zhang Ao’s Divine Sense drift over him like a spring breeze.

Zhang Ao’s face tightened. Something was off. The boy before him—only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm—seemed to have become a bottomless black hole. No matter how he sent out his Divine Sense, he couldn’t probe the depth.

“And you think the likes of you can take me?” Yang Kai laughed, as if the three weren’t even worth his notice. “Go on, try it—see if you can catch me.”

“Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!” Cao Guan snarled. “Work with us now and we won’t treat you badly. If we have to catch you, don’t expect courtesy.”

“Come, then. If you fail to catch me this time, wait to be exterminated by my hand,” Yang Kai said, face hard, patience spent. These maggots that cling to bone were insufferably clingy and put him in a foul mood.

Inwardly, he swore that once he grew strong, he would kill all three of them.

“You won’t get the chance,” Zhang Ao snapped. The handkerchief‑like Secret Treasure suddenly exuded boundless suction. The space around Yang Kai turned sticky like a quagmire; even space itself wavered and warped, like the moon in water or a flower in a mirror—subtly unreal.

Zhang Ao wore a look of utter certainty. No matter how capable Yang Kai was, there was no breaking free of his bind.

Yang Kai only sneered, a cold gleam in his eyes, standing stock‑still.

The suction surged. The handkerchief swelled and wrapped over Yang Kai in a split second, sealing him tight.

Delighted, Cao Guan laughed and started forward.

But Zhang Ao snorted. The handkerchief flashed back to him. After a careful probe, his face turned dark.

The Yang Kai who should have been bundled inside was nowhere to be found. It was empty!

“Looks like he ran long ago,” Wu Jie said in an eerie tone, ghost‑fire dancing in his eyes—the first words he’d spoken.

“Ran?” Zhang Ao’s eyes bulged. “When?”

“About when you struck... heh heh. The Nine Heavens Divine Technique—I’ve seen it now. That footwork is extraordinarily fast.” Wu Jie turned his head and looked in a certain direction.

Following his gaze, Zhang Ao and Cao Guan sent out their Divine Sense—and sure enough, they sensed Yang Kai’s aura over ten Li away. He was fleeing at a speed beyond common sense. Even Zhang Ao and Cao Guan blanched.

Because that speed already rivaled a Saint’s.

No wonder the boy hadn’t panicked—he had his crutch.

“Even to the ends of the earth, I’ll catch you. Don’t think you can slip my palm,” Zhang Ao spat. His figure blurred and vanished.

Cao Guan hurried after him.

Wu Jie stood quietly for a moment, an intrigued look crossing his corpse‑pale face. Then he turned into a wash of green mist and shot away like lightning.

As he ran, Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense to track the three behind him, his expression growing ever more grim.

He’d never been chased like this. He wasn’t afraid of them, but it was infuriating. As he flew, he searched for chances to shake them off.

But the three were Saints. Shaking them for good was fiendishly hard.

Time passed. Yang Kai didn’t know how far he’d run. Now and then he managed to lose them for a short while, but before long they were back again—maggots clinging to bone, maddeningly persistent.

He couldn’t imagine what method they were using to lock onto his direction so precisely and keep up the chase.

Only now did he realize he had underestimated how the Sacred Land’s inheritance tempted those three. That inheritance—power at the cost of lifespan—was nothing he coveted, but others’ eyes were green with envy.

Originally, Yang Kai had intended to fly toward Tianxiao Sect. As long as he returned there, if the three dared pursue, none of them would return.

But after flying for a while, he lost his bearings and no longer knew which way Tianxiao Sect lay. All he could do was take it one step at a time, smoldering with frustration.

This day, as he sped along, Yang Kai suddenly halted and stared ahead.

Ahead, an unusual aura slowly gathered, setting his nerves on alert.

Moments later, the aura suddenly thickened. Before his eyes, emerald mist appeared out of nowhere. In the next instant, a man in black robes, his whole body wreathed in green miasma, appeared bizarrely.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. He stared hard at the newcomer, gaze sharp, and barked, “Wu Jie?”

He had no idea what sort of divine technique the Netherworld Sect’s leader had used—how he had appeared before him in the blink of an eye. Such uncanny methods were beyond Yang Kai’s comprehension.

The man, however, looked exhausted. His already ghastly face was paper‑white; he panted for breath, and the True Yuan in his body fluctuated wildly.

Yang Kai immediately sent out his Divine Sense. Confirming there was no danger within range, he shouted, “Court of Divine Battle!”

White light flared. A mysterious force burst from Yang Kai’s body and yanked out Wu Jie’s Spirit Body before he could react.

“Hey—” Wu Jie cried in alarm. Then his vision swam—and the next moment he realized his Spirit Body had left his Sea of Consciousness and now stood in a world of endless white without sky or earth.

Not far away, Yang Kai’s Spirit Body stared at him with a hard look.

The Court of Divine Battle was a Saint‑Grade Secret Treasure Yang Kai and An Ling’er had obtained together in an ancient ruin beneath the sea. This was the first time Yang Kai had used it.

Its function was unusual: it could forcibly draw out an enemy’s Spirit Body and compel a battle of Divine Senses.

There was a drawback, though. When used, Yang Kai’s Spirit Body would also enter within.

The other man was a First Stage Saint. Knowing his fleshly cultivation couldn’t match him, Yang Kai hadn’t hesitated—he had used the Court of Divine Battle to end things quickly.

Battle‑fire burned in Yang Kai’s eyes. He wanted to know whether his Divine Sense could now truly stand against a Saint’s.

And this was the perfect proving ground.

Sensing his intent, Wu Jie hastily raised a hand. “Boy, don’t be rash. I didn’t come to fight.”

Yang Kai frowned and gave a cold little laugh. “At this point, what’s the point of that?”

“You don’t believe me?” Wu Jie looked at him in amusement. “If I meant you harm, I wouldn’t have appeared like this. You can feel it—I’ve burned through my strength. I’m far from my peak.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and stared at him, Divine Sense circling as he watched for any tell, wanting to see if he spoke truth or lies.
