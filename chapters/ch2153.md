## Chapter 2153 — The Temple Appears

Seeing him so sensible, Xiao Chen dropped his stern expression and instead smiled, asking, “Let me ask you, how long have you all been here?”

Jing Li replied, “We arrived a little before you, sir…”

“Then did you see where those things that fell from the sky earlier went?”

“It seems they all fell into that Golden Cloud and disappeared!” Jing Li said, pointing at the rolling Golden Cloud in the sky.

“They fell in there?” Xiao Chen looked up, his brows furrowing.

With his cultivation and Divine Sense, he could naturally sense the unusual energy hidden within that Golden Cloud, though he had no idea what kind of mysteries it concealed.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but look troubled, glancing at Lan Xun and saying, “Princess, what do you think…”

Lan Xun’s elegant brows knitted slightly. After a moment, she said, “Let’s wait and see what happens.”

Though dozens of Star Seals had fallen into the Golden Cloud, rushing in to investigate without knowing its nature would be courting disaster. Even someone like Wuchang didn’t dare act rashly—clearly, being the first bird to stick its head out wasn’t so easy.

While Xiao Chen was asking questions, Yang Kai had been listening intently, so he naturally heard Jing Li’s answer. At this moment, he glanced at Kou Wu for confirmation, and the latter nodded slightly, indicating that Jing Li was telling the truth.

During the time everyone was hesitating, quite a few people had already arrived from all directions. Most had been nearby and were drawn here by the strange phenomenon of the Star Seals falling.

There had originally been only a dozen or so people, but in just a short while, the number had suddenly increased to more than twenty…

With so many people, some martial artists naturally became wary, glancing around cautiously and making the atmosphere tense and strange.

However, this situation didn’t last long.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, a buzzing sound suddenly came from the rolling Golden Cloud in the sky. The sound was incredibly loud, as if something was being reborn from within the cloud. All the martial artists present tensed up and stared intently.

Golden light burst forth, and the Golden Cloud writhed. Suddenly, a vague, gigantic shadow emerged from the golden radiance.

The instant that colossal shadow surfaced, a solemn and awe-inspiring aura surged forth, sweeping over everyone. It seemed born of the very void itself, slowly unveiling its true form.

With its appearance, the Golden Cloud in the sky continued to twist and change, gradually dissipating.

In a short while, the outline of that giant shadow finally became clear.

“What is that…”

“T-this… is a palace?”

“How could there be a palace here, and it even appeared out of thin air!”

“Hahaha, I know! I know what this is… The Time Temple, you fools! This is definitely the legendary Time Temple!”

“Time Temple? What’s that?”

Not everyone present knew the secret of the Time Temple. Some martial artists from small sects and families had never even heard of it. Only those from long-standing great forces had records of the Time Temple in their sect’s ancient texts, and before their disciples entered, their elders would explain these secrets so they would be on guard.

Yang Kai even suspected that Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were deliberately operating in this area just to search for traces of the Time Temple.

Even Wuchang, Lan Xun, and the others were likely here for the same reason. Otherwise, how could they have all gathered here by coincidence?

Whether the palace that had appeared in the Golden Cloud and now revealed its outline was truly the legendary Time Temple, no one knew, but Yang Kai felt that it almost certainly was.

After all, the location marked on the map Hua Qingsi had given him was roughly here.

He just hadn’t expected that the Time Temple would be hidden in the void and would appear in such a dramatic fashion, with dozens of Star Seals falling beforehand to point the way.

With things like this, there would be even more competitors.

As these thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, he suddenly sensed someone looking at him. He couldn’t help but glance at Bian Yuqing and say, “Is there something on my face?”

Bian Yuqing snorted coldly and said, “You must know something about the Time Temple, right?”

Yang Kai pursed his lips at her words.

Bian Yuqing said, “Go on, it’s not like it’ll cost you anything!”

“It may not cost me anything, but why should I tell you?” Yang Kai sneered at her.

Bian Yuqing pouted in annoyance and said, “So your wings have grown hard now that you’re strong, huh… What are you after?” As she spoke, she suddenly looked at Yang Kai warily, crossing her arms over her chest. “You’re not up to something, are you?”

“If you weren’t so annoying, we could actually have a decent conversation!” Yang Kai shot her a sidelong glance.

Bian Yuqing was so angry she looked like she might explode.

Kou Wu, standing to the side, laughed and said, “Junior Brother Yang, if it’s convenient, could you tell us about the Time Temple? Protector Bian and I really don’t know anything about it…”

Yang Kai frowned and said, “Since Senior Brother Kou put it that way, I suppose it’s fine to tell you! But let’s be clear—after this, we’ll truly owe each other nothing, and from now on, we’ll go our separate ways!”

“Why are you so wary of us?” Bian Yuqing asked angrily. She could sense that ever since they’d met again, Yang Kai had been on guard against her and Kou Wu, as if he couldn’t wait to get away from them.

“You wouldn’t understand even if I told you!” Yang Kai glanced at her, then grew serious and said, “I don’t know much about the Time Temple, only that it was the palace of the Great Emperor of Time. In fact, the Four Seasons Land itself was created because of the Great Emperor of Time…”

“The Great Emperor of Time!” Bian Yuqing’s expression changed slightly. From her reaction, it was clear she’d heard of this Great Emperor.

Yang Kai nodded and then explained everything he knew. In truth, there wasn’t much to say, because even knowing these things, no one could say for sure what was hidden inside the Time Temple. There might be opportunities, or there might be deadly traps…

“So, it seems… those missing Star Seals must have fallen into the Time Temple!” Bian Yuqing speculated.

“That’s for sure.” Yang Kai grinned. “Maybe it was the fall of the Star Seals that triggered the temple’s appearance—otherwise, it might never have shown up!”

“Junior Brother Yang, you mean the fall of the Star Seals was the key… If not for that, we’d never have found the Time Temple?” Kou Wu asked.

Yang Kai nodded, his face growing excited. “But now, not only are there all sorts of treasures left behind by the Great Emperor of Time in the Time Temple, there are also Star Seals… Who could possibly ignore that?”

As they spoke, the Golden Cloud in the sky had almost completely vanished, replaced by a grand and imposing palace. Even from a great distance, one could feel the ancient and majestic aura of the hall—it was like a slumbering ancient beast slowly awakening.

At a certain moment, the palace finally became fully visible, and with a rumbling sound, it settled completely in the void.

Whoosh…

The sound of something breaking through the air rang out, and two figures shot forward almost simultaneously. It was none other than Wuchang and Luo Yuan, who had been waiting for this moment. These two were both bold and skilled, so they charged ahead without hesitation!

As soon as those two moved, the other martial artists couldn’t hold back either, and all of them used their movement techniques to fly up into the sky.

Yang Kai was among them. As he’d said, no one knew if there were opportunities hidden in the Time Temple, but there were definitely dozens of Star Seals inside. That alone was enough to drive people mad.

From the ground, the Time Temple hadn’t seemed that large, but the closer they got, the more they felt its grandeur. Everyone flew at full speed, and it still took a full quarter of an hour to reach the front of the hall.

The outside of the hall was wrapped in a layer of golden light, and at the very center, a plaque hung overhead with the word “Time” written on it!

The word was written in a wild, flowing script, and seemed to contain an incredibly profound power. Just one glance made people feel dizzy, as if time itself was slipping away.

After just a glance, Yang Kai was startled and quickly looked away.

But someone else wasn’t so lucky.

No one knew which sect this martial artist came from, but he was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. He’d been flying forward just fine, but at a certain moment, his gaze was completely drawn to the two characters on the plaque, unable to look away.

Visibly, his black hair rapidly turned white and then drifted away in the wind until it was all gone. At the same time, his once-robust body quickly withered. In less than ten breaths, he shriveled into skin and bones, and his face, which had looked about thirty, became covered in deep wrinkles.

It was as if a thousand years had passed over him in that brief moment.

The terrifying thing was, he never noticed a thing. He just kept staring at the word “Time” on the plaque, letting the power of time erode his mind and body, even wearing a strange smile.

Halfway there, his life force faded away, and he fell straight down.

After a while, the sound of him hitting the ground could be heard…

Everyone’s faces changed dramatically.

With that as a warning, no one dared look at the plaque again, for fear of being caught off guard. This was the supreme power left behind by a Great Emperor—once a Dao Origin Realm martial artist was trapped, there was no escape.

Boom, boom, boom…

At that moment, Wuchang and Luo Yuan, who had been the first to arrive, reached the front of the hall. But as soon as their bodies touched the golden light outside the hall, they were blocked by an invisible force and couldn’t enter.

The two of them tried several times, but the result was the same. Furious, they both attacked the golden light.

Two loud bangs rang out, and their even fiercer attacks were reflected back by the golden light, sending Wuchang and Luo Yuan staggering backward, their faces filled with shock.

Even these two experts suffered minor injuries as a result…

“Haha, what good is running fast? You’ve been blocked all the same!” Seeing this, Xiao Chen, who had arrived close behind, laughed aloud.

Wuchang’s face darkened as he glared at Xiao Chen and said, “If you’ve got the guts, why don’t you go in and show me?”

Xiao Chen smiled faintly and shook his head. “If even Brother Wuchang can’t get in, how could I? I’ll save my strength.”
