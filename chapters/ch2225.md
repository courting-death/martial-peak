## Chapter 2225 — Captured

The woman transformed from the divine deer gazed at Yang Kai, gently parting her red lips as she said, “Young Master, it’s time to go home.”

Yang Kai remained motionless and silent, knowing she wasn’t actually speaking to him.

Behind him, the Purple Civet rustled about, poking out its little head and resting it on Yang Kai’s shoulder, staring at the woman.

The woman pressed her lips into a smile and said, “Don’t be afraid. Although the Lord is very angry this time, he said that as long as you obediently come home with us, he’ll let you off and won’t punish you.”

The Purple Civet opened its mouth and let out a few incomprehensible cries. In any case, Yang Kai didn’t understand a word.

“Still trying to bargain?” Yuan Fei’s eyes widened at these words. As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves, looking ready for a fight, and said, “Bai Lu, don’t stop me this time. I have to teach him a lesson!”

As he spoke, he really looked like he was about to rush over and give the Purple Civet a good beating.

The Purple Civet was so frightened it quickly shrank its head back, clutching Yang Kai’s back with its two paws, trembling all over.

By now, Yang Kai had completely figured out what was going on.

The Purple Civet he had run into by chance clearly had a significant background. To find it, two Emperor Realm demonic beasts had been dispatched, and judging by how they addressed the Purple Civet, the little creature seemed to be the offspring of a ruler of Heavenly Yao Mountain.

That ruler… was most likely the master of Heavenly Yao Mountain!

Yang Kai was deeply shaken.

Over there, Bai Lu and Yuan Fei played good cop and bad cop with practiced ease, clearly not their first time at this. They had already scared the little Purple Civet out of its wits.

Seeing Yuan Fei really about to charge over, Bai Lu hurriedly called out, “Young Master, come to me quickly, big sister will protect you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Kai felt the weight on his back lighten.

The Purple Civet had turned into a streak of purple light, darting straight into Bai Lu’s embrace. It curled up between her arms, poking out its little head and watching Yuan Fei warily.

“He fell for it…” Yang Kai looked utterly speechless.

At that moment, Yuan Fei also stopped in his tracks, glaring fiercely at the Purple Civet and threatening, “Don’t let me catch you, or I’ll skin you alive!”

Hearing this, the Purple Civet clung even tighter to Bai Lu’s arms, not daring to leave, and even stuck out its tongue at Yuan Fei in a cheeky manner.

“This is the eleventh time!” Bai Lu looked at the Purple Civet with helplessness and said, “Young Master, you can’t do this again next time. There are many dangers outside…”

At this point, she glanced at Yang Kai, intentionally or not, and continued, “The Lord also said that once you grow a little more, you’ll be allowed out. Just wait a bit longer.”

Held in warm arms by a gentle beauty, the little Purple Civet naturally nodded its head like a pecking chick, looking utterly obedient.

“When you get back, you must apologize to the Lord, or no one will be able to save you!” Bai Lu added.

The Purple Civet, of course, obeyed her every word.

Only then did the two Emperor Realm demonic beasts exchange a glance, understanding each other without a word.

“Alright, the Young Master’s matter is settled, so…” Yuan Fei’s gaze turned cold as he looked at Yang Kai and shouted, “Boy, who gave you the guts to come to the depths of Heavenly Yao Mountain?!”

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn. He quickly cupped his fists and said, “Senior, I was being hunted and had nowhere else to run, so I ended up here. If I have offended, I hope Senior…”

“Enough!” Yuan Fei had no intention of listening to Yang Kai’s explanation. Waving his hand, he shouted angrily, “It seems you humans have forgotten the Heavenly Yao Pact from years ago!”

“Heavenly Yao Pact?” Yang Kai frowned.

He was only here to temper himself in the Divine Roaming World, not a native martial artist, so how could he know about any Heavenly Yao Pact? He had never even heard of it before.

“You really have forgotten!” Yuan Fei’s face turned cold and furious. “Humans truly are untrustworthy. In that case, let this Lord send you on your way!”

As soon as he finished, he surged his power, and Imperial Might instantly filled the air.

His Imperial Might was completely different from Ban Qing’s—where Ban Qing’s was soft and lingering, his was fierce and domineering, making Yang Kai feel there was no way to dodge or resist, as if he would be crushed to dust beneath it.

“Zhi zhi…” Just then, the Purple Civet hiding in Bai Lu’s arms suddenly cried out anxiously, waving its little paws at Yuan Fei, its expression urgent.

“Hm?” Yuan Fei paused, his anger subsiding a bit as he looked Yang Kai up and down suspiciously. “You saved the Young Master’s life?”

Yang Kai immediately understood—the Purple Civet must have told them about their earlier encounter. Without hesitation, he nodded. “It was a coincidence.”

Yuan Fei frowned, looking troubled.

In his view, any human daring to come here should be killed without question, since it was humans who broke the Heavenly Yao Pact first.

But this human had actually saved the Young Master’s life, which put him in a difficult position.

If he didn’t kill him, it would go against his own wishes; if he did, it would put the Young Master in an awkward spot, and if the Lord found out, he’d surely be scolded.

He scratched his head in frustration and looked to Bai Lu for help.

Bai Lu also frowned slightly. After a moment’s thought, she said, “Saving the Young Master is a great merit, but… Junior, I see many traces of demonic beast origins in your body. Along the way, you must have killed quite a few demonic beasts, right?”

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. He had no idea how she could tell, but lying now would do no good. He could only nod. “Yes!”

“The demonic beasts you killed are subjects of Heavenly Yao Mountain. That is a grave disrespect to Heavenly Yao Mountain, a crime you cannot escape!”

“Then I’ll kill him!” Yuan Fei’s killing intent surged instantly.

Bai Lu waved her hand, stopping him. “There are merits and faults—let the Lord decide how to handle it!”

“Fine!” Yuan Fei nodded.

With that, he reached out to Yang Kai without warning and pulled him forward with a sudden force.

Yang Kai immediately felt a powerful force pulling him forward. Thinking quickly, he didn’t resist, but let himself be captured by Yuan Fei.

In this situation, turning hostile with these two Emperor Realms would only bring disaster. Even if Yang Kai could escape under their noses, where could he go?

Judging by Bai Lu’s earlier words and actions, she didn’t seem unreasonable. Since he had saved the Purple Civet, he felt he shouldn’t be in mortal danger.

At worst, he’d just be imprisoned in Heavenly Yao Mountain for a while. Once the time was up, he could return to the outside world.

Even as he was seized, Yang Kai didn’t forget to speak up. “I have something to report to you both!”

“Spit it out!” Yuan Fei barked.

“As far as I know, someone named Zhou Dian has entered Heavenly Yao Mountain with many experts, searching the mountain…”

“Zhou Dian?” Yuan Fei and Bai Lu’s faces changed dramatically, exclaiming in shock. This name clearly struck fear in them.

Yuan Fei immediately pulled Yang Kai in front of him, glaring as he asked, “Are you sure Zhou Dian is here?”

“I haven’t seen him myself, but… I ran into someone named Ban Qing. I heard about Zhou Dian from him.”

“You met that bastard Ban Qing?” Yuan Fei’s eyes widened.

Bai Lu said gravely, “If Ban Qing is here, Zhou Dian must be too. The other three are probably with him… What are they looking for?”

The last question was directed at Yang Kai.

“It seems they’re searching for some Calamity Stars. I’m not too sure,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Calamity Stars?” Bai Lu frowned.

Yuan Fei looked at Yang Kai in astonishment. “You met Ban Qing and still survived?”

“I’m pretty good at running away!” Yang Kai replied with an awkward laugh.

Yuan Fei looked him up and down a few times, unsure whether to believe him. Meanwhile, the Purple Civet in Bai Lu’s arms rolled its eyes mischievously at Yang Kai, but didn’t expose him.

“Whether what you say is true or not, this must be reported to the Lord at once. Yuan Fei, take him and let’s go!” Bai Lu called out, then immediately turned and sped off in a certain direction.

Yuan Fei carried Yang Kai and followed closely behind.

“Senior… I can walk on my own,” Yang Kai said, feeling awkward at being carried like this by Yuan Fei, and quickly offered the suggestion.

Yuan Fei glanced at him but said nothing, simply letting go.

Yang Kai had no intention of running away, instead urging his strength to keep up with the two.

The two experts seemed intent on testing whether Yang Kai was really good at escaping, so they moved faster and faster, not accommodating him at all.

Yet Yang Kai pushed himself to keep up, not falling too far behind, which made the two click their tongues in surprise.

…

Somewhere in Heavenly Yao Mountain, Zhou Dian still sat astride the Nine-Resonance Kui Dragon Beast, looking imposing as he gazed deeply in a certain direction, a powerful fighting spirit surging from him, almost tangible.

Around him, four or five experts were scattered nearby.

These experts formed a circle around an open space, where many people sat on the ground with grim faces.

Although these people weren’t physically restrained, the energy within their bodies was suppressed to the extreme, and each bore a sealing mark that blocked their abilities.

They were all martial artists training in Heavenly Yao Mountain, now captured by Zhou Dian’s subordinates.

Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and Shen Muji were among them.

The three didn’t dare to communicate, only exchanging glances to pass on secret messages.

It was truly unfortunate. They had only come to the Divine Roaming World to train, never expecting something like this. After splitting up, the three had been hunting lone demonic beasts in Heavenly Yao Mountain, absorbing Divine Soul Origin to strengthen themselves.

But several Emperor Realm experts had suddenly descended from the sky, capturing them without a word and bringing them here to be sealed.
