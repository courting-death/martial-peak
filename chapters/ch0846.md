## Chapter 846 — He Really Gave It

The tinkling, bell‑like laughter of Senior Aunt Fei Yu came from behind, wildly unrestrained.

Yang Kai was mortified; he had been so absorbed in grasping the true meaning of the space‑rending technique that he hadn’t even noticed his clothes turning to dust in that void storm.

No wonder Fei Yu had been looking at him strangely.

He popped his head up from the deep pool beneath the waterfall, wiped the water from his face, and called out, “Senior Aunt, if you see something like that next time, could you tell me earlier?”

Fei Yu poked her little head over the waterfall, laughing so hard she rocked back and forth, and replied, “What’s the big deal? I’m much older than you — you’re not supposed to be shy, are you?”

Yang Kai ducked his head back into the deep pool, leaving only his two eyes visible.

There was nothing he could do about this Senior Aunt; and since she outranked him in seniority, if some other woman had teased him like this, Yang Kai would have given her a lesson long ago, shown her that some men shouldn’t be trifled with.

But she just happened to be his Senior Aunt...

“What sort of closed‑door training were you doing to get yourself so wounded?” Fei Yu’s expression turned serious as she asked with concern.

She had seen clearly the dried blood on his exposed skin — he had clearly lost a lot of blood.

“I accidentally ended up like this...” Yang Kai answered weakly.

Once she was certain he was not seriously hurt, Fei Yu relaxed, laughed some more, and then descended the mountain.

Yang Kai washed in the deep pool for a long time and put on a brand‑new set of clothes.

Back in the cave, Fei Yu wore a teasing smile, staring at Yang Kai until he felt utterly ashamed.

“By the way, do you want to go see Elder Du? While you were away he kept sending Mi Na over to inquire about you — he seems quite concerned,” Fei Yu said suddenly.

“Oh. I should go see him.” Yang Kai nodded. “Since I’m fine, I’ll go now.”

“Mm, the sooner you go the sooner you’ll return!” Fei Yu waved, aware he felt awkward around her and didn’t stop him.

“I might have to stay over there a while; there are some alchemical matters I need to consult Elder Du about.”

Fei Yu glanced at him and scoffed, “Suit yourself. Don’t disappear for years like last time!”

She thought Yang Kai was using an excuse to live away temporarily, but in truth Yang Kai did have alchemical questions he wanted to ask Elder Du.

His alchemical attainments were now quite high, almost matching Du Wan, and combined with the exquisite spirit formations he could set, he was in no way inferior to Du Wan when it came to refining pills.

Yet Du Wan had long immersed himself in this line and had accumulated his own unique insights and experiences.

Those things required time to accumulate and settle — things Yang Kai could not obtain, which made them especially precious.

To free the Ancient Demon Clan from the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai’s pillcraft still lacked a touch of mastery; he wanted to raise his alchemy as quickly as possible and then go to the Endless Snow Mountain to free the Ancient Demon Clan.

With that clan as his power and backing, Yang Kai could accomplish many things a lone man could not.

After bidding farewell to Fei Yu, Yang Kai left the Tianxiao Sect and flew toward Giant Stone City.

He arrived after roughly two hours.

Once there, Yang Kai was surprised to find the city much livelier than before; many of the passersby were foreign warriors, though he had no idea what they were doing.

Yang Kai shrugged off the others and headed straight for the Alchemists' Association.

As he reached the Association, a young girl barreled toward him — only fourteen or fifteen years old, with twin ponytails, fresh and appealing.

She was still too young and not fully grown, but you could see she had the makings of a beauty; petite and charming, her chest like two small buns.

The girl planted herself in front of Yang Kai, arms outstretched to block him, and looked up: “Who are you, barging in like that?”

Yang Kai stared and sized her up; despite her age her cultivation was impressive — even surpassing Sun Yu of the Dragon‑Phoenix Palace back then. She possessed the power of Ninth Stage True Yuan.

“Who are you?” Yang Kai asked in return.

There should have been only three people inside the Alchemists' Association: Du Wan, Mi Na, and Mi Na’s master Ye Xiong.

When did a girl like this appear?

“Who are you to ask?” she sniffed, displeased. “Don’t you know this is the Alchemists' Association? Outsiders aren’t allowed to barge in.”

“Outsider...” Yang Kai was left speechless; the girl was small but she spoke with no small degree of arrogance.

“Hmph, you’re here to ask Elder Du and Master Ye to refine pills for you, right? If you want pills, come back in a month — both masters’ schedules are full,” she presumptuously guessed.

“So busy?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Of course. Lately many people have come asking the two masters to refine pills.” The girl beamed as if those people were her clients, her bright eyes shifting before she added, “But if the pill you want isn’t high‑grade, I can refine it for you.”

“You can refine pills too?” Yang Kai looked down at her, suddenly amused.

“Of course I can. Don’t underestimate me — I’m a Lower‑Level Mystery‑Grade alchemist!”

“Oh? That’s impressive.” Yang Kai genuinely praised her. At such a young age already a Lower‑Level Mystery‑Grade alchemist, and he hadn’t seen her a few years ago, meaning she had been here at most three to five years — likely Du Wan or Ye Xiong had found a promising talent and trained her.

To reach Lower‑Level Mystery‑Grade in three to five years, her aptitude had to be quite extraordinary.

Hearing Yang Kai’s praise, the girl’s face lit up and she no longer looked so hostile; she giggled, “So? Let me refine your pills. My success rate is eighty percent!”

“Eighty percent — not bad. How much will you charge?” Yang Kai stroked his chin and asked.

“I won’t take your fee!” she quickly answered. “Elder Du and Master Ye said I should practice more now, so I must seize every chance... Well, if you insist on paying, Wu'er won’t refuse. Refining is hard work — every time I refine I’m drenched in sweat!”

Yang Kai laughed: “Your name is Wu'er, right?”

“Mm.”

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then began taking out from the Black Book Space a number of Heaven‑Grade and Mystery‑Grade lower‑level medicinal materials and handed them over.

The materials weren’t high grade and were useless for him now, so they were perfect for the girl to practice with and improve her technique.

Yang Kai still remembered how much trouble he had gone through collecting herbs when he first learned alchemy.

Wu'er’s eyes brightened as she accepted the materials and stowed them into her Spatial Pouch, clearly delighted.

“Just refine one hundred Spirit-Linking Pills for me,” Yang Kai requested after providing the herbs.

“Alright. This much should be enough.” Wu'er agreed happily. “But one hundred will take some time — come back in a month and I’ll give you the pills!”

“Fine.” Yang Kai nodded seriously, then took out some Crystal Stones. “This is your payment!”

“You actually gave them...” Wu'er shyly looked Yang Kai over, twirling the edge of her floral dress — she wanted them but felt embarrassed, hesitating.

“Refining takes time and effort; you deserve reward.”

“Then... Wu'er won’t be impolite.” She accepted the Crystal Stones with a beaming face, instantly finding this young man kinder than Elder Du and far more heroic than Master Ye; she waved happily, “It’s settled — come pick them up in a month. I’ll start refining now and won’t let you down.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and watched her fly off.

Around the corner, the excited Wu'er ran right into Mi Na, who quickly caught her and scolded, “Little brat, always rushing about — where do you get so much energy?”

“Senior Sister, look!” Wu'er offered the Crystal Stones in her hands. Mi Na’s eyes brightened. “Where did so many Crystal Stones come from?”

“There are more in my Spatial Pouch; that man gave me more than twenty!”

“Who gave them to you?” Mi Na frowned.

“A man... he asked me to refine one hundred Spirit‑Linking Pills and gave me these Crystal Stones as payment!”

“One hundred?” Mi Na was astonished. “Why would he need so many Spirit‑Linking Pills? And he actually asked you to refine them?”

“Yes! The herbs are in my Spatial Pouch.”

Mi Na’s expression turned serious and she scoffed, “Ill intentions! That man is either blind or has ulterior motives! Is he still in the Association?”

“I don’t know... he was here just a moment ago.” Wu'er looked at Mi Na, puzzled by her senior sister’s displeasure.

“I’ll go check.” Mi Na said, and dashed outside.

Her junior sister was far too young and still learning alchemy; if that man truly wanted pills refined he wouldn’t have chosen Wu'er — she seemed far too unreliable.

Mi Na instinctively believed the man had come with ulterior motives to get close to Wu'er.

She stormed out, scowling and silently vowing to find that man and teach him a lesson — to let him know the people of the Alchemists' Association were not to be bullied.

Before she reached the door she saw someone strolling over; their eyes met and the man smiled and called out, “Hey, beauty, long time no see.”

Mi Na froze, staring at him for a moment before reacting. “Yang Kai!” she cried.

She hurried over excitedly. “You finally returned?”

“Mm, I only returned a month ago.”

“I thought you were dead out there,” Mi Na sniffed. “For years I’ve been sent by Elder Du to the Tianxiao Sect to look for news of you, but I always came up empty.”
