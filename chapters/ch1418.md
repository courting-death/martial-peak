## Chapter 1418 — Dragon Bone Sword

Fortunately, Yang Yan taught him a method: using that Void King-Grade forging furnace together with the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird's power, they placed the Dragon Bone Dragon Pearl into the furnace to let it slowly refine.

The Artifact Spirit had a mental link with Yang Kai; having it perform the refinement was essentially no different from Yang Kai doing it himself.

This method did not require exquisite smithing technique, only the accumulation of time; although it seemed crude and makeshift, it was far better than entrusting the materials to an unreliable artificer and wasting them.

Even Yang Yan herself lacked the confidence to use the Dragon Bone Dragon Pearl to craft a treasure — this already exceeded her capabilities.

One could say this approach suited only Yang Kai, for he possessed a Void King-Grade furnace and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird — both conditions together were indispensable.

Several years passed, and the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Pearl thoroughly fused into one, for they were of the same origin and their union was not difficult; now it had reached the point where it could be employed.

Yang Kai had not expected that the very first time he used it he would almost cause a mishap: the remnant dragon soul lingering within the pearl refused to submit to him.

Even if it was only a wisp of a remnant soul without intelligence, it was the vestige of an Ancient Divine Spirit, proud to the extreme and not one to bow willingly; fortunately Yang Kai possessed the Blooming Lotus secret art and at the crucial moment forcibly suppressed the dragon soul's stubbornness, preventing catastrophe.

But that was not a long-term solution — it seemed he would have to take time later to properly temper this Dragon Bone Sword before using it with complete peace of mind. Yang Kai thought to himself, his gaze cold as a blade as he scanned the surroundings.

The terrifying pressure slowly dissipated, yet everyone was sweating coldly; a breeze passed and a chill ran from head to toe.

They had thought Dragon Lair Mountain could be toyed with at will, yet at this moment it erupted with such formidable combat power that it was beyond their imagination.

That Awakened Ancient Tree, that Stone Giant, and this eerie emerald-green longsword — none of them failed to inspire the utmost fear. Especially the emerald-green longsword: everyone knew it was a good thing, but no one knew how great its power truly was.

For a time Yang Kai once again became the focal point; many covetous and wary gazes fixed upon that emerald-green longsword.

Yang Kai himself wanted to test the might of his new Secret Treasure and naturally did not wish to waste time; he poured Saint Yuan into the emerald-green longsword, and a faint, high dragon-cry sounded as the sword began to hum.

"Go!" Yang Kai pointed, and an emerald-green radiance flashed from his hand and vanished. Instantly, a colossal creature several dozen zhang long took shape in midair.

It was a strange beast, entirely emerald-green, with wings that shadowed sky and earth, its body covered in scales like solid armor, appearing impregnable.

The creature opened its cavernous maw, its teeth like blades and its claws like spears, emanating a faint cold light that sent shivers down one's spine.

"Ancient Divine Spirit!" Mo Yu groaned; even with his usual composure he nearly fell to the ground.

Although he had never seen an Ancient Divine Spirit with his own eyes, Mo Yu was not unfamiliar with such beings — nearly every great sect's records contained accounts of those long-vanished Ancient Divine Spirits, so he had naturally seen their depictions.

The colossal beast before them matched the records exactly; it was clearly the image of an Ancient Divine Spirit.

Moreover, it was one of the top-ranking True Dragons among the Ancient Divine Spirits!

Its very aura alone chilled the limbs of warriors below the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; let alone its own offensive capability.

“It's a remnant soul—he actually has another remnant soul of an Ancient Divine Spirit!” On the other side, Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes trembled violently as he muttered in disbelief, standing there in a daze, completely forgetting about the opponent he was fighting.

Qian Tong was the same; their opponents' situation was identical. At this moment, who still had the heart to continue fighting? All turned their eyes to the emerald giant dragon several dozen zhang long.

The last time in the Imperial Garden, Fei Zhi Tu had seen the phantasmal image of an Ice Phoenix and knew Yang Kai possessed a remnant of an Ancient Divine Spirit.

At that time Fei Zhi Tu had been astonished by Yang Kai, thinking his fortune extraordinary to possess such a heaven-defying treasure. Because of that, Fei Zhi Tu changed his attitude toward Yang Kai, refraining from any airs of seniority; for even a remnant soul, given enough time and opportunity, might grow into something not inferior to the Void King Realm.

Never underestimate the young — who could guarantee Yang Kai would not someday stand at the very pinnacle?

Therefore making a good connection with him now would certainly bring many benefits later.

So when Dragon Lair Mountain was in trouble, he unhesitatingly followed Qian Tong here to intervene; otherwise, given his aversion to trouble, he would have remained in Tianyun City and watched coldly from afar.

He had thought Yang Kai possessing an Ice Phoenix remnant was already a heaven-defying opportunity; he never expected Yang Kai to also have a True Dragon remnant!

Furthermore, this True Dragon remnant seemed even stronger than the Ice Phoenix remnant seen before.

Fei Zhi Tu was both envious and jealous to the point of wanting to vomit blood.

Compared with Yang Kai's foundation, everything he himself possessed was rubbish.

While the crowd was stunned, the emerald giant dragon had already lunged at a Leitai Sect warrior at the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, only one step from breaking through to the Second Stage; his strength was no trifling matter.

He had been fighting against both the Divine Tree and the Stone Puppet all this time, yet remained completely uninjured—only his appearance was a bit disheveled. That alone spoke volumes of his strength.

But however strong an individual, he could not face an Ancient Divine Spirit head-on.

Seeing the True Dragon swoop in, the man's face turned deathly pale; he hurriedly produced a black-gold shield, forming a defensive barrier before him.

A hint of humanlike disdain flickered in the dragon's vast eye; with a single claw it lightly slashed forward, and with a tearing sound the shield-formed barrier was ripped apart as if it were tofu, fragile and gone.

Immediately the emerald giant dragon opened its cavernous maw and, in full view of all, swallowed the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior in one gulp.

A scream rose and was abruptly cut off; the life aura of that warrior was extinguished in an instant.

When the dragon's body rushed past where the man had stood, a horrifying sight met everyone's eyes: only a skeleton remained on the spot in a defensive pose, its flesh completely vanished.

A cold wind swept over, and even the strong felt as if they had fallen into an icehouse.

Mo Xiaosheng, Cheng Pengxuan, Jin Shi, Old Woman Feng — one after another their faces went ashen; momentarily stunned, they almost were individually crushed by the woman surnamed Ye.

After swallowing the Leitai Sect warrior's blood-and-flesh essence, the emerald dragon reared its head and let out an ear-splitting roar, then opened its mouth again and sprayed a jade-green mist downward, covering those below.

A dozen or so Origin Returning Realm warriors were instantly enveloped, their screams rising in quick succession.

"It's poisonous!"

"Get away!"

That emerald mist actually contained fierce toxicity; those trapped inside grew dizzy and had difficulty breathing, and even their Saint Yuan could not be operated.

The slightly weaker ones staggered and fell; plainly visible, their flesh quickly dissolved, leaving white, grim bones — a shocking sight.

Only those at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm or above could wrench themselves out of the emerald mist's shroud, but each appeared sallow and greenish — clearly badly poisoned and requiring much time and spiritual pills to purge the toxin.

This emerald giant dragon was, in fact, a poison dragon!

Yang Kai was also greatly surprised. He had no idea what kind of divine abilities the original being of the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl he obtained had possessed in its lifetime. When he made his move just now, it had partly been to test it out—and now that the result was before him, his brows lifted, his face full of delight.

Among the True Dragons of the Ancient Divine Spirits, poison dragons and fire dragons were the two most offensively ferocious types — this discovery naturally thrilled him.

Since the last expedition to Zangxiong Valley, his only offensive Secret Treasure, the Hundred Mountains Painting, had self-destructed, and he had lacked any offensive Secret Treasure to command. One reason was his confidence in his own methods and the belief that there was no need to have Yang Yan craft anything for him, since even producing a Secret Treasure required much time to nurture.

The other, more important reason was that Yang Kai had been waiting for the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Pearl to be refined.

Now it seemed his wait had not been in vain: the sword Secret Treasure forged from the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Pearl was comparable to Void King-Grade, and it even appeared to possess great room for growth — after the emerald sword's dragon form devoured the blood-and-flesh essence of an Origin Returning Realm warrior earlier, he distinctly felt his Secret Treasure's aura grow slightly stronger.

This was plainly a sign it could grow.

While Yang Kai pondered, those Origin Returning Realm warriors who had just escaped the emerald mist were suddenly targeted by the Stone Puppet; they had been fortunate and were fairly strong, but it was their limit. The Heaven-Shaking Pillar swung, rolling the heavens and earth, and none could withstand it; they fell like wheat.

The stench of blood filled the air, and in an instant Dragon Lair Mountain became Shura's Purgatory.

The tide of battle bizarrely turned overwhelmingly one-sided!

And it wasn’t the one-sided slaughter of Dragon Lair Mountain’s people that the gathered experts had imagined—instead, they were the ones being slaughtered. In an instant, their morale plummeted to rock bottom.

Taking the opportunity, Chang Qi and the others vigorously counterattacked and immediately seized the initiative.

To be clear, Chang Qi and the others were not especially powerful in themselves; they relied on the craftiness of the Secret Treasures in their hands, Secret Treasures of Origin-Grade upper-level quality that Yang Yan had tailored for them — the maximum that fighters of their rank could wield.

Originally, outnumbered and in a precarious situation, they had only been able to split enemy attention and buy time.

Now, with the enemy's morale greatly diminished, Chang Qi and the others fought with boundless might; advancing cautiously and seeking to avoid mistakes rather than glory, they became for the time being like dragons and tigers, leaving their opponents furious and helpless.
