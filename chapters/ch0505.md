## Chapter 505 — Ice Cold Cave

Ever since leaving the Void Passage, they had concealed their identities and roamed the land. Later, they learned that their sect had been reduced to ashes in a great fire, the Sect Leader and several elders vanished without a trace. Not daring to return rashly, they settled here for the time being, awaiting the day they could make future plans.

And this stay lasted until now.

They had indeed heard the news of the Yang Family Succession War. Although in seclusion, every month they dispatched people to gather intelligence from various sources. It was then that they learned of Yang Kai's true identity and the ongoing Succession War.

But just as Yang Kai had said earlier, even though they knew about the Succession War and wanted to assist Yang Kai, it was still inconvenient for them to go to War City.

Because the Evil Sect reputation of Lingxiao Pavilion had not yet been erased, their arrival in War City would only bring unnecessary trouble to Yang Kai.

Having lived here for more than a year, although contact with the outside world was limited, disputes were rare. Except for occasional attacks from Demonic Beasts, everyone in Lingxiao Pavilion was diligently cultivating, hoping for the day they could restore the sect's former glory!

“So you don’t know that the sect has already been rebuilt?” Yang Kai asked after they finished speaking.

“The sect is rebuilt?” Several Senior Uncles and Aunties expressed astonishment.

“Yes, it should be rebuilt, but for now, the sect’s name hasn’t been restored. Lingxiao Pavilion is currently only considered a temporary asset under my control. We have to wait until the sect’s name is properly reinstated before fully restoring it.”

“Disciple, your intention is truly thoughtful. Perhaps only you can accomplish this!” Several Senior Uncles and Aunties perceived the crux of the matter and said gravely, “We will certainly trouble you a great deal in the future.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “It is a disciple’s duty.” Then he asked, “What news is there of the Sect Leader and the elders?”

Those Senior Uncles and Aunties all looked somber. “No clues for now. We only send a few people every month to scout around, but we don’t know exactly where the Sect Leader and elders are.”

“I see…” Yang Kai sighed, comforting them, “It’s all right. The Sect Leader is already above Divine Roaming. There are very few in the world who could harm him.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s expressions brightened, deeply moved. Although they had heard rumors before, hearing it from Yang Kai carried a different weight.

“I came this time to ask you Senior Uncles, Aunties, and senior brothers to accompany me back to War City. If you have no objections, I will have the disciples pack up, and we will set off as soon as possible.”

The Senior Uncles and Aunties exchanged glances. One smiled, “We didn’t want to trouble you to avoid causing you difficulties. But since you have taken the initiative to ask, it would be unthinkable for us not to go. Even if we enter War City bearing the title of Evil Sect disciples, as long as we have your protection, no one would dare say anything, right?”

Yang Kai gave a cold smile. “Anyone who dares speak won’t live long!”

Only then did the Senior Uncles and Aunties set aside their worries and firmly agree.

“Then I will go find… Su Yan.” Yang Kai scratched his nose.

The expressions of the Senior Uncles and Aunties immediately turned awkward. The one who had just spoken said, “Ah, yes, I nearly forgot. Disciple, please forgive me.” Then he shouted outside, “Su Mu!”

“Present,” Su Mu responded, stepping inside.

“I need you to take Senior Brother Yang to the Ice Cold Cave.”

“Understood.” Su Mu smiled slightly and gestured to Yang Kai. “Brother-in-law, please follow me.”

Yang Kai cleared his throat and slowly followed.

Ying Jiu wanted to follow as well but was stopped by Yang Kai.

With Su Mu leading, Yang Kai asked, “Ice Cold Cave? What kind of place is that?”

“It’s where Sister cultivates,” Su Mu explained. “We discovered a place of intense cold here, suitable for Sister’s cultivation, so we settled here temporarily. The last time I visited her, she said she was going into seclusion. I don’t know if she’s out yet.”

“Yes, she is definitely in seclusion.” Yang Kai nodded.

If she weren’t in seclusion, Su Yan would have come out to greet them. From dozens of li away, Yang Kai could already sense her presence. The Dual Cultivation Technique had intertwined their minds and bodies, forming an indelible bond from the very First Stage. If Yang Kai could sense her, she certainly sensed him as well.

Currently, though, Su Yan was probably unable to leave her seclusion immediately, so she didn’t appear.

As they drew closer, Yang Kai’s True Yuan began to pulse uncontrollably, as if drawn by an invisible vortex.

That was the energy within Su Yan!

Neither had practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique for so long, and both yearned intensely for the other’s solace.

Yang Kai’s usually steady heart likewise began to flutter.

The Ice Cold Cave was not far from where everyone lived, less than three li away. Shortly after, Su Mu led Yang Kai to an entrance from which chills spilled forth.

Even outside, icy mist surged continuously from the cave, a magnificent sight. Around the entrance, no grass grew and the earth was hardened and lifeless.

Su Mu had already reached the Fifth Stage of the True Yuan Realm, but halted about ten zhang from the cave entrance and said, “Brother-in-law, you should go inside alone. That cursed place is too cold, and we don’t even know how it formed. Only Sister can endure it. Even the Senior Uncles can’t enter.”

“All right, you can go back.”

“Hehe, Brother-in-law, please take your time!” Su Mu smiled brightly and turned away.

Yang Kai shook his head, took a deep breath, and stepped into the Ice Cold Cave.

The icy chill assaulted him from all sides, as if even his True Yuan would be frozen.

He activated the True Yang Technique to dispel the cold and walked inward step by step.

The walls were smooth blocks of ice, the cave seemingly completely natural, without any signs of artificial excavation.

Faint light glimmered from unknown sources, reflected by the icy walls like mirrors, so the cave was not engulfed in darkness.

The deeper he went, the colder it became. Yang Kai hastened the circulation of True Yang Technique within him.

After about the time it took to drink a cup of tea, his vision suddenly cleared. This must be the innermost part of the Ice Cold Cave, where the chill was most intense. The narrow corridor opened into a spacious area.

In a single glance, Yang Kai saw Su Yan.

Her hair was like silky satin, falling smoothly and hiding her rounded, firm hips. Her skin rivaled snow in its purity, shining as delicately as fine porcelain. Her exquisite nose, rosy cheeks, and lips like twin cherry blossoms emitted gentle breath like orchids. Her snow-white face sparkled like jade.

Su Yan was as before, resembling a delicately carved ice doll.

At this moment, she was seated cross-legged on a crystal-clear ice bed, eyes closed in meditation. Her delicate body trembled slightly, revealing inner excitement.

Suddenly, Su Yan’s True Yuan surged wildly. Clearly visible, frost rapidly coated her fair flesh, face, and all exposed skin.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. His body flickered and he appeared before Su Yan. He sat cross-legged, gently holding her hands and activating the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Simultaneously, Su Yan’s True Yuan traced the circulation path of the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Her turbulent True Yuan began to calm down. Their True Yuan fluctuations, breathing rhythms, and heartbeats gradually synchronized.

After a while, Yang Kai exhaled softly and opened his eyes.

Opposite him, Su Yan’s beautiful eyes opened slowly. Her long lashes fluttered, seemingly unable to believe Yang Kai had found her. But soon, her cold face lit with a flushed, loving smile.

“Even I didn’t expect you to be so moved just because I came. Almost caused an accident,” Yang Kai laughed lightly.

Su Yan was clearly still in seclusion. Upon sensing Yang Kai’s arrival, her energy had been thrown out of balance. If not for Yang Kai’s timely help, who knew what would have happened.

Her cheeks reddened, and she was about to speak when a sudden powerful force pushed her down onto the ice bed. She gasped in surprise, her expression flustered.

Looking up, she saw Yang Kai’s eyes burning fiercely like a beast hunting its prey.

His heavy breath was like a fierce beast about to devour her alive.

That gaze, filled with unrestrained possessiveness, made Su Yan’s breath quicken. She immediately realized what was about to happen.

“Yang—” she barely uttered the first syllable before Yang Kai pressed down, silencing her.

But she barely resisted, wrapping her pure white arms around his neck, allowing him to act freely.

Breath grew heavier. In this frigid environment, on the crystal-clear ice bed, the young man and woman were tightly entwined. No words were needed, only fierce passion and ecstatic response.

Their clothes fell into disarray. The biting cold, capable of freezing heaven and earth, could not freeze the fiery hearts of youth. Su Yan’s translucent white skin was quickly exposed to the air.

Her firm, delicate chest flushed rosy, her slender legs entwined in fragrant grass-like softness, subtly revealed with every inch inviting endless longing from Yang Kai.

Su Yan’s face burned deep red, her eyes gleaming with unusual light. She felt Yang Kai was a wild beast unleashed from its cage, releasing himself entirely upon her tender body without a shred of gentleness.

Yet strangely, it was this roughness that pleased her, stirring her heart and overwhelming her senses.

With a suppressed, tantalizing moan, Su Yan’s body tightened, lips bitten lightly, bracing herself for the storm of passion.

The merciless lashings covered her soft, snowy skin as her cries grew louder, stimulating Yang Kai’s nerves.

As if the world vanished, only these two remained, lost in forgetful union.

The dragon-shaped tattoo on Yang Kai’s back and the phoenix-shaped one on Su Yan’s also seemed alive, swiftly moving across their skins.
