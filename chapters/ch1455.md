## Chapter 1455 —  Searched High and Low, Only to Find It by Chance

Not even half a cup of tea's time had passed since Yang Kai left when Xue Yue led that group of experts to the spot; after hearing the beautiful woman's sharp cry, they pooled their strength, shattered the formation, and rescued the woman.

After listening to the woman's report, Xue Yue's expression grew exceedingly grim.

She had not expected her people to be so unlucky as to trigger the formation here and let that brat escape.

"Third Young Master, I have failed in my duties; please punish me." The woman's face was miserable as she said this with shame.

"Forget it." Xue Yue waved a hand. "It's not a great matter. I merely suspected that person to be an old acquaintance, though I couldn't be certain. Since we didn't catch him, we'll let it drop."

No wonder he was the Third Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild—able to pick up and let go, decisive and without fuss; upon learning Yang Kai had fled, he showed no intention of pursuing the matter further.

"Third Young Master is wise. What matters most now is finding that cultivation technique; it is tightly connected with President's future. If we can find that technique, President will surely advance and become a peak existence of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm." An elderly man with lively bearing and flushed complexion said; though aged, his Qi and blood power was astonishingly strong.

"Mm, Elder Chu is right, but we have too little information, and whether that technique truly exists here remains uncertain. In any case, our chief objective on this trip is that—let's scout around first." Xue Yue did not object and instead agreed with Elder Chu, showing the old man's high standing among them.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild was wealthy beyond compare; though the Imperial Garden had a grand name, few things could move them. Still, this time the Hengluo Commerce Guild sent its elite—every dispatched martial artist was a top master at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—and with an important figure like Xue Yue leading them, their aim must be substantial.

As for the cultivation art they mentioned in their conversation, no one knew exactly what it was—but it seemed capable of allowing a cultivator at the peak of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm to break through into the Third Stage.

On the other side, after shaking off his pursuers, Yang Kai pressed deeper into the Imperial Garden.

Along the way there were traces of battles and signs of formations and restrictions having been broken, as well as many corpses strewn about—this place was indeed fraught with danger at every step.

At the very least, it was far more dangerous than the last time he had entered.

Because as he passed, Yang Kai discovered numerous remains of ancient puppets; they came in all sizes and shapes, without exception destroyed by the martial artists who had intruded here.

Last time there had been puppets too, but not nearly so many.

It seemed that once the Imperial Garden officially opened, the peril within had greatly increased. No wonder Min Sha and the others fled outside and dared not linger—the competition here was fierce and the danger manifold.

Yet there were advantages to coming late. Having dawdled outside for many days, Yang Kai need not worry about triggering any restrictions inside; by following where the signs of battle were, passage was generally extremely safe.

Numerous people had cleared the way ahead of him.

Of course, gains come with losses—the benefits had already been taken by those people.

As he walked, each pavilion and chamber had doors flung open and interiors in disarray, clearly searched thoroughly; who knew whether any good things had been scavenged away.

Yang Kai did not care; he had come into the Imperial Garden for only two things.

Both were items he had discovered during his previous entry.

One was the Life Jade Nectar, one of the Three Divine Waters of the Star Domain, wondrous in use—capable of restoring flesh and bone, reviving the dead.

But what Yang Kai prized most was its ability to help refine his Golden Blood. After swallowing some diluted Life Jade Nectar last time, he had already gained tremendously; obtaining more, purer Life Jade Nectar would be of obvious benefit.

He yearned to replace all his blood with that pure Golden Blood. If he could achieve this, both his Qi and blood power and his physical strength would increase greatly—perhaps not rendering him immortal, but making him extremely difficult to seriously wound.

The second thing was, of course, the Heaven and Earth Spirit hidden within that Ice Path.

That thing was condensed from pure cold energy and had already gained sentience. It was a type most beloved by the Ancient Divine Spirits. According to legend, during ancient times, there had been many such Heaven and Earth Spirits, but they were hunted and devoured by the Ancient Divine Spirits—hence their gradual extinction today.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit in the Ice Path was of icy nature and exactly suited to the Ice Phoenix's palate; if the Ice Phoenix remnant soul could swallow it, it would receive tremendous nourishment.

Yang Kai naturally cared for anything related to Su Yan's future.

If he could obtain those two things, the trip into the Imperial Garden would be a great harvest; he paid little mind to anything else.

With such thoughts in mind, Yang Kai kept surveying the surrounding terrain, but even after an entire day, he was still completely at a loss.

No wonder—the interior scenery of the Imperial Garden was too similar; he had no idea where he was and could not even attempt to search for the Heaven and Earth Spirit or the Life Jade Nectar.

That day passed uneventfully; he didn't encounter anyone. Those who entered had either perished or delved deeper, leaving him no one to question.

Inside the Imperial Garden, unlike outside, Divine Sense could not spread far; here it was suppressed to a range of only dozens of zhang, unable to extend outward.

Yang Kai again took out the Transmission Compass that could contact Yang Yan and Qian Tong, poured Divine Sense into it, but to his disappointment it still didn't react.

With a sigh, Yang Kai reluctantly put the Transmission Compass into his Spatial Ring and went on deeper.

About half a day later he suddenly halted, pricking up his ears—he thought he heard fighting not far off, and upon closer listening his face brightened as he hurried toward the sound.

Indeed there were people fighting ahead; the nearer he came the clearer the sounds and motions became.

The battle was inside a palace, and the numbers seemed not small—at least seven or eight people—and their strength was not weak. From the noises, the struggle had reached a stalemate; even if one side had the upper hand, the edge was not decisive.

Yang Kai did not rush to appear; he concealed his aura and silently swept to the outside of the palace, poked through a broken window, and glanced in.

Inside the palace Secret Treasures and martial skills flashed like light; figures surged and fell—sometimes dueling in pairs, sometimes fighting in groups—waging fierce contention.

One figure, judging by body shape, was a woman lying on her side—whether alive or dead he could not tell.

"It's them!" Yang Kai said in astonishment after watching for a moment.

He had not expected such coincidence—the first group he encountered inside the Imperial Garden were people he knew.

Qiantian Sect's Great Elder Mo Yu, Sect Master Gu Zhen, and Shen Shitao.

Though Mo Yu and Gu Zhen were both Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and therefore top experts within the Imperial Garden, Shen Shitao had only just advanced to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and her rise had been artificially boosted by many elders of Qiantian Sect using secret means, so she could not display Origin Returning Realm strength.

She had not even condensed her own force.

Their opponents numbered four: two at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and two at the Second Stage, so the battle was clearly unfavorable to Qiantian Sect.

Shen Shitao teetered on the brink; were it not for the Nine Palace Sky‑Net Umbrella bestowed by Mo Yu—a powerful defensive secret treasure—she would likely have been captured or died already.

Gu Zhen and Mo Yu had to spare thought from fighting to protect her.

Yet as leader and great elder, their Secret Treasures and methods were terrifying, so though the scene looked perilous, they could hold out for some time.

They must have been fighting the enemy for quite a while before Yang Kai arrived.

Since they were acquaintances, Yang Kai naturally would not stand idly by. He had a good impression of Mo Yu and some rapport with Shen Shitao.

But Yang Kai was puzzled—why would Qiantian Sect fight those four in this palace? Was there some benefit here?

With that thought he scanned the palace, and when he looked his brow lifted and joy shone across his face.

At the very center of the palace was a sacrificial‑platform like object—a strange stone blood red in color about the size of a heart.

A Blood Essence Stone!

Yang Kai recognized at a glance what it was.

It truly was a Blood Essence Stone!

He had searched far and wide for it to no avail, and yet here it was before him with no effort at all.

For others the Blood Essence Stone had great uses—it could absorb the blood of the dead, convert it into pure blood‑qi, and in critical times heal or replenish Qi and blood power.

But for Yang Kai there was a greater purpose: to serve as the heart for a Stone Puppet.

On Tongxuan Continent Yang Kai had obtained two stone embryo puppets in total, but there was only one Blood Essence Stone, so after coming to Dark Star only one Stone Puppet could be born. In his Black Book Space there was another stone embryo that had yet to hatch.

What that embryo lacked was only a single Blood Essence Stone.

With a Blood Essence Stone it could birth a second Stone Puppet. Yang Kai knew better than anyone the strength and mystery of Stone Puppets—Yang Yan could use one to refine instruments, and they had formidable combat power; at the battle of Dragon Lair Mountain the Stone Puppet had displayed dazzling prowess.

Yang Kai already had one Stone Puppet; if he obtained the second and gave it to Yang Yan she would be overjoyed—she had envied Yang Kai for a very long time.
