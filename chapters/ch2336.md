## Chapter 2336 — Detained

If the Heaven-Grade Puppet could be activated, the Chiyue Sect would instantly rise among the top sects. Why fear the insignificant Tianzhao Palace? By then, every sect and family within a million li would have to bow to the Chiyue Sect, their survival would hang on its whim.

But he never expected Shi Cangying to be so despicable and vicious. Taking advantage of his and Yang Kai's absence, he sent his trusted subordinates to seize people. If those people were handed over, how could Yang Kai possibly let it go? The lost cultivation methods and secret arts of the Chiyue Sect would never be recovered. By then, the Chiyue Sect would truly be finished.

Thinking of this, Ye Hen grew both anxious and furious, and shouted in a low voice, "Shi Cangying, if you truly care for the sect, then call those people back at once."

Shi Cangying snorted coldly, "It's already too late!"

When he heard that many experts had arrived outside the mountain gate, Shi Cangying had already guessed their purpose. He secretly instructed those elders to lie in ambush and wait for his order. Earlier, seeing Ye Hen still unwilling to hand over the people, he had already given the secret command. Now, it was clearly too late to say anything more.

"You..." A mouthful of hot blood surged up Ye Hen's throat. Consumed by rage, he nearly spat it out. Pointing at Shi Cangying, he gritted his teeth and said, "Do you know what a colossal mistake you have made! If even a single hair is harmed on those people, this Sect Master will hold you accountable!"

Shi Cangying's face darkened as he said, "This Shi acts with a loyal heart for the sect. Heaven and earth can bear witness, the sun and moon can attest. Even if the ancestors stood here, they would not think I was wrong!"

Seeing him still so stubborn and unrepentant, Ye Hen finally spat out a mouthful of blood.

Shi Cangying looked at him coldly and said indifferently, "Sect Master, you are old. You are no longer fit to lead the Chiyue Sect. Your decayed and stubborn thinking will only hold the Chiyue Sect back."

As soon as these words fell, everyone's expression changed dramatically. They realized Shi Cangying was seizing the opportunity to make trouble and usurp power. The elders were all terrified and at a loss for what to do.

Du Xian shouted angrily, "Old thief Shi, how dare you commit such treason! Today, I will cleanse the sect on behalf of my master!"

He had been standing behind Ye Hen the whole time, seeing everything. Although he didn't know why Ye Hen valued Yang Kai so much, Ye Hen was still his master. Now that his master had been angered to the point of vomiting blood by Shi Cangying, how could he remain indifferent?

As soon as he finished speaking, a cold, gleaming longsword appeared in his hand. Sword light swept out, thrusting straight at Shi Cangying.

Shi Cangying stood in place, his face full of disdain. He reached out with a large hand and slapped forward, saying, "As a disciple of the sect, you dare to defy your superior and attack this Lord. Ye Hen truly taught a good disciple!"

As he spoke, Origin Qi surged in his large hand, colliding with the sword light.

With a loud bang, the sword light shattered, and the palm strike landed on Du Xian, causing him to spit blood and be sent flying.

This sudden turn of events happened in a flash. Although the Protective Mountain Array blocked some of it, Qiu Ze and the others still saw everything clearly and immediately revealed mocking smiles. They had come together today to make trouble for the Chiyue Sect. They thought it would be a tough battle, but before they even made a move, the Chiyue Sect was already falling apart from within. The Sect Master and Vice Sect Master were quarreling endlessly, and the disciples were the first to act without respect for their elders, only to be injured and forced back.

At this rate, they probably wouldn't need to do anything to take the Chiyue Sect. All they had to do was stand here and watch.

Thinking this, each of them wore a look of confidence.

"Sect Master Shi is truly loyal and courageous. Qiu admires you!" Qiu Ze smiled at Shi Cangying and cupped his fists from afar. He was already addressing Shi Cangying as Sect Master, clearly believing Ye Hen had no hope of turning things around.

Shi Cangying replied with a fist salute, "Palace Master Qiu flatters me. This Shi is only thinking for the sect, unlike some who are blinded and recklessly bring disaster upon the sect."

Qiu Ze said, "This Lord believes that under Sect Master Shi's leadership, the Chiyue Sect will surely have a bright future."

Shi Cangying smiled slightly and lowered his posture, saying, "Then I must ask Palace Master Qiu to look after us in the future."

With these words, he was clearly indicating that he would be associating more with Tianzhao Palace in the future, even to the point of following their lead. Hearing this, Ye Hen spat out another mouthful of blood and shouted angrily, "Shi Cangying, you will regret this! The foundation built by our ancestors over tens of thousands of years is being destroyed by your hands. When you die, how will you face the ancestors?"

Shi Cangying sneered, "I wonder who is truly unable to face the ancestors. This Shi acts with a clear conscience. Even if I die and go to the underworld, the ancestors will have no complaints!"

Ye Hen's face was pale, his breath extremely weak, but he gritted his teeth and said nothing, only glaring at Shi Cangying as if he wished to devour him.

On the other side, Qiu Ze nodded in satisfaction and said, "Sect Master Shi, you'd best hand over the people now. We've been waiting here for quite some time."

"Of course." Shi Cangying smiled slightly and said, "By my estimation, they should be arriving soon."

As he spoke, he turned his head to look in a certain direction and smiled, "Look, they're here."

Hearing this, everyone looked over. Ye Hen grew even more anxious, secretly circulating his Origin Qi, ready to strike the moment Shi Cangying let his guard down. No matter what, he could not let Yang Kai's friends be handed over.

But when he glanced over, Ye Hen's expression suddenly changed, and he frowned deeply.

Shi Cangying seemed to sense something was wrong as well, his expression turning odd.

Over there, a streak of light flew toward them in a crooked line. Soon, it landed before the crowd, revealing a figure. The man appeared to be around fifty years old, with the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. He was one of Shi Cangying's most trusted elders and a core member of the new faction within the Chiyue Sect.

But at this moment, the elder was covered in blood and looked utterly miserable. Not only that, but his aura was extremely weak—it was clear he had suffered serious injuries.

Seeing this man, Ye Hen couldn't help but look puzzled, while Shi Cangying's face changed dramatically. He hurried forward, supported the man, and asked in a low voice, "What happened? Who injured you? Weren't you going to seize the people? Where are the others?"

The elder, terrified, replied, "There was an expert among them at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. We were no match. The Seventh and Ninth Elders were detained..."

"What?" Shi Cangying was shocked. "Detained?"

He could hardly believe his ears, staring at the injured elder with a look that said, "Are you kidding me?"

Shi Cangying naturally knew the cultivation of the people Yang Kai brought. They were all at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, with one at the Void King Realm. How could they possibly be a match for his three trusted elders? Yet now, two of his three confidants had been detained, and one had fled back here seriously injured.

If not for the fact that this elder had always been loyal, Shi Cangying would have thought he was lying to disturb his mind.

"Who detained them?" Shi Cangying asked in shock.

"A woman!"

"A woman?" Shi Cangying looked utterly astonished, as if recalling something. He gritted his teeth and said, "Were they pretending to be weak?"

He probably thought Chi Yue had hidden her true strength, which was why his three confidants had failed.

But the elder shook his head, "No, I've never seen that woman before. I don't know when she arrived at the sect."

"Never seen her?" Shi Cangying was even more confused, then angrily said, "Even if she was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the three of you shouldn't have lost so miserably."

He looked as if he hated iron for not becoming steel, barely stopping himself from cursing the elder as a useless good-for-nothing.

The elder said miserably, "She is definitely at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm. When she struck, there was a trace of Emperor Intent. If not for that, even if we were no match, we wouldn't have been captured so easily."

"Emperor Intent?" Shi Cangying was truly shocked now.

To display Emperor Intent in her attacks—what did that mean? It meant she had already comprehended a trace of the mysteries of the Emperor Realm. In other words, as long as she was given enough time, she could break through to the Emperor Realm!

An Emperor Realm expert was not someone the Chiyue Sect could afford to provoke.

Shi Cangying's mind was thrown into chaos. He glanced thoughtfully at Ye Hen, thinking the woman must have been arranged by Ye Hen to protect those people. But one look told him he was wrong, for Ye Hen was just as bewildered. Clearly, he had no idea when a peak Dao Origin Realm woman had appeared on that side.

For such an expert to arrive at the Chiyue Sect, yet neither the Sect Master nor the Vice Sect Master knew about it—no one would believe it if word got out.

Shi Cangying couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat, feeling a bit horrified.

Suddenly, Qiu Ze sneered, "Sect Master Shi, your subordinates are really unreliable. They can't even handle a few mere thieves."

Shi Cangying was already full of frustration. Hearing this mockery, he immediately snapped, "This is sect business, Palace Master Qiu. Just watch, there's no need for you to comment."

Qiu Ze snorted, slowly stood up from his palanquin, and walked step by step toward the Protective Mountain Array, saying, "Originally, I didn't want to interfere in your sect's affairs, but this matter concerns several major sects in the area. As the overlord of this million-li region, how can this Lord just sit by and do nothing?"

As he finished speaking, an unimaginable aura suddenly erupted from his body. In an instant, the surrounding space seemed to freeze, and the laws of heaven and earth trembled.

Everyone enveloped by this power felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on them. It was hard to breathe, and their strength could not circulate properly.

Even the Chiyue Sect's Protective Mountain Array rippled visibly under the impact of this force.

In that moment, Qiu Ze seemed to become the master of this world. The lives and deaths of everyone present were at his whim, and no one could resist.

"Em... Emperor... Realm!" Mu Guan of White Cloud Tower's legs trembled, nearly kneeling. His eyes shook violently as he stared at Qiu Ze in disbelief.

The others were all equally shocked and pale.

Especially Ruan Hongbo of Heavenly Extreme Hall, who instantly turned ashen. Earlier, he hadn't thought much of Qiu Ze. After all, they were both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Although rumors said Qiu Ze had been in seclusion for over a decade comprehending the mysteries of the Emperor Realm, there had been no sign of success. As long as he hadn't succeeded, they were equals.

Before, seeing Qiu Ze act so high and mighty, he was quite displeased, thinking the man was too full of himself. If he really broke through to the Emperor Realm, wouldn't that be even worse?

But now he understood why Qiu Ze hadn't even glanced at him. It turned out Qiu Ze had already broken through the shackles and reached the Emperor Realm long ago.
