## Chapter 1813 — Senior... Please, Die

"I'm so scared!" Yang Kai made an outrageously exaggerated face, one hand pressed to his chest as if he were truly terrified; the next moment his expression turned bone-cold and he said in a chill voice, "But that's none of your concern anymore. If any of your Purple Star people dare come to hunt me, come one I'll kill one, come two I'll kill both — I wonder how many Void Kings Purple Star has for me to slaughter.”

A cruel smile curled at the corner of his mouth.

Zi Donglai trembled all over; under Yang Kai's stare his whole body chilled. He could see the other was neither bluffing nor joking, and he cried out desperately, "Father! Save me!"

He didn't have the courage to face Yang Kai in battle and immediately begged Zi Long for help.

Take people like him, Xue Yue, and Gu Jianxin — such outstanding young talents all possessed exceptionally tenacious wills in the Martial Dao. They would only grow stronger when faced with stronger foes, their courage rising with every setback. Just like that day when Gu Jianxin was ambushed by Li Minghai — he had thrown himself into battle without a moment’s hesitation.

Had Xue Yue encountered this, she would certainly not have cried for help; she would have found a way to resist the enemy herself.

So what if someone was at the Void King Realm? For true geniuses, fighting opponents a realm above is nothing unusual. If one loses the courage to battle just because a stronger foe sets their sights on them, then what point is there in cultivating any further?

A cultivator who can only run rampant among those of the same realm will never reach the true pinnacle of the Martial Dao.

Zi Donglai had utterly lost any qualification to be a future expert of the Star Domain! Since encountering Yang Kai he had been humiliated and struck down time and again; deep inside he was already riddled with wounds and shrouded in gloom.

Thus he did not dare confront Yang Kai; even if he survived this time, whether he could later advance to the Void King Realm was another matter entirely.

“Boy, if you dare so much as harm a single hair on my son’s head, I’ll slaughter your entire clan and wipe out nine generations of your bloodline!” Zi Long’s furious roar echoed from not far away — yet his voice was soon drowned out by the deafening sounds of the ensuing explosion.

As for him, it wasn’t that he didn’t want to save his son — but his entire body was shrouded beneath the Ghost Ancestor’s Ten Thousand Souls Banner, surrounded by countless vengeful spirits. He was completely trapped; even with the will to act, he had no power to break free.

"Is that so?" Yang Kai tilted his head and glanced toward where the voice came from, snorted lightly, and waved his hand. A blast of force shot forth in response.

The next moment Zi Donglai felt a chill on the crown of his head and shivered all over.

Dead? Am I dead? Zi Donglai wondered in alarm and uncertainty, but he quickly discovered he was unharmed save for a strange sensation above his head.

He reached up and touched it, then immediately screamed, "Ah — my hair!"

His flowing long hair had been cut clean off by Yang Kai; the top of his head was bald, the sight grotesquely comical.

He had always fancied himself a debonair, rakish figure; though he could not rival the monstrous beauty of Xue Yue, he was still an uncommon handsome man. The purple long hair inherited from his ancestors was his pride, the part he loved most because it accentuated his looks.

And now that flowing purple hair had been severed — gone from him!

Zi Donglai felt both heartache and abject terror.

Yang Kai's casual strike had left him no time to react; if he could chop off one's hair he could just as well chop off one's head! Thinking that made Zi Donglai sweat as if caught in a storm, his face as pale as paper.

"I've already plucked a great many of his hairs — what are you going to do about it?" Yang Kai taunted.

Within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, Zi Long stayed silent — most likely furious beyond words — while the Ghost Ancestor burst out laughing. “This old man’s long been sick of those two’s purple hair. Well cut, well cut indeed!”

"Boy!" Zi Long's voice rang out again. "You release my son and I will withdraw and trouble you no more. As the saying goes, enemies who fight once may come to know one another — we all move about this Star Domain; one day you will surely need Purple Star's help. As master of Purple Star I can promise you a favour that is not unreasonable — if Purple Star can do it, it shall be granted."

"That would be fine," Yang Kai chuckled. "If I can have Purple Star do one thing for me, it would be my honour."

Zi Donglai nodded repeatedly. "As long as you spare my life, everything is negotiable. If in the future I become master of Purple Star, we can even become sworn brothers."

As he spoke, a flash of hate passed across his eyes — brief, but not missed by Yang Kai's observation.

"So you accept?" Zi Long asked gravely.

"I accept. What is there to consider? Elder Zi Long's methods reach heaven and earth; although our sect's Grand Elder may have the edge to suppress you, he likely cannot be sure to kill you. Rather than both sides suffer mutual ruin, it is better to part on good terms."

Zi Long nodded in satisfaction. In truth, as Yang Kai had said, even though the Ghost Ancestor could temporarily imprison Zi Long within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, killing him was unrealistic — both men were Second Stage of the Void King Realm, their strength scarcely different; even if Ghost Ancestor could slay Zi Long, he would likely lose most of his own life, perhaps even die.

The Ghost Ancestor frowned. Though he treated Yang Kai with a veneer of friendliness, that did not mean he was kind; on the contrary, he was ruthless. He knew this affair could not end cleanly; even if Yang Kai and Zi Long reached some agreement, Yang Kai would absolutely not gain any true benefit.

Words alone were no guarantee — if Yang Kai later truly went to Purple Star to have them handle matters for him, he would likely be immediately seized by Purple Star's many experts.

After all, father and son had lost great face this time, and the matter concerned the Everlasting Tree — how could Zi Long simply let it slide?

Yet at present he had no better option and could only allow Yang Kai to act.

“Of course I know how to be reasonable, hehe…” Yang Kai said, rubbing his forehead with a troubled expression. “Mm, come to think of it, there really is something I’d like Senior Zi Long to help me with. I hope Senior can agree to it.”

Zi Long’s expression darkened. He thought to himself, This brat really took that bit of flattery seriously? Those words just now were nothing more than polite talk to save face so things could end peacefully. Anyone with half a brain wouldn’t take them to heart—yet this kid actually jumped on the chance and immediately started making demands.

Though displeased, Zi Long still indulged him: "Speak. If I, Zi Long, can do it, I will see it done for you."

Once I take Donglai and leave this place, I’ll immediately issue a kill order. I’ll make sure that brat has no way to heaven and no path to earth! Zi Long swore viciously in his heart.

“This matter is quite simple — naturally, Senior Zi Long can handle it,” Yang Kai chuckled, his face pure and harmless. “This junior dares to ask only one thing of Senior… please die!”

A sharp inhalation came from within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner; the ghosts' howls seemed to pause for a moment, betraying the Ghost Ancestor's deep unease.

Zi Long immediately fell silent, but anyone could sense his rage climbing step by step, as if capable of burning the very Ten Thousand Souls Banner.

Nearby, Zi Donglai gaped with his mouth wide, staring blankly at Yang Kai, utterly unable to imagine the words and expression his enemy had just put forward.

Does this brat even know what he’s saying? Has he lost his mind?

Before he could finish the thought, his vision blurred — Yang Kai had already appeared before him and reached out to seize him.

Zi Donglai screamed in terror; his Purple Qi Long River Technique was pushed to its limits as he tried to flee the spot.

It was all in vain. He hadn't even registered what had happened when his strength was suppressed and Yang Kai gripped him by the throat, lifting him up.

"Ah..." Yang Kai sighed. "It seems Elder Zi Long is a man of empty promises. If that's the case, then we'll let our hands decide."

“You brat — dare harm my son and I will tear you limb from limb!” Zi Long bellowed, furious.

Yang Kai idly picked at his ear and sneered, "You said something like that earlier and nothing came of it — are you all bark? Show some real action, will you? But... I'm curious: if I really kill him, what will you do..."

Zi Long dared not answer, afraid of striking some wrong nerve in Yang Kai and bringing about his son's death.

He realized the truth: this kid was a complete madman; there was no reasoning with a madman.

Crackle, crackle...

The sound of bones fracturing came from Zi Donglai's neck. He slammed both hands against Yang Kai's arm, trying to shove him away, but unable to draw on Saint Yuan, he was utterly powerless.

Yang Kai glanced at him coolly and said in a cold voice, "I had no feud with you father and son; I just minded my own business. Yet you relied on power to bully the weak — everything today is of your own making. In your next life, don’t grow your eyes on the top of your head — that’s how people end up falling on their faces.”

With those words he exerted his force.

Zi Donglai's head snapped to the side and his struggling ceased in an instant; all signs of life were gone.

The Purple Star Young Master was dead!

The Ghost Ancestor nearly bit his tongue at the commotion.

Even he hadn't expected Yang Kai to actually execute Zi Donglai; he had been pondering whether Yang Kai was bluffing to squeeze more advantage from Zi Long, or if he had some other scheme.

He had never imagined Yang Kai truly intended to kill.

This was bad! the Ghost Ancestor's heart sank.

With his son slain, Zi Long would undoubtedly go utterly berserk.

Before that thought had fully formed, the Ghost Ancestor's eyes went wide in horror. The darkness of the Ten Thousand Souls Banner suddenly erupted with thousands of purple lights, each carrying terrifying killing intent; chimeras and demons scattered, and even the banner itself hummed and trembled.

Boom...

A breach was blasted in the Ten Thousand Souls Banner's shroud; Zi Long's figure burst through and he lunged straight at Yang Kai with a hideous snarl, roaring, "Kid, I will make you pay blood for blood!"
