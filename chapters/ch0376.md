## Chapter 376 — Boredom

In a daze, Yang Kai asked three times before Tu Feng suddenly reacted, “It’s just a small injury. Young Master doesn’t need to worry.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood.

What could be considered a small injury? That was the result of their joint attack erupting within his body, essentially meaning he had struck himself hard without any defense. It was a miracle that he hadn’t passed out on the spot.

“Do you have any healing pills?” Yang Kai inquired in a deep voice.

He had some healing pills in his Shadow Space, but those Pill were prepared for him by Ling Taixu back in the day and were not of a very high grade. As blood servants of the Yang Family, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian certainly carried pills refined by the Yang Family, which would undoubtedly be better than Yang Kai's own.

Thus, Yang Kai chose not to embarrass himself.

“Mm.” Tang Yuxian nodded her head gracefully and, together with Tu Feng, pulled out a bottle from their robes, pouring out the only brown Mystery-grade Pill.

A hidden look of pain and a wry smile appeared on both their faces.

This brown Mystery-grade Pill was the type of pill commonly carried by Blood Servants, of the Lower-Level grade, capable of treating general minor injuries.

Such pills were incredibly precious; even Blood Servants would only carry one at a time, so both were a little reluctant to swallow it now.

However, their duty was to protect Yang Kai’s safety; if they didn’t heal their injuries quickly, any unexpected incident would spell disaster.

Thus, despite their reluctance, they decisively swallowed the Mystery-grade Pill.

Everything prioritized Yang Kai’s protection!

After the two consumed the pills, Yang Kai suddenly moved, quickly pulling them up and then rubbing his foot on the ground a few times to cover the bloodstains on the floor.

In the next moment, Lü Liang arrived with many masters from the Lü Family.

“What happened?” Lü Liang asked with a look of anxiety.

The loud commotion from earlier had drawn the attention of the Lü Family’s experts. Upon realizing it came from Yang Kai’s residence, they immediately rushed over.

Everyone was afraid that something had happened to Yang Kai. If something went wrong with the young master of the Yang Family while at the Lü Family, even with the Qiu Family as a backing, the Lü Family would be finished.

With the Yang Family’s overbearing nature, they would have no qualms about flattening the place.

Concerning the survival of their clan, how could Lü Liang not be anxious? How could he not be frightened?

After asking, all eyes turned to Yang Kai, seeing him unharmed and without any injuries, they all visibly sighed in relief.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had hidden their condition exceptionally well, both slightly circulating their True Essence to make their faces flush with vitality, revealing no signs of injury.

“It’s nothing.” Yang Kai smiled lightly. “I just had Tu Feng and Yuxian exchange a few moves so I could observe. I didn’t expect the commotion to be a bit loud.”

“Exchange moves?” Lü Liang looked shocked.

Yang Kai casually smiled and said, “I was bored. Watching experts exchange moves can be entertaining.”

Upon hearing this, Lü Liang and the others had strange expressions, their brows knitting slightly.

Looking at the two large pits on the ground and the cracks spread all around, Lü Liang and others silently marveled at the strength of the two Blood Servants.

Just exchanging moves created such a loud noise. How intense would a life-and-death battle be?

With a hearty laugh, Lü Liang said, “So it turns out Young Master Yang has such leisure, my apologies for our impetuousness. You may continue; we will take our leave!”

“Take care!” Yang Kai smiled elegantly. Not waiting for Lü Liang to leave, he called out, “By the way, Master Lü.”

Lü Liang frowned, turning back to ask, “Does Young Master Yang have any instructions?”

His tone and demeanor seemed to have lost the tension and caution from the day before, instead infused with a hint of impatience, unwittingly illustrating a slight shift in his attitude.

Yang Kai didn’t mind and simply said, “The Lü Family is blessed with talents; the environment here is beautiful. I and the two Blood Servants would like to stay a few more days. It won’t cause you any trouble, will it?”

Lü Liang was slightly surprised but didn’t think much of it, responding with a smile, “It is our honor for Young Master Yang to be a guest at the Lü Family; there’s no trouble at all.”

“Mm, that’s good.” Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

Lü Liang bowed again and led everyone away.

Once they had departed, Yang Kai suddenly turned his head, gazing at a pavilion several dozen zhang away.

On the second floor, Qiu Yimeng leaned against the railing, sporting a meaningful smile as she leisurely watched this side.

Their eyes met. Qiu Yimeng slightly raised her smooth chin in a somewhat provocative manner, while Luo Xiaoman beside her giggled as if she had uncovered a significant secret.

Yang Kai grinned at them, leading the two Blood Servants back into the room.

Inside the room, Yang Kai did not avoid the two Blood Servants, simply changing out of his soaked clothes.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged complex glances, their emotions conflicted, anxiously waiting.

But after quite a while, Yang Kai showed no intention of speaking.

Once dressed, he sat directly on a chair.

The two exchanged a look before steeling themselves to kneel together on the ground, speaking solemnly, “We have sinned; we ask the Young Master for punishment.”

Yang Kai gave them a sweeping glance, his expression indifferent, “What sin?”

Tu Feng's face was awkward as he replied in a low voice, “Because of our reckless behavior, we delayed the Young Master’s plans!”

At the very end, Yang Kai had mentioned to Lü Liang that he wanted to stay a few more days, clearly intending to provide a safe and stable healing environment for Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian understood this deeply, and because of this, gratitude welled up within them.

It was rare for a young master of the Yang Family to show such consideration for his subordinates. Their injuries weren’t critical, but if not treated promptly, they could lead to unforeseen issues.

After Tu Feng finished speaking, Yang Kai remained silent.

Tang Yuxian added, “Because of our matters, the Young Master was looked down upon by the Lü Family. We have sinned!”

The subtle shifts in Lü Liang’s attitude had not escaped anyone’s notice.

Why had he reacted that way? It was merely because Yang Kai had said he was bored and asked the two Blood Servants to spar for his amusement.

What were Blood Servants? They were experts who had loyally protected the Yang Family through countless generations, contributing immensely; they had even risked their lives to save the lives of direct descendants of the Yang Family.

In every generation, Blood Servants had carved their legacy with their blood!

The prosperity of the Yang Family was built on the backs of the Blood Servants!

The loyalty and sacrifices of the Blood Servants were plain for all to see.

Thus, while outsiders might dislike the Yang Family, they held immense respect for the Blood Servants.

However, now, two members of that group had engaged in intense combat merely to entertain a young master who hadn’t even returned to the family? They were as close as siblings and usually wouldn’t even quarrel, yet here they were fighting because of a somewhat inconsequential order.

They weren’t monkeys; how could they act this way just for amusement?

Yang Kai’s reckless abandon and sensuality had become glaringly apparent.

Hence, Lü Liang had that change in attitude.

If it hadn’t been for Yang Kai taking the blame upon himself, he wouldn’t have been so underestimated.

If word got out, people across the lands might think Yang Kai was a useless piece of refuse, which would greatly impact his future.

In an instant, the two Blood Servants pondered far and wide, feeling a sense of unease and guilt.

“What else?” Yang Kai said with a light smile while looking at them.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged glances, unsure how to respond.

“Get up.” Yang Kai chuckled, “I know that Blood Servants only kneel to their own masters. You haven’t fully accepted me yet, so this kneeling is waived!”

Both Blood Servants felt their faces flush.

Yang Kai’s words were blunt, yet reflected their thoughts. Throughout this journey, Yang Kai had indeed surprised and impressed them significantly, especially today, making them feel gratitude; yet, this was still far from complete submission.

“When that day comes where you are willing to follow me, you can come kneel then,” Yang Kai said calmly.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian awkwardly stood up.

Tu Feng smacked his lips, hesitating, “But now the Lü Family definitely no longer values you, Young Master…”

“I’ve said it; I have no thoughts about them. Whether they value me or not has nothing to do with me! If they underestimate me, that’s their own blindness!” Yang Kai grinned, his expression growing cold. “But you two should not pry into my matters from now on.”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian’s expressions changed slightly, recalling the overwhelming pressure from earlier, feeling a bit afraid.

They knew that their earlier probing had made Yang Kai uncomfortable, so they nodded in response.

What a joke! That kind of terrifying pressure—if they were to feel it any longer, they might truly be crushed to pieces. They couldn’t understand how Yang Kai had borne it.

“For these few days, focus on healing. Whenever your injuries are healed, we shall head back to Zhongdu.”

“Oh.” Tang Yuxian replied absentmindedly.

After this incident, it seemed Lü Liang also became less invested in Yang Kai. The upper echelon of the Lü Family unanimously believed that this Young Master of the Yang Family could not achieve anything significant.

Even though Lü Liang was astute and wise, he was still deceived by Yang Kai’s disguise.

With a sharp cry of an eagle, a Golden Feather Eagle descended from the sky, landing on Yang Kai’s shoulder, using its curved beak to affectionately ruffle Yang Kai’s hair.

The Golden Feather Eagle had not suffered while following Yang Kai; it had hunted for its food before reaching the Lü Family.

Upon arriving at the Lü Family, it enjoyed abundant provisions, with fresh meats supplied to it, saving it from the trouble of hunting. However, it only ate live prey, making every meal a bit gruesome.

Yang Kai gazed at the Golden Feather Eagle, dipped a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye onto his hand, and offered it to the bird.

For the past few days, Yang Kai had been feeding it a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye every day, and over time, the Golden Feather Eagle seemed to have become a bit more spirited.

However, Yang Kai still had some thoughts about this Golden Feather Eagle.

He was very curious to know whether it could evolve to the Sixth-Tier level and, if so, when would that happen?
