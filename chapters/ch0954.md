## Chapter 954 — The Heavens Have Changed

Ten thousand li from Shuilan City, in a mountain valley.

Yang Kai set down the rescued middle-aged man and Shui Ling, and the three of them looked at one another in silence, their faces grave.

Shui Ling was still weak; a Bone Clan member's Divine Sense attack had struck her and left her injured. The middle-aged man hurriedly took some pills from his Spatial Pouch and gave them to Shui Ling to take.

Watching her sit in meditation to recover, the middle-aged man finally relaxed and turned to Yang Kai, bowing solemnly with cupped hands: “Young brother, thank you for saving our lives just now. I am deeply grateful.”

“You’re welcome.” Yang Kai nodded lightly. “It was nothing.”

“Young brother, did you know Ling’er before?” the middle-aged man asked, puzzled as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and replied with a question instead, “You are Shui Yun, the Hall Master of the Water Divine Hall, aren’t you?”

“Exactly!” Shui Yun nodded. “How shall I address you, young brother?”

“Father, this is the Yang Kai I told you about!” Shui Ling interjected.

Shui Yun’s body trembled and he stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, exclaiming, “Shame on me, shame on me—I didn’t recognize you! So you are the Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!”

Once Yang Kai’s identity was known, Shui Yun’s manner of address changed immediately.

Nowadays on the continent, no one dares belittle the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

It was easy for Yang Kai to identify him: the Water Divine Hall had only one Saint Realm cultivator—the Hall Master Shui Yun—and coupled with his concern for Shui Ling, Yang Kai could naturally deduce his identity.

“Yang Kai, how are you here?” Shui Ling asked as she recovered, looking at him.

“Passing by.” Yang Kai frowned and asked in a low voice, “Where did those Bone Clan members come from in Shuilan City?”

“Bone Clan?” Shui Yun was taken aback.

“Those skeletons that can absorb the essence of flesh and blood!”

“Saint Lord Yang knows of them?” Shui Yun’s expression changed, and he asked anxiously.

Yang Kai shook his head. “Not very well. I’ve seen them before, and recently again. Senior Shui, do you know where they came from?”

Shui Yun’s face darkened. He sighed, “We don’t really know their origin. A year ago a melting iceberg drifted near the Water Divine Hall; disciples found a set of bones inside and out of curiosity brought them out, finding nothing of value. Everything was peaceful until a few months ago… for some reason those bones suddenly came to life…”

Shui Yun related the tale briefly while Yang Kai listened quietly.

He learned that after that Bone Clan member revived, it rampaged across the Water Divine Hall, absorbing the flesh-and-blood essence of the dead to rapidly restore its power. When Shui Yun realized what had happened he gathered all the hall’s experts and paid the price of over a dozen dead and wounded before finally capturing and imprisoning it.

But no matter how they struck it, they could not kill that Bone Clan creature; in the end they had no choice but to burn it.

That method did work—only then did it truly die.

They had barely enjoyed a few months of peace when, a few days ago, terrifying skeletons erupted from all directions and the Water Divine Hall instantly fell.

“Those skeletons… the Bone Clan members are extremely powerful. They have many Saint Realm masters; the weakest among them are at least Transcendent Realm, and there are no Divine Roaming Realm cultivators among them. After killing people they absorb their flesh-and-blood essence to restore and reshape their bodies. Two thousand disciples of my Water Divine Hall were slaughtered in a single night, and a dozen nearby isles were taken… the Water Divine Hall has been destroyed!” Shui Yun said in pain. “Few escaped. I am guilty and helpless; I could only bring Ling’er away from the islands to Shuilan City, but a few Bone Clan pursued us here and even Shuilan City has suffered terribly.”

“Father, it’s not your fault!” Shui Ling comforted him from the side.

“But the Water Divine Hall was destroyed because of me.” Shui Yun cried out in anguish.

“They may have come from the Glacier World.” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Glacier World?” Shui Yun stared at him in surprise.

“From the Ice Sect.” Yang Kai suddenly snapped alert. “In the past few months has your Water Divine Hall had contact with the Ice Sect? How are things over there?”

“The last trade was a few months ago, just days before that set of bones came to life…” Shui Yun answered.

“You stay here and recover. I’ll go check it out.” Yang Kai said, manifesting his Flying Shuttle and preparing to leave.

“Yang Kai, don’t go!” Shui Ling cried out urgently. “Those people are very powerful. It’s dangerous for you to go alone.”

“Yes. Their numbers aren’t many, but they have many Saint Realm experts, and after killing people they can replenish themselves. Saint Lord Yang, your path will be fraught if you go.”

“It’s fine. I’ll just take a look. If you sense any danger, leave this place. I’ll find a way to contact you.” Yang Kai gave a few hurried instructions and then vanished.

Shui Yun and his daughter wanted to stop him but were powerless to do anything.

“I hope he returns safe.” Shui Yun sighed heavily. Facing those terrifying skeletons, as Hall Master of the Water Divine Hall he was utterly powerless; if they hadn’t fled quickly even he and Shui Ling would have perished.

The memory of it still sent chills down his spine.

A streak of azure light flashed as Yang Kai sped toward the Water Divine Hall.

The Bone Clan had appeared en masse in the Water Divine Hall, taking the islands and slaughtering its two thousand disciples; they could not have appeared without cause.

If Yang Kai’s guess was correct, these Bone Clan creatures came from the Ice Sect.

The Ice Sect had long guarded the Glacier World precisely to prevent the Bone Clan from emerging. Yang Kai hadn’t thought deeply about it before, but now it made sense: the Ice Sect must know the Bone Clan hadn’t been exterminated but were hiding beneath the ice, so they remained stationed there.

However, they probably did not know exactly where the Bone Clan was hidden; when dormant these Bone Clan members resemble ordinary corpses and are difficult to detect.

But now a large number of the Bone Clan have appeared at the Water Divine Hall, and the situation at the Ice Sect looks grim.

Su Yan is still with the Ice Sect—of course Yang Kai was anxious.

Before long Yang Kai returned to Shuilan City.

The city was deathly quiet; no living souls remained. Even those of the Bone Clan were nowhere to be seen, and the corpses of the dead had all vanished.

Only ruined walls and bloodstained ground remained in Shuilan City.

Passing over Shuilan City, Yang Kai was instantly above the Water Divine Hall.

One oppressive aura after another rolled up from below, chilling the heart.

A chill seized Yang Kai’s chest. He released his divine sense to probe, and his expression changed abruptly.

Below there were at least dozens of Saint Realm cultivators and hundreds of Transcendent Realm; among them were even Saint cultivators of Second or Third Stages. Such a vast force no sect could resist—if they intended to dominate the Tongxuan Continent, they could do so with ease.

The heavens have truly changed!

Chu Lingxiao’s words from a few days ago still rang in his ears—and now they had come true.

Yang Kai moved with incredible speed and flashed past without any idea of stopping to meet those Bone Clan creatures.

As the azure light sped by, the highest-ranking Bone Clan members below all lifted their heads and looked in the direction Yang Kai had gone.

“Star Shuttle!” A middle-aged man with emerald-green eyes clasped his hands behind his back and gave a low, heavy cry, a flicker of delight surfacing in his gaze.

This Bone Clan member was completely different from those Yang Kai had seen earlier. He already possessed his own fleshly body and appeared no different from ordinary people—ruddy complexion and a powerful life force within—except for his pair of green eyes, terrifying and uncanny.

“Lord, that is the Star Shuttle we saw in that city just now. Shall we try to seize it back?”

The middle-aged man shook his head. “The Star Shuttle is too fast; we can’t catch it. Find out who that person is.”

“Yes!”

“Judging by how he looked, he’s heading to that glacier… what would he do there? What connection does he have with them?” the middle-aged man frowned, pondering.

Half an hour later Yang Kai arrived at the vast Glacier World.

The moment he entered, an unusual aura flowed through him.

Void energy!

He looked up and saw, dozens of li away and roughly ten zhang above the ground, the entrance to a Void Passage, and thick void energy streamed from within it.

Yang Kai’s expression changed.

He did not inspect where the Void Passage led but quickly sent out his divine sense to probe the Glacier World.

The result, however, left him bitterly disappointed. The entire Glacial World was devoid of life; the Ice Sect disciples who once dwelled here had long since vanished, and the icy peaks they lived upon had all collapsed. From the traces left behind, it was clear that a world-shaking battle had taken place here.

The pristine ice and snow had been stained crimson in many places.

A cold weight settled in Yang Kai’s heart.

He and Su Yan had long been in tune; as long as they weren’t too far apart they could sense one another clearly. Now he could not detect Su Yan’s presence at all…

One possibility was that she had died; another was that she had left this place.

Yang Kai’s face contorted and his aura surged wildly as he forced himself to remain calm.

After a long while he finally drew a deep breath.

He believed the latter possibility more likely.

Qing Ya, head of the Ice Sect, was a Third Stage Saint Realm warrior; several elders were also Saint Realm cultivators. Even if the Bone Clan had revived here and attacked, the Ice Sect could not have been completely annihilated.

Qing Ya must have escaped with them.

He raised his head and looked toward the Void Passage.

Although there was no direct evidence, he could conclude Qing Ya and the others had entered that Void Passage—if he were Qing Ya and unable to defeat the enemy, he would have chosen the same.

Wasting no time, Yang Kai plunged into the entrance of the Void Passage.

In an instant a crushing pressure came from all directions as if it would compress his body to powder; the ground under his feet vanished and countless stars dotted the surroundings.

A starry sky!

Yang Kai’s face changed; he had not expected this Void Passage to be like the starry-sky gate at Poxuan Palace—opening into the vast starry sky. The relaxed chord in his chest tightened at once.
