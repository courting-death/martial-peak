## Chapter 185 — Entering the Trap

Previously, seeing Yu Aoqing and the others in such a fluster while dealing with the strange insects, Yang Kai had thought these creatures would be difficult to handle. However, after taking action himself, he discovered that this was far from the truth.

Perhaps they were challenging for Yu Aoqing and her companions, but for him, it was simply effortless.

These little creatures had fragile wings and were of a low rank. As he charged forward, he found that he didn’t even need to strike; the scorching Yang Qi alone was enough to incinerate their wings.

Without the ability to fly, they posed no significant threat to Yang Kai.

Their only advantage was their overwhelming numbers and their ability to burrow underground, allowing them to move with great ease and often spring out from beneath his feet to launch surprise attacks.

Unfolding his movement technique, Yang Kai quickly broke free from the encirclement of the strange insects. After rushing forward for several li, he suddenly came to a halt.

He found himself confronted by a hazy mist blocking his path. It was the same kind of mist that had melted the ordinary person earlier!

What was going on? Had he run back? Yang Kai felt uncertain and hurriedly began to move along the edge of the mist, hoping to find a breakthrough to escape.

However, half an hour later, when a skeleton appeared before him, his expression changed.

This skeleton was none other than that of the ordinary person who had been melted before.

Refusing to give up, he continued running, but after a while, Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Not far ahead, there was another corpse, but it had been gnawed to an unrecognizable state. The clothing on the body was familiar to Yang Kai; it belonged to a disciple of the Yunxia Sect.

From the weapon beside him, it was clear that this person was Qi Yuan, the one he had thrown out earlier!

After running for so long, he had ended up going in circles! The area within a radius of several li was completely enveloped by that toxic mist.

Only then did Yang Kai realize that those strange insects were not as easy to deal with as they appeared. While they were indeed vulnerable to his scorching Yang Qi, he had no idea what abilities they possessed that allowed them to seal off such a vast area with their poisonous gas.

Unless he broke through the mist, there was no way to leave.

Could he withstand the erosion of that mist? Yang Kai felt uncertain. After pondering for a long time, he decided to test it out.

Approaching the edge of the mist, he slowly extended a hand with a cold expression. He activated the True Yang Technique to its limit, even using the Unyielding Will.

As soon as his fingertip touched the mist, Yang Kai swiftly recoiled like lightning.

A sizzling sound came from his fingertip, and looking down, Yang Kai's expression darkened.

The flesh at his fingertip was nearly melted, and a sharp pain shot through him. Without hesitation, Yang Kai severed that piece of flesh.

Tearing off a piece of his clothing, he wrapped it around the wound and took a deep breath, surveying his surroundings.

He had just separated from Yu Aoqing and the others nearby. But where were they now? With the mist enveloping the area, no one could escape, and there were no other corpses around. Where could they have gone?

Rustling sounds and buzzing filled the air…

Countless strange insects seemed to have caught the scent of blood and once again closed in on Yang Kai.

His expression changed, and he unleashed his True Yang Yuan Qi, charging toward the strange insects.

As before, it was effortless; after burning their wings, the insects fell like leaves, yet their numbers showed no signs of diminishing. In fact, they seemed to multiply. Who knew how many of these insects were hiding here, overwhelming in number and impossible to count.

While Yang Kai ran and killed these little creatures, he circled around the area for several large loops but still saw no sign of an exit, causing a wave of anxiety to rise within him.

Although he had plenty of Yang Liquid in his Dantian to support such a massacre, his physical stamina was limited. If he exhausted himself, even with an abundance of Yang Liquid, he would be left helpless.

“Young Master, these social insect-type demon beasts usually have a Bug King, much like bees,” the Earth Demon spoke at a critical moment.

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai asked, taking a brief moment to respond.

“The old servant means that if we can capture that Bug King, we might have a chance to escape.”

“Do you know where the Bug King is?”

“Ahem… the old servant does not know.”

Yang Kai had no time to blame the Earth Demon for his uselessness, but a possibility dawned on him.

Perhaps… these strange insects attacking him were not trying to kill him but were hunting him!

The disappearance of Yu Aoqing and the others, along with the absence of any corpses, was the best proof. It was highly likely that these Yunxia disciples had been captured by these strange insects and taken somewhere.

And that place was likely the lair of the strange insects!

Just like bees, some would gather honey outside and bring it back for the Queen Bee. Could it be that the actions of these strange insects could be interpreted as gathering honey?

The more he thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. A bold plan slowly formed in his mind.

After carefully estimating the success rate of this plan for a long time, Yang Kai finally withdrew his True Yang Yuan Qi, panting as he looked at the strange insects.

He no longer resisted, and surprisingly, the strange insects also ceased their attacks, instead surrounding him in layers.

“What are you doing, Young Master?” the Earth Demon exclaimed in shock.

“Conducting an experiment!” Yang Kai said with a serious face. He realized he could not escape the mist surrounding him. If he continued fighting like this, he would eventually exhaust himself and die. It was better to take advantage of the current opportunity to let them lead him.

If his guess was correct, there might still be a glimmer of hope for survival.

After a moment of standoff, dozens of strange insects suddenly separated from the group and flew toward Yang Kai.

The Earth Demon shouted, “Young Master, you can’t just sit and wait for death like this!”

“Shut up!” Yang Kai didn’t want to hear his nagging, focusing all his attention on the dozens of strange insects charging toward him, his entire being tense like a drawn bow, ready to strike again at the slightest hint of danger.

But to his delight, when the strange insects reached him, they showed no intention of killing him. Instead, they tugged and pulled at him, pushing him in a certain direction.

Just as he thought! A smile broke out at the corners of Yang Kai's mouth.

This explained why there were no corpses of Yu Aoqing and the others at this moment. It seemed they had also fought until exhausted and were captured by the strange insects.

Surrounded by tens of thousands of strange insects, the scene looked somewhat terrifying, yet Yang Kai remained calm, following the direction the insects were pulling him.

Before long, he arrived at a large pit.

Inside this pit was a dark cave, resembling the mouth of a beast ready to devour, looking extremely menacing.

At the entrance of the cave, Yang Kai spotted a torn piece of skirt, the color and fabric somewhat familiar. It belonged to Yu Aoqing.

They had indeed been captured.

His suspicions were completely confirmed. Yang Kai felt no fear. Without waiting for the strange insects to urge him, he jumped directly into the cave.

A foul, fishy odor assaulted him as he entered. Inside the cave, it twisted and turned, with tunnels dug out by the strange insects, appearing like a hidden world.

As Yang Kai walked through, he kept an eye on his direction while secretly leaving some marks along the way.

In the tunnels, he occasionally saw many strange insects scurrying back and forth. Moreover, these insects were not just the size of a bowl. It seemed there were many different kinds; some were as tall as a person, while others were as large as a washbasin or even a bucket, looking extremely frightening.

Damn it, he had actually become a prisoner under a swarm of insects! Once he found their Bug King, he would make them pay! Yang Kai’s emotions fluctuated.

Led by the strange insects, Yang Kai walked for a long time through the tunnels until he finally arrived at a relatively spacious area.

This could be described as a cave, but it was actually a storage place for these strange insects’ food. As soon as Yang Kai entered, he discovered several people from Yunxia, all in dire straits.

Many gazes turned toward Yang Kai, and he heard a series of malicious and gloating sneers, coming from Miao Lin.

The Yunxia disciples bore various injuries, sitting listlessly on the ground, all looking at Yang Kai with unfriendly expressions.

The strange insects brought Yang Kai to this place and then left, while outside the cave, several large insects, taller than humans, stood guard, clearly preventing these people from escaping.

Once inside the cave, Yang Kai ignored the Yunxia disciples and found a secluded corner to sit cross-legged.

Yu Aoqing glared coldly at Yang Kai. Seeing him close his eyes in meditation, she could not help but ask, “Who exactly are you?”

Yang Kai opened his eyes and glanced at her indifferently.

“Why did you sneak onto our Yunxia ship and hide your true strength? What is your ulterior motive?” Yu Aoqing pressed with a series of questions.

Yang Kai looked at her disdainfully and replied slowly, “First, it wasn’t me who snuck onto your ship; it was your Yunxia who brought me aboard. Second, if I were hiding my strength, would I still be alive now? Third, I only have one motive, which is to survive. Woman, stop acting so high and mighty. If it weren’t for your Yunxia capturing people everywhere, would I be here?”

“How dare you speak to me like that!” Yu Aoqing sneered.

“Do you think you’re so noble?” Yang Kai scoffed.

“Senior Sister Qing, don’t waste your breath on him. He just killed Senior Brother Qi Yuan!” Miao Lin glared at Yang Kai with hatred. “We must avenge Senior Brother Qi!”

“Ha ha!” Yang Kai laughed.

“What are you laughing at?” Miao Lin glared at Yang Kai through gritted teeth. “Do you not know how to write the word ‘death’?”

“Idiot!” Yang Kai looked at him with contempt. “While I was doing menial work on the ship, I heard this woman talking to your Elder Yu about throwing you into the sea once they reached the Hidden Island. How ridiculous that you are completely unaware!”

Yu Aoqing’s expression changed, and she hurriedly said, “I never said that!”

After saying that, she glanced at Miao Lin and explained, “Don’t listen to his nonsense!”

Miao Lin looked at Yang Kai and said, “Do you think I would believe your slander against Senior Sister? You don’t need to explain, Senior Sister; I know you wouldn’t do such a thing.”

Yu Aoqing nodded in agreement.

“Whether she said it or not, she knows the truth,” Yang Kai said coldly, looking at Yu Aoqing. “You better not think of making a move; otherwise, you might alert those insects!”

Yu Aoqing took a deep breath, suppressing the killing intent in her heart. She knew Yang Kai was right; while they were talking, the large insects guarding outside had already been disturbed and were peering in their direction.

Although she wanted to kill Yang Kai, she truly did not dare to act.

After the verbal confrontation, there was no flavor to the exchange. Yang Kai only intended to plant a thorn in Miao Lin’s heart. After all, they had the advantage in numbers, and if they truly resolved to deal with him, he would certainly come to a bad end. Only by fostering mutual suspicion could he ensure his own safety.
