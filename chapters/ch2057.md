## Chapter 2057 — Breakthrough to the Dao Origin Realm

Shentu stood dazed where he was; he parted his lips as if to say something, but the words failed to come out.

A single snowflake fell and landed atop his head.

In the next moment, with a soft plop where the snowflake had landed, Shentu's body split in two; bright red blood spurted from the ruptured corpse, his entrails scattered, and fell downward.

The Ghost-Hand Shentu, whose evil deeds had plagued the area around Fenglin City for countless years, thus died in such an inexplicable manner.

And in the next moment, the Yao Worm Matriarch that had taken him shook slightly and then vanished; no one knew where it had gone or where it hid.

The snowflakes drifting from the sky all melted at that moment, and the pervasive icy profound intent lingering nearby likewise dispersed.

In the distance, the onlookers erupted into an uproar.

Each of them widened their eyes and stared at the scene in the distance.

Though too far to see details, they could clearly make out the deaths of those dozen or so Void King Realm warriors and Shentu's fall.

The sheer visual shock made them feel as if they had seen ghosts in daylight; no one dared to believe what they had seen, and some kept rubbing their eyes as if to see more clearly.

“Shentu is dead?”

After a long moment someone murmured the question, their tone full of uncertainty.

“Shentu is really dead, he was killed by that man.”

“No, no, no, Shentu wasn't killed by that person; he was slain by another expert.”

“Indeed, there seemed to be friends guarding that man. That expert's strength is not trivial.”

“Good thing we didn't go attack that man earlier, otherwise...”

Many of the onlooking warriors breathed inward sighs of relief, feeling they had narrowly escaped disaster.

Upon realizing Yang Kai was not alone in his breakthrough but had experts secretly guarding him, those watchers no longer dared to remain where they were; almost as if in agreement, they all retreated dozens of li and watched from farther away, afraid of angering the hidden guardian.

On the other side, a group from the Qin Family was equally dumbfounded.

When Shentu and his party had come before, their momentum had been fierce, yet no one had expected their end to be total annihilation.

“Did you all clearly see who it was that ultimately killed Shentu?” Qin Yu's bright eyes flashed with an unusual light as she fixed her gaze on the place where the Yao Worm Matriarch had vanished, asking with some excitement.

Shentu was an expert at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; to be slain at a glance meant the killer was at least of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

If they could recruit that person into the Qin Family, the family's strength would instantly match the City Lord's Mansion, and the Qin Family would gain a powerful guardian.

Unfortunately, the Yao Worm Matriarch vanished too quickly; Qin Yu had no chance to see clearly.

Hearing her question, the Qin Family cultivators exchanged glances and all slowly shook their heads.

The middle-aged man said, “Miss, although I did not see clearly, that person seemed to be wielding twin sword Secret Treasures; are there any experts near Fenglin City who use such Secret Treasures?”

“Twin swords!” Qin Yu showed a look of thoughtfulness, and after a while shook her head, “I've never heard of it; twin swords are extremely difficult to use. If any local expert were proficient in twin-sword techniques, I would certainly have heard of them. It seems this person must be an outsider.”

The Qin Family cultivators all nodded inwardly, convinced.

“Not only was the guardian powerful, but the one on the verge of advancement is by no means ordinary.” Qin Yu pursed her red lips and looked toward Yang Kai's direction with shining eyes as if trying to see more clearly, but the dense Spiritual Qi surrounding that place prevented her from seeing Yang Kai's face.

The middle-aged man nodded. “Indeed, this person was at the crucial moment of advancement yet still managed to slay more than ten Void King Realm warriors; clearly extraordinary. What puzzles me most is why Shentu suddenly fled.”

Qin Yu's expression shifted. “Shentu is cruel and bloodthirsty; for him to flee indicates he suffered a heavy loss at that person's hands!”

“No way, Miss, that person was only a Third Stage Void King, not yet broken through to the Dao Origin Realm; Shentu is a genuine Dao Origin Realm expert!” the middle-aged man said in astonishment.

“Have you seen a Third Stage Void King cause such a fuss when breaking a major boundary? Look over there — it seems even the space itself is somewhat collapsing.” Qin Yu pointed ahead.

The middle-aged man gave an embarrassed laugh, “I'm only a Third Stage Void King myself; I've never witnessed anyone breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm. Though I haven't seen it, I don't think the scene would be this grand.”

“That's exactly it: the stronger the power, the greater the commotion!” Qin Yu's eyes rolled and she chuckled lightly, “I'm growing more and more interested in this person; if we could recruit him...”

The middle-aged man looked at Qin Yu and saw her excited expression; knowing she truly intended to recruit him, he said, “But we'll have to wait until he finishes his breakthrough.”

Qin Yu lightly nodded and murmured to herself, “He should succeed.”

At that moment, a muffled thunder rolled across the sky, an enormous, ear-splitting sound as if it would rend the heavens and earth.

In the next instant, the black funnel that had been spinning in the heavens seemed suddenly attracted by some force and hurtled downward.

And the very center of that black funnel pointed squarely at where Yang Kai stood.

Boom boom boom...

The sky shook and the earth vibrated; that enormous black aperture soon connected to Yang Kai, and unimaginable heaven-and-earth might poured down the funnel, frantically flooding into Yang Kai's body!

“This is impossible!” Qin Yu cried out, her pretty face paling.

The Void King Realm cultivators gathered around her all grew pale.

The middle-aged man shook his head in utter disappointment and said, "Just how far must one have defied the Heavens for the Heavenly Dao itself to resist him so? It looks like he won't survive."

It was true that when a cultivator broke through a great realm they would undergo a Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism, but each such baptism followed a set rhythm that allowed the cultivator time to breathe and recover; never had anyone during advancement, like Yang Kai, been directly connected to the Heaven-and-Earth Energy itself.

As a result, that funnel-shaped heaven's might continued to pour into Yang Kai's body without pause, leaving him no chance to catch his breath.

Which Third Stage Void King could withstand such an onslaught?

This was not a Baptism at all, but annihilation!

Even a true Dao Origin Realm expert coming here might be blasted to pieces at sight.

The earth seemed to shake even more violently; even from a great distance every watching cultivator could feel the ferocity of this Heaven-and-Earth Energy, something no mortal force could resist, and many grew pale.

A raging wind howled from far away and in an instant sand and rock flew across a hundred-li radius, dimming sun and moon alike.

The Qin Family formed a protective circle around Qin Yu, all activating their defensive powers to block the incoming rubble and broken timber.

From that distance, mingled with the roar of the wind, came a man's wild howl, like a wounded beast, chilling to the bone.

The sound naturally came from Yang Kai, at the very center of the energy's rage.

At the moment the Heaven-and-Earth Energy's Baptism struck his body, Yang Kai realized this was a grave problem.

His clothes were shredded in the blink of an eye; incomprehensible, vast energy poured from above through his acupoints into his body, flowing through his limbs and bones.

Even his robust body lasted less than ten breaths before skin tore and meridians throbbed painfully, giving rise to the sensation that he might explode and die.

Golden Blood spread through him, turning him into a figure of radiant golden light.

His strong regenerative ability showed itself; the ruptured flesh and blood repaired, but just as it mended it would rupture again.

Just as he was about to ignite the pure Golden Blood to sustain his Qi and life, a gentle force suddenly welled up from his flesh and meridians. The moment it appeared, it swiftly joined the work of mending his body, and at the same time sent his wavering Qi and blood surging upward.

The pressure greatly lessened!

Yang Kai's face lit with joy, and he hurried to hold onto the sliver of clarity in his mind, opening himself to accept the raging Heaven-and-Earth Energy while probing his body's condition.

The results were far better than he had imagined, and it was all thanks to that suddenly appearing gentle force.

Soon Yang Kai understood what that power was.

It was the medicinal potency of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup he had drunk previously.

After consuming the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup, he had secluded in the cave and cultivated for more than half a year, absorbing its effects to transform his flesh; yet the soup's medicinal power was so vast he couldn't assimilate it all at once, so the remainder had been stored within his flesh, meridians, and bones.

Only now did it spontaneously surface, becoming one of the primary supports for Yang Kai's advancement.

Relieved at the discovery, Yang Kai relaxed inwardly.

As the medicinal power of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup seeped from his flesh, meridians, and bones, Yang Kai felt far less pressure; his flesh no longer throbbed, his meridians no longer ached, and his bones ceased their creaking. With joy he focused on driving his power against the bottleneck to the Dao Origin Realm.

As time passed under the Heaven-and-Earth Energy's Baptism, both his body and inner power underwent a peculiar refinement, growing purer and stronger.

Especially his Origin Qi, which suddenly became much purer, equivalent to the gains of many years of arduous cultivation.

This unexpected boon filled him with ecstatic delight!

Half a day later, a cracking sound echoed from deep within his mind as some barrier collapsed; Yang Kai suddenly opened his mouth and let out a long, high-pitched roar that rolled like thunder across the fields.

Within that roar, the bottleneck that had plagued his advancement instantly cleared, and Yang Kai's already formidable aura leaped up another level!

Dao Origin Realm! He had successfully broken through!
