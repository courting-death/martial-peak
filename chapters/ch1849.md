## Chapter 1849 — The Whole City Knew

Inside the Tongtian Auction House, the main hall was spacious and bright; people came and went, and it was surprisingly bustling.

As soon as Yang Kai and Hua Youmeng entered, a young maiden with a beaming smile came forward, bowed respectfully, and said in a soft voice, “Your servant greets the two honored guests. May I ask whether you have come to reserve seats for some days hence, to consign an item for auction, or is there another matter?”

Yang Kai cast her a glance; under his powerful Divine Sense, the girl's cultivation was immediately exposed.

She was a First Stage of the Saint King Realm martial artist. Although her strength was not especially high, it was by no means low; placing someone like her in the hall as a maid could in fact display the Tongtian Auction House's grandeur.

Throughout the entire hall, there were at least eighty people of that sort.

“We have come to consign something.” Hua Youmeng recovered her usual composure and smiled faintly. “How should we proceed?”

The young maiden smiled sweetly. “If you have come to consign an item, our auction house does not accept items valued under one million. If the item you consign is worth more than one million, it meets the requirement. For items over one million but under five million, I can handle them. If the value is over five million but under fifty million, I do not have that authority and must call a steward to assist.”

“And if it exceeds fifty million?” Hua Youmeng asked in a low voice.

Hua Youmeng did not know exactly how much those thirty‑plus land deeds were worth, but they would definitely exceed fifty million Saint Crystals.

The girl's expression flickered, but she quickly bloomed into a smile. “If that is the case, they will be received personally by our auction house's Manager Li. Please, honored guests, this way!”

She understood that the value of the items the two were consigning was far beyond what she or a steward could handle, and without hesitation she led them further into the auction house.

The maid's heart fluttered with excitement; after all, in their line of work, if they successfully brokered a deal for a client they could receive considerable reward.

Yang Kai had not spoken once the entire time, standing behind Hua Youmeng like a bodyguard, which made the young maiden all the more convinced that Hua Youmeng's background was not simple and not dare treat her with the slightest neglect.

Passing through the bustling hall, the three soon arrived at a tranquil courtyard as if they had stepped into another world; the clamor outside vanished, replaced by little bridges, flowing water, and the tinkling of silk and bamboo, which refreshed the spirit.

After walking a short while along the winding pebble path, they came to an oval arch. The maiden produced from her Spatial Ring a device like a Transmission Compass and poured in Divine Sense.

In a moment, the arch flashed with light—clearly a sign that the restriction had been lifted.

Only then did the maiden turn, bow respectfully and say, “Please enter, honored guests; someone will receive you. I take my leave.”

With that she turned and departed.

Hua Youmeng and Yang Kai exchanged a glance, then crossed the arch and entered the courtyard.

A woman who appeared to be around forty came forward, made a graceful bow and asked, “Are you two guests here to consign items?”

“Indeed.” Hua Youmeng nodded in reply.

“Please follow me!” the woman turned to lead them, but as she did she cast a puzzled glance at Yang Kai, as if a little surprised.

Yang Kai gave her a meaningful smile. The woman's face changed slightly and her steps faltered.

After a short walk they arrived at a stone pavilion where the aroma of tea filled the air; a woman in a floral dress was brewing tea with elegant motions and a graceful bearing.

“Miss, the guests have arrived.” The other woman announced this and then stepped to the side to wait.

“Manager Li?” Hua Youmeng asked in surprise. She had not expected the auction house's manager to be a woman, and such an extraordinary beauty at that—on looks and temperament Hua Youmeng could not help but feel inferior.

Manager Li looked up at Hua Youmeng, pursed her lips, and playfully winked, “Oh? Do you suppose I should be a man?”

“No, no!” Hua Youmeng hurriedly waved her hand. “It is a little surprising, but... more than that I am impressed.”

Manager Li regarded Hua Youmeng with a surprised look, then as if understanding nodded and said, “It appears you are also a manager of a local force; we have something in common.”

“A humble little Commerce Guild like ours could hardly be compared to your esteemed establishment,” Hua Youmeng said modestly.

“A force is not judged by size; a manager bears all the hopes and life‑and‑death futures of their brothers and sisters—such a burden on the shoulders is heavy indeed.”

Hua Youmeng heartily agreed and nodded repeatedly.

The two women, upon meeting, immediately found common ground and seemed like old friends, as if ready to talk by candlelight late into the night.

The woman standing nearby cleared her throat, “Miss, the two guests are here to consign items!”

“Hehe.” Deacon Li gave an apologetic smile. “My apologies — something just stirred my thoughts for a moment. Please don’t mind me. Have a seat, both of you.”

Hua Youmeng hesitated briefly then took a seat as instructed.

Just as Manager Li was about to speak, she glanced down at a jade pendant at her waist; a moment later she lifted her head and regarded Yang Kai solemnly. “Honored guest, beg your pardon—this woman is dim‑sighted and earlier offended you; I hope you will not hold it against me.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai half smiled and glanced at the jade pendant at her waist, surprised. “This thing can sense my cultivation?”

“You must think me ridiculous, my lord,” Deacon Li said softly. “Here, people come and go every day, and there are always some experts who conceal their cultivation like yourself. I’m but a mere Origin Returning Realm cultivator and can’t see through such depths, so I had this device specially made—to avoid offending anyone important out of ignorance. I meant no offense.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. “I understand. But there’s no need to be so nervous, is there? Leaving aside that the Tongtian Auction House holds a respectable standing within Purple Star City—just having this lady by your side is protection enough, wouldn’t you say?”

As he spoke, Yang Kai smiled at the woman.

The woman blushed slightly and murmured, “Your strength is indeed profound. Not only did you elude my perception, you were even able to probe mine—I'm impressed.”

“Say no more.” Yang Kai smiled faintly. From the moment he first saw her he had noticed she was a First Stage of the Void King Realm, but she must have practiced concealment techniques so that no signs of the Void King Realm were apparent—only those stronger than her could detect them.

Yang Kai was now Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and his Divine Sense was incomparably strong, comparable to a Third Stage, so the woman's strength could not hide from him.

An auction house actually having a Void King Realm expert on hand suggested the Tongtian Auction House enjoyed considerable backing.

In just a few words the atmosphere inexplicably turned solemn.

Manager Li chuckled, “Let us not dwell on trifles. I imagine we all have our reasons—let us speak of business.”

Her shift in topic immediately softened the mood.

“Mm, I am Li Nuo. May I ask what the two guests have come to consign?” After introducing herself, she looked toward Hua Youmeng.

“It is this.” Hua Youmeng said as she took out the box containing the land deeds and set it before Li Nuo.

Li Nuo took the box with a suspicious look, examined it carefully, and found that while the box itself was precious it was not a priceless heirloom—clearly only a container.

Upon opening the box, the land deeds came into view.

Li Nuo drew them out; her beautiful eyes narrowed and she exclaimed, “These are...”

The other woman's gaze swept over the deeds, equally astonished. “Land deeds? Could these be land deeds for Purple Star City?”

“Indeed, all are land deeds for Purple Star City.” Li Nuo checked them one by one; her expression grew ever graver. “So many, and all on the same street?”

Hua Youmeng smiled faintly. “These deeds encompass the entirety of Tenglong Avenue.”

Li Nuo shuddered. Even she, who had seen countless storms and handled innumerable valuables, could not help but startle.

Land deeds in Purple Star City were already immensely valuable on their own; deeds covering the whole of Tenglong Avenue were astronomical in worth.

Deeds bundled together like that would at the very least double in value.

She suddenly seemed to recall something and looked at Hua Youmeng in astonishment, “Sister, could you be from the Five Directions Commerce Guild?”

“Manager Li has heard of our Five Directions Commerce Guild?” Hua Youmeng asked in surprise.

She was quite surprised. After all, the Five Directions Commerce Guild was hardly considered a major force within Purple Star City. There were at least eight to ten thousand small organizations like it, struggling to survive at the very bottom.

How could the Tongtian Auction House, with its considerable standing, have heard of the Five Directions Commerce Guild?

Li Nuo glanced meaningfully at Yang Kai and said, “I had not heard before; it was only in the past two days that I learned—word is someone from the Five Directions Commerce Guild dared to beat Deacon Min and a captain at the city gate, and afterward emerged unscathed, even forcing Commander Lu Tianfeng to personally come and apologize! When these deeds were brought out, I realized these deeds must be Commander Lu's compensation—only he could marshal such things.”

“Word spread that fast?” Hua Youmeng frowned.

“Perhaps it is not that the rumor spread so quickly, but that your auction house has effective methods and reliable information,” Yang Kai said with a smile toward Li Nuo.

Li Nuo’s delicate face flushed as she gave an awkward smile. “Doing business in Purple Star City naturally requires keeping one’s eyes and ears open—please don’t laugh at me, my lord. Yes, very few know about that apology matter; our Tongtian Auction House is one of them. But as for what happened at the city gates yesterday… I’m afraid the whole city knows by now. The Five Directions Commerce Guild’s reputation must have exploded overnight.”

“The whole city knows?” Hua Youmeng's face drained of color.

The small Five Directions Commerce Guild had suddenly become the focus of the entire city; it was likely more calamity than blessing. She cast a pleading look at Yang Kai; he smiled faintly and signaled her to remain calm, and Hua Youmeng then regained her composure.
