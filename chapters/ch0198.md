## Chapter 198 — The Troops Emerge from Yunxia Sect

The voice of a girl is inherently crisp and piercing. At this moment, it was early morning, and this place was the residence of the elders, with no surrounding noise to drown her out. When Zhong Miaoke shouted, it could be said to have reached ten li away, allowing all the disciples of Gu Yun Island nearby to hear her clearly.

The two senior brothers blocking her path turned pale in an instant, their legs going weak as they nearly collapsed to the ground.

The nearby disciples of Gu Yun Island, who were either walking or cultivating, after a moment of shock, felt a gust of wind beneath their feet and hurriedly fled. Zhong Miaoke's shout was as if she had unleashed a forbidden technique of absolute destruction, causing everyone to run for their lives.

It was over! Elder Han's peacocks have actually died! That was Elder Han's lifeblood! Although these peacocks were merely common beasts, they were raised by Elder Han's deceased wife, whom she had saved years ago. Elder Han was a sentimental man; after his wife's passing, he had projected his longing onto those peacocks, often visiting them, treating them with more affection than his own son.

But now... they were all dead!

All the disciples of Gu Yun Island who heard that statement could imagine how furious Elder Han would be. When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer; if they didn’t run now, they might be implicated when Elder Han's wrath descended.

“Y-you little girl, do you know what you’re saying?” The senior brother blocking Zhong Miaoke's way was terrified, his words tumbling out in confusion. He wanted to run, but he simply didn’t have the courage.

“Who is spouting nonsense?” A furious roar came from Elder Han's residence. The next moment, an old man with hair as white as snow shot out from within, landing before Zhong Miaoke and the two disciples of Gu Yun Island. It was Elder Han Zhao.

Upon closer inspection, Han Zhao's eyes were bloodshot, and he was only wearing his nightclothes, barefoot, clearly having rushed out without even changing his clothes or putting on shoes. The overwhelming pressure of the Divine Roaming Realm suddenly dropped, causing Zhong Miaoke and the two disciples to involuntarily shiver.

Han Zhao's eyes were filled with murderous intent. His gaze swept over, locking onto Zhong Miaoke as he sternly demanded, “What happened to my peacocks?”

Zhong Miaoke was so frightened she could hardly respond. Lowering her head, she held out the letter with both hands and respectfully presented it.

Han Zhao scrutinized the disciple responsible for caring for his peacocks, reached out to take the letter, took a deep breath to suppress his rising anger, and casually pulled out a yellowed page from within the letter, glancing at it.

In the next moment, Han Zhao's eyes widened in shock, like a quail exposed in the cold winter, trembling uncontrollably. He made choking sounds in his throat, as if a bone had lodged there, struggling to speak coherently.

The two male disciples, seeing this scene, felt a chill run down their spines, thinking to themselves that it was over. It seemed the death of the peacocks had dealt a significant blow to Elder Han. Even someone as strong as he, at the Divine Roaming Realm, was struggling to bear it.

“Elder Han…” Zhong Miaoke called out weakly.

Han Zhao seemed to awaken from a dream, hurriedly stuffing the yellowed page back into the letter. He stamped his foot in anger and scolded Zhong Miaoke, “Why didn’t you report such a major incident sooner?”

The two male disciples felt their hearts race and quietly took a few steps back, fearing they would be implicated. They looked at Zhong Miaoke with a mix of sympathy and pity.

Zhong Miaoke, feeling wronged, said, “I only discovered it this morning and rushed to report it. These two senior brothers wouldn’t let me in, so I shouted out!”

“Elder, it has nothing to do with us…” The two male disciples, their legs going weak, quickly knelt down to plead for mercy.

Han Zhao ignored them entirely, vanishing from sight in a flash.

Zhong Miaoke and the two were left stunned.

Before they could breathe a sigh of relief, Han Zhao returned, his hawk-like eyes sweeping over Zhong Miaoke as he asked in a deep voice, “No one else knows about this, right?”

Zhong Miaoke quickly shook her head.

“Good. Come with me!” Han Zhao grabbed Zhong Miaoke's arm and disappeared once more.

After waiting for a long time, the two kneeling disciples dared to slowly rise, exchanging bewildered glances, both feeling confused and speechless.

What was wrong with the elder? Had he lost his mind? The peacocks were all dead, so why was he praising that junior sister for doing well? Shouldn’t she be severely punishing her instead?

Moreover, with that shout from junior sister, it was likely that everyone on Gu Yun Island knew about it. How could it be that no one else knew?

At the residence of the island master of Gu Yun Island, Zhong Miaoke knelt in the great hall, surrounded by silence, with no one in sight.

After bringing her here, Han Zhao had not paid her any further attention, but Zhong Miaoke noticed that all the elders and protectors of the island were hurriedly gathering in this great hall.

A group of elderly men, all in their seventies and eighties, gathered together, seemingly discussing something.

After waiting for half a day, the group finally emerged, their expressions grave, each leaving in a flurry, leaving only Elder Han Zhao and the island master, Gu Feng.

The two approached Zhong Miaoke together, and Gu Feng said kindly, “Get up.”

“I dare not!” Zhong Miaoke lowered her head.

Gu Feng chuckled, casually tossing an object in front of Zhong Miaoke, and said, “Take this order, go to the Pill Hall to collect some pills you need, then go to the Yunsoul Cave to enter seclusion for cultivation.”

Zhong Miaoke trembled all over, looking up at Gu Feng in disbelief.

The Yunsoul Cave! That was the most concentrated place of heavenly and earthly energy on Gu Yun Island, where cultivation efficiency was three times that of other places. Only those with outstanding talent, deemed to have great potential by the elders, could go there. Someone like her, a mere nobody, wouldn’t even dare to dream of it.

But now, the island master had actually ordered her to enter the Yunsoul Cave for seclusion cultivation?

Moreover, she could also go to the Pill Hall to collect pills? This token in front of her was the island master's order, and holding it was like having the island master himself present, commanding all disciples of Gu Yun Island.

“Do not doubt it; this is what you deserve.” Han Zhao, who had never given her a smile before, was now looking at her with a beaming smile, his face warm and friendly, like a kind grandfather. He then changed his tone, saying, “But remember, regarding today’s matter, no matter who asks you…”

“I know nothing,” Zhong Miaoke replied, not being foolish and understanding how to respond.

Han Zhao nodded in satisfaction, waving his hand, “Go!”

“Thank you, Island Master! Thank you, Elder Han!” Zhong Miaoke expressed her gratitude, feeling as if she had struck a stroke of luck today. Just by discovering a letter at the door, she had received such tremendous benefits.

Who was the benefactor that left her this fortune? They hadn’t even revealed their name, and she wouldn’t be able to find them to repay her gratitude in the future.

Picking up the island master’s order, Zhong Miaoke floated out of the great hall, still feeling a sense of unreality, as if she were dreaming.

On Gu Yun Island, undercurrents were surging. Some astute disciples noticed that the island's experts were hastily gathering in one direction, not knowing what they were busy with, creating a vague feeling of impending storm.

At midnight, the experts of Gu Yun Island gathered in one place and boarded a large ship, heading in a specific direction.

On the ship were two hundred experts from Gu Yun Island, with the island master personally overseeing, the four great elders, and three protectors all mobilized. In addition, there were countless True Yuan Realm experts, with everyone on the ship being at least a Separation and Union Realm martial artist.

Except for a few who knew the truth, the others were completely in the dark.

The next day, at dawn, the large ship approached an island.

“Isn’t that Yunxia Island?” someone recognized it.

“What are we doing here?”

Although Yunxia Sect was merely a third-rate force, not comparable to the deep foundations of Gu Yun Island, it was still a sect. Generally, overseas forces developed independently, with no interference. No one had expected that this voyage’s target would actually be Yunxia Island. Were they going to war with Yunxia?

Gu Feng, a burly figure with eyes like lightning, aged yet still strong, stood at the bow of the ship and declared loudly, “This island master has received reliable news that the long-lost Transforming Moonbreaker Technique of Gu Yun Island is currently within Yunxia Sect.”

Transforming Moonbreaker Technique!

The entire ship erupted in an uproar. This was the supreme technique of Gu Yun Island, lost for three hundred years and never found until now. How could it suddenly appear in Yunxia Sect?

Gu Feng clearly did not wish to explain much further and continued, “Today, we will search Yunxia and must retrieve the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique to fulfill the wishes of our ancestors of Gu Yun Island. Those who resist will be killed without mercy! Those who speak falsely will be killed without mercy! This battle today is solely for the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique. If we can retrieve it, you will all be the contributors of Gu Yun Island!”

“Board the island!” Gu Feng commanded decisively, waving his hand as the experts on the ship rushed to land on Yunxia Island.

In just a short while, piercing screams erupted from Yunxia Island, interspersed with sounds of fighting and cursing. At this moment, it was dawn, the time of day when everyone was most relaxed. Gu Yun Island had come prepared and launched a surprise attack with overwhelming force. How could Yunxia Sect possibly resist?

The two remaining Grand Elders emerged to resist but were jointly killed by the elders of Gu Yun Island.

The Sect Leader of Yunxia Sect and the elders were unable to resist and were all killed. Wherever the experts of Gu Yun Island passed, chaos ensued.

On this day, Yunxia Sect was drenched in blood, with piles of corpses. The disciples on the island suffered heavy casualties, with all experts above the Separation and Union Realm slaughtered.

“I found it! I found it! I found it, hahaha!” Han Zhao trembled as he searched the body of an elder from Yunxia Sect, discovering a yellowed ancient book, which was indeed the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique of Gu Yun Island.

In a hurry, he brought this supreme technique back to the ship and handed it to Gu Feng.

The island master of Gu Yun Island was also filled with tears of joy, his voice trembling, “Heaven bless Gu Yun! After three hundred years, the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique has finally been found. Our ancestors of Gu Yun, you can rest in peace now.”

Han Zhao excitedly asked, “Island Master, what should we do with the remaining disciples of Yunxia?”

“Kill!” Gu Feng’s expression was cold and stern. With just one word, he decided the fate of Yunxia.

Regardless of how the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique ended up in Yunxia's hands or how many people had seen this unique copy, killing them all meant no one would know the secret of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique. To protect the supreme technique of Gu Yun from being leaked, what was the slaughter of an island worth?!
