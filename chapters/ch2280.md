## Chapter 2280 — Fate

"If you have something to say... come in and speak." Yang Kai tilted his head, pushed open the side room door, and walked in.

Ye Qinghan was momentarily stunned by his words, but the grievance on her pretty face instantly melted into joy. In a delicate voice, she said, "Thank you, Young Master Yang."

She hurried in after him, as if afraid Yang Kai would change his mind.

Inside the room, Yang Kai glanced around, not yet able to take in the furnishings and decorations, when Ye Qinghan had already taken quick, dainty steps, picked up a stool, and set it behind him. In a gentle voice, she said, "Young Master Yang, please sit."

Yang Kai glanced at her and, not standing on ceremony, flicked his robe and sat down in a grand manner.

Ye Qinghan picked up the teapot on the table, poured a cup of water for Yang Kai, and placed it before him, saying, “Young Master Yang, please have some water!”

After speaking, she waved her hand, and a fruit plate appeared on the table, filled with fresh, fragrant spirit fruits. She smiled and said, "I brought these out from Thousand Leaves Sect. I don’t know if they suit Young Master Yang’s taste, but I hope you won’t mind."

Yang Kai’s expression immediately became odd. He had never been served so attentively before, and secretly thought that if Ye Qinghan became a maid or servant, she would surely be very competent.

“Why are you running around so busily for me?” Yang Kai looked at her warily. “Don’t tell me you’ve taken a fancy to me? Let me be clear, though I am handsome, elegant, and adored by countless young ladies and married women...” He flicked his hair, then changed his tone and said seriously, “But I am already a man with a family, so you’d best not have any improper thoughts.”

Ye Qinghan blushed at his words and stammered, "What are you saying, Young Master Yang..." She was torn between laughter and tears—she had truly never seen someone praise themselves so shamelessly.

“Ah... isn’t that so?” Yang Kai looked embarrassed, gave a couple of dry laughs, and said, “Just joking, don’t mind it.”

As he spoke, he picked up a spirit fruit from the table, popped it into his mouth, and chewed with satisfaction, nodding repeatedly. “Go ahead, what do you want me to refine?”

“What?” Ye Qinghan was confused by his question, her face blank.

Yang Kai sneered, “Ever since you recognized me, you’ve been following me around, so attentive and thoughtful, all but offering yourself. Isn’t it because you want something from me?”

“Yes...” Ye Qinghan nodded lightly.

"Isn’t it to have me refine pills for you?" Ye Qinghan suddenly understood and smiled, "Young Master Yang’s alchemy skills are extraordinary. Even the Supreme Mystic Pill, a Spiritual Pill thought lost to the world, you can refine successfully. Your attainments and talent in this field are truly beyond ordinary people."

“It’s flattery, but it feels good.” Yang Kai grinned.

Ye Qinghan said, “But I came to see Young Master Yang not to ask you to refine pills.”

“Then what do you want?” Yang Kai frowned, now truly on guard.

Ye Qinghan explained, “Although my Thousand Leaves Sect isn’t a great Sect, we do have a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist, so there’s no need to trouble Young Master Yang for alchemy. I came to ask you to repair something.”

“Repair something?” Yang Kai raised his brows. “What is it?”

Ye Qinghan pursed her red lips, glanced around cautiously, and only after a long hesitation said, “A Space Array!”

“A Space Array?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, and he chuckled, “Looks like quite a few people know about my proficiency with space powers.” Back in the Four Seasons Land, he had used space abilities in front of many people, so it was impossible to keep it a secret. Yang Kai had expected this, but didn’t think Ye Qinghan would seek him out for this reason. Clearly, she wanted to use his space powers to repair that Space Array.

Ye Qinghan said, “I only heard it from others.”

Yang Kai said, “If it’s just repairing a Space Array, you don’t necessarily need me, right? Can’t those array masters do it?”

Ye Qinghan gave a bitter smile, “If it were an ordinary Space Array, those array masters could repair it. But the one in my Thousand Leaves Sect... we’ve already invited several array masters, even people from the Gong family, but none could fix it.”

“Even the Gong family couldn’t repair it?” Yang Kai was shocked, as if he’d thought of something. He asked in a low voice, “Could it be... a Realm-Linking Space Array?”

Ye Qinghan’s beautiful eyes lit up, and she nodded, “Young Master Yang truly has keen insight. It is indeed a Realm-Linking Space Array.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly. He glanced sidelong at Ye Qinghan and asked, “Your Thousand Leaves Sect has a secret realm?”

Ye Qinghan gave a bitter smile, “I knew I couldn’t hide it from you. Yes, my Thousand Leaves Sect does have a secret realm. It was originally a place for disciples to temper themselves. No one knows where it drifts in the spatial crevice, and there’s no way to enter except through that Space Array. But over two thousand years ago, the Space Array suddenly failed, and since then, we’ve been unable to enter.”

“Is that secret realm very important to your Thousand Leaves Sect?” Yang Kai asked.

Ye Qinghan nodded, "Back then, my Thousand Leaves Sect wasn’t as great as Qingyang Shrine or Tianwu Sacred Land, but it was still a first-rate force. Unfortunately, ever since the secret realm’s entrance closed, we’ve declined year after year, until now..." She trailed off, unable to continue.

Yang Kai sneered, “If the disciples don’t work hard, what does the secret realm matter? Not every Sect in the world has its own secret realm. If you’re truly diligent, it makes no difference whether you have one or not.”

Ye Qinghan’s pretty face turned pale, and she said bitterly, “Young Master Yang is right. But when the secret realm’s entrance closed over two thousand years ago, the Sect Master at the time took many of our sect’s inheritances inside, even our Ancestral Treasure... Without those inheritances, many of our Thousand Leaves Sect’s divine abilities can no longer be cultivated. Most crucially, our sect’s Spirit Gathering Array was set up using the secret realm as its source. Once the entrance closed, the spiritual qi in the sect...”

“I understand.” By now, Yang Kai had grasped Ye Qinghan’s meaning. Losing many inheritances and even the Ancestral Treasure was one thing, but the key was the loss of spiritual qi. For martial artists, spiritual qi was essential for cultivation. Once it thinned, the strength of Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples naturally declined with each generation.

Biting her red lips, Ye Qinghan said solemnly, “I wish to invite Young Master Yang to come to Thousand Leaves Sect with me and repair the Realm-Linking Space Array at the secret realm’s entrance. If you agree, both I and everyone in Thousand Leaves Sect will be endlessly grateful, and we will also present you with a generous reward.”

“Well... um...” Yang Kai’s eyes darted about as he tried to change the subject. After a long while, he couldn’t think of an excuse and could only say, “I understand the situation, but I’m very busy. How about this: you go back for now, and when I have time, I’ll visit your Thousand Leaves Sect. I won’t let you down.”

Ye Qinghan could easily tell he was brushing her off. If she really left as he said, she’d probably never see Yang Kai again, even if she waited until her hair turned white. She could only plead bitterly, “Young Master Yang, in this world, only those who understand space powers can repair our sect’s Space Array. But space powers are so mysterious and complex that ordinary people can’t even get started. I’ve heard there’s an expert on Spirit Beast Island in the Eastern Territory who is skilled in this, but that person is a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. How could my humble Thousand Leaves Sect possibly invite someone like that?”

"So you expect me to do it just because I’m merely at the Second Stage Dao Origin Realm?" Yang Kai shot her a look.

Ye Qinghan quickly waved her hands, “That’s not what I meant, Young Master Yang, please don’t misunderstand.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ve heard of that person too. Spirit Beast Island, huh...” Mo Xiaoqi seemed to be from Spirit Beast Island. Although she’d never admitted it, as Yang Kai learned more about the Star Realm and saw Aunt Feng’s terrifying strength, he gradually guessed Mo Xiaoqi’s origins. Only someone from Spirit Beast Island could command so many demonic beasts. Thinking of Mo Xiaoqi, Yang Kai wondered how that girl was doing now. He hadn’t been in the Star Realm long and didn’t know many people. Kang Siran, after advancing to the Dao Origin Realm, had been transferred away by Ziyuan Commerce Guild. Mo Xiaoqi had been taken back by Aunt Feng.

As Yang Kai’s mind wandered, Ye Qinghan bit her lip and said, “Actually, the reason I came to find you was because someone recommended you.”

“Which bastard was so shameless? Tell me, I promise I won’t beat him to death!” Yang Kai was instantly furious.

Ye Qinghan covered her mouth and smiled, “Gong Wenshan. Young Master Yang should know him, right?”

“That kid!” Yang Kai’s eyes bulged. “You know him?” Gong Wenshan was, of course, the rising star of the Gong family in Tianhe Valley. The Gong family were masters of arrays, and Gong Wenshan was an array master. Back in the Four Seasons Land, he had used the sealing power of the Time Temple to keep Wuchang out, causing the outstanding youth of Tianwu Sacred Land to miss a great opportunity. That kid looked simple and honest, but he was actually full of mischief! Yang Kai never expected that it was Gong Wenshan who recommended him to Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan replied, “A few years ago, I invited him to Thousand Leaves Sect to repair the Space Array, but he couldn’t do it. Senior Brother Gong said that to repair that array, you must find someone proficient in space powers. Three months ago, I received a message from him, telling me to seek out Young Master Yang. I was planning to go to Qingyang Shrine to try my luck after finishing things here, but I didn’t expect to run into you here. Young Master Yang, don’t you think this is fate...” She looked overjoyed, like a lovestruck maiden.

Yang Kai snorted, “Only lovesick fools talk about fate. Do you want to have fate with me?”

Ye Qinghan broke out in a cold sweat and said awkwardly, “Young Master Yang, you must be joking. I’m afraid I don’t have that kind of luck.”

“I’ve only met Gong Wenshan once, we’re not close. Whatever he said is his own business, nothing to do with me.” Ye Qinghan sighed deeply and said softly, “Young Master Yang, will you really not help?” She bit her lip, looking pitiful and delicate, a sight to stir anyone’s heart.
