## Chapter 1938 — Biyu Sect

The more Yang Kai learned about the Star Realm, the more he discovered the vast, radiant future hidden within this new world, and the clearer his own shortcomings became.

He was filled with a burning desire for greater power.

The two of them were speaking when Yang Kai's expression suddenly sharpened and his face grew grave.

"What's wrong?" Liu Qianyun looked at him in puzzlement, but the next moment she also sensed it, her whole body going rigid as she exchanged a white-faced glance with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised a finger and pressed it to his lips in a warning gesture.

Before Liu Qianyun could react, a flash of light appeared at the cave mouth and a figure brazenly materialized before them.

The two of them instinctively circulated their Saint Yuan, readying themselves, standing shoulder to shoulder and warily looking toward the newcomer.

The newcomer showed no intention of concealing his presence, coldly regarding Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun with a sneer: "Two little mice sure are alert."

With the dim light, Yang Kai made out the other's face.

He looked like a man in his thirties, dressed in white and possessing an unusual air, but what made Yang Kai uneasy was the other's aura — a fathomless force far more oppressive than what he had felt from Yin Lesheng in the Starlight Passage.

Dao Origin Realm!

That thought flashed through Yang Kai's mind and his expression darkened further.

He and Liu Qianyun were both elites in their respective Star Domains; hiding in a cave had masked their auras. Ordinarily a Void King Realm cultivator would never have noticed them.

But if the other was of the Dao Origin Realm, it explained how their presence had been detected.

Yang Kai had no concrete understanding of how powerful a Dao Origin Realm cultivator truly was; he only knew such a realm was far beyond what he could contend with now.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The sound of ruptured air came from outside, and three figures followed the man into the cave.

One of them asked, "Senior Brother Kou, any discoveries?"

Another exclaimed in surprise, "Huh, there really are two people hiding here — Senior Brother Kou is impressive for detecting that."

The last one laughed heartily: "Senior Brother Kou is a First Stage Dao Origin expert; these two are just like us. How could they possibly play tricks under Senior Brother Kou's nose?"

All of them were men. After entering the cave they looked at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun with sneering eyes; the one who had spoken first glanced meaningfully between Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, his gaze lingering on Liu Qianyun's fine figure as he chuckled lowly, presuming the two were engaged in some shameful act.

Liu Qianyun flushed with humiliation but did not dare lose her temper.

Yang Kai remained silent as well.

Not to mention the three Third Stage Void Kings among them, even the leading Dao Origin expert alone was overwhelmingly beyond what he and Liu Qianyun could match, so Yang Kai could only act according to circumstances. Fortunately they had not attacked outright, or things would have been grim for the two of them.

The leading man surnamed Kou cast a cold glance at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, his look growing ever more contemptuous as he snorted, "Your Origin Qi is so scant yet you possess the cultivation of a Void King — where do you two come from, and what are you scheming in my Biyu Sect's territory?"

"Biyu Sect?" Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged astonished looks.

They began to suspect this place was territory belonging to a sect called the Biyu Sect, and that they had accidentally trespassed and thus been discovered by its disciples.

Relieved by the thought, Yang Kai cupped his fist, "Greetings, friends. We did not know this was your sect's land and entered by accident. If we have caused offense, please forgive us. Rest assured, we will leave at once."

As he spoke, Yang Kai gave Liu Qianyun a look.

Liu Qianyun understood at once and prepared to follow Yang Kai out of the situation.

The man named Kou and the others stood at the cave mouth without moving, showing no intention of letting them pass.

Kou sneered, "'Entered by accident'? Spare the lie for children — do you take Kou for a fool? Be honest: are you people from the Cuiri Pavilion?"

"Cuiri Pavilion?" Yang Kai frowned and shook his head, "Sorry, never heard of it."

"They're putting on a convincing act," one of the men behind Kou scoffed. "Senior Brother Kou, don't waste words on them — take them back and give them a proper 'welcome.' They'll confess soon enough. How dare they trespass on Biyu Sect territory; those Cuiri Pavilion types clearly don't respect us."

Kou likewise bore a cold expression: "Better to kill in error than to let them escape!"

As he finished speaking he formed a hand seal and uttered a low shout, pointing remotely at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

Two bursts of force shot out, striking the unsuspecting Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun in the chest.

The two were startled and tried to resist, only to see rope-like constructs appear on their bodies, covered with rice-grain sized rune patterns that flickered incessantly, completely sealing off their internal power.

The harder they struggled, the tighter the secret binding became.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun's faces changed dramatically.

A casual move had stripped them of any fighting capability, and they fully realized the terror of the Dao Origin Realm.

Having done all this, Kou no longer looked at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, waving his hand: "Take them away!"

He then turned and strode out, giving them no chance to protest.

Yang Kai was furious but knew now was not the time to act.

The three cultivators who had followed Kou surged forward, pushing Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun out of the cave.

Liu Qianyun twisted her body and gritted her teeth, "Don't touch me — I can walk myself!"

The man who had been leering at Liu Qianyun sneered, "This little woman has a fiery temper; I like that. I wonder if she can take the pain later."

The other two exchanged knowing, suggestive looks.

That made Liu Qianyun feel even more distressed.

She had once been a dominant force in the Great Wilderness Star Domain; arriving in the Star Realm she had not yet seen its wonders, and now she had been captured and bound as a prisoner — something she had never experienced in her life and could hardly accept.

From the way the three talked, it sounded as if worse torments awaited them at Biyu Sect...

Thinking of the possible treatment, Liu Qianyun's pretty face turned pale as she looked to Yang Kai for help.

"Everyone, there must be some misunderstanding — could you at least hear me out?" Yang Kai said, composed but making a final attempt.

"Explain? You'll have time to explain once you're inside the sect," the Kou cultivator snorted.

"Right. Hand over your Spatial Rings first if you don't want to suffer more!"

Yang Kai glanced at Liu Qianyun, then slowly shook his head and handed over his Spatial Ring, tossing it to the nearest man.

There was nothing particularly valuable in his ring, only common items used in daily life. Truly precious treasures were kept in the Demon God's Secret Codex or the Small Xuan Realm.

Thus surrendering the Spatial Ring meant nothing to him emotionally.

Liu Qianyun struggled, unwilling; if her power had not been sealed she would have fought fiercely.

All of her possessions were stored in her Spatial Ring — how could she bear to give it up?

But standing beneath their watchful gaze, she had no choice but to bow; unwillingly, like Yang Kai, she slipped off her Spatial Ring and hurled it toward one of them.

The men secured both Spatial Rings but did not casually inspect them; instead they presented them to their Senior Brother Kou, who was greatly pleased and casually pocketed the rings.

In a short while they left the cave.

Kou casually produced an item that lengthened until, in the blink of an eye, it became a carved tower-ship, dragon and phoenix motifs embellishing its hull, giving off a grand aura.

The tower-ship was not large, only two stories, but it easily accommodated the group.

With a casual motion, Kou enveloped Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun in his own force, and they drifted down onto the deck as light as feathers. The others' forms flashed, and one by one they materialized aboard the ship.

Then Kou urged the ship's power and activated its formation; a shimmering energy membrane enveloped the vessel and it flew forward at great speed.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun looked on in astonishment, their eyes full of wonder.

In their own Star Domains they had never seen such a craft; the most common were Star Shuttles and Warships.

Though this tower-ship was not as vast as a Warship, its craftsmanship far outmatched anything a Warship could boast, and in practicality it could not be compared to a Star Shuttle.

It occupied a niche between Star Shuttle and Warship, perfect for traveling long distances.

Kou and his companions ignored Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, since their powers were sealed and they could not cause any trouble.

Seeing their expressions, the Biyu Sect disciples could not help but chuckle, gathering to whisper and point at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun as if mocking them.

The two of them felt embarrassed.

For former Star Domain overlords to behave like country bumpkins upon entering the Star Realm was indeed unbecoming.

Kou noticed their reaction and frowned slightly, but said nothing, focusing instead on controlling the ship's speed and course.

After flying for roughly half an hour, a densely packed cluster of buildings appeared amid the mountains ahead; Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun realized at once this was the Biyu Sect's mountain gate, and both, curious about the sects of the Star Realm, stood to peer over the deck.

The next moment they were struck dumb.

As far as the eye could see — for tens of thousands of li — mountains rose and fell, jagged and rugged, all bearing signs of construction; it was clearly all within the Biyu Sect's domain.

The entire sect stood amidst the encircling peaks with an aura that swallowed heaven and earth; this might was in a completely different league from the sects of even a Star Domain, and even Yang Kai's Lingxiao Sect was not on the same level as this Biyu Sect.
