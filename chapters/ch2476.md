## Chapter 2476 — Reunion with Wu Mengchuan

When the fatty asked, Red Ghost replied, "I sensed something strange and came to check."

The fatty said, "So did we!"

Red Ghost was stunned by these words. He glanced at the Emperor shrouded in black qi and said, "Wasn't it you, Yao Si, who did something?"

The Emperor called Yao Si snorted coldly and said, "What makes you think I did something?"

"Just a guess..." Red Ghost sniffed.

The robust young man said in a low voice, "It's not Brother Yao Si's doing. The Origin Power has been flowing in this direction. This little island seems to be the source of the issue."

As soon as he said this, five pairs of eyes all turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face darkened. He said, "Why are you all looking at me? I don't even know what you're talking about. What exactly happened? Why aren't you all staying in your own places to absorb and refine the Origin, and instead coming here to make a fuss?"

The young man in tight clothes frowned and said, "In the past half month, the Origin Power in the Origin Sea has decreased dramatically, and all the flow points to this place. What do you think we're here for?"

Yang Kai's eyes widened, his expression innocent as he exclaimed in shock, "Really? No way!"

His words couldn’t have sounded more fake. The decrease and flow of Origin Power was obvious to anyone—let alone Yang Kai, even a cultivator with a much lower cultivation could sense it. Yet here he was, acting completely clueless, which only made him look more suspicious. But strangely, his expression didn’t seem like he was lying. Especially his eyes—clear and bright, calm as a still lake, without the slightest hint of pretense.

This made the five of them doubt themselves, unsure if they were mistaken.

However, the flow and decrease of Origin Qi had just stopped in a strange way.

"It really has nothing to do with you?" Red Ghost asked with a frown.

Yang Kai snorted, "I'm just at the Dao Origin Realm. How could I pull off something like this right under your noses? If the decrease in Origin Power here really was caused by someone, it definitely wasn't me. It must have been one of you, yet you want to pin it on me! That's despicable! Whoever did it, own up!"

Seeing how righteously he spoke, the others grew doubtful again. Although all signs pointed to this island as the source, Yang Kai wasn't wrong—how could a Dao Origin Realm cultivator like him do such a thing?

The young man in tight clothes mused, "The anomaly in the Origin Sea started half a month ago. At first, it wasn't obvious, but it became more and more pronounced. And you, brat, arrived here half a month ago."

Hearing this, the other four looked at Yang Kai with odd expressions, full of suspicion.

The timing was just too much of a coincidence.

"You can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want!" Yang Kai glared at him. "If you keep talking nonsense, friend, don't blame me for being rude!"

"Rude to me?" The young man in tight clothes widened his eyes, as if he'd heard the funniest joke in the world. He grinned and said, "I'd like to see how you'll be rude to me."

After all, he was an Emperor. Although Yang Kai had taken a blow from him earlier and seemed strong, he really didn't think Yang Kai could be his enemy.

If it really came to a life-and-death fight, he believed he could take Yang Kai's life within three moves.

"Enough, enough. Since it's not a problem here, then something must have gone wrong with the Origin Sea itself." No one knew what Wuchang meant by this, but he stepped in to smooth things over, helping Yang Kai out of his predicament.

Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously, but Wuchang pretended not to notice and said, "Instead of arguing over baseless things, why not go back and absorb and refine more Origins? Although a lot has been lost, there's still enough to meet everyone's needs."

The fatty nodded. "Mm, that's right."

The young man in tight clothes and Red Ghost seemed to have no better ideas, but the Great Emperor's son, Yao Si, said in a deep voice, "Brat, whether or not the Origin Sea's anomaly was your doing, you must leave this place now. This is a place for Emperors. With your current strength, you have no right to be here!"

Yang Kai turned his head to glance at him, a cold chuckle escaping his lips. “You say I’m not qualified—who gave you the right to decide that? Did you ask me first?”

This man wanted to drive him away; of course Yang Kai wouldn't cooperate. Although he'd already taken much of the Origin Power from the Origin Sea, there was still plenty left. The laws of heaven and earth in the Small Xuan Realm weren't yet complete, his Incarnation hadn't shown signs of breaking through to the Emperor Realm, and he himself hadn't sensed a breakthrough opportunity. Leaving now would waste everything he'd gained.

Yao Si's eyes narrowed as he said coldly, "Leave or die! You have three breaths to choose!"

"Try it!" Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance.

Everyone was shocked, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment.

If it were any other newly advanced Emperor, it would be one thing. But although Yang Kai was only a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he seemed quite strong and had some reason to be proud. But who was Yao Si? He was the son of a Great Emperor!

The descendant of the Great Emperor Youhun of the Eastern Territory!

All the Emperors present were wary of him. While they weren't exactly afraid, they didn't dare speak to him like this.

Yet Yang Kai actually told him to try it!

Where did this brat get the nerve to speak to a Great Emperor's son like that?

The young man in tight clothes was especially stunned, thinking this guy was a fool. Why had he bothered arguing with a fool earlier? He shook his head, feeling Yang Kai was doomed. If he offended him, he might just get a harsh beating, but if he offended Yao Si, there'd be no way to survive.

Wuchang's expression also changed, but he said nothing more. He'd helped Yang Kai earlier because they were both from the Southern Territory. In the Southern Territory, he could fight Yang Kai all he wanted, but here in the Shattered Star Sea, in front of experts from the other three territories, he couldn't just watch Yang Kai get bullied.

But now he realized Yang Kai was simply unreasonable, provoking a Great Emperor's son like this—what good could come of it?

Too rigid and easily broken. This brat was still too young and hot-blooded.

For a moment, the atmosphere froze, and even the void seemed to fill with a chilling murderous intent.

Yao Si looked at Yang Kai indifferently, his eyes icy as if staring at a dead man. Unexpectedly, Yang Kai showed not the slightest fear. That blazing gaze even made Yao Si's heart waver a little.

Yao Si's face darkened. Just as he was about to attack Yang Kai, a streak of rainbow light shot over from the distance, as fast as thunder, and instantly appeared above the group.

Everyone's eyes narrowed as they looked up, not knowing who had arrived so ostentatiously.

As the rainbow light faded, a burly middle-aged man suddenly appeared.

He stared wide-eyed at the people below, his expression wild with excitement, his eyes shining as if a starving beast had found its prey.

But very quickly, he shuddered all over, gulped hard, and his expression stiffened.

The six people below glared at him like tigers, and five of them were Emperors!

He'd come in high spirits, but never expected to be greeted by such a scene. He was so startled he almost turned and fled on the spot.

Although he didn't care much about ordinary Emperors, there were five here. If a fight broke out, he definitely wouldn't be able to handle it.

"Oh!" Yang Kai exclaimed softly, looking at the newcomer with bright eyes, both surprised and delighted.

He was surprised because he knew this person, and delighted because he'd planned to seek him out after the Shattered Star Sea ended, but now the man had come to him instead.

Wu Mengchuan!

Sect Master of the Biyu Sect, descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor!

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art was taught to Yang Kai by Wu Mengchuan, but Yang Kai had never dared to cultivate it himself and left it to his Incarnation, who found it quite enjoyable and advanced rapidly.

But recently, the Incarnation felt a bottleneck in his cultivation, suspecting it was due to the technique. Perhaps the Heaven Devouring Battle Art Wu Mengchuan had passed on to Yang Kai back then was incomplete.

Yang Kai wanted to find Wu Mengchuan to ask about the Heaven Devouring Battle Art and get the complete technique from him. Otherwise, his Incarnation's cultivation might remain stuck forever.

Back then, Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and no match for Wu Mengchuan. But now, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he no longer needed to fear him.

Each with their own thoughts, the two met here by chance, both extremely surprised.

"What kind of stray cats and dogs dare come here now?" The young man in tight clothes, seeing that Wu Mengchuan was also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, curled his lip in annoyance.

Earlier, he'd let Yang Kai in because Yang Kai had taken a blow from him, and he was eager to absorb and refine the Origin Power here, not wanting to waste time or energy on Yang Kai. But now, another Dao Origin Realm cultivator had come to this Emperor Realm territory.

"Just kill him!" Red Ghost snorted coldly.

Wu Mengchuan was shocked by this. Although he didn't know what the six below were up to, it was obvious from the five Emperors' unfriendly stares that he was in trouble. He quickly wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, "Sorry, sorry, I intruded by mistake. I'll leave right away, please don't be angry."

As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai, his expression a bit strange, then turned to leave.

He had recognized Yang Kai and remembered teaching him the Heaven Devouring Battle Art in the Bone Prison years ago, but sensing up close, he couldn't detect any trace of the technique on Yang Kai.

This left Wu Mengchuan completely baffled.

He could sense that the mature seed's aura was coming from here, but by the time he arrived, it had vanished. Instead, he unexpectedly ran into Yang Kai.

His mind was filled with confusion—he had no idea what was going on.
