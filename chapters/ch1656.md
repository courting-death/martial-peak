## Chapter 1656 — Star Lord Falls

Icebound Island — countless disciples trembled; the island's seals and formations had long since been shattered by that horrific eruption of energy.

At this moment Icebound Island was, for all intents and purposes, completely undefended.

Luo Li's face flickered, then she suddenly barked, "Quick, have every disciple take refuge in the underground chamber!"

Bing Long froze for a beat, then recovered and hurriedly produced a Transmission Compass, pouring her Divine Sense into it.

In no time at all, every disciple of Ice Heart Valley received the order and surged toward the underground chamber.

Only Bing Long and a dozen or so elders remained by Luo Li's side, staring up at the sky’s phantasmal lights and the energy upheaval with sheer, stunned horror.

With Luo Li guarding them, at least they had the courage to stand there.

Far above the cloud tops, at a place beyond the naked eye, two dreadfully fearsome auras were clashing — those of Yang Kai and Su Yan, and of Luo Hai!

Though the dozen or so elders could not clearly make out the situation, the terrified shouts that came from Luo Hai from time to time made it plain that he was thoroughly on the back foot.

From the clouds, crimson blood rained down, and each drop contained an appallingly potent force, round and gleaming like jewels; when they struck the ground they punched out enormous pits.

It was the blood of a Void King Realm expert!

"Grand Elder…" Bing Long tremulously called out, "what is the situation now?"

Luo Li's deep eyes fixed on the void; when she heard the question she murmured, "Luo Hai is likely done for."

A chill of horror washed over everyone — they could hardly believe their ears.

Luo Hai was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert; even if a Third Stage expert were to strike personally, he would not necessarily be able to slay him. At his level, even when outmatched one could often escape and live to fight another day.

Yet Luo Li had given the assessment that Luo Hai was finished.

That meant there was a very real chance Luo Hai would die here today.

Could Yang Kai and Su Yan, united as one, unleash a combat power more terrifying than a Third Stage of the Void King Realm? Was this the might of the Star Emperor Token? For a moment everyone stood dazed.

At that moment Yang Kai's loud, exhilarated laughter echoed through the sky, threaded with Luo Hai's frantic curses.

The heavens were a chaotic shroud; the upheaving spatial forces made the battlefield's space collapse, and vast spatial rifts prowled about like the gaping maws of beasts.

Crimson blood kept pouring down, falling onto the ice peaks of Icebound Island.

The destructive forces toppled many of the ice peaks and the whole island lay in ruin.

Bing Long and the others were horrified — this tier of battle was beyond their reach; even if they tried to watch, they could not discern anything clearly, nor feel the aftershocks and ripples of that combat, nor glean anything from it.

Only Luo Li alone could barely see some of it.

But as time wore on and the field above grew more chaotic, even she could no longer discern the situation over there.

Luo Hai's curses had long since fallen silent; he seemed to have no strength left, barely clinging on.

Yet his aura was visibly weakening.

"Die!" Suddenly Yang Kai's furious shout issued from the void, and at the same time Luo Hai's terrified scream rang out.

A halo of light burst forth, radiating in all directions and sending ripples that violently spread to distant reaches.

Great torrents of blood rained down as if from the sky; there were even severed limbs and chunks of flesh.

The aura that belonged to Luo Hai abruptly vanished.

Luo Li's pupils shrank to pinpoints; her delicate body trembled.

She had sensed what had just transpired.

The earth-shattering battle fell silent at that moment; the dozen or so elders of Ice Heart Valley did not dare draw a breath, each staring in horror at the void.

The chaotic sky began to clear, and the vast rifts started to mend.

Gradually, a gold-and-white light mass merged into view, and Luo Hai was nowhere to be seen.

It seemed as though a gaze was cast forth from within that sphere of light, overlooking all directions from above.

That gaze was cold and emotionless, with a faint trace of crimson hidden within it.

All who met that gaze could not help but quake.

Luo Li involuntarily took a deep breath and swallowed; her heart leapt into her throat.

However, what put her mind at ease was that the faintly crimson gaze within the sphere of light soon withdrew. A soaring dragon’s roar and a clear phoenix cry rang out, and the light sphere flickered once before suddenly vanishing from sight.

No one knew where it had gone.

The dozen or so elders of Ice Heart Valley were long unable to quiet their racing minds; no one dared speak. Each sent out their Divine Sense cautiously to probe the area.

Only when half a day had passed without the light mass reappearing did they gradually relax.

Yang Kai had shown no intent to finish the slaughter; otherwise Icebound Island would certainly have run red with blood.

……

Cuiwei Star, the Star Lord's Divine Palace.

At the very center of the Star Lord's Divine Palace was a vast plaza, and in that plaza stood a humanoid statue some thirty zhang tall; it was clearly the work of many hands, exquisitely carved with an uncanny spirit.

That statue was modeled on Luo Hai himself.

As Star Lord, Luo Hai naturally enjoyed such an honor; this statue in the Star Lord's Divine Palace symbolized his position as the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star.

Beneath the statue, many martial artists sat cross-legged, seemingly attempting to glean teachings from the statue; each was entranced, their minds immersed.

Then there came a soft cracking sound; the movement was noticed at once. The warriors in the front frowned and opened their eyes to look around, seeking the source, but found nothing suspicious.

Just as they were about to close their eyes and return to their contemplation, another cracking sounded — this time clearer than before.

Finally they detected it and looked up toward the huge humanoid statue.

What they saw left them dumbfounded!

"Lord Luo Hai's statue is cracking!"

"What? Impossible. How can Lord Luo Hai's statue be cracking?"

"This statue is linked to the Stellar Origin and to Lord Luo Hai's own qi; if the statue is cracking now, does that mean Lord Luo Hai himself is in danger?"

"Nonsense — Lord Luo Hai, as Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, is enlightened and his cultivation reaches the heavens; how could he be in danger…? Huh, it's really cracking."

The news swept through the assembly like a gale, and the thousands of martial artists present all craned their necks. Watching the crack widen and lengthen, each was stupefied and filled with foreboding.

“Everyone, rest assured. Lord Luo Hai is bound to the fate of Cuiwei Star itself. Even if he encounters danger, he will surely turn misfortune into blessing and return safely. There is no need for such panic.”

"Indeed — a man like Lord Luo Hai could not lightly perish. Don't make a fuss." Someone immediately chimed in, their admiration for Luo Hai obvious.

But before the words had fallen, the great humanoid statue suddenly produced a great tearing sound; then the towering figure split into pieces and instantly shattered. Massive stones rained down from above, mercilessly smashing into the ground.

Those nearby were stunned, their gazes trembling as they hurriedly deployed movement techniques to flee.

Rumbling …

The statue's collapse sent the plaza into tremors and a plume of dust.

At the same time, the whole of Cuiwei Star seemed to shudder; those with slightly stronger cultivation could feel that the star's Spiritual Qi had weakened compared with before.

"Lord Luo Hai… has fallen?" After a momentary stillness and shock, the thousands of practitioners on the plaza immediately understood what had happened.

The statue was bound to Luo Hai himself and to the Stellar Origin of Cuiwei Star; there was only one plausible explanation for its inexplicable destruction.

Luo Hai was dead!

The crowd could hardly believe it.

A powerhouse like Luo Hai could actually die?

"Who did this? Which bastard did this? If I find out, I'll tear him to pieces!" someone roared in fury, their face twisted.

"Whoever killed Lord Luo Hai is an enemy of Cuiwei Star — anyone who sees them, kill them on sight!"

"Kill them on sight!"

The plaza echoed with furious shouts as countless martial artists bristled with righteous anger.

Whether or not they had any personal connection to Luo Hai, whether they had ever met his face, Luo Hai was the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star; his fall affected the star. The lost Yuan Qi could not be restored quickly unless some other Void King Realm expert came to Cuiwei Star to refine the Stellar Origin.

In short, Luo Hai's death inflicted a certain degree of loss upon all of Cuiwei Star.

The killer of Luo Hai naturally became their enemy.

While the crowd shouted and raged, many pulled out Transmission Compasses and poured their Divine Sense into them, relaying the earth-shattering news to friends, family, and their sect elders.

A day later, everyone on Cuiwei Star knew that Star Lord Luo Hai had fallen!

A month later, the news had spread across the entire Star Domain!

The Star Domain trembled!

Regarding Luo Hai's death there was much speculation — some said those reclusive old monsters had struck and slain him, others said he had ventured into a perilous place and could not escape. As for exactly how he died and who killed him, no one knew for now.

But it was undeniably explosive news; Void King Realm experts are not numerous across a star domain, and the death of any one could cause considerable uproar.

Moreover, the one who died was the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, Luo Hai, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm existence.

The news soon reached Chi Lan Star. Grand Elder Luo Li of Ice Heart Valley ordered that none of the island's disciples speak of what had happened that day, or she would personally purge the sect; the disciples all obeyed.

To be frank, only the dozen or so elders of Ice Heart Valley truly knew what had happened that day; the ordinary disciples did not know what had occurred, only that a titanic battle had erupted above Icebound Island and who fought and who triumphed remained indistinguishable to them.
