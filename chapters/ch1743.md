## Chapter 1743 — Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill

Cups clinked and laughter rang out as one warrior after another came to offer a toast; Yang Kai accepted every invitation, his smile modest and his composure steady, pouring and receiving wine in such a way that everyone present felt warmth toward him.

He chatted and joked with Gu Jianxin, occasionally casting a glance at the exquisite dancing taking place below.

Time flew; as the wine flowed and spirits rose, the hall’s atmosphere grew ever more lively and intense.

Most of the warriors present were bold and free-spirited; such an unrestrained banquet was the perfect place for their natures to show. Those who followed Gu Jianxin drank heartily and laughed boisterously.

Although Gu Jianxin had taken more than his share, he was far from drunk; throughout the evening he had been observing Yang Kai closely.

A figure as dazzling as Yang Kai, who had suddenly emerged in the Star Domain, naturally aroused Gu Jianxin’s curiosity—he had come to the feast hoping to glean some clues.

To his disappointment, he had discovered nothing of real use.

When Yang Kai looked down at the slender young women dancing, his gaze was clear, without the slightest lust; and when drinking with his subordinates he had behaved with the utmost propriety.

In short, Yang Kai was indeed someone worth befriending.

After several rounds of wine, Gu Jianxin suddenly spoke: “Brother Yang, I have a somewhat improper request—may I speak freely?”

At that, the noisy hall quieted considerably; though those present continued to shout and drink as before, many could not help but turn part of their attention toward Gu Jianxin’s words.

“Speak plainly, Brother Gu.” Yang Kai set down his cup and smiled faintly.

He was a little surprised. Throughout the banquet he had been seeking the right moment to bring up the matter of He Zao and He Miao with Gu Jianxin, yet he had never found the opportunity—now Gu Jianxin had spoken first.

He did not yet know what this improper request might be.

“It’s like this.” Gu Jianxin’s expression grew serious. “On this trip I was ambushed by people led by that old dog Li, and suffered considerable losses. Though old dog Li deserved death, he was after all a senior of my Sword Alliance. The Soul-Breaking Spear he used was forged for him by a Void King-Grade artificer at tremendous cost; it counts as Sword Alliance property. Now that he is dead, by rights I should bring the Soul-Breaking Spear back to the main star and report everything to the Alliance Master.”

He looked at Yang Kai with some embarrassment.

Yang Kai immediately understood what he meant.

“Brother Gu wishes to reclaim the Soul-Breaking Spear?”

“Mm.” Gu Jianxin’s face showed an awkward smile. “I know this request is presumptuous—old dog Li was killed by you, so the spear should rightly belong to you. But without the Soul-Breaking Spear I cannot answer to my superiors when I return, so I wish to take it back. Rest assured, Brother Yang: I can guarantee compensation equal to the spear’s value; as for the other things on old dog Li’s person, you may keep them yourself—they were not Sword Alliance property.”

“Is that so.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, his face taking on a contemplative look.

Gu Jianxin did not press him, only waited in silence.

At some point the hall had fallen silent; every eye was turned toward them.

After a long moment Yang Kai said, “The Soul-Breaking Spear is a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure of no small worth. Brother Gu, if I were to return the spear to the Sword Alliance, what compensation could I request?”

“So long as the value does not exceed that of the spear itself, I will see to it,” Gu Jianxin replied gravely.

Yang Kai chuckled. “If Brother Gu is so sincere, I will not be polite; that treasure is of no use to me anyway.”

He could not use a spear-shaped Secret Treasure, nor did he know anyone suitable to wield it, so returning the Soul-Breaking Spear posed no burden.

As he spoke, Yang Kai drew the Soul-Breaking Spear from his Spatial Ring and placed it before Gu Jianxin.

Gu Jianxin gave a signal; Sword Servant Lingyue immediately stepped forward and took the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure away.

“Brother Yang’s generosity overwhelms me. What would you have as compensation? The Sword Alliance is not the strongest power in the Star Domain, but we possess a fair stock of precious cultivation materials and Spiritual Pills; if you desire a cultivation technique or secret art, I can endeavor to procure it for you.”

Gu Jianxin was sincere in his offer and meant to make amends for Yang Kai’s loss as thoroughly as possible.

Yang Kai smiled inscrutably. “Compensation can wait; I will discuss it with Brother Gu later.”

“Not discuss it now?” Gu Jianxin was taken aback.

“Mm, I wish to ask—who here is Elder Qin Wuhui?”

Swish, swish, swish…

Nearly everyone in the hall turned their gaze in one direction. Yang Kai followed their eyes and saw a thin, spry elder in a dingy gray robe, sitting inconspicuously at the lower seat nearest Gu Jianxin.

That he could sit in the first seat made clear how high his standing here was.

Yang Kai asked his name; Qin Wuhui looked puzzled, rose, cupped his hands and said, “I am Qin Wuhui; the title ‘elder’ is undeserved. Young Lord Yang, what may I do for you?”

“Please, elder, do not be so polite,” Yang Kai smiled. “I wish to present you with something; I hope you will not refuse.”

“Present me something?” Qin Wuhui was bewildered to the point of being at a loss.

He was certain he had never met Yang Kai before and had no prior dealings with him; for such a man to suddenly offer him something left Qin Wuhui thoroughly baffled.

Before he had time to think, Yang Kai casually tossed a jade-like bottle that flew directly to him.

There was not the slightest trace of Saint Yuan about it; Qin Wuhui caught the jade bottle in one hand and asked in astonishment, “Young Lord Yang, this is—”

“Elder, you may open it and see.” Yang Kai smiled. “Then you will know what is inside.”

Qin Wuhui frowned and glanced toward Gu Jianxin, who laughed heartily: “If Brother Yang offers it, Old Qin should take a look. The Young Master is curious too—I wonder what Brother Yang has in mind?”

Qin Wuhui nodded and, under the gazes of all, removed the cap and poured a single Spiritual Pill from the jade bottle.

The pill was snow-white and about the size of a soybean; the moment it entered Qin Wuhui’s sight his expression brightened, the suspicion on his face shifting to excitement, surprise, and disbelief all at once.

He held the Spiritual Pill to his nose to sniff it carefully, even sticking out his tongue to taste it.

Then he cried aloud, “This is… the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill?”

“What?” The hall erupted as if a cauldron had boiled over; many warriors exclaimed while they stared at the pill in Qin Wuhui’s hand and then at Yang Kai, as if seeking an explanation from him.

A gleam passed through Gu Jianxin’s eyes as he regarded Yang Kai thoughtfully. “Brother Yang, is this truly the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill?”

“Elder Qin has keen eyes; this is indeed the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill.”

Upon Yang Kai’s confirmation, Qin Wuhui nearly lost his composure from excitement.

Even Gu Jianxin drew in a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Brother Yang, what generosity!”

“Merely two Spiritual Pills.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Young Lord Yang, why…” Qin Wuhui regained his wits, clutching the jade bottle, his face full of puzzlement as he looked at Yang Kai, unable to understand why Yang Kai would suddenly offer him two Seven Orifices Exquisite Pills.

“I heard that Young Master Qin suffered damage to his spirit many years ago during a battle, and the wound has never fully healed. This Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill should serve as a proper remedy. Though I dare not claim it will bring an instant cure, it should certainly aid in slowly restoring the damaged soul.” Yang Kai smiled as he looked at Qin Wuhui. “With proper care and nourishment in the days to come, he will surely recover.”

Qin Wuhui looked back at Yang Kai, his face filled with emotion.

Qin Qiyang’s matter had long been a torment in his heart. Over the years he had been searching for a Spiritual Pill to heal his useless son; despite his status and Gu Jianxin’s backing, nothing had borne fruit.

Spiritual injuries to the spirit were not ordinary wounds; they were not something common Spiritual Pills could repair. Minor wounds might be managed, but Qin Qiyang had been harmed to the point of idiocy—that was a foundational injury.

Rumor said only a handful of Spiritual Pills could completely heal such wounds, and those pills were all but extinct. Either the formulas were lost, or the materials could not be obtained.

The Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill was one such recipe. Qin Wuhui could recognize it because over the years he had studied many texts and knew the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill required a principal ingredient: the Inner Core of the Seven-Colored Stag.

The Seven-Colored Stag was an ancient aberrant species long gone from this Star Domain; it was essentially impossible to find.

Even if one existed, the Inner Core of a Seven-Colored Stag could be used to forge treasures like the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense—who would waste such a rarity to refine the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill?

Yet Yang Kai had suddenly produced two of them!

Qin Wuhui clutched the jade bottle, his lips trembling; he could not find the words to speak.

“Brother Yang, I have heard the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill is an ancient Spiritual Pill that can enhance a warrior’s comprehension and even possibly improve innate aptitude—can this really be true?” Gu Jianxin asked.

Enhancing comprehension and improving aptitude—such a pill would be a heaven-defying existence.

Generally, comprehension and aptitude were innate; external forces could not change them unless some extraordinary fortune intervened.

Hearing Gu Jianxin speak thus, everyone present grew solemn; if his words were true, the value of these two Spiritual Pills would far surpass that of the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure Soul-Breaking Spear.

A Secret Treasure is but an external aid, whereas aptitude and comprehension form the very foundation of a cultivator. Between the two, which holds greater weight was plain to see.
