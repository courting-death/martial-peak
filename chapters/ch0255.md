## Chapter 255 — In a Dilemma

“Yao He is dead, do you know?” After a long silence, Chi Xue finally spoke, his eyes narrowing slightly, flashing with a dangerous light, as if warning Zi Mo that her answer would determine her fate.

Zi Mo felt a chill run through her body and frowned, “I killed him!”

Chi Xue's narrowed eyes suddenly widened, and he said in a deep voice, “You killed him?”

“Yes!” Zi Mo replied, unafraid.

“Give me a reason!” Chi Xue snorted coldly, his face devoid of warmth.

Zi Mo trembled slightly and answered, “They killed my Demonic Beast, took my Control Soul Insect, and destroyed a thread of my Divine Sense!”

Chi Xue furrowed his brows, looking at Zi Mo with suspicion, “Why did they do this?”

Zi Mo sneered, “Senior Brother, you already have the answer in your heart, why ask me?”

Chi Xue closed his eyes, nodding slightly after a moment, “Indeed, they dared to act against you, it is their own doing!”

Hearing this, Zi Mo couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. If Chi Xue truly intended to stand up for Yao He, things would become quite troublesome. Fortunately, Chi Xue still had some semblance of a Senior Brother and did not indiscriminately punish Zi Mo.

“However... you alone cannot kill them,” Chi Xue said indifferently, “Who helped you?”

Zi Mo bit her red lip, remaining silent.

Chi Xue cast a casual glance at Yang Kai, his expression cold as he said, “I will not interfere in the conflict between you and Yao He. After returning, Master will handle it fairly. But... if outsiders act against them, you should know how to deal with it!”

“I understand,” Zi Mo replied softly.

“Then... kill him!” Chi Xue pointed at Yang Kai, his expression fierce, his tone unyielding.

Yang Kai's heart skipped a beat, and he became secretly vigilant. He had not expected Zi Mo's Senior Brother to be so decisive and ruthless.

Zi Mo raised her head, a flicker of struggle appearing in her eyes.

She certainly could not harm Yang Kai. As long as she had this thought, before she could act, Yang Kai would be able to put her to death. But Chi Xue was right in front of her, pressing with overwhelming force. No matter how clever and intelligent Zi Mo was, in this moment, she did not know how to resolve the dilemma before her.

No matter how she chose, it was impossible to satisfy both parties.

“Join me. There is no need for him to protect you, why not act?” Chi Xue urged coldly.

Zi Mo's chest rose and fell, her expression filled with struggle, unable to make a firm decision.

After a long while, Zi Mo suddenly looked up, forcing a bitter smile, “I cannot kill him!”

Chi Xue's eyes narrowed, his voice chilling, “Why?”

Yang Kai sneered inwardly, waiting for Zi Mo's response. Once she attempted to reveal her secret, she would face a heart-wrenching punishment!

“Because... I like him!” Zi Mo's gaze was firm, her cheeks slightly flushed. After saying this, she added, “I am already his person. So I cannot harm him!”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, staring at Zi Mo in disbelief. He had not expected this woman to come up with such a clumsy excuse.

Chi Xue was equally astonished, looking at Zi Mo with deep disappointment, gritting his teeth as he said, “What did you say?”

“I said, I like him. I am already his person!” Zi Mo boldly declared, her expression much more natural the second time she spoke such words.

Chi Xue laughed in anger, “You have fallen for a Great Han martial artist?”

“Yes!” Zi Mo secretly glanced at Yang Kai, only to see him looking pleased with himself. Anger welled up in her heart, wishing she could slap him a few times to vent her frustration.

Even though she knew this reason was too flimsy, at this point, she truly could not think of a better excuse, especially since this man was so smug, completely unaware of her inner turmoil.

Chi Xue's face darkened, his gaze shifting between Yang Kai and Zi Mo. Taking a deep breath, he said, “Indeed, you did not plant a Control Soul Insect! It seems you are not lying!”

Yang Kai's heart sank. Chi Xue's words inadvertently revealed an important piece of information; he seemed to sense the presence of the Control Soul Insect.

“I have no need to deceive you!” Zi Mo forced a smile.

“Good, good!” Chi Xue's True Yuan surged, killing intent spreading, “Since you are so unloving, allowing a piece of trash from the Great Han to easily possess you, there is no need for Senior Brother to favor you any longer. This time when we return, I will report everything to Master. Just wait to accept your punishment!”

Zi Mo's delicate body trembled, falling silent.

“As for him...” Chi Xue coldly looked at Yang Kai, “If you are unwilling to kill him, then let your Senior Brother do it for you!”

As his words fell, the dozens of Demonic Beasts controlled by Zi Mo suddenly stood up, baring their teeth at Yang Kai, looking ferocious.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly, his gaze cold as he looked at Zi Mo.

Zi Mo hurriedly explained, “Run! Senior Brother's Control Soul Insect is of a higher level and can influence my Control Soul Insect!”

So that was it! Hearing Zi Mo say this, Yang Kai felt relieved. Initially, he thought Zi Mo was secretly planning to attack him, but it seemed he had wronged her.

“Can you escape?” Chi Xue snorted coldly, the dozen Demonic Beasts becoming even more ferocious, surrounding Yang Kai completely.

Zi Mo's face turned pale in an instant, sweat pouring down as she desperately tried to control her Control Soul Insect while urgently shouting to Yang Kai, “You must leave! Why are you still standing there?”

Yang Kai remained unmoved, his gaze fixed on the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath Chi Xue.

Chi Xue sneered, issuing commands in his heart. The dozen Demonic Beasts leaped up simultaneously, pouncing towards Yang Kai. Zi Mo exerted all her strength to control them, but it was still futile.

Yang Kai's expression was grim, his figure flickering as he broke free from the encirclement of the Demonic Beasts. His Yuan Qi surged within him, his left hand forming the White Tiger Seal, and his right hand forming the Divine Ox Seal, the two seals merging into one.

A beam of ghostly light shot from his palm, heading straight for the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

“Roar...” A thunderous roar erupted as the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath Chi Xue opened its mouth to roar, a visible massive wind blade spewing forth, colliding with Yang Kai's Slave Beast Seal, the violent energy clashing in mid-air, and the Slave Beast Seal was directly shattered.

“Overestimating yourself!” Chi Xue snorted coldly. He was unaware of the intricacies of the Slave Beast Seal, thinking it was merely an attack method Yang Kai had used. However, Yang Kai's action had exposed his true strength.

Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm! Realizing this, Chi Xue became even more furious.

If this person was truly a genius from the Great Han, it would be understandable for Zi Mo to fall for him, but he clearly had not even reached the True Yuan Realm, so how could he have the qualifications to win Zi Mo's heart?

As the Senior Brother of this lineage, Chi Xue felt deeply ashamed. His determination to eliminate Yang Kai grew stronger.

“Kill!” Chi Xue did not even intend to personally intervene, raising his hand to wave, and the dozen Demonic Beasts controlled by Zi Mo lunged forward once more.

Yang Kai's figure flashed again, ignoring the dozen Demonic Beasts and Zi Mo's calls, running straight towards the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

Seated atop the Demonic Beast, Chi Xue sneered repeatedly, looking down at Yang Kai's struggles and resistance with disdain.

“Your footwork is decent, but your strength is too weak!” Chi Xue commented arrogantly.

The Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath him seemed to understand its master's thoughts, opening its mouth once more, this time unleashing a continuous series of roars. Accompanied by the roars, one after another half-foot-long wind blades spiraled out, fiercely attacking Yang Kai's path.

Yang Kai dodged left and right, fully focused on avoiding the attacks, never ceasing his approach towards the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

As the distance closed, Chi Xue's expression finally changed slightly. He realized he had underestimated the speed and footwork of this Great Han martial artist. The dozen Demonic Beasts controlled by Zi Mo could do nothing against him, and his own Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast could not attack him at all. In just a few breaths, Yang Kai had already approached within five zhang of him.

“Humph!” Chi Xue's face was filled with anger, his eyes fixed on Yang Kai, his expression extremely cold.

Three zhang... This Great Han martial artist's speed increased again, leaving a shadow in place.

Chi Xue's senses were sharp. Suddenly, he sneered and sidestepped, launching a palm strike.

The wind from the palm howled. Just as the palm force erupted, Yang Kai's figure appeared, looking as if he had collided with Chi Xue's attack.

A beam of ghostly light shot from Yang Kai's palms, striking the body of the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath Chi Xue.

At the same time, Yang Kai hastily clashed with Chi Xue, accompanied by a light sound. His body flew far away like a kite with a broken string.

“Unfounded!” Chi Xue frowned. He found that this Great Han martial artist had desperately charged over, only to strike his Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast with a beam of ghostly light. Although it hit, his Demonic Beast did not react much; instead, it was he who, after clashing with him, had certainly sustained some injuries.

With a “thud,” Yang Kai landed, staggering back several steps before stabilizing himself, taking a deep breath to suppress the rolling blood in his chest, a hint of astonishment flashing in his eyes.

“Impressive!” Yang Kai praised without reservation.

No wonder they were elites from a superpower; even if it was just a small branch, such strength was not something ordinary people could compare to.

“It is too late to beg for mercy now!” Chi Xue's expression was icy, “Junior Sister, Senior Brother can give you a chance. As long as you kill him, I will speak well of you in front of Master, and I can even help you hide the secret of losing your innocence, so it won't affect your status in the sect. Otherwise, if this matter spreads, you will find it hard to survive.”

Zi Mo shook her head without hesitation, “I cannot act against him!”

Attacking Yang Kai was equivalent to digging her own grave; Zi Mo understood this very clearly.

“Fine, you chose this path, do not regret it later!” Chi Xue, not knowing the reason behind it, was naturally filled with disappointment. He reached out to pat his Demonic Beast, coldly staring at Yang Kai, “I do not know what means you used to conquer my Junior Sister, but... the women of Tianlang Kingdom cannot be possessed by you Great Han men, so you must die!”

Having said this in an imposing manner, Chi Xue awaited Yang Kai's demise. However, moments later, his expression changed, and he looked down at his Demonic Beast in astonishment.

Just now, he had commanded his Demonic Beast to attack, but it had shown no reaction at all.

The Control Soul Insect was still there; how could this be?

In doubt, Chi Xue issued another command in his heart. This time, the Demonic Beast did respond, but instead of attacking Yang Kai, it leaped up and landed heavily, directly sending Chi Xue flying away.
