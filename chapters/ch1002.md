## Chapter 1002 — Star Sect Token

"Origin Returning Realm?" Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment.

"Above the Saint King Realm is the Origin Returning Realm, and above the Origin Returning Realm lies the Void King Realm... I told you, every cultivation star has a Star Lord stationed there, and each Star Lord is an expert of the Void King Realm! What is the highest level of the cultivators from the continent you came from?"

"Third Stage of the Saint Realm..."

"Truly a low-tier continent, no wonder—who knows which backwater corner of the Starry Void it's stuck in!" Shen Tu sneered with contempt. "There are indeed many such continents in the Star Domain; they don't even possess the ability to explore it. Generation after generation their descendants remain confined to their own continents, never witnessing the marvels of the Starry Void."

Yang Kai felt a strong resonance with those words, recalling the cultivators on the Tongxuan Continent—indeed, they were much the same.

"Then what am I hiding for? No one dares touch me now anyway." Once Shen Tu grasped the situation, the worry he had been carrying dropped away, the tension in him instantly easing as he carelessly sat cross-legged and began to dissolve the effects of the Saint Pill.

While healing, he chatted idly with Yang Kai, trying to learn what had happened during the day.

He seemed very interested in that old man and repeatedly questioned Yang Kai about the elder's circumstances.

"That old fellow... cough, cough, why did that elder pick up so many warship fragments?" Shen Tu frowned and pondered, but could not make sense of it.

"You'll have to ask him that."

"Hey Yang Kai, tell me... if we could gain that elder's protection, wouldn't we never have to fear the people from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance again?"

"That kind of high-level person—do you have anything that could move him?"

“Where there’s a will, there’s a way!” Shen Tu gave a mysterious grin. “Just wait—once I’ve recovered, I’ll see if I can help you remove the restriction in your body. You’re really too inconvenienced like this.”

Yang Kai lightly nodded. He didn't put much hope in it, but he appreciated Shen Tu's good intentions.

The two fell silent. Shen Tu focused on recuperating while Yang Kai sat at his side keeping watch.

After roughly two hours, Lü Guichen and Yue Xi returned, both wearing expressions of helplessness; it seemed matters hadn't progressed smoothly. They each returned to their respective camps.

"Master, what did the elder say?" Wei Wu stepped forward and asked respectfully.

Yue Xi shook her head bitterly. "We didn't even see his face."

"Ah!"

“Lü Guichen and I sent a Divine Sense transmission to him from fifty li away from that mountain, requesting an audience, but he never responded. I don’t even know if he’s still there.” Yue Xi sighed.

Dealing with such a mysterious high-level figure is truly a troublesome task: unknown identity, unknown origin, and unknown cultivation level. Both Yue Xi and Lü Guichen had tread with extreme caution during the attempt to meet him.

In the end, however, they were deeply disappointed.

The sole consolation was that, despite the elder's ferocious and wicked appearance, he did not create wanton slaughter; otherwise, in such a continent they would have nowhere to hide.

"We'll prepare to visit again tomorrow; let's leave it at that for today." Yue Xi shook her head and was about to rest when He Miao suddenly called out in a sweet but frightened voice, "Master."

"What is it?" Yue Xi turned to look at her.

He Miao pointed toward the distant sky, a trace of terror flashing across her pretty face. "That elder seems to be coming."

Yue Xi's body shivered; she hurriedly followed the direction pointed out and indeed saw the mysterious elder swiftly approaching. Her expression immediately tightened as she urgently shouted a few orders to the Sword Alliance cultivators and assumed a solemn posture.

Lü Guichen of Purple Star had noticed as well; with a flick he came to Yue Xi's side and stood shoulder to shoulder with her.

The two of them had, without much reliability, formed an alliance of convenience—facing that elder, the pressure on both of them was simply too great.

In the blink of an eye, the elder landed before Yue Xi and Lü Guichen.

"Elder!" Lü Guichen immediately cupped his fist and forced a smile. "We two just went to pay our respects, but it seems you were not on that peak!"

“Must this old master report his whereabouts to you?” The elder cast Lü Guichen a sidelong glance.  

“Of course not!” Lü Guichen’s face went pale, and he hastily fell silent.

"Hm, I'm here to ask you for something. Though this continent's Spiritual Qi is abundant and material resources plentiful, there is one thing vexing me: there are no rare ores!" the elder muttered to himself.

Lü Guichen's eyes brightened and he hurriedly said, "What kind of ore do you need? If it's convenient, tell us—we might have it."

Yue Xi also looked to the elder eagerly and added, "Elder, there is no need to be polite with us."

"I won't be polite!" the elder snorted, then casually asked, "Ethereal Crystal—do you have any?"

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi, who had still been hopeful of forging a better relationship with the elder, both fell into sullen expressions when they heard him mention Ethereal Crystal.

Lü Guichen replied awkwardly, "If you needed other ores we might have them, but Ethereal Crystals are far too rare; we don't carry any with us. If you need them, come with me back to the Purple Star main continent—there they are mined in abundance."

"My Sword Alliance stars have them as well," Yue Xi hastened to add.

"Trying to curry favor with me?" the elder glanced at them with a strange smile.

"Elder, you worry too much. We merely wish to invite you to be our guest on the Purple Star main continent for a few days, if you are willing," Lü Guichen quickly explained.

"Visiting would be fine; I too would like to travel a bit," the elder said as if appeased, a hint of longing flashing across his face—then his expression abruptly turned icy. "If I could leave this damned place, why would I be asking you for Ethereal Crystals? What foolishness!"

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi stared, taken aback by his sudden anger; their faces flushed with embarrassment and they dared not speak.

Nearby, Yang Kai, having heard the elder's shout, asked Shen Tu, "What is an Ethereal Crystal?"

"An exceptionally precious crystal; its yield across the Star Domain is extremely low and it is exorbitantly expensive," Shen Tu explained casually. "The spatial ring you're wearing was forged primarily from Ethereal Crystal."

"The spatial ring was made from Ethereal Crystal?" Yang Kai was stunned—now he understood why the material of this ring felt so different from that of the Demon God's Secret Codex; they were simply two entirely different materials.

"Strange. Why would that elder want Ethereal Crystals?" Shen Tu frowned. "And from what he just shouted, it sounds as if he has been trapped here for many years."

Elsewhere, the elder ranted and cursed, berating Lü Guichen and Yue Xi without relent, but the two could only endure silently, their hearts full of suppressed grievance.

"Fine, if there are no Ethereal Crystals, hand over your spatial rings," the elder commanded casually.

At these words, both Purple Star and Sword Alliance cultivators' expressions instantly changed.

"Don't worry—the worthless contents inside your rings I do not want; I only want the spatial rings themselves!" the elder added.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi exchanged glances, both at a loss for what to do.

"Give them to me, or you'll all die!" the elder shouted impatiently. "Although I do not wish to kill you, I will not tolerate anyone defying me!"

Sensing his ill intent, Lü Guichen forced a bitter smile and signaled to the Purple Star cultivators to come forward and hand over their spatial rings. Seeing Lü Guichen capitulate, Yue Xi could only swallow her pride and comply as well.

One by one, spatial rings were gathered by Lü Guichen and Yue Xi and handed to the elder.

Before long the elder had collected more than a hundred spatial rings.

With a wave of his hand, the contents stored within those rings were all poured out.

Immediately before him a small mountain appeared.

Within that heap were countless Saint Crystals, bottles of Spirit-Grade Pills, Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, rare ores, martial manuals, and so on.

The variety of treasures was dazzling and made it hard for onlookers to take their eyes off them.

Such a vast fortune made everyone's gazes burn with desire.

The elder merely glanced over the items without the slightest interest and coolly instructed, "Take what belongs to you and behave. If anyone dares to snatch what is not theirs, I'll see to it they learn their place!"

"We obey your orders, Elder!" Lü Guichen hastened to respond.

"Any more spatial rings?" the elder scanned those around him, then his cold gaze suddenly fixed on the spatial ring in Yue Xi's hand as he sneered, "You woman—do you want to die?"

Yue Xi clutched the spatial ring to her chest and, with a strained expression, pleaded, "Elder, could you leave me one to hold some items?"

"Here you won't have use for a spatial ring," the elder said as he reached out and grabbed toward Yue Xi. Though Yue Xi's strength reached the Saint King Realm, she could not even summon the thought of resistance under that man's grasp; the ring was snatched from her hand.

Her expression turned heartbroken.

The elder emptied the ring's contents and, as his gaze swept them, was immediately drawn to one particular token.

He reached out, drew the token to himself, examined it a moment, and could not help but be moved: "Star Sect Token? No wonder you were unwilling to hand over the ring—so you obtained a Star Sect Token!"

"Star Sect Token!" Lü Guichen involuntarily muttered; the previously gloating expression on his face suddenly turned fervent, his eyes greedily fixed on the token in the elder's hand.

The many cultivators around them all changed at once as a different light entered their eyes; one after another their gazes gathered, burning hot, upon the Star Sect Token.

"Elder, that token..." Yue Xi pressed her dry lips together and spoke in a low, pleading tone.

The elder said nothing, but tucked the Star Sect Token into his bosom; it seemed the token held considerable value to him.

Yue Xi's voice trailed off. She knew that once the token was in the other's hands, it would likely be impossible to retrieve, and a profound sense of loss washed over her, as if something precious had been taken.
