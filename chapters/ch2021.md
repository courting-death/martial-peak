## Chapter 2021 — Quite Insidious

A First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator’s Self-Destruction, though powerful in its own right, was never going to threaten an expert of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; at best, that skinny cultivator’s Self-Destruction could only leave Lu Baichuan looking disheveled.

Yet the man’s madness still sent a chill through Lu Baichuan.

What unsettled Lu Baichuan even more was the sudden appearance of a youth before him; the moment the youth appeared, he casually unleashed a move that shattered the man’s Domain Field and offensive strike, saved the Zhang Family’s thin cultivator, and then stood between him and danger.

From the aura emanating from the youth, Lu Baichuan felt this man was in no way inferior to himself.

When had the Zhang Family produced another Third Stage of the Void King Realm? Lu Baichuan was baffled and dared not act rashly, so he hastily retreated.

Yang Kai looked at him calmly and gave no sign of pursuing; instead he reached out and slapped the thin cultivator, dispersing the violent power within him in an instant and leaving the man staggered and nearly collapsing to the ground.

The thin cultivator raised his head and stared, baffled, at the suddenly appeared Yang Kai; only after a long moment did he come to his senses.

“Third Brother, hurry back!” the fat cultivator broke out in a cold sweat and hurriedly called to the thin one; when he got no response he rushed over and dragged him back into the crowd.

“Who are you?” Lu Baichuan stared at Yang Kai, instinctively sensing he was not to be trifled with, and asked in a low voice, “You do not seem to be of the Zhang Family, do you?”

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. “No.”

“Then who are you, and why meddle in Zhang Family matters?” Lu Baichuan frowned.

From Yang Kai’s earlier casual move, Lu Baichuan realized the youth’s strength matched his own. He did not particularly wish to make an enemy of Yang Kai, so he resolved first to probe the youth’s background and his ties to the Zhang Family.

“For certain reasons, matters of the Zhang Family are my concern now,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

Lu Baichuan asked, “What do you mean, friend? If you are to concern yourself with Zhang Family affairs, you should give a reason. Today I am escorting a bride, not making trouble for the Zhang Family — have you misunderstood something?”

"Lu Baichuan, stop your smooth words; my husband was killed by you in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, and this is an unforgivable hatred!" At that moment a middle-aged beauty brandishing a sharp sword charged out from the manor and shouted, appearing beside Yang Kai.

Hearing this, Lu Baichuan smiled. “Sister-in-law, Zhang Brother’s death is regrettable, but it truly has nothing to do with me. How am I to prove myself so you will believe me?”

“This Young Brother has brought home my husband’s final words. Do you still want to deny it?” The middle-aged beauty pointed at Yang Kai and snapped through gritted teeth.

Lu Baichuan’s eyes narrowed and he turned to Yang Kai at once. “You saw Zhang Brother inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda?”

When he asked this, a hint of delight appeared on his face, as if the news were good for him.

Yang Kai replied calmly, “I did see him. But why are you so pleased? Heh—have you thought of something?”

Lu Baichuan’s expression shifted several times and he lowered his voice. “If that is the case, then that thing must be on you.”

“So you guessed—yes, that thing is on me. And what of it?” Yang Kai said openly, looking him squarely in the face.

At that instant the middle-aged beauty's face fell; she silently blamed herself for speaking without thinking and inadvertently revealing Yang Kai’s possession of the Dao Origin Fruit.

After all, Lu Baichuan and Zhang Gaoxuan had entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda together and had contact inside the tower; perhaps they had discovered the Dao Origin Fruit together.

Even though the beauty had not directly announced that Yang Kai had the Dao Origin Fruit, Lu Baichuan’s shrewdness meant he would not fail to deduce it.

“So you killed Zhang Brother for that thing,” Yang Kai said with utter contempt as he stared at Lu Baichuan.

“Hmph, even without that thing I would have acted. But this is a matter between the Lu and Zhang families. Now that the thing is on you, Lu has some words he wishes to speak with you.”

“What words?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

Lu Baichuan’s expression turned sharp; his lips moved and he began to transmit sound.

At that moment Yang Kai suddenly smiled mysteriously, leapt into the air, and just as he moved a pitch-black little snake burst from the ground and silently lunged for Yang Kai’s calf, biting at empty air.

None of those present had noticed how the black snake had infiltrated the ground; only when its position was revealed did they cry out in alarm.

“Friend, you are truly insidious!” Yang Kai looked down from above and sneered at Lu Baichuan. “So this is how Brother Zhang was ambushed by you and then died of poison, is it?”

As he spoke, Yang Kai flicked his finger and a strand of Golden Blood Threads shot forth, transforming into a golden filament that, as if sentient, coiled toward the black serpent.

Lu Baichuan had not expected Yang Kai to be so alert, to detect such a concealed strike; when he had plotted against Zhang Gaoxuan in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, his attempt had succeeded in an instant.

Realizing the situation had gone awry, he let out a light whistle and the black serpent immediately seemed to receive a command, attempting to burrow back beneath the earth.

But it was too late; the Golden Blood Threads wound about it and strangled the spirit-snake fast.

Hissss……

The serpent’s tongue flickered in and out, but no matter how the black snake thrashed, it still could not break free of the Golden Blood Threads coiled around it. As those threads tightened further and further, its scales and flesh were cut open, fresh blood streaming out in rivulets.

“Stop!” With a shout, Lu Baichuan suddenly summoned a small hammer, pouring his internal Yuan Force into it. At once, arcs of deep-blue lightning danced across its surface, and in the next instant it transformed into a surge of ferocious electric plasma, blasting straight toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed; realizing that the small hammer was no ordinary Secret Treasure, he did not recklessly meet it head-on. His figure flickered, slipping away from his original position.

A hiss echoed out, followed by several crisp snapping sounds. The black serpent bound by the Golden Blood Threads was finally sliced into several pieces, its severed body segments thudding to the ground and writhing in twisted spasms. Even its severed head still flicked its tongue, looking vicious and feral to the extreme.

With such injuries, the creature was undoubtedly doomed.

“My spirit-snake!” Lu Baichuan cried out as if his wife and daughter had been stolen, his eyes suddenly bloodshot as he glared at Yang Kai hovering in the air and snarled, “You killed my spirit-snake; I will have your life!”

As he spoke he poured Origin Qi into the hammer as if life itself were expendable.

Cracking sounds rang out like thunder, the hammer’s light flashed wildly, and the surrounding Spiritual Qi suddenly churned.

Lu Baichuan tossed the hammer and it transformed into a terrifying, world-shattering force, forming an electric web that surged toward Yang Kai.

“Young Brother, be careful — the Lu family’s Lei Feng Hammer is a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure; do not meet it head-on!” the old matron cried from below. With Zhang Ruoxi’s aid she had finally come out and, seeing the scene, warned aloud.

Yang Kai had no intention of taking the treasure’s might head-on; lightning powers were violent and overbearing, and even with a strong body he would not dare meet them directly.

With fingers flying, dozens of Golden Blood Threads shot forth and formed a golden net in midair to confront the Lei Feng Hammer.

Boom……

Thunderous sounds boomed as the glow of the Golden Blood Threads shattered and the wandering lightning arcs splashed about the void; their duel looked dizzyingly fierce and left onlookers hearts pounding.

“Great-Grandmother, can this gentleman win?” Zhang Ruoxi, supporting the old woman, watched Yang Kai intently; though young, she knew the Zhang Family’s safety now depended entirely on Yang Kai and thus was deeply anxious.

The old matron gave no answer — she knew little of Yang Kai beyond sensing he possessed the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and Lu Baichuan was likewise at the Third Stage.

A contest between cultivators of equal Stage made the outcome hard to predict.

But judging by the scene, Yang Kai looked unperturbed while Lu Baichuan’s face was savage, as if he were pouring forth his full might; no one knew why the black serpent had such significance to him.

Above, the golden net fashioned from the Golden Blood Threads and the lightning web of the Lei Feng Hammer were locked in a contest of equals.

With an explosive shout Lu Baichuan spat out and unveiled yet another Secret Treasure.

The old matron’s face changed and she cried, “Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade!”

The Zhang and Lu families had long been on good terms, so the old matron was acquainted with some of the Lu family’s clan treasures; seeing the item Lu Baichuan produced she quickly recognized it.

Like the Lei Feng Hammer, the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade was a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure — one of the two most formidable treasures the Lu family possessed, usually entrusted to two people, yet now both were in Lu Baichuan’s hands.

“Young Brother, beware — this Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade was originally forged by an Dao Origin-Grade artificer; it failed and fell to Void King-Grade Upper-Level, but it still contains a trace of the Power of the Laws,” the old matron cried again.

“Shut up, you old thing!” Lu Baichuan roared in fury.

He was locked in mortal combat with Yang Kai, and the matron had just exposed his family’s assets; how could he remain calm? He signaled and several people from his wedding procession charged toward the Zhang Family.

Among that group were three Void King Realm cultivators; though only First Stage of the Void King Realm, they were more than sufficient against the lone Zhang Family.

Seeing the Lu family advance, the matron planted her cane and, exchanging a look with the middle-aged beauty, the Zhangs began to fight back with the Lu contingent.

After producing the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade, Lu Baichuan held it in his right hand and sneered down at Yang Kai. “Brat, I will not waste words. Hand over that thing and I will spare you; otherwise, once this blade is unleashed you cannot possibly withstand it!”

“Where did you get so much confidence?” Yang Kai laughed loudly and contemptuously curled a finger at him. “Then come — I would like to see this worthless blade’s might.”

“Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!” Lu Baichuan’s rage surged and he declared, “So be it — then I will show you!”

With those words he suddenly lifted the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade at chest height, spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood onto it, and the blade trembled as strands of the Power of the Laws surged through it.
