## Chapter 2353 — What’s So Strange About Crippling Your Cultivation?

“Who dares cause trouble in my Jubao Tower!” A furious roar came from the rear hall, and immediately the bald giant who had injured Liu Qianyun earlier burst out. His body, like an iron tower, exuded an overwhelming oppression, and the aura radiating from him was extremely ferocious.

The dazed and battered servant, seeing this man appear, seemed to find his backbone at last. He scrambled and crawled toward him, clutching his swollen cheek, and cried out indistinctly, “Deacon, you must stand up for me! This man attacked me the moment he entered, without rhyme or reason. I’m too weak to resist, and he knocked out all my teeth—look, just look, how miserable I am!”

He wailed incessantly, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth; he truly looked pitiful. Anyone unaware of the real situation would surely sympathize with him.

Yet Yang Kai hadn’t used much force. Though the servant’s injuries looked tragic, they were not serious; otherwise he wouldn’t be so lively now.

“Daring to act wild in my Jubao Tower, boy, do you have a death wish!” The bald giant’s leopard-like eyes locked onto Yang Kai, his voice vicious. Then, his gaze shifted to Liu Qianyun standing beside Yang Kai, and as if understanding something, he sneered, “So that’s what’s going on—you brought a helper.”

As he spoke, he looked at Yang Kai mockingly. “Boy, this Lord doesn’t know what benefits this woman promised you to make you stand up for her, but coming here to help her is a grave mistake.”

With a sudden wave of his hand, the doors of Jubao Tower slammed shut. Instantly, four Dao Origin Realm cultivators sprang out from all directions, surrounding Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun so tightly that not even water could pass through.

The sudden turn of events was utterly abrupt. Liu Qianyun’s expression changed at once, and she instinctively edged closer to Yang Kai’s side, as though seeking a measure of safety. A calming aura seemed to envelop her, and she glanced up at him, only to see his face calm and indifferent, as if the situation before them was of no consequence to him at all.

Affected by him, Liu Qianyun suddenly calmed down as well.

“So many bullying so few!” A playful smile appeared at the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth. He glanced around, sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, and found that all four Dao Origin Realm cultivators were only at the First Stage, while the bald giant was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Who knew where they got the courage to close the doors? It seemed they wanted to keep things hidden and trap Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun here.

Hearing Yang Kai’s taunt, the bald giant only snorted coldly and glared at Liu Qianyun. In a chilling voice, he said, “I hadn’t planned to do anything to you, but since you’re so ungrateful and came back on your own, don’t blame this Lord for being ruthless. My bed is missing a warm body, and your looks aren’t bad. Crawl over and kneel before me, and you’ll suffer less pain!”

Liu Qianyun trembled with rage and shouted through gritted teeth, “In your dreams!”

This shameless man not only stole her Spiritual Medicine and injured her, but now even coveted her beauty, demanding she submit herself. How could Liu Qianyun endure this? Back in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, she was a dominant figure. Even though she was less influential in the Star Realm, she still had her pride.

“Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!” The bald giant clearly had little patience. Seeing Liu Qianyun reject him, he waved his hand and barked, “Kill the man. Keep the woman. Do they not even know where they are, daring to cause trouble here? Utterly clueless.”

The four Dao Origin Realm cultivators surrounding Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun attacked in unison, each unleashing their secret arts at Yang Kai. Murderous intent filled the air—they clearly intended to kill him on the spot, just as the bald giant ordered.

With Jubao Tower’s powerful backing, what was killing a few people? The only one to blame was this fool for not knowing his place and daring to make trouble.

But the four soon realized something was wrong.

The moment they moved, the entire space within Jubao Tower grew heavy. An indescribable force filled the air, making them feel as if they’d fallen into a quagmire, unable to move freely.

All four were Dao Origin Realm cultivators. Though not especially strong, having reached this realm, they had some understanding of Law Power.

They immediately realized that the force hindering their movements, making them feel crushed and unable to breathe, even disrupting their Origin Qi, was an extremely profound Law Power.

Their faces changed dramatically as they desperately tried to break free, but to little effect.

Yang Kai grinned savagely, and Golden Blood Threads shot out, flashing with golden light as they slashed toward the four.

Sss sss sss sss…

After a series of strange sounds, the golden light vanished, and the Law Power filling Jubao Tower also dissipated without a trace.

Yet the four Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had attacked Yang Kai stood frozen in place, motionless, as if petrified, their eyes full of terror and disbelief.

After a moment, one man’s body suddenly collapsed, as if he’d been sliced into countless pieces, scattering across the floor, blood and shattered organs spilling everywhere.

Crash…

The other three also shattered, and in an instant, a nauseating stench of blood filled the air.

“Ah!” The bald giant clearly hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so ruthless. He’d thought Liu Qianyun was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and any helper she found wouldn’t be much. That’s why he hadn’t acted himself. But now, seeing this, he realized he’d made a grave mistake.

Those were four First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators, painstakingly cultivated by Jubao Tower, yet they were wiped out in a single exchange.

How could he possibly contend with such strength?

The servant was even more pitiful. He’d been standing beside the bald giant, gloating and waiting to see Yang Kai killed, but when the outcome was the complete opposite, his eyes rolled back and he fainted on the spot.

“You… you actually killed people in Jubao Tower?” The bald giant’s face turned deathly pale. Realizing he was no match for Yang Kai, his blood ran cold, and all his earlier arrogance vanished.

“What a joke. If someone wants to kill me, of course I’ll kill them first!” Yang Kai sneered, his gaze sharp as he stared at the bald giant. “Now it’s your turn.”

The bald giant knew things had gone south. He suddenly formed a hand seal, and a crimson glow enveloped his body. He spat out a mouthful of Essence-Blood, clearly using a secret art that burned his blood, and shot backward like an arrow, trying to escape while shouting, “Shopkeeper, save me!”

“Even if the Heavenly King himself came, he couldn’t save you!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. Though he hadn’t moved, in the blink of an eye, he was right in front of the bald giant, pressing close, his eyes icy and fierce.

The bald giant was terrified. With his Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he hadn’t even seen how Yang Kai got in front of him. He finally understood the gap between them and bitterly regretted not investigating Yang Kai’s strength first. Now he’d completely enraged him and likely wouldn’t survive.

“Stop!” A stern shout suddenly came from behind, followed by a peak Dao Origin Realm aura pressing down on Yang Kai.

In the next moment, an old man with white hair and beard appeared before Yang Kai, clearly having rushed over from the rear hall after hearing the bald giant’s cry for help.

Before the old man even arrived, he struck out at Yang Kai, his hand clawing down from above clearly intending to save an ally by attacking the enemy.

The bald giant was overjoyed and shouted even louder, “Shopkeeper, save me!”

He thought that with the Shopkeeper himself intervening, he’d be safe. The Shopkeeper was at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm, and though this young troublemaker was strong, he was definitely not at the Emperor Realm. That much he could sense. With the Shopkeeper’s power, he was sure to be saved.

Yang Kai glanced at the old man with disdain, then casually slapped the air; a solid palm print flew out to meet the old man’s hand.

At the same time, he reached out with his other hand and gently pressed it against the bald giant’s chest.

The bald giant’s face changed drastically, his earlier joy vanishing. In horror, he cried, “What are you doing?!”

Before he could finish, a violent surge of Origin Qi rushed into his body, slicing through his meridians like a blade and ravaging his Dantian. The excruciating pain was unbearable, and he screamed in agony.

Boom…

Only then did Yang Kai’s palm print collide with the old man’s hand. Using the force, Yang Kai drifted lightly back to Liu Qianyun’s side, his expression calm.

The old man, on the other hand, changed expression after feeling Yang Kai’s power. He had to alter his stance several times to neutralize the force, and after landing, he staggered back several steps.

With a thud, the bald giant landed right at his feet.

“Cough, cough…” The bald giant coughed painfully, spat out a mouthful of dark blood, then looked at Yang Kai with a face full of hatred and despair. “You actually crippled my cultivation?”

At this moment, his meridians were destroyed, his Dantian shattered, and all his cultivation was gone. Though such injuries weren’t completely incurable, he’d need extremely rare Spiritual Pills and miraculous medicines. Not only were such things impossible to find, even if he did, he couldn’t afford them.

“You dared to injure my Junior Sister. What’s so strange about crippling your cultivation?” Yang Kai looked at him as if he were an idiot.

“Why not just kill me!” the bald giant roared.

Yang Kai sneered, “Killing you would be letting you off too easily.”

The bald giant’s face turned even paler. He knew Yang Kai was right—death would be a release, but losing one’s cultivation was the cruelest punishment for any cultivator.
