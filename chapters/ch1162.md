## Chapter 1162 — Terrifying Bidding

The auction for the Dragon-Slaying Whip proceeded steadily; although the price climbed step by step, each bid remained fairly rational, rising by only a few hundred thousand at a time.

But Yang Kai blurted out six million in one breath, a full one million higher than Yin Sudie’s bid!

The hall erupted in uproar once more.

On the auction platform, the fair-haired auctionress glanced suspiciously at Yan Pei; she assumed he had planted a shill, though this shill seemed rather unprofessional—too blatant.

Unexpectedly, Yan Pei slowly shook his head, indicating the shill he’d arranged was not in that private room, leaving the auctionress frozen in place.

In Private Room C-13, when they heard Yang Kai call out six million, Wu Yi and Yang Flame both covered their mouths, staring at him in stunned bewilderment, wondering what on earth he intended to do.

Six million—if that Dragon-Slaying Whip ended up in their own hands, they wouldn’t even have a place to weep!

Yang Kai’s expression didn’t change; his eyes brimmed with confidence.

He believed the Dragon-Slaying Whip was worth far more than six million! At least in such a venue it should command a much higher price.

Having watched the auction this far, he’d already worked out the values of Secret Treasures at different tiers, and it differed greatly from his initial estimate. He’d thought those Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures would only fetch two or three hundred thousand Saint Crystals, yet each was selling for over a million; the twin forks Yang Flame had forged even went for two million one hundred thousand.

Now the Dragon-Slaying Whip was genuinely an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure—how could it possibly be worth only a few million? Tens of millions were within the realm of possibility.

If not for Qu Changfeng’s earlier remark, countless people would have bid on the Dragon-Slaying Whip. The price would have shot up. But because Qu Changfeng spoke first, few dared to compete; no one wanted to offend him and Yin Sudie of Liuli Gate, hence the chilly atmosphere.

Yang Kai felt no fondness for Qu Changfeng, nor any ties to Yin Sudie, and he certainly wouldn’t let his goods be cheapened for strangers. If nobody else would bid, then he would—at worst he’d buy the whip back himself; he wouldn’t let others reap the benefit.

“Hmph, quite the big mouth, my friend. Six million — can you even afford that?” Qu Changfeng’s cold voice came from his private room, clearly doubting that someone from a C-Class room could produce that many Saint Crystals.

“Why does it concern you whether he can or can’t?” Fang Tianzhong sneered. “If he can’t pay, Jubao Tower will make him pay the price. Bid if you want—enough idle chatter.”

“Fang brother, this doesn’t concern you—why so talkative?” Qu Changfeng’s voice grew colder. Normally he and Fang Tianzhong sparred with words, but for Fang to come and belittle his face now pushed Qu Changfeng to the edge.

“I merely can’t stand some people’s behavior.”

“Juniors, don’t be so arrogant. If you dare prattle on again, I’ll have you both expelled from Jubao Tower—forever barred from its auctions!” Yan Pei snorted.

When Old Yan Pei spoke, no one dared refuse him; Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong hurriedly apologized in unison.

Yan Pei nodded slightly and called out loudly, “Room C-13, six million—any higher?”

“Six million five hundred thousand!” Qu Changfeng immediately raised the bid.

Before Yang Kai could speak, Fang Tianzhong’s voice rang out: “Seven million!”

Without waiting for Qu Changfeng to respond, Yang Kai hardened his resolve and snapped, “Eight million!”

“Hahaha—can’t let you juniors have all the fun; I bid eight million five hundred thousand!” Qian Tong’s loud laugh rang out.

Yang Kai paused for a moment, thought briefly, then smiled faintly. Lifting his teacup for a leisurely sip, he said calmly to Wu Yi and Yang Flame, “Get ready to collect the money — it’s about time.”

Qian Tong had pushed the price to eight million five hundred thousand, not to truly compete, but to draw attention and hostility onto himself—hence his immediate raise after Yang Kai’s bid.

Qian Tong was a decent sort; Yang Kai acknowledged the favor.

In the Yingyue Hall’s private room, Wei Guchang and Xuan’er looked at Qian Tong in puzzlement, wondering why he’d suddenly joined the bidding. They were curious but didn’t ask; Qian Tong surely had his reasons.

The Dragon-Slaying Whip’s auction proved dramatic: an Origin-Grade Middle-Level offensive Secret Treasure that had few bidders at the start, even stalling several times, unexpectedly saw its price climb in the final moments—each raise chilling the crowd. After Qian Tong’s bid of eight million five hundred thousand, Yin Sudie immediately followed with nine million, and it sold at that final price.

Though it didn’t reach ten million, the price still sent a shock through countless people.

Nine million—how many forces on Dark Star could actually muster that?

In Room C-13, Wu Yi and Yang Flame were stunned, their faces flushed with excitement, hands clenched together as they gazed at Yang Kai with worshipful eyes.

If Yang Kai hadn’t stirred things up at the end, the Dragon-Slaying Whip might only have fetched five million; now it sold for nearly twice that.

Counting the earlier Origin Condensing Pill and the twin forks, the three of them had harvested a great bounty at this auction.

Over ten million Upper-Level Saint Crystals, obtained so easily—once upon a time they wouldn’t have dared dream of such a haul.

“You think ten million is a lot?” Yang Kai chuckled softly.

“Ten million isn’t a lot?” Wu Yi was astonished. “Then what do you want?”

“Watch—there’s something even more terrifying.” Yang Kai sipped his tea, eyes alight as he looked toward the platform. He could already sense that the final item would sell for an even higher price than the Dragon-Slaying Whip. Though he didn’t know the exact sum, Jubao Tower had placed it after the whip for a reason—its value was indisputably higher.

On the high platform, Yan Pei cleared his throat and announced loudly, “Next, we will auction the final highlight of today’s event—the closing item of the auction…”

As he spoke, the auctioneer stepped forward carrying a jade tray and presented it to Yan Pei; everyone saw the delicate woman trembling slightly, her hands shaking as she held the tray.

This scene stirred the curiosity of the powerhouses in the private rooms. The beautiful auctioneer was from Jubao Tower—an experienced woman who had seen much of the world. What kind of item could make her so visibly excited? The smile on her lovely face even seemed a bit stiff with tension.

“Everyone, look!” Yan Pei swept the red cloth off the tray, and the final lot appeared before the crowd.

It was a transparent bottle—neither metal nor jade, its material unknown. The bottle itself was valuable, but what drew every eye was not the vessel but the pill that lay quietly within.

Plump and perfectly rounded, the pill bore clear, intersecting striations like a web of meridians.

“Pill patterns!”

“An Origin Condensing Pill with pill patterns!”

Shouts of astonishment rose from every direction; private rooms erupted in varying degrees of commotion—some people crushed their chairs, some knocked over tables, some smashed teacups…

At that moment, the leaders across Dark Star could no longer remain composed; those usually as unmoved as mountains behaved like country bumpkins who’d never seen anything, floundering and exposing themselves to ridicule.

The martial artists in the main hall also burst into uproar.

An Origin Condensing Pill had appeared earlier in the auction and been bought mid-sale by Sea Hall’s Third Hall Master Jiang Huai’an for one million ten thousand Saint Crystals, so everyone recognized the pill.

But this Origin Condensing Pill was obviously different from the previous one—it bore pill patterns!

The Origin Condensing Pill was a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level pill, exceedingly difficult to refine; only Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemists could produce it, and even a Void King-Grade pill refiner might not manage one with pill patterns.

And now, one such pill with pill patterns had appeared on the auction platform!

Shu—shu—shu—

Figures darted forth from all directions with restrained auras and eyes like lightning—these were Jubao Tower’s Origin Returning Realm experts. They surged onto the platform and surrounded the pill in an impenetrable ring, their expressions deadly serious; the killing intent radiating from them seemed almost tangible, instantaneously quieting the hall’s clamor.

Seeing this, the great figures in each private room slowly calmed and took their seats, though their brows remained tense with shock and resolute determination to obtain it.

They finally understood why Yan Pei had sent word for them to gather Saint Crystals.

It turned out the true showpiece was not the Dragon-Slaying Whip but this Origin Condensing Pill with pill patterns—such a pill was worth a fortune and worth going bankrupt over.

Yan Pei glanced around; when everyone’s emotions had settled and the hall fell silent, he proudly announced, “Everyone has seen it, yes? Then let’s not waste time—start the bidding for this Origin Condensing Pill at five million, with each raise no less than five hundred thousand!”

No sooner had he spoken than bids erupted from all directions—far fiercer than any contest earlier in the sale.

Each bidder called out with overwhelming momentum, their voices strident.

Those magnates all joined the bidding personally.

So many bids came that almost every private room had someone calling out, and Yan Pei paid no heed; he only looked toward the highest bidder.

Six million, eight million, ten million, fifteen million, twenty million…

Within merely ten breaths, the Origin Condensing Pill had been bid up to thirty million, and the volley of competing calls showed no sign of abating—still fierce and savage, each raise terrifyingly massive, growing by millions upon millions.

Yan Pei barely had a chance to interject; he didn’t need to speak—just shifting his gaze made others automatically raise their bids.

Thirty-five million, forty million… the price rocketed without pause—then fifty million, sixty million…
