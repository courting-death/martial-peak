## Chapter 935 — A Bite

During the Succession War, everyone who followed Yang Kai reaped great rewards. Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang used the Wan Yao Ling Ye to prepare a pool of medicinal liquid that remade their bodies and cleansed their meridians and marrow, and each person's aptitude improved to varying degrees. For prominent figures like Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng, the benefits were even greater.

It could be said that their future accomplishments would not be low; even if they stayed in Zhongdu, they could still rise to the Transcendent Realm.

After ten years apart, Qiu Yimeng had already reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, yet Huo Xingchen, who back then had been in no way inferior to her, was only at the Sixth Stage. This greatly surprised Yang Kai.

He couldn't understand why Huo Xingchen's cultivation had fallen so far behind.

When Yang Kai asked like that, many people in the Yang Family hall secretly laughed, as if they knew some inside story.

Qiu Yimeng covered her mouth and couldn't help but smile.

Huo Xingchen made a bitter face and complained, "Young Master Kai, you don't know—brother's life has been hard..."

He began to explain in detail.

Yang Kai's expression grew extremely strange; he looked utterly speechless.

The Huo Family was one of Zhongdu's Eight Great Families, but the previous family head Huo Zheng had only one son, Huo Xingchen; he had many daughters and treated them like treasures.

After Huo Xingchen took over as family head, the Huo Family's elders learned from the previous generation's painful lessons and promptly began arranging marriages for him so he could establish a household.

Over the past ten years, the Huo Family found a dozen prominent young ladies to fill his harem; under pressure from many elders, Huo Xingchen diligently performed his duties day after day to ensure the Huo Family's line continued.

Working himself to death, it was no wonder Huo Xingchen's cultivation lagged behind.

"Ah, by my count I already have fifteen concubines, plus one principal wife," Huo Xingchen said with a deeply aggrieved look, patting Yang Kai on the shoulder. "If there comes a day, I'll introduce them to you—each is a beauty. But honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed."

Yang Kai regarded him with sympathy, not knowing what to say; after a long moment he managed, "My condolences..."

The hall erupted in laughter.

News of Yang Kai's return must have spread, for after Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen, the other young heads of the Eight Great Families all arrived at the Yang residence.

The Meng Family head Meng Shanyi, Liu Family head Liu Qingyao, Kang Family head Kang Jian, Gao Family head Gao Rangxian, Ye Family head Ye Jingli...

Of these five, Yang Kai knew Meng Shanyi and Liu Qingyao relatively well; the other three he hardly knew.

They came together because they had heard Yang Kai had returned and crushed the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, and they wanted to ask what plan to make for the future.

When they learned Yang Kai intended to lead the Yang Family out of Zhongdu and head to the Tongxuan Continent, the five were momentarily unable to decide.

A family's affairs were not theirs to decide arbitrarily.

Besides, they had concerns.

In the Succession War, the Huo and Qiu families had been closest to Yang Kai; Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen had supported him, and those two families would follow Yang Kai without dispute. But the other five families had opposed Yang Kai back then, and though times had changed, they still didn't know how to make their stance clear.

Yang Kai casually extended an invitation to them as well, asking them to come with him to the Tongxuan Continent.

The past was past; Yang Kai did not mind. After all, those five families were people of Zhongdu—if they could help, he would lend a hand; it was no trouble for him.

The five all said they needed to return and discuss with their elders before deciding.

After the five departed, the hall did not stay quiet for long; a flood of people soon arrived.

They were all friends who had participated in the Succession War alongside the Yang Family.

From Wan Hua Palace came Han Xiao Qi, Ye Han, Liu Qingru, and Hua Ruoyin.

From Shui Yue Hall came Feng Qianhen.

From Wen Xin Palace came Zuo Fang and Li Xinyuan.

From Yingyue Sect came Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu.

From Baoqi Sect came Tao Yang and Zhao Rong.

From Ghost King Valley came Leng Shan, Shen Yi, and Chen Ying...

After Yang Kai left, these people had helped rebuild Zhongdu. The Yang Family was grateful for their past assistance and had established reciprocal agreements with their sects, leaving them to manage affairs; consequently they lived in Zhongdu as contacts between the Yang Family and their respective sects.

They had not been affected by this disaster and each of them was unharmed.

Old acquaintances met happily; the four girls from Wan Hua Palace had grown up and become fresh-faced, mature young women.

After the lively greetings, Yang Kai explained his plan for returning; everyone said they would consult their sect elders before making a decision.

When they left, Yang Kai said, "Second Brother, consult with the elders in the Elder Hall about whether to come with me; give me a quick answer—I will stay here for a while."

"No need to consult—since Ninth Brother has arranged everything, the Yang Family will of course follow you," Yang Zhao replied briskly, agreeing at once.

The others nodded in agreement; none objected. The people of the Blood Servants Hall were especially thrilled to follow the Young Lord and serve him.

"Alright, use this time to pack; bring only what matters most. Leave behind supplies—those things aren't worth much on the Tongxuan Continent," Yang Kai instructed, then turned his gaze to Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen.

Young Master Huo said, "I'll follow whatever Qiu Yimeng does—her vision is broader than mine."

"I will take the Qiu Family to the Tongxuan Continent," Qiu Yimeng said with a glance.

Huo Xingchen shrugged. "I'll go notify my father and have the family pack up at once."

With that he left in haste.

"Then let's hurry and pack," Yang Zhao stood and instructed the Yang Family in the hall, "Just do as Ninth Brother said—keep it simple. Don't take what you don't need."

"Yes!" the crowd responded and quickly dispersed.

Soon only Yang Kai, Li Rong, Han Fei, Qiu Yimeng, and Luo Xiaoman remained in the hall.

"Master, we'll wait for you outside," Li Rong said with a small smile and, together with Han Fei, walked out. With her eyesight, how could she have missed the odd look Qiu Yimeng gave the master?

That longing and infatuation could not be hidden.

Qiu Yimeng had purposely stayed behind; it was obvious she wanted to be alone with Yang Kai for a time.

"Sister Qiu, I'm going out too," Luo Xiaoman murmured, following Li Rong and Han Fei.

The hall fell silent and the atmosphere turned strange; Qiu Yimeng simply stared at Yang Kai without speaking.

Yang Kai awkwardly said, "Judging by your dress and bearing, it seems you never married—you're getting on in years."

"I'm waiting for you," Qiu Yimeng lifted her chin and revealed the long, pale curve of her neck.

"Don't joke," Yang Kai forced a laugh.

"Do I look like I'm joking?" Qiu Yimeng snorted coldly, then grit her teeth and said, "I know you have other women in your heart; I don't expect you to love me. The gap between us now is too great—I have some self-awareness!"

Yang Kai looked at her helplessly.

"But since you're back, I'll speak plainly. You once said... you wouldn't fall in love with me; but playing around would be fine!"

"Did I say something that beastly?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"You did!" Qiu Yimeng snapped, biting her lip and glaring at him. "You know that's beastly—I thought you didn't know."

"Uh... I was young and foolish back then..." Yang Kai stammered.

"Never mind—then let's just play. I don't expect forever; that's unrealistic. I don't want to keep waiting and suffering every day. I only want to have had you once."

"No way..." Yang Kai was dumbfounded, secretly shocked by Qiu Yimeng's bold words.

"I don't care how you feel about me. Once this is done and we're safe on the Tongxuan Continent, I'll make you realize what I'm capable of!" With that, Qiu Yimeng swayed forward and kissed him on the lips without waiting for his consent, standing on tiptoe to reach him.

Yang Kai let out a miserable cry and reached up to touch his lips, where a searing pain was burning.

Qiu Yimeng spun away with an air of nonchalance, her silver laugh fading into the distance. "That's just a little interest. Once we're there I'll collect both principal and interest."

Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a flurry of thoughts.

After a stick of incense burned down, Yang Kai left the hall with a serious expression.

Li Rong and Han Fei, waiting outside, stole a glance at him then quickly looked away, trying not to smile while their shoulders trembled with suppressed mirth.

“Go ahead and laugh—it’s just a woman’s bite, isn’t it?” Yang Kai rubbed his mouth, feeling thoroughly humiliated.

"That girl is actually quite something," Li Rong said earnestly. "If she were from the Tongxuan Continent, her cultivation would surely be higher now."

"Yes—this world limits their development!" Han Fei agreed.

"That's why I want to take them away to see a wider world," Yang Kai said, his gaze deep. "This world is too small. There may be greater dangers over there, but the conditions are better."

Both women nodded slightly.

After a moment, Yang Kai instructed, "You two stay at the Yang residence for now to guard the place in case anything happens."

Li Rong startled, "Where will Master go?"

"I have two other stops to make."

"Let me or Han Fei accompany you."

"No need. I can go alone—the Flying Shuttle ensures my safety; no one can catch me. This world isn't dangerous."

Li Rong thought for a moment and didn't insist, but she reminded him, "Master, be careful on the road."

"Tell my parents for me—say I'll have plenty of time to be with them later." Yang Kai said, then summoned the Flying Shuttle. A green light flashed and he was already a hundred li away.
