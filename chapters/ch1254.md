## Chapter 1254 — Demon Blood City

When Yang Kai mentioned Tianyun City, Deng Ning clearly misunderstood something, assuming he was a disciple of Yingyue Hall. Yang Kai neither confirmed nor denied it.

After a bit of flattering, Deng Ning changed tack and said, "Tianyun City is quite far from here; if one were to travel by Star Shuttle alone, it would take at least half a year to arrive."

"Half a year!" Yang Kai frowned; he knew Dark Star itself was vast, for when his Golden Blood had just formed he once drove a drop of it to fly around the entire Dark Star — even at Golden Blood speed it took a long time to make a round trip — so the idea of spending half a year to fly from here back to Tianyun City sat poorly with him.

With half that time he could accomplish many things.

Seeing Yang Kai's expression, Deng Ning fell silent; soon a trace of struggle crossed his brow and he bit his lip. "However, if one passed through the Space Array of Demon Blood City some ten thousand li away, one could save much time. The Demon Blood City's Space Array isn't directly linked with Tianyun City, but it can transport one to a place called Qingshi City, which lies within the Li Huo Sect's territory. From Qingshi City to Tianyun City only takes about a month by flight. Of course, if Brother Yang knows a core disciple of the Li Huo Sect and can find someone to vouch, he could directly use Qingshi City's Space Array to teleport to Tianyun City."

"The Demon Blood City's Space Array connects to Qingshi City?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Indeed. Our Demon Blood Sect and the Li Huo Sect conduct a great deal of trade and collaboration, so disciples from the two sects are often in close contact and sometimes venture out to temper together," Deng Ning explained with a smile. Then, with perfect timing, he added, "If it's convenient for Brother Yang, you could come with me to Demon Blood City. I am considered a core disciple within the Demon Blood Sect; vouching for personal use of the Space Array shouldn't be a problem."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's heart brightened — sparing Deng Ning's life had proved useful after all — but he remained outwardly calm and asked lightly, "What is the price to use your Space Array?"

Deng Ning hurriedly waved his hand. "Brother Yang, you jest. This time you saved my life; I was worried I wouldn't have a chance to repay you, and now you present me such an opportunity, I am delighted — what price could I demand? Besides, using the Space Array only consumes some Saint Crystals. It's nothing. If Brother Yang truly wishes to pass through Demon Blood City, leave it to me."

Deng Ning beat his chest in guarantee. It seemed Yang Kai's earlier killing of An Zhiyong and aiding him against Ye Yangrong had genuinely made Deng Ning wish to befriend him, so these words sounded unfeigned and full of magnanimity.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment. He knew a sect disciple would not be allowed to casually use a Space Array without orders from elders or a sect task — it would cost more than a few Saint Crystals — yet the other's eagerness suited him, so with a smile he nodded, "Then I leave it to you, Brother Deng."

"You're welcome!" Deng Ning's mood lifted at Yang Kai's change of attitude; secretly he thought this deal advantageous — not only could he repay a favor, he might even profit.

"Brother Yang, wait a moment while I deal with that shameless man's corpse," Deng Ning said, and hurried off.

After killing someone it was natural to destroy the body; Yang Kai was practiced in such matters and said nothing, but once Deng Ning left, Yang Kai wore a strange expression and touched his chest.

At his chest lay the small refining furnace, and now, where it had been empty, a crimson pill exuded a raging blood aura.

It was the Blood Fusion Pill that Deng Ning had thrown into the Flowing Flame Sandland!

Yang Kai was naturally curious about something that three Saint King Realm brothers from the Demon Blood Sect would turn against each other for. So, when Deng Ning threw the Blood Fusion Pill away, Yang Kai immediately sent the Artifact Spirit darting after it, quietly wrapping the pill up and retrieving it.

That others could not enter the Flowing Flame Sandland did not mean the Artifact Spirit could not. It had been born from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool’s core flames and had been tempered within that stone chamber for tens of thousands of years. As a fire-attribute Artifact Spirit, how could it possibly be affected by the Sandland’s heat?

The flash of light An Zhiyong saw fly into Yang Kai's chest was precisely the Artifact Spirit returning with its prize.

Although he had not examined it closely, from the soaring blood aura within the Blood Fusion Pill Yang Kai guessed it had likely been refined by means akin to a blood sacrifice. The pill harbored much violent aura; it was not for everyone to consume. It would serve the Demon Blood Sect's disciples far more than others — such malignant aura might not harm them but could instead propel their cultivation.

Yang Kai had his Artifact Spirit fetch it merely out of the curiosity of a pillmaster who wished to study it; he had no other intentions.

While Yang Kai brooded, Deng Ning had already reached Ye Yangrong's body and, contrary to Yang Kai's expectation of a simple disposal, sat cross-legged before the corpse with great delight. He employed some secret art; soon wails like ghosts and wolves rose, followed by surging blood qi and a blaze of bloodlight.

About half an incense later Ye Yangrong's corpse had become a skeleton, and in Deng Ning's hand appeared a crimson pill similar to the Blood Fusion Pill. He eyed it with satisfaction, slipped it into his Spatial Ring as if he had made a handsome gain, then utterly shattered the bones.

He also picked up Ye Yangrong's and An Zhiyong's fallen Spatial Rings and returned.

Finding Yang Kai watching him with a peculiar look, Deng Ning gave an awkward smile and explained, "Do not laugh, Brother Yang. To Demon Blood Sect disciples, fellow cultivators are living medicines who can help one progress, that's why the sect does not forbid internal strife."

Yang Kai rubbed his chin and, embarrassed, said, "So I've caused you to lose out on such a pill?"

Having blasted An Zhiyong to nothing, Deng Ning naturally could no longer refine such a pill from his corpse.

"No matter, no matter — I'm satisfied with today's haul. Though the sect doesn't forbid inner strife, killing a peer of the same rank is no easy thing; one may be undone unexpectedly. Many die in sect trials from counterattacks by fellow disciples, so while the sect doesn't stop it, people won't act unless provoked." Deng Ning dared not press the point with Yang Kai, hurried on, and changed the subject: "These are my two senior brothers' Spatial Rings; there should be some decent items inside, though they may be of no use to you. Their Saint Crystals, however, you may take — there are quite a few, at least a hundred thousand or so."

Yang Kai glanced at him and waved his hand, "No need. Keep the Spatial Rings; consider them my payment for using your Space Array."

Deng Ning deliberately reminded him that his sect’s items would be useless to Yang Kai — as if Yang Kai couldn’t tell what he was thinking. As for those mere hundred thousand Saint Crystals, Yang Kai didn’t care in the slightest, so he simply handed them all over to Deng Ning.

Indeed, Deng Ning was overjoyed; he offered a few humble refusals but yielded, happily slipping both Spatial Rings onto his fingers, apparently unconcerned anyone would know he had slain two sectmates.

With matters settled, Deng Ning and Yang Kai summoned a Star Shuttle and flew toward Demon Blood City ten thousand li away.

Along the way Deng Ning tried to learn Yang Kai's standing within Yingyue Hall, but Yang Kai kept his mouth shut and refused to be probed.

Yang Kai, however, steered the conversation elsewhere.

Through their talk Yang Kai finally recalled why Deng Ning's voice had sounded familiar in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

It turned out both had attended the Jubao Tower auction held in Tianyun City before the opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland; at that auction Deng Ning had once bid several times on behalf of Demon Blood Sect elders.

The topic immediately turned to that magnificent auction. Deng Ning praised the endless treasures auctioned there with hungry eyes, unaware that the most valuable items had all been brought by Yang Kai himself.

Chattering easily, time flew, and soon a grand, sprawling city came into view.

Deng Ning quickly pointed it out: that was Demon Blood City. The Demon Blood Sect itself dwelt in a mountain range a thousand li outside the city. Though the sect was a wicked and violent one, the cultivators who frequented Demon Blood City came from all corners of Dark Star, making it unusually lively; on the surface it looked no different from other cities.

However, many of the cultivators walking through the city wore cold, grim expressions—their cultivation arts were wicked to the extreme.

Sure enough, upon entering Demon Blood City Yang Kai noticed many such people. They kept others at bay with a cold, aloof manner and gave off an unpleasant aura. They disliked mingling and moved about in a hurry, all appearing very busy.

The city was full of shops and thriving commerce; many forces placed their enterprises here to trade with the Demon Blood Sect and to gather intelligence.

Deng Ning led Yang Kai through the wide streets with practiced ease, enthusiastically describing the locale and its customs.

After half a day's walking through the city, the two arrived before a vast palace.

"We're here; this is where Demon Blood City's Space Array stands," Deng Ning said, stopping and pointing ahead at Yang Kai.
