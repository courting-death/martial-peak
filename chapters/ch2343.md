## Chapter 2343 — Have You No Shame

“You dare kill someone right in front of this Lord? Boy, you’re being outrageous!” Qiu Ze’s hair bristled with fury as he gnashed his teeth and roared, his face twisted in shame and anger.

Even after personally suppressing Yang Kai, he still let Luo Jin be killed. If word of this got out, everyone would think he was just a paper tiger. This was his very first battle after advancing to the Emperor Realm, meant to establish his prestige, but things had gone completely awry.

Yang Kai killing Luo Jin was a direct slap to his face—how could Qiu Ze possibly endure such humiliation?

As soon as he finished speaking, Qiu Ze flicked his wrist, and a blood-red spear appeared in his hand. The weapon pulsed with intense energy, layer upon layer of restrictive seals swirling across its surface. At a glance, it was clearly an upper-level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure, intimately connected to Qiu Ze’s mind and spirit—he had even performed a blood sacrifice to bind it to himself.

Qiu Ze had only just ascended to the Emperor Realm and did not possess an Imperial Treasure. Still, if given enough time to refine and nurture this blood-red spear, it might one day be elevated to the rank of an Imperial Treasure. 

Unfortunately, he no longer had that luxury.

To deal with a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, he was actually forced to use a Secret Treasure. It was a bit disgraceful, but Qiu Ze couldn’t afford to care about that now.

With the spear in hand, Qiu Ze’s aura surged even higher. The blood-red spear was tightly linked to his own aura, the two seemingly fused as one, mind and weapon in perfect harmony. Qiu Ze let out a thunderous shout and struck first, aiming to kill Yang Kai in a single blow and reclaim his dignity.

Sss sss...

Countless blood-red spear shadows shot forth, swarming toward Yang Kai like a plague of locusts. The entire sky turned crimson as murderous intent and wild power swept out, leaving everyone watching pale with fear.

Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword was poised to strike, sword intent surging, sword light flashing as he shouted, “A million swords unleashed—one man holds the pass!”

He stood right between Chi Yue and the others and Qiu Ze, so there was no way to dodge Qiu Ze’s attack. If he tried, Chi Yue and the others would be engulfed by the spear shadows.

Not only was Qiu Ze’s attack a sneak attack, he was also shamelessly exploiting Yang Kai’s concern for Chi Yue and the others. Truly despicable.

An ordinary Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator would have no way to resist. Under this move, they’d be blasted to pieces.

But with an Imperial Treasure in hand, Yang Kai’s ultimate defensive technique greatly neutralized Qiu Ze’s power.

Boom boom boom...

Spear light and sword light collided in midair, energy tides roiling, the void trembling, heaven and earth shattering.

Qiu Ze’s expression suddenly changed. He retreated a step, and with a flick of his spear, shredded a hidden Moon Blade that had come with the sword light into dust.

On the other side, Yang Kai didn’t move an inch. But with several soft hissing sounds, blood blossomed across his body—he’d clearly suffered a minor loss in this exchange.

Qiu Ze was, after all, an Emperor Realm master. For Yang Kai to go head-to-head with him was already a testament to his strength. If he’d come out completely unscathed, that would be truly terrifying.

"Boy, you dare ambush this Lord? Despicable!" Qiu Ze was inwardly shocked, but his face remained calm. His earlier strike had been too hasty, so he hadn’t seen the Moon Blade’s true form—only that it was a mysterious attack.

Yang Kai curled his lip and said, “Old bastard, don’t you feel ashamed saying that?”

Qiu Ze naturally understood what he meant, but had no intention of arguing. He spun his spear, unleashing another ultimate move that shattered the sky, thrusting straight at Yang Kai’s face.

Yang Kai was furious. This old bastard had clearly seen he couldn’t dodge freely, so every move was ruthless, forcing him into a head-on clash. If not for Chi Yue and the others behind him, Yang Kai wouldn’t be so passive. But he simply couldn’t ignore their safety.

Not only did Yang Kai see this, everyone else did too. Ruan Hongbo and the others all wore awkward expressions, secretly thinking Qiu Ze had no bearing as an Emperor Realm expert—he was nothing but a thug.

But now that they were all in the same boat, even if they despised him, they didn’t dare say a word.

“Give you an inch and you take a mile! Old dog, have you no shame?” Yang Kai shouted angrily, channeling Origin Qi into the Myriad Sword and meeting the attack head-on.

Wherever the sword edge passed, all the spear shadows were shattered, instantly collapsing into nothing.

This time, Qiu Ze’s face truly changed. The other party was just a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, yet could fight him to a standstill. If not for his concern for his companions, wouldn’t Qiu Ze be completely outmatched?

After breaking through Qiu Ze’s attack, Yang Kai didn’t pause for a moment. With a flick of his fingers, over a dozen Moon Blades howled forth.

Qiu Ze’s eyes narrowed sharply. This time, he finally sensed it clearly—those crescent, pitch-black energy attacks were filled with dense Spatial Force. As they surged and shifted unpredictably, he simply couldn’t grasp their trajectories.

“Spatial Law?” Qiu Ze cried out in shock, his body trembling as Emperor Intent erupted, forming an Emperor Domain ten zhang wide around him.

With the sudden appearance of the Emperor Domain, he was finally able to discern the direction of the Moon Blades’ attacks, and his spear danced, breaking them apart one by one.

In an instant, Qiu Ze was drenched in cold sweat, his face filled with terror.

When Yang Kai displayed extraordinary combat strength, Qiu Ze hadn’t panicked. Even when they fought evenly, he just thought Yang Kai was a rare talent. But once he realized Yang Kai had mastered the Spatial Law, he felt things had taken a dire turn.

How rare and bizarre is the Spatial Law? Ordinary people can’t even sense a trace of it, let alone comprehend it. It's not tied to cultivation level. There are plenty of Emperor Realm experts in the Star Realm, but how many truly understand the Spatial Law?

Yet this young man before him could wield the Spatial Law in battle, casually unleashing Space Blades. What did that mean? It meant his attainments in spatial power had reached the pinnacle. Such a person’s future was limitless—given time, he would surely achieve greatness.

When he finishes cultivating, wouldn’t Qiu Ze be doomed?

At this thought, Qiu Ze no longer cared about establishing prestige. Only the words “eliminate the root” flashed through his mind. He shouted, “What are you all standing around for? Get moving!”

At his shout, everyone finally snapped out of it. They’d come here to cause trouble for the Chiyue Sect, not to watch a show. Besides, they’d already killed so many Chiyue Sect disciples—if they didn’t wipe them out now, and the sect managed to recover, they might rise again.

“Palace Master Qiu, I’ll help you!” a loud voice rang out as a figure shot forward.

To everyone’s surprise, the first to respond wasn’t Ruan Hongbo or Mu Zheng, but Shi Cangying of the Chiyue Sect.

He looked as if he bore a deep grudge against the Chiyue Sect, eager to kill Yang Kai and the others right now. As he spoke, he unleashed his Secret Treasure, Origin Qi surging as he attacked Yang Kai.

With Shi Cangying making a move, how could Mu Zheng, Ruan Hongbo, and the others stand by? After only a brief hesitation, they all gritted their teeth and joined in. In an instant, over a dozen Secret Treasures and secret techniques from Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators bombarded Yang Kai.

Though Yang Kai was formidable and had grown even stronger after his breakthrough, able to fight Qiu Ze without falling behind, with so many people attacking at once, he simply couldn’t fend them all off. In just three breaths, he was covered in blood, battered and miserable.

Once Yang Kai was surrounded, the other martial artists from Tianzhao Palace, White Cloud Tower, and Heavenly Extreme Hall bypassed the battlefield and charged at Chi Yue and the others.

Seeing this, Hua Qingsi’s face turned cold. She said in a low voice, “Miss Ye, take them into the secret realm.”

Ye Qinghan replied, “What about you?”

Hua Qingsi glanced at Liu Yan, who was still sitting cross-legged and motionless, and said, “I have to stay here.”

No one knew what Liu Yan was up to. Ever since she sat down, she hadn’t moved at all. Naturally, Hua Qingsi couldn’t just leave her.

What Hua Qingsi didn’t expect was that, faced with her urging, Ye Qinghan shook her head and said, “This is a life-and-death moment for my Chiyue Sect. How could we run away?”

Ye Hen also nodded and declared, “Indeed. Young Master Yang, an outsider, is willing to risk everything for our Chiyue Sect—how could I, as Sect Master, shrink back now? Even if I must spill my blood within five steps, I will not retreat!”

As soon as he finished, the others all nodded, showing they were ready to face death without fear.

“You all really…” Hua Qingsi stamped her foot in frustration, but seeing the determination on Ye Hen and the others’ faces, she knew persuasion was useless. She could only turn to look at Chi Yue and the others.

Chi Yue smiled and said, “One more person means one more strength. Sister, don’t try to persuade us. We’ve only just reunited with Yang Kai—if we separate again, we might never see him.”

Hua Qingsi sighed, knowing nothing more could be said. She could only say, “Then everyone, be careful!”

As they spoke, their location was surrounded by layer upon layer of martial artists. But for some reason, these martial artists hesitated, not attacking immediately, instead watching warily.

Just then, a furious roar came from Yang Kai’s side, as if he’d truly been enraged. In the next instant, a dazzling light erupted, swallowing the area where Yang Kai stood.

Over twenty Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators plus an Emperor Realm master attacking together—how could Yang Kai possibly withstand it?

In this moment of crisis, he could only teleport away, suddenly appearing in front of Hua Qingsi and the others.

His sudden appearance startled the surrounding sect martial artists, who all retreated in shock. Yang Kai had just fought Qiu Ze and killed Luo Jin in a single move—how could they not be wary?

In an instant, a huge space opened up on the Formation Foundation platform where everyone stood.

“The rumors are true—mastering spatial power really is a good thing.” Qiu Ze’s voice, tinged with envy and jealousy, came from the outskirts. The crowd parted, and Qiu Ze led over a dozen Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators forward, stopping a dozen zhang in front of Yang Kai and the others.

Yang Kai curled his lip, his face full of defiance.

Though he couldn’t match so many experts working together, it wasn’t possible for them to kill him either. Now that he’d retreated to the Formation Foundation platform, he could advance or retreat at will. He had no fear at all—at worst, he could just activate the Space Array and take Chi Yue and the others back to the secret realm.

Besides, he hadn’t even used his trump cards yet.

Previously, he had been forced to hold back, wary of harming his companions. But now that they had all gathered here, those worries had vanished—he could finally fight without restraint.
