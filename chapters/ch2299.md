## Chapter 2299 — Unable to Make a Move

Qiu Yu could not stand it any longer either. He reached out and tugged at Luo Bing, saying, “Sister Bing, don’t make trouble. The City Lord has to prepare for tomorrow’s ceremony today, so I’m afraid he won’t see you.”

“I’m not making trouble! I just want to buy these things!” Luo Bing insisted stubbornly.

Yang Kai shook his head, took the herbs, placed them into his Spatial Ring, paid the shopkeeper the corresponding number of Source Crystals, and turned to leave.

He could not be bothered to entangle with these two any further.

“Don’t go!” Luo Bing called out persistently, but it was useless. Seeing Yang Kai about to leave, she hurriedly grabbed Qiu Yu, pleading, “Brother Yu, help me stop him. I must buy those herbs today.”

“Forget it!” A trace of impatience flashed in Qiu Yu’s eyes. Accompanying this naive little girl in her nonsense, he was reaching the limit of his patience. Still, Tianhe City was quite powerful now, and Tianzhao Palace wanted to get closer to it, so every time he came to Tianhe City, he would accompany Luo Bing. “If the City Lord finds out, it won’t be good.”

“What’s so bad about it? In Tianhe City, I can take whatever I want. If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility.” Luo Bing acted high and mighty. “Besides, isn’t he with the people from Chiyue Sect? Just as well, we can ask him what plot he has coming into the city.”

Qiu Yu sighed helplessly. Seeing her so unreasonable, he could only grit his teeth and agree. Besides, he also wanted to know what relationship Yang Kai had with Chiyue Sect. There was no such person as Yang Kai in Chiyue Sect. He was sure of that. But earlier at the city gate, Ye Qinghan had said he was from Chiyue Sect, which made Qiu Yu wary. Thinking of this, he nodded, "Fine. But if the City Lord asks about this…"

“I’ll never mention you, that’s all. Brother Yu, you’re the best.” Luo Bing showed a happy expression.

Qiu Yu’s face turned stern and he shouted in a low voice, “Elders, please!”

It was unclear who he was talking to.

Luo Bing stood there grinning, staring at Yang Kai’s back, expecting him to be captured. She imagined him being interrogated, kneeling and begging for mercy, obediently handing over the herbs. But as she watched, her smile faded, because Yang Kai strolled out the shop’s door, turned, and melted into the crowd, disappearing from sight.

“He… he ran away!” Luo Bing shook Qiu Yu’s arm, reminding him.

Qiu Yu was also stunned. He shouted into the air, “Elders, what’s going on?”

As soon as he finished speaking, two figures suddenly appeared beside him—the two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm elders who had come with him at the city gate. But now, both were sweating, their faces pale, looking as if they had just survived a disaster.

“Why didn’t you make a move?” Qiu Yu’s face darkened, feeling he had lost face in front of Luo Bing. He was in a foul mood.

The two elders exchanged glances. One said, “Young Master, please understand. It’s not that we didn’t want to act, but we simply couldn’t!”

“What do you mean?” Qiu Yu’s face sank.

The elder said, “I can’t explain it. Just as we were about to act, we suddenly felt an extremely dangerous sensation, as if… as if…”

As he spoke, a trace of fear appeared on his face.

The other elder added, “It felt as though, if we had truly made a move, the two of us would have collapsed on the spot!”

“Are you joking?” Qiu Yu’s mouth fell open as he stared at the two elders in disbelief.

The first elder said, “Young Master, we have followed you for many years and never disobeyed your orders. But this time… something is off.”

“Indeed, please forgive us, Young Master,” the other elder added.

Qiu Yu stared at them for a long time before saying hoarsely, “You mean that brat is pretending to be weak… and might be an Emperor Realm expert?”

As soon as he said this, Qiu Yu couldn’t help but swallow, cold sweat breaking out on his back, his face turning pale.

Both elders were Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts. Though old, their cultivation was even more refined and powerful. For someone to suppress them in an instant, making them too afraid to act and leaving no trace, only an Emperor Realm expert could do that.

Thinking that he had provoked an Emperor Realm-level expert, Qiu Yu felt weak in the knees, his legs trembling so much he could barely stand.

“No, no, no…” The first elder shook his head. “That brat is too young to be an Emperor Realm expert. Besides, we used Divine Sense to scan him carefully—he’s definitely at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.”

“Then is there an Emperor Realm expert secretly protecting him?” Qiu Yu was shocked again.

“No! That feeling didn’t come from an Emperor Realm expert…” the other elder shook his head.

Qiu Yu swallowed and said, “Could you two have made a mistake?”

The first elder said, “Does Young Master not trust us?”

“Not at all.” Qiu Yu quickly waved his hand. “It’s just… there must be some explanation, right? Could that brat really defeat you two so easily?”

The elder sneered, “With his cultivation and age, it’ll be another hundred years before he can beat the two of us.”

Luo Bing, who had been listening in confusion, interjected, “What are you talking about? That guy already ran off, and you two old geezers are useless. Brother Yu treats you so well, too.”

Qiu Yu’s face suddenly turned cold. He glared at Luo Bing and said, “Shut up!”

Luo Bing was startled. Since she had known Qiu Yu, he had never treated her like this, nor had she ever seen him so angry. Coupled with the humiliation she had just suffered, she couldn’t take it and screamed hysterically, “You scolded me? You dare scold me!”

Qiu Yu snorted, “The two elders treat me like a junior. I won’t allow you to insult them!”

Luo Bing’s eyes reddened, and tears fell like broken pearls. She glared at Qiu Yu, then rushed at him, pounding him with her fists, shouting, “I hate you, I hate you! Brother Yu, you’re the worst! I hate you!”

After hitting him for a while, she turned and ran out of the shop, vanishing into the crowd in the blink of an eye.

“Young Master, aren’t you going to chase her?” one of the elders asked, his face changing.

Qiu Yu snorted, “That little girl is spoiled. Let her reflect on her own for a while.”

“But if something happens to Miss Luo…” the elder said worriedly.

Qiu Yu didn’t care. “She’s the City Lord’s daughter. In Tianhe City, who would dare do anything to her? She’s probably already running to the City Lord’s mansion. I know her temperament—don’t worry.”

Seeing him say this, the two elders could only drop the matter.

“But that brat… is worth keeping an eye on.” Qiu Yu’s face was grave. “He might have some secrets. I really want to know who he is.”

“Don’t worry, Young Master. I’ll go investigate right away.” One elder cupped his fists, then disappeared.

…

On the streets of Tianhe City, a young girl wept bitterly, looking utterly heartbroken as she ran through the crowd, drawing curses from all around.

Luo Bing was completely devastated. Not only had she been rejected and disliked by a strange man, but she had also been humiliated in the shop, and then scolded by Qiu Yu, whom she considered her best friend.

She had never suffered such grievances since childhood. Now, sorrow overwhelmed her, and her tears would not stop. Soon, her eyes were red and swollen from crying.

She ran while crying, glancing back from time to time as if expecting something, but no one came after her. This made her even sadder, and she felt like the most pitiful person in the world.

The more she thought about it, the more she blamed that shameless-looking youth. If he had just given her the herbs, she wouldn’t have been embarrassed, nor would Qiu Yu have scolded her.

Thinking this, she cursed Yang Kai in her heart, vowing to make him pay the next time they met.

She had no idea how long she had been running and crying. When she finally came to her senses, she realized she was lost.

Although she was the City Lord’s daughter and had grown up in Tianhe City, whenever she went out, she was always surrounded by attendants and guards, so she never had to worry about anything. After shopping, someone would always lead her home.

And wherever she went was always the most prosperous part of Tianhe City.

But now, she found herself in a desolate area. The streets were narrow, the air foul, and the place was filled with disgusting smells. There were even many disabled people begging on both sides of the street.

There was even a filthy beggar sitting in the sun, picking lice off himself. Whenever he caught one, he would pop it into his mouth and crunch down, eating with relish…

Luo Bing quickly turned her head away, retching. She wondered to herself: Is this really the flourishing Tianhe City? Did I run into some unknown small town by mistake?

The thought made her shudder.

If that was the case, she would never find her way home. Her mood, which had just calmed down, plummeted again, and tears of panic welled up once more.

Just then, she saw two men walking ahead. Like a drowning person grabbing a lifeline, she wiped her tears and hurried over, calling out, “You two, wait!”

The two men stopped and turned to look at Luo Bing.

With a glance, both of their eyes lit up.

Luo Bing was naturally beautiful, with a graceful figure. Years of pampering had given her an innate air of nobility. Now, though she was crying, it only made her look more pitiful and endearing.

No wonder the two men stared, unable to look away, secretly swallowing. In this part of Tianhe City, women with any status or beauty would never come here. But today, a goddess had suddenly appeared. How could they not be moved?
