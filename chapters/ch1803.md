## Chapter 1803 — Let's Talk

It was as if he had been struck by thunder; Lü Guichen's body was flung backward, and while still airborne he spat a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground like a dead fish.

After hitting the ground he scrambled to his feet, looking at Yang Kai with terror and wariness, and trembled, "You... this can't be!"

He had not gone to probe Yang Kai's realm before because he had assumed Yang Kai's strength must be lower than his; after all, back then that brat had only just entered the Saint Realm, while over these years he had enjoyed rich Spiritual Qi and countless heaven-and-earth treasures on this Floating Continent, his cultivation had advanced terrifyingly — he had been many times stronger than that kid in the past, so how could he be his match now?

He had simply not taken Yang Kai seriously!

But the instant Yang Kai's Saint Yuan counterattacked, he knew something was wrong.

That kid's Saint Yuan was many times more vigorous and pure than his; when he compared his own Saint Yuan at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in both quality and quantity with the other's, it was like a firefly's glow contending with a brilliant moon.

This left Lü Guichen utterly unable to believe it!

Could this kid already be at the Void King Realm?

Only then did he think to release his Divine Sense and probe Yang Kai.

"Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!" After confirming Yang Kai's realm, Lü Guichen's face changed drastically; he collapsed onto the ground, his mind losing the ability to think, and he could only mutter, "How is this possible, how could this be..."

No matter what he could not accept what he perceived — in just decades this brat before him had leapt from the Saint Realm to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

What terrifying speed and talent this was.

Could time flow differently in this damned place so that while he had been here for decades, outside hundreds of years had passed? Otherwise, where would such terrifying cultivation have come from?

All manner of strange thoughts flashed through Lü Guichen's mind; he was completely stunned.

Seeing him look utterly bereft, Yang Kai could not help but sneer, "Ignorant!"

Lü Guichen was no great figure within Purple Star and the information he could access was limited; in truth, not to mention himself, even Gu Jianxin and Zi Donglai were by no means slow in their cultivation speed.

However, when it came down to comparison, they were still far inferior to himself.

After all, they all had powerful forces backing them, never having to worry about cultivation resources, and were constantly guided and instructed by numerous masters who personally imparted profound mysteries to them.

By contrast he had wandered and struggled on his own, relying on his own exploration and occasionally meeting a benefactor who offered some pointers. In this respect Yang Kai believed he could not be compared with those young masters of the great forces; precisely because he relied on himself he had a far deeper comprehension of the Martial Dao.

Glancing sideways at him, Yang Kai curled his lip and sneered, "I regret not killing you back then."

Lü Guichen shuddered; the haze in his eyes cleared a little as he snorted coldly, "What do you intend?"

Even if Yang Kai's realm was one stage higher than his, so what? Lü Guichen believed that if he struck with full force Yang Kai might not easily kill him, so after coming to his senses his tone hardened considerably.

"Looks like your strength has progressed these years. You've taken a lot of heaven-and-earth treasures, haven't you? Tsk tsk... but judging from the fluctuations of your Saint Yuan, there is much impurity inside — you swallowed them raw. Do you know that wastes the efficacy of those treasures, and taking too many does you no good?" Yang Kai spoke matter-of-factly.

Hearing Yang Kai speak so plainly, Lü Guichen's eyes flashed with panic, for he realized the other was not wrong at all.

Over these years he had been alone on the Floating Continent and could do nothing but cultivate; in the early years he had tried to find a way to escape, but as time passed he gave up — even someone like the Ghost Ancestor had been trapped here for two thousand years, how could he possibly flee?

Once he had resigned himself, Lü Guichen only sought to increase his power so that one day he might shatter the void and escape this damned place by his own ability.

To improve his strength, of course he had to take some heaven-and-earth treasures.

But he was not an alchemist; even if he gathered medicinal ingredients on the Floating Continent he could not refine them, so helplessly he had to swallow them raw like a demonic beast.

The result was that the herbs' stray energies accumulated in his body and became increasingly difficult to resolve; now it had begun to affect his cultivation — each time he circulated his Saint Yuan his meridians ached slightly.

He did not know what the long-term consequences would be, but he knew it was absolutely not a good sign.

Now that Yang Kai had exposed his condition in a single sentence, Lü Guichen's eyes brightened, "You know my state — you know the method to resolve it?"

“So what if I do?” Yang Kai lifted his nose toward the sky, looking as if he didn’t take him seriously in the slightest.

"Teach me!" Lü Guichen begged.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed, "Are you joking? I haven't settled accounts with you for what happened back then."

Back then he had been captured by Purple Star's cultivators and Lü Guichen had placed a restriction on his body so he could not use Saint Yuan; he had nearly died — Yang Kai had never forgotten that.

"It's been so many years — why bring it up now? Besides, you didn't die back then either. Teach me the method to resolve it and I can give you benefits," Lü Guichen urged urgently.

Yang Kai gave a derisive snort, appraised him from head to toe, frowned and asked, "What about your Spatial Ring? You've been here so many years and collected many heaven-and-earth treasures, where is the ring?"

"What ring do I have?" Lü Guichen shouted, "Don't you remember? Everyone's rings were taken by that Ghost Ancestor back then!"

"Oh... so that's it, I forgot," Yang Kai said in sudden comprehension. The Ghost Ancestor had once seized everyone's Spatial Rings to refine a Space Array, all for the purpose of extracting the tiny bit of Ethereal Crystal contained within.

In the end his experiment ended in complete failure...

"So you hid the good stuff then..." Yang Kai said, looking at Lü Guichen.

Lü Guichen's face turned grim; he looked at Yang Kai as if at a robber about to seize his hoard and warned, "I tell you, those things are indeed hidden by me — but in a very safe place. Without me, you'll never find them in your life."

"Don't be so tense," Yang Kai chuckled. "Let me guess — in this place the only ready-made dwelling is the cave the Ghost Ancestor left; you've probably been living there these years, and the heaven-and-earth treasures..."

Lü Guichen remained calm and untroubled, giving Yang Kai a faint cold laugh.

"Of course those treasures couldn't also be hidden there," Yang Kai went on.

The smile on Lü Guichen's face vanished in an instant and he was somewhat astonished — he had not expected Yang Kai to be so shrewd.

"A crafty rabbit has three burrows — you don't put all your eggs in one basket," Yang Kai said.

"Hmph, clever of you. Even if you guessed that, so what? This place may not be large, but hiding things here is still easy. If you don't tell me how to resolve it, you'll never get anything from me. And mark my words, I've already gathered all the useful herbs on this continent clean — to find more you'd have to wait at least a hundred years. You were here once yourself and should know this place produces many Void King-Grade herbs; those herbs are too potent for me to resolve at my strength, so I've preserved them all. If you meet my demands, I'll hand everything over," Lü Guichen finished, his tone softening.

"Is that a threat?" Yang Kai asked calmly, snorting coldly, "Fine — I won't waste words on you. I only don't want those herbs to be wasted. Since you're so stubborn... then please die."

There were indeed many good things on the Floating Continent, and Yang Kai had come partly out of a desire not to see them squandered; now that Lü Guichen proved so troublesome, he had resolved to be ruthless.

After all, his harvest in the Medicine Valley of the Lost Realm had already been substantial — the herbs on the Floating Continent were merely the icing on the cake.

With that, Yang Kai flicked two Golden Blood Threads from his hand; they twisted and shifted in midair and transformed into two strangely shaped demonic beasts.

They were the Blood Beasts Yang Kai had condensed in the Lost Realm — the Tail-Crested Snake and the Star-Emperor Turtle.

Both of those demonic beasts were peak Ninth-Tier. Although their strength had dipped somewhat when condensed into Blood Beasts, their foundation was solid and did not fall far; against a mere Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm like Lü Guichen they were naturally more than enough.

The Blood Beasts appeared and charged at Lü Guichen with a surging, bloodthirsty aura.

"What are these?" Lü Guichen cried in alarm, staring at the two ferocious Blood Beasts — he could not identify what sort of creatures they were and shouted, "Kid, do you really mean to wipe me out? Aren't you afraid those treasures will perish with me?"

"You call them treasures, but to me they're expendable," Yang Kai said lightly, without concern.

Lü Guichen was genuinely panicked now — he had relied on those Void King-Grade herbs to bargain, but it turned out his life-insurance was worthless; confronted with the terrifying auras the Blood Beasts gave off, how could he remain calm?

Either of those Blood Beasts alone was beyond what he could contend with.

"Young hero, wait — let's talk!" Lü Guichen retreated swiftly to avoid the Tail-Crested Snake and the Star-Emperor Turtle while shouting, "I, Lü, am willing to hand those things over with both hands; please spare my life!"

"About time," Yang Kai said without moving, and uttered a single word: "Kill!"

"Hiss..."

"Roar..."

The Tail-Crested Snake and the Star-Emperor Turtle closed in from left and right, death looming; Lü Guichen cried in terror, "Don't kill me — I can tell you a tremendous secret about this continent. If you obtain it, your future attainments will be boundless!"

Yang Kai frowned; with a slight motion of thought the two Blood Beasts halted.

At that moment the Tail-Crested Snake's fangs were less than three chi from Lü Guichen and the Star-Emperor Turtle's tail swept toward him; sensing Yang Kai's command, they immediately changed direction and flew over his head.

A fierce wind hit him and Lü Guichen broke into a cold sweat.

He had just been to the very gates of death!
