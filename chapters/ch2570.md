## Chapter 2570 — The Power of the Myriad Beasts Seal

Niu Quan was like this, and Yang Youwei’s group of yao were the same. The glowing light escaping from their bodies was clearly tied to their vitality—the more it leaked, the dimmer their life force became. As time passed, death was inevitable.

Niu Quan could be said to have come here willingly, ready to meet his end, but Yang Youwei and the other yao were simply dragged into this mess.

"Senior, please... save us..." Yang Youwei lifted his head upon sensing Yang Kai's gaze, his voice trembling as death's aura clung to him.

Yang Kai looked awkward, coughed dryly into his fist, and said, “I can’t do anything about this. Well, you’ll have to fend for yourselves!”

He couldn’t even figure out what the Tomb of All Spirits was, let alone how to save Yang Youwei and the others. He could send them into the Small Xuan Realm, maybe let them escape disaster, but the Small Xuan Realm was Yang Kai’s deepest secret. Except for a handful he truly trusted, he would never reveal it. Exposing the Small Xuan Realm just to save these yao wasn’t worth it.

Hearing this, Yang Youwei was instantly plunged into despair, but soon looked at Yang Kai in surprise and asked, “Sir, why are you... unharmed?”

Yang Kai had noticed this too. Of all those sucked in by the tomb gate, only he and Zhang Ruoxi were safe and sound. The other yao were rapidly losing vitality. If he hadn’t realized this, he wouldn’t have calmed down so quickly.

“No idea. Maybe it’s because we’re not natives of the Ancient Land. Didn’t you say this was the tomb of Ancient Land creatures?” Yang Kai replied casually. Besides this explanation, he had no clue what was happening.

“Such luck...” Yang Youwei’s mouth twitched, and a venomous light flashed in his eyes.

If you hadn’t ordered us to find that crazy woman, we wouldn’t have gotten involved with the Tomb of All Spirits and ended up here. Now, bad luck has struck, we’re doomed, while you’re carefree and don’t have to worry about dying here—and you won’t even lend a hand.

Yang Youwei was furious. He wished he could tear Yang Kai apart to vent his anger.

“Sir, you can’t just abandon us!” Yang Youwei shouted through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai frowned impatiently and said, “I told you, I have no way! Who knows what’s up with this tomb!” As he spoke, he suddenly glanced at Yang Youwei, a cold smile curling at his lips. “What, are you angry?”

Of course! Who wouldn’t be angry in this situation? Facing death, Yang Youwei suddenly grew bold, his eyes cold. “Sir, if you won’t help, maybe we’ll drag you down with us!”

Yang Kai suddenly burst out laughing, shooting Yang Youwei a sidelong glance. "Drag me down with you? Have you forgotten that your life and death rest entirely in my hands? What makes you think you can drag me along?"

“...” Yang Youwei froze, instantly silenced. He’d been so angry he forgot—he didn’t have the means to drag Yang Kai down, especially with his soul imprint still in Yang Kai’s grasp.

Grief overwhelmed him. He collapsed to the ground, wailing, “Tragedy, tragedy! Old Yang worked so hard cultivating, and just when I was about to enjoy life, I’m going to die! Heavens are blind, damn heavens, Old Yang and you are sworn enemies!”

His cries were heart-wrenching and mournful. The other yao heard him and felt sorrow too.

Falling into the tomb, they could all foresee their fate. They just weren’t as dramatic as Yang Youwei, but their hearts were heavy.

Yang Kai snorted, “Stop crying like that. If we die, we die together. At least on the Yellow Springs Road we’ll have company—no need to go alone.”

Yang Youwei wiped his tears and snapped, “Easy for you to say! The tomb is for the Ancient Land creatures—what’s it got to do with you!”

Yang Kai pursed his lips and said nothing. He was also puzzled why he and Zhang Ruoxi weren’t affected by the Ancient Land, while the other yao were losing vitality, turning into glowing lights.

Could it really be as he’d just casually said?

Just then, a wailing sound suddenly rang out. Strands of pitch-black light shot up from beneath the white bones, transforming into all sorts of bizarre Demonic Beast forms, pouncing on the living yao.

Each Demonic Beast shadow that crashed into a yao made their vitality dim even more, and the glowing light escaping sped up sharply.

“Beast souls!” Yang Youwei cried out in terror.

Yang Kai’s expression changed too. In just a moment, over a thousand black shadows had flown out from beneath the bone mountain. These shadows were similar to Yin-Souls, full of sinister energy, clearly the beast souls left behind by Demonic Beasts that died here.

The Tomb of All Spirits had existed for countless years, and the Demonic Beasts that died here were innumerable. After death, their beast souls remained, so many it was impossible to count.

In the blink of an eye, the bone mountain was swarming with beast souls. Each one retained its original form, all exuding fierce auras. The dense blackness seemed to shroud the entire tomb, like locusts passing through.

Yang Youwei’s group of yao wanted to resist, but how could they? In no time, every yao was surrounded by countless beast souls. Piercing screams echoed, as if they were suffering inhuman torment—there was no hope for survival.

Zhang Ruoxi’s face turned pale, and she clung tightly to Yang Kai, not daring to move.

With prior experience dealing with Yin-Soul ghosts, Yang Kai wasted no time. He immediately summoned the Slave-Insect Bracelet, releasing all the Soul-Devouring Worms, which gathered around himself and Zhang Ruoxi, forming a protective cloud. Once their safety was ensured, the remaining Soul-Devouring Worms went after the beast souls.

As soon as the Soul-Devouring Worms appeared, the countless beast souls clearly met their nemesis, quickly avoiding Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, not daring to approach.

Yang Kai was overjoyed. The Soul-Devouring Worms had performed brilliantly in the Ancient Land, proving to be the best means against Yin-Soul types. He secretly decided to focus on raising them—if they grew strong enough, maybe he could even challenge Great Emperor Youhun in the future.

That old man, relying on his profound cultivation, let his daughter run wild, and Yang Kai was helpless to stop him. Yang Kai ground his teeth in frustration.

Over there, the cries of Yang Youwei and the other yao faded one after another. In less than a few dozen breaths, all sound ceased—clearly, none of them had survived. Yang Kai felt the Soul Imprint he held over Yang Youwei shatter as well, and he could not help letting out a faint sigh.

He hadn’t planned to care about Yang Youwei’s fate; he’d only controlled him to help search for the Third Disciple. But for him to die like this was still unexpected.

“Sir, open a gap!” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly spoke.

Yang Kai didn’t know what she wanted, but after her previous actions, he was wary. Still, seeing her take out a large seal, his eyes lit up and he obediently controlled the Soul-Devouring Worms to open a gap.

Zhang Ruoxi slapped the seal with her fair hand and sent it flying.

She then rapidly formed hand seals, controlling the power of the seal.

Once the seal flew out, it grew with the wind, instantly becoming as large as a house, pitch-black like a black hole.

Clatter...

The sound of chains whipping echoed. As Zhang Ruoxi’s hand seals changed, countless pitch-black chains shot out from inside the seal, suddenly lashing in all directions.

The flying beast souls were caught off guard, and were bound and locked by the chains.

The chains went taut, and under Zhang Ruoxi’s control, dragged the bound beast souls into the seal. In the blink of an eye, over a hundred fierce beast souls were pulled in and vanished, unable to escape no matter how they struggled.

“You’ve fully refined the Myriad Beasts Seal?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“I finished refining it a few days ago,” Zhang Ruoxi replied happily, her hands never stopping. “Didn’t expect to run into such a good opportunity.”

That seal was the Myriad Beasts Seal of Kunyuan City’s City Lord, Zu Hong. After Zu Hong was killed by Yang Kai in the ancient medicine garden, the Myriad Beasts Seal was given to Zhang Ruoxi for self-defense. It was a powerful Imperial Treasure, and its strength depended not on the wielder, but on the number and strength of beast souls sealed within.

The more beast souls sealed inside, the stronger the Myriad Beasts Seal’s power. The fewer, the weaker.

After obtaining the Myriad Beasts Seal, Zu Hong had labored tirelessly, yet managed to slay barely a thousand Demonic Beasts, sealing their Beast Souls into the treasure through secret arts. Most of those souls were only Tenth- or Eleventh-Tier, and the Twelfth-Tier ones could be counted on one hand. As such, he had never been able to bring forth the true power of the Myriad Beasts Seal.

But here in the Tomb of All Spirits, Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast souls were everywhere. If Zhang Ruoxi sealed them all into the Myriad Beasts Seal, the Imperial Treasure’s power would be unimaginable.

Beast souls were hard to find—one had to kill a Demonic Beast to get a soul, then refine it with secret arts to avoid damage. Damaged beast souls had little power.

But this place was a natural gathering spot for beast souls, tailor-made to boost the Myriad Beasts Seal’s power.

She’d been wondering where to hunt Demonic Beasts to strengthen the Myriad Beasts Seal, but unexpectedly stumbled into this opportunity. How could she not be delighted?

Throughout history, countless Ancient Land creatures died here—even powerful Yao Kings, whose strength rivaled the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, couldn’t escape. One can imagine how many formidable beast souls were gathered here.

If all the beast souls here were sealed into the Myriad Beasts Seal and used in battle, the entire Star Realm would be shocked.

Clatter, clatter...

The sound of chains filled the air. Each time Zhang Ruoxi acted, over a hundred beast souls were dragged into the Myriad Beasts Seal and sealed, repeating the process over and over, busy and overjoyed.

Yang Kai watched with envy.
