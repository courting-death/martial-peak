## Chapter 581 — One Slight, Triple Retribution

Four Transcendent Realm experts died in an instant. This was not only a severe blow to Zhongdu’s forces but also dealt a heavy strike to their morale.

What troubled the heads of the Eight Great Families even more was that they could not comprehend Yang Kai’s stance at all.

“Seventeen beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!” Meng Xiping’s lips trembled as he stared blankly at the impressive lineup beside Yang Kai, his eyes glazed over.

Thirteen Blood Servants, plus the Earth Demon, Ling Taixu, Li Yuanchun, and Lü Si—a total of seventeen experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

This staggering number made the heads of the Eight Great Families feel utterly ashamed. Their families had painstakingly cultivated their strength for so many years, yet they barely had four or five top-tier experts. Compared to Yang Kai’s household, it was like heaven and earth.

How had these people’s powers suddenly increased so dramatically? No one could figure it out.

“Ying Jiu, follow me. The others act on their own,” Yang Kai commanded, then led Ying Jiu as they wove through the chaotic and bloody battlefield.

The other sixteen Transcendent Realm experts charged silently toward the Cangyun Evil Land.

After a brief moment of horrified hesitation, the martial artists from the Eight Great Families cooperated with Yang Kai’s men to launch a coordinated siege against Cangyun Evil Land.

“Order everyone to retreat,” Yang Bai suddenly appeared and softly instructed the five Evil Kings.

The expressions of the five Evil Kings were hardly better than those of the heads of the Eight Great Families. After witnessing the number and caliber of Yang Kai’s forces, they felt the situation was perilous.

For so long, they had been locked in a stalemate against the Eight Great Families, but with the sudden emergence of Yang Kai’s household, this deadlock was likely to shatter.

Wherever Yang Kai’s loyalty lay, the other side was destined to lose.

What somewhat reassured the five Evil Kings was Yang Kai’s indiscriminate ruthlessness—he killed both Cangyun Evil Land warriors and those from Zhongdu. It seemed he would kill anyone who provoked him.

Upon receiving Yang Bai’s order, the five Evil Kings dared not delay.

A deep, somber sound echoed—like a battle horn.

At that signal, the Cangyun Evil Land forces retreated in the midst of battle and gradually disappeared from sight.

Yang Kai’s warriors and the Eight Great Families pursued for a while but did not dare to advance recklessly, withdrawing back to their bases.

From the moment Yang Kai arrived, no more than the time a tea brew takes, the clash ended with heavy casualties on both sides. Yet none of Yang Kai’s forces were lost, at worst a few sustained minor injuries.

All returned with smiles, their demeanor calm and assured.

Yang Kai circled the battlefield a few times, absorbing the Divine Sense energy of the fallen Divine Roaming Realm experts. Only then did he return to his residence with Ying Jiu.

He immediately entered seclusion to purify and absorb the energy, not even bothering to greet the Eight Great Families.

Such arrogant disregard for the Eight Great Families left everyone feeling suffocated and unsettled.

“Brother Yang, isn’t your boy in the Yang Family a bit too arrogant?” After withdrawing, Kang Rui glared angrily at Yang Yinghao.

“He has the qualifications,” Yang Yinghao sighed lightly.

“But after all, he is part of the Yang Family. Can’t you, as family head, rein him in?”

“A joke. At this point, do you think he still cares about the Yang Family?” Yang Yinghao snorted coldly.

“Ah... Maybe we were wrong.” Meng Xiping sighed. “We shouldn’t have targeted him so aggressively from the start, tried to pry the secrets from his hands. If only we had…”

“Does it make sense to say that now?” Ye Kuangren looked coldly at Meng Xiping. “This is the current state: if we gain Yang Kai’s support, we can repel Cangyun Evil Land in less than half a month. However, if Cangyun Evil Land gains Yang Kai’s backing, then Zhongdu…”

It’s over!

“But he just killed one person from the Nan Family, the Xiang Family, the Huang Family, and Guangming Mansion. How shall we deal with this?” Gao Mo frowned. “This is no small matter. Those four answered the call of the Eight Great Families to aid Zhongdu. If we handle this poorly, the world will lose faith in the Eight Great Families.”

Everyone fell into a heavy silence, realizing the complexity of the issue.

Logically, Yang Kai’s killing of those four could never go unpunished by the Eight Great Families. Even if only for appearances, they must respond to the powers of this world. But if they crossed Yang Kai, the consequences would be unbearable.

“What kind of person is this boy, really?” Old Master Huo Zheng’s face was filled with confusion and disbelief. “How could he go to such lengths?”

Hearing this, the seven all turned their eyes to Yang Yinghao.

Yang Yinghao replied indifferently, “Don’t look at me. I don’t know much about him. I only know he’s stubborn. Even back in the Yang Family, he was very assertive and would never accept being slighted.”

“Why don’t we call his parents over to ask? They should know more than us,” Kang Rui suddenly suggested.

“Good idea. No matter how ruthless he is, how much we clash with him, he must care about his parents, right?”

Yang Yinghao pondered and nodded, “Bring them over, but remember, do not treat them badly.”

“Of course, Brother Yang. You worry too much,” everyone nodded in agreement.

Who now dares offend Yang Kai?

Fourth Master Yang and his wife had remained at the Yang Family, not dispatched to fight against Cangyun Evil Land. This was by Yang Yinghao’s special arrangement, despite Fourth Master Yang’s many requests to join the battle.

It was a small measure of compensation from Yang Yinghao to Yang Kai for past grievances.

They sent for Fourth Master Yang and his wife from the Yang Family.

Yang Yingfeng bowed respectfully. “Family Head, why summon my wife and me?”

He and Dong Suzhu didn’t know Yang Kai had already come to Zhongdu today, nor of the fierce battle just fought. Naturally, they were puzzled and assumed Yang Yinghao was dispatching them to join the battle.

“It’s nothing serious,” Yang Yinghao cleared his throat. “The family heads want to understand Yang Kai’s character.”

“Kai’er?” Fourth Master Yang furrowed his brow, suspicion clouding his face.

“Did something happen to Kai’er?” Dong Suzhu instantly grew anxious and hurriedly asked.

Yang Yinghao shook his head. “Yang Kai is safe. Sister-in-law, no need to worry.”

“If nothing happened, why do you want to know about Kai’er?” Dong Suzhu was extremely vigilant. Her beautiful eyes scanned around and noticed that these usually aloof heads of families were unusually reserved, some even smiling at the couple.

This was unlike anything she had seen before, arousing her suspicion.

Yang Yinghao was helpless and reluctantly recounted the recent events briefly.

“That rebellious child…” Fourth Master Yang scolded, “Since he came to Zhongdu, why hasn’t he returned to the family? Could it be that he still holds a grudge against the Eight Great Families for their past injustices?”

The eight’s faces instantly grew awkward.

Though Fourth Master Yang seemed to berate Yang Kai’s behavior, everyone could tell he was venting his own frustrations on behalf of his son.

If the Eight Great Families had not wronged him earlier, why would this Yang Family member raise his own banner and act independently?

“Forgive him, brothers. My son is young and immature; he has made grave mistakes. I shall discipline him well when I see him,” Fourth Master Yang offered apologies.

“No need for that,” Kang Rui quickly interrupted. “If Yang Kai is reprimanded to fury and turns completely against the Eight Great Families, it would be disastrous. We only want to understand Yang Kai’s character a bit better. You two raised him, so you should know him best.”

“Well…” Fourth Master Yang hesitated. “To be honest, I rarely communicate with him, so I don’t know him well.”

“I know him!” Dong Suzhu raised a hand and cried out gently.

Everyone looked expectantly at her.

Dong Suzhu began speaking rapidly, recounting trivial stories from Yang Kai’s childhood. The eight family heads listened with complicated expressions.

After an entire hour, they had gained little useful information but were well-informed of Yang Kai’s experiences over the years.

“Alright…” Seeing Dong Suzhu was about to continue, Yang Yinghao hastily interrupted, “We’ve gathered enough.”

Dong Suzhu laughed softly. “My son isn’t a bad person. Since he was young, I’ve taught him: ‘If others show me respect, I’ll return it many times over. But if they destroy one of my chestnuts… hehe, I’ll take the harvest from three orchards!’”

The eight family heads suddenly became serious, all gazing intently at Dong Suzhu’s seemingly innocent yet resolute smile.

Fourth Master Yang stood motionless like a puppet, expressionless.

“We understand,” Kang Rui nodded solemnly.

“Since you all understand, my wife and I will take our leave,” Fourth Master Yang apologized and, together with Dong Suzhu, departed calmly.

After their departure, the eight glanced toward the departing couple, realizing that the apparently sentimental Fourth Madam was no simple character. Yang Kai’s current code of conduct owed much to her past teachings.

“If others show me respect, I return it many times over…?” They all fell into deep thought.

Yang Kai’s Residence.

After this large-scale absorption and subsequent purification with the Golden Pupil Eye, Yang Kai had been in seclusion for two days. He finally reached the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, fully closing the gap with Su Yan.

Upon reaching this realm, Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief. Since meeting Su Yan until now, her strength had always surpassed his. As her man, naturally, Yang Kai wished to surpass her.

This was neither petty rivalry nor arrogant pride but a sober acknowledgement of Su Yan’s boundless potential. If he stagnated, she would only pull farther ahead.

Upon emerging from seclusion, Yang Kai once again led many strong warriors from his residence to launch a fierce assault on Cangyun Evil Land.

But having suffered losses previously, Cangyun Evil Land had prepared defenses. Yang Kai’s strike accomplished little, killing only a handful of Divine Roaming Realm experts and some Demonic Beasts.

The gains were minimal.

Yang Kai was not impatient. He regarded the Golden Pupil Eye as an auxiliary tool for cultivation. To grow stronger, he needed perseverance and unrelenting practice.

Frequent offensive actions served two purposes: to obtain the Divine Sense energy of fallen Divine Roaming Realm experts and to hone himself.
