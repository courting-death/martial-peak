## Chapter 1407 — Total Annihilation

The Soul-Devouring Worms, an ancient aberrant insect species, had been nurtured by Yang Kai and even once nourished with the Zhi Stone. Their current destructive power was incomparably greater than at the beginning.

They could now easily devour the Divine Sense power of Saint King Realm warriors and could even cause certain interference to Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

However Yang Kai rarely employed them; ordinary foes he could slay with ease, while against powerful enemies the Soul-Devouring Worms often could not perform much, so they were seldom sent out.

That did not mean the Soul-Devouring Worms were useless—their strength lay in mass slaughter.

And at this moment, they were precisely appropriate.

Soul-Devouring Worms most favored devouring Divine Sense power. Poor Lu Ye—his own secret art condensed spirit technique usually met with success, but this time it was utterly countered by Yang Kai. The World-Ending Demon Eye and the Soul-Devouring Worms—what of them was not a counter to the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu?

In the blink of an eye the cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms flew before him. Even though the blood-colored pupa was shrouded by the World-Ending golden light and had only struggled slightly, when the Soul-Devouring Worms arrived it seemed to have met its natural enemy and began to tremble.

The Soul-Devouring Worms paid no heed and, under Yang Kai's control, threw themselves recklessly at the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu.

Crunching sounds like something being gnawed echoed out.

The Soul-Devouring Worms came and went swiftly; in a moment they returned along their path toward the Seven-Colored Treasure Isle, and the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu that had been shrouded in World-Ending golden light was nowhere to be seen.

Clearly it had been devoured cleanly by the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense about and, after confirming there were no lingering threats within his Sea of Consciousness, lightly nodded and retracted his Spirit Body.

At the Xie Family headquarters more than two hundred li from Dragon Lair Mountain, in a side chamber, a fair-featured youth sitting cross-legged suddenly turned pale, spat a spray of blood mist, and with a face of astonished doubt cried out, "How is this possible?"

That person was, of course, Lu Ye.

He was clever—cautious by nature—and had not personally participated in the attack on Dragon Lair Mountain, instead remaining at the Xie Family headquarters to await news. After all, if things succeeded his presence was unnecessary; if they failed his presence would be of no use.

For that reason Lu Ye had waited from the start at a distance.

But just now a strange alarm rang out: his most relied-upon Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu had been destroyed! That Gu had been planted within Xie Li and had cost Lu Ye much effort. After all, Xie Li was a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, and secretly manipulating him was no simple task.

For this Lu Ye had even expended a fraction of his natal spirit essence.

Now that natal spirit essence had vanished, and Lu Ye as the owner naturally suffered a rebound; his injuries were not severe, but not light either—he would need at least a month or two to recuperate.

Lu Ye's face turned ferocious. What he had thought foolproof had suddenly gone awry, and from the scant clues fed back by the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu, it appeared the other side had been destroyed by Yang Kai.

As to exactly what means had been used, Lu Ye could not know—no matter how formidable his secret arts, he could not monitor the happenings within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

"Fine, fine!" Lu Ye sneered softly. "I have underestimated you. A mere Saint King Realm can wound me—looks like I won't be lonely in the future. Interesting."

Muttering to himself for a while, Lu Ye’s expression grew dark. With a cold snort, he said, “A bunch of useless trash—good for nothing but ruining things. If this Honored Self hadn’t been forced to seize a new body and cultivate anew, why would I ever have needed you lot? It seems this place is no longer suitable to stay in. Enough…”

Saying this, Lu Ye rose and silently departed the Xie Family headquarters, picking a direction at random and vanishing.

Though he held the title of Young Master of Liu Yun Valley, he paid no heed to it. After reclaiming the body by force, he had subjugated the valley; to practice his evil arts nine out of ten disciples had been used in blood sacrifices— even the body's kin had not been spared.

Now Liu Yun Valley was practically deserted; he had no intention of returning.

In any case, with his means, the vastness of Dark Star was his to roam. The most important thing now was to find a suitable place to restore his cultivation. As for Yang Kai—there would come a day to settle that score. He refused to believe that Yang Kai could have refined his treasured artifact. After all, Yang Kai’s cultivation was far too low; even a Void King Realm expert would need several years to succeed in refining such a thing.

It must be hidden somewhere by him!

Lu Ye assumed this, but he could not imagine Yang Kai possessed a Heaven-and-Earth treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus! Yang Kai indeed lacked the power to refine such a thing, yet the Warm Spirit Lotus had absorbed the enormous energy from that unknown crystal and thereby evolved into its final seven-colored form, allowing Yang Kai to comprehend the Blooming Lotus secret art.

Meanwhile Yang Kai opened his eyes and extended his Divine Sense to probe within Dragon Lair Mountain. He soon detected that the battle where Chang Qi and the others had been engaged had ended; Chang Qi and the other two were sitting in meditation to recuperate.

The three of them had faced the middle-aged man of the Demon Blood Sect—though he was a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, fighting within Dragon Lair Mountain his strength was greatly reduced. After being jointly beaten by Chang Qi, Hao An and Ning Xiangchen, and harassed by the formation controlled by Yang Yan several times, he inevitably perished here.

With that, all enemies who had invaded Dragon Lair Mountain had been slain without exception.

The Dragon Lair Mountain had only sent out four fighters: three at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and one at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Such a record—though not claiming there would never be future challengers—was practically unprecedented; if spread about, few would believe it.

Standing there, Yang Kai thought a moment, removed his tattered clothes, donned a fresh set, wiped the blood from his body, and then leisurely walked toward Chang Qi and the others.

Elder Du of Myriad Beasts Mountain's spirit had been devoured by the World-Ending Demon Eye; after Xie Li's self-destruction he too had not survived—there remained the Demon Blood Sect expert's spirit, and Yang Kai certainly would not let it go.

Presumably after devouring and integrating the soul energies of these three, he could launch an assault on the Origin Returning Realm.

In a short while Yang Kai reached Chang Qi and the others, glanced at the corpse of the Demon Blood Sect expert lying in a pool of blood, and quietly swallowed the spirit into his Sea of Consciousness.

His arrival evidently surprised Chang Qi and the others. The three opened their eyes and, when they saw Yang Kai, all showed delight and rose to their feet.

"Elder Ning, thank you for your efforts." Yang Kai cupped his fist to Ning Xiangchen. Ning had unhesitatingly stood at Dragon Lair Mountain and helped slay many enemies, earning Yang Kai's great favor.

No matter what his motives, the help was real.

"Haha!" Ning Xiangchen laughed heartily. Though having seen fierce battle, his complexion looked good and he showed no wounds. "Young friend Yang, you are too polite. In my life I rarely encounter such a grand event. I haven't felt this fervent in ages. I must thank you for this opportunity—you've made me feel young again."

Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Elder Ning overpraises. If Elder Ning ever finds the time in the future, you are always welcome to visit Dragon Lair Mountain. We will be sure to receive you with utmost respect.”

Ning Xiangchen's eyes brightened and his laughter grew fuller; Yang Kai's words clearly did not treat him as an outsider, and he felt the effort had paid off. But he was not satisfied and probed, "Rather than visit often, why not stay permanently? What say you?"

"Hmm?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise. Ning's suggestion seemed to indicate he wished to join Dragon Lair Mountain.

After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai understood why he had made such a choice. By aiding Dragon Lair Mountain in this battle, he had offended Myriad Beasts Mountain, the Demon Blood Sect, as well as Haixin Sect and Liuyun Valley. Though he was an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he belonged to no sect and had no one to shield him—sooner or later, someone seeking vengeance might come knocking at his door.

Better to bind himself to Dragon Lair Mountain directly.

Indeed Ning Xiangchen had lived freely but in old age felt lonely; he wanted companions to discuss cultivation and had nowhere to go. Having seen Dragon Lair Mountain's might today, he wished to join and secure a place to spend his twilight years.

Moreover, the only two Origin Returning Realm practitioners in Dragon Lair Mountain matched his strength and came from modest backgrounds with pleasant temperaments; joining would not risk being ostracized.

Considering all this, Ning's proposal was well thought out, not a rash fancy.

He was no longer young and not so impulsive.

After speaking he looked anxiously at Yang Kai, unsure if his offer would be accepted.

"Elder Ning, if you have that intention, you are most welcome!" Yang Kai's face turned grave. "But you must think it through—Dragon Lair Mountain is not a peaceful place now, perhaps..."

Before Yang Kai could finish, Ning waved a smile and said, "You may guess my worries. I'm already half-buried; nothing frightens me. Better to die here than rot in the wilderness, unknown. If I can die at Dragon Lair Mountain, that will be my fortune—it's a fine burial place."

Yang Kai's brow lifted. Seeing he had spoken so plainly, Yang Kai could not refuse and nodded: "Very well. Elder Ning will be a Guest Elder of Dragon Lair Mountain, enjoying the same treatment as the other Guest Elders."

"Haha, I accept!" Ning Xiangchen laughed and cupped his fist.

Chang Qi and Hao An congratulated repeatedly. Though the three had known each other briefly, after fighting side by side they felt a kinship. In conversation the two hinted at Dragon Lair Mountain's wealth and the treatment Guest Elders received, which made Ning's eyes shine and his heart burn.

During the earlier fight with the Demon Blood Sect's middle-aged man, Ning had seen that Chang Qi and Hao An had profound foundations, far beyond what he, a lone wanderer, could match.
