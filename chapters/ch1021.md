## Chapter 1021 — Blessing or Curse

"The truths of both powers?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Only by studying the mysteries of power to their utmost, by penetrating the true meaning of power, can one fully unleash it!" Bi Ya smiled and explained.

"That's true enough." Yang Kai felt somewhat despondent; although the Ghost Ancestor's earlier words had left him immensely encouraged, secretly feeling a whole new world opening before him, the Ghost Ancestor might have been speaking offhand.

He could not point out a clear path, nor offer Yang Kai any advice.

"Though I have never seen such a marvel, I have seen two people cultivating different attribute powers fight side by side, two forces that should counteract each other instead enhancing one another's might," Bi Ya added. "There are many like that; I believe Master, you must have seen them too."

Yang Kai's eyes suddenly brightened, his gaze burning as he stared at Bi Ya, that scorching look seeming as if he would devour her in a single bite.

Bi Ya forced a laugh, her shyness boundless: "Master, why are you looking at me like that?"

Yang Kai didn't answer; deep within, a tumult roiled.

A single word roused the dreamer; Bi Ya's casual remark led Yang Kai to subconsciously grasp some key points.

Indeed, it is exceedingly difficult—perhaps impossible—for two utterly opposite forces to fuse. Yet when two people who cultivate entirely different powers fight side by side, they can complement each other's strengths and offset weaknesses; this often happens.

That is exactly how Su Yan and I are!

Su Yan's icy cold and my own blazing heat should not be able to coexist, but once we fight side by side, both our strengths are greatly enhanced!

That's because of the existence of the Dual Cultivation Technique!

It was even more so during their dual cultivation. The two powers coexisted within each of their bodies, flowing from one to the other and back again. Through this endless cycle, Su Yan’s icy energy and his own True Yang power were both tempered and elevated in a kind of baptism, becoming ever more refined and pure.

The Dual Cultivation Technique?

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he sank into deeper contemplation.

He recalled the scenes of cultivating with Su Yan, savoring that bone-gnawing, soul-melting sensation, as if Su Yan stood before him, sharing the same Divine Sense, hearts linked, cultivating together with no escape.

Boom...

In the depths of the void, Yang Kai felt a veil blocking his sight tear apart, allowing him to see a more wondrous world and higher realms.

His body shook violently as brilliant light spilled from his eyes.

In that instant, he imagined a possibility.

Ice and fire can fuse because they persist in a cycle—an endless cycle—in which they complement and amplify each other, not restrain one another, but rather increase each other's power.

If ice and fire can do this, then perhaps my true Yang Saint Yuan and the evil energy in the Indomitable Golden Body might as well.

Strictly speaking, the evil energy within the Indomitable Golden Body is also a yin-cold force, only not quite the same as Su Yan's icy cold. It's a cold that makes one feel as if plunged into the Nine Nether Purgatory, causing both body and soul to tremble.

An invisible wave of qi suddenly exploded from Yang Kai's body; in an instant, alternating sensations of heat and cold assailed Bi Ya. One moment she felt unbearable heat, the next her delicate form trembled as if thrown into an icehouse.

"What's wrong with you?" she cried, only to find Yang Kai acting strangely; she was instantly terrified and at a loss.

She had been laboring to ingratiate herself with Yang Kai so that he might pity her, shelter her, and keep her safe. If anything happened to Yang Kai, all her efforts would have been for nothing.

Bi Ya was naturally anxious.

"Begone!" the Ghost Ancestor barked from the void; at once Bi Ya was seized by an invisible force and flung out of the stone chamber, crying out.

A breeze brushed past; Bi Ya turned, horrified to find the Ghost Ancestor standing beside her, his eerie eyes flashing oddly as he stared at Yang Kai, who remained seated in the stone chamber.

"Elder, what's wrong with him?" Bi Ya asked, mustering courage.

"I'm not entirely sure, but he seems to have gained something!" the Ghost Ancestor frowned. "What did you just talk to him about?"

Bi Ya hurriedly recounted what had happened.

The Ghost Ancestor listened, his expression shifting; he let out a queer laugh. "This brat—he can delve this far merely because of one of my jokes? I really don't know whether this is a blessing or a curse!"

"Elder... is he in danger?" Bi Ya covered her mouth.

"He wants to fuse two kinds of power—do you think that's dangerous?" the Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "If it goes wrong he could die on the spot; he's got nerve."

"Elder, can't you stop him?" Bi Ya cried, desperate. "Aren't you relying on him to help find a way out? If he dies..."

"If he dies, so much the better. I don't think this brat truly intends to help; even if he finds a way out, he'll likely abandon me! Hmph—if he dies, I'll collect his soul and use the Soul-Searching Technique to probe his memories."

The Ghost Ancestor adopted an air of indifference, a spectator on the wall; Bi Ya immediately realized pleading with him was useless.

"You, woman, aren't truly worried for his safety—why so nervous?" the Ghost Ancestor sneered at Bi Ya.

Bi Ya forced a laugh. "Elder, you jest... I really don't want him to die right now."

"What's happening?" Shen Tu shouted from the side as he hurried over. Peering into the stone chamber, he gaped and hurriedly asked, "Brother Yang, what's wrong? Why do you look like you're dying?"

No sooner had he spoken than the Ghost Ancestor's face turned cold; he barked fiercely, "Leave!"

Saying that, he vanished.

Seeing the Ghost Ancestor take such a solemn stance, how could Bi Ya and Shen Tu linger? They both used their movement arts and sped outward.

Just as they left the mountain hollow and reached the flat ground outside, two utterly opposite forces suddenly burst forth from within the mountain.

One was blistering as fire; the other, an evil, yin-cold.

Both forces were so immense they sent hearts into panic, roaring through every chamber and passage in the mountain hollow and spreading beyond the peak.

Lü Guichen, who had been standing on the mid-mountain flat, suddenly turned, his eyes trembling as he looked toward the sky.

Yue Xi, who had been speaking with He Zao and He Miao, also changed expression and looked in the same direction.

At that moment, an extremely strange scene appeared on the entire peak—it seemed to be split in two.

The left half was shrouded by that blistering yang attribute power, glowing golden; the right half was covered by pitch-black evil energy, which carried a bloodthirsty, brutal cruelty, like nightfall blotting out half the peak.

Two forces of utterly opposing attributes and colors clashed violently, making the whole peak tremble, rocks cascading—the scene of an impending apocalypse.

"What's going on?" Lü Guichen barked, retreating quickly; at the same time everyone on the mid-mountain hurried back several li to the foot of the mountain.

"I sense that youngster—what is he doing?" Yue Xi's beautiful eyes flickered as she asked He Zao and He Miao.

"I don't know; when we left, he didn't seem to be doing anything," He Miao shook her head.

"Bi Ya of Purple Star must know," He Zao said, turning her gaze to where Bi Ya and Shen Tu stood, both looking at the peak with worried, tense expressions.

Lü Guichen had already come to their side and was asking.

Listening in on their conversation, Yue Xi quickly grasped what had happened.

A most peculiar expression flitted across her pretty face, then she laughed and nodded. "That youngster is done for this time; it seems I needn't lift a finger. He's really overestimating himself—daring such an attempt at merely the First Stage of the Saint Realm. He must be tired of living."

"Master, is Yang Kai in danger?"

"His life hangs by a thread!" Yue Xi said with a pleased expression.

"Master, please save him—you're just angry at his disrespect, you don't truly want him dead, right?" He Zao pleaded.

“Of course I want him dead — I’d love nothing more than to strip him limb from limb!” Yue Xi said through clenched teeth. “And this sort of thing can’t be handled by others; didn’t you see even Ghost Ancestor stand aside?”

He Zao and He Miao looked up and saw the Ghost Ancestor standing in the sky with an inscrutable expression.

"If you forcefully stop him, he will die for sure!" Yue Xi frowned, her voice grave. "Right now he has a sliver of life left—it depends on his own effort."

After saying that, she suddenly noticed He Zao and He Miao staring at her strangely; Yue Xi fell silent, her pretty face changing.

He Zao laughed, "Master, you're really two-faced—you don't actually hold that grudge against him."

“You little ghost, don’t lecture your master,” Yue Xi said, her face darkening. “If he doesn’t die this time, you’re to stay far away from him from now on — do not come within one zhang of him!”

"Yes!" He Zao and He Miao both nodded in agreement.

"Elder, can't you think of a way?" Shen Tu stood at the foot of the mountain, calling up to the Ghost Ancestor.

The Ghost Ancestor grinned. "I have no way to stop it. This time he'll either die or soar to the heavens—let his fate decide. Heh heh, whichever outcome it is, I look forward to it. So even if there were a way, I wouldn't stop him."

He suddenly became very interested in Yang Kai.

Although he had been startled before upon learning that Yang Kai was proficient in the mysteries of space, and had been paying close attention to his movements these past days, it was only at this moment that he realized he had been underestimating Yang Kai all along.

To be able to grasp his own strength to such a degree in a short time from merely one of his words is not something just anyone can do.

The Ghost Ancestor wanted to see whether Yang Kai could truly succeed; if he did, what form would the fusion of the two forces take, and how much would it advance him?

If he survived, he would surely have a splendid future—perhaps becoming the brightest new star in the Star Domain.

At the foot of the mountain, everyone stood watching as the peak was shrouded by the two forces, watching their contest.

Some wished Yang Kai would die and be reborn sooner, some hoped he would live, and some were indifferent, merely watching a good show; the people's moods and expressions varied.
