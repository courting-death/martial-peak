## Chapter 2620 — Spring Breeze in All Directions

Yang Kai's gaze swept over, landing coldly on the two of them.

Bai Lu broke out in a cold sweat and stammered, "What do you want? I'm the Young Pavilion Master of the Thunderclap Pavilion! If anything happens to me, you'll be finished!"

Realizing he was no match, he could only bring up his background, hoping Yang Kai would hesitate.

"Scram!" Yang Kai spat out a single word.

Bai Lu shuddered as though he had just been spared a death sentence, then turned and hurried off. In his panic, he even forgot about Xue Man, forcing her to stamp her foot in frustration and hurry after him.

Not far away, Yan Qing climbed up from the ground, his face pale. He glanced fearfully in Yang Kai's direction, then hurried after Bai Lu. Though he'd lost an arm, his Emperor Realm foundation remained, so his life wasn't in danger—he'd just be crippled for the rest of his days.

"Yao'er!" Yang Kai turned his head and called softly.

Just those two simple words pierced Ji Yao's eyes like a sharp sword, parting the darkness before her.

Ji Yao's delicate body trembled as she suddenly snapped awake. "Master?"

Yang Kai couldn't help but sigh in relief and tentatively asked, "Just now... what happened to you?"

Ji Yao frowned. "Just now? What about just now?"

She seemed to have no memory of what had happened. Turning her head, she asked in surprise, "Eh? Where did those three annoying people go?"

Yang Kai smiled. "I chased them off. No need to look for them!"

Ji Yao glanced at the blood on the ground, knowing Yang Kai spoke the truth. She said, "Those guys should have been killed. I already said I wouldn't sell the Multi-deck Ship, but they insisted on pestering me. Who knows how many times they've forced others to sell things this way."

"Yes, yes, they should have been killed." Yang Kai didn't dare say more and could only go along with her, then asked nervously, "Yao'er, how are you feeling now?"

Ji Yao looked at him curiously. "I'm fine, Master. You should go in and rest. In a few days, we'll be able to return to the Valley."

Yang Kai said, "Put away the Multi-deck Ship. Let's find a place to rest first."

Ji Yao suddenly had another episode, and Yang Kai didn't know if it was because she'd been using her strength too much lately. He didn't dare let her control the Multi-deck Ship anymore. If she lost her senses again, things would get troublesome.

Letting her rest for a while might do her some good.

At Yang Kai's word, Ji Yao naturally complied and put away the Multi-deck Ship. The two of them flew forward together.

Half a day later, a city appeared ahead. They landed at the city gate, paid some Source Crystals, and entered smoothly.

The city seemed extremely prosperous. The streets were wide and bustling with people, and shops lined both sides. The goods for sale were dazzling, leaving one at a loss for where to look.

They found an inn and walked inside.

The shopkeeper stood behind the counter, glanced at Yang Kai and Ji Yao, and asked with a grin, "Staying the night?"

"What else would we be here for if not to stay?" Yang Kai snorted.

The shopkeeper chuckled dryly. "Would you like one room or two?"

Yang Kai frowned, glanced at Ji Yao, and said, "One upper room."

He really didn't dare let Ji Yao out of his sight now. Staying together would at least let him keep an eye on her—he had no other intentions.

Ji Yao naturally had no objections. In her mind, sharing a room with her master was only proper.

The shopkeeper gave Yang Kai a knowing look, smiled meaningfully, took out a room token, and respectfully handed it over. "Fifth floor, Room A-3. Please rest assured, guests—our inn has had formation masters set up arrays in every room. Privacy is absolutely guaranteed. No matter what happens inside, nothing will be heard outside."

As he spoke, his expression grew more animated, looking downright lecherous!

"Heh..." Yang Kai forced a smile as he took the room token. "The price?"

"Ten thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals!" the shopkeeper replied with a beaming smile.

Yang Kai waved his hand, tossed ten thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals onto the counter, and led Ji Yao up the stairs.

Reaching the fifth floor, they found Room A-3, used the token to open the restriction, and entered.

The room wasn't especially spacious, but it was fully furnished. A bright red carpet covered the floor, and the bed was draped in gold-threaded bedding, giving a sense of luxury.

For ten thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals, it could indeed be considered money well spent.

After looking around for a while, Yang Kai sat down. Ji Yao skillfully took out a tea set from her Spatial Ring and began brewing tea. Soon, the room was filled with a rich fragrance.

She extinguished the fire, poured the water, and offered a cup to Yang Kai with respect. "Master, please enjoy."

"Mm." Yang Kai took it without ceremony and sipped slowly.

After a long while, he suddenly came to his senses and said, "You should sit down too."

"It's fine for this disciple to stand." Ji Yao gazed at Yang Kai without blinking. For her, watching her master drink the tea she brewed was the happiest thing in the world, and her face was full of a sweet smile.

"Sit when I tell you to sit," Yang Kai said firmly.

"Yes!" Ji Yao couldn't refuse and obediently sat down.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai suddenly said, "Yao'er."

"Disciple is here," Ji Yao replied quickly.

Yang Kai coughed awkwardly into his fist before saying, "If one day... you find that your master has hidden or lied to you about something, I hope you'll understand my good intentions."

"Hidden and lied?" Ji Yao frowned in curiosity. "Does Master have something to hide or lie to Yao'er about?"

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. "I'm just speaking casually. But if that day really comes, don't blame me. But rest assured, I would never do anything to wrong you, nor would I ever hurt you."

It was only a few days’ journey to the Ice Heart Valley now. Once they returned and saw Bing Yun, Yang Kai truly didn’t know how Ji Yao would react. In the best case, she might suddenly come to her senses and realize that he was an impostor all along.

If that happened, Ji Yao would surely remember all the times he'd taken advantage of her with his words during this period.

That would be fine—he'd only done it to keep her stable, and he believed she'd understand. The real problem was that, in Luan Feng's palace, he'd seen her entire body.

Even if it was just a glance, it still concerned Ji Yao's reputation.

Yang Kai wasn't sure if she'd come after him for it...

By saying this now, even if Ji Yao fully recovered later, she would probably forgive him.

"Yao'er trusts Master." Ji Yao said solemnly, "My Senior sisters and I are all orphans. It was Master who took pity on us, taught us, and raised us. Everything I have today is thanks to Master. Even if Master wanted my life, it wouldn't matter."

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, thinking, "I'll be grateful if you don't come after me in the future..."

Still, her words made Yang Kai realize Bing Yun's supreme status in the hearts of her disciples.

"Master..." Ji Yao called softly. "Is there anything troubling you? Do you need Yao'er to help?"

"No, don't overthink it!" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Ji Yao stood up and walked over, a fragrant breeze swirling around her. "Yao'er is useless, so please let me massage your shoulders, Master."

"Hm?" Yang Kai was startled, and before he could react, Ji Yao was already behind him, gently kneading his shoulders.

Yang Kai's whole body stiffened, feeling overwhelmed.

Ever since coming to the Star Realm, he'd kept his desires in check, focusing only on getting stronger. But he was still a man, with his own urges.

Last time, he'd accidentally seen Ji Yao's body and nearly had a nosebleed. Now, alone together in a room, Ji Yao was even giving him a massage.

Not only that, her warm body pressed against his back, and the faint fragrance at his nose made his heart race and his throat go dry.

Ji Yao giggled softly behind him. "Master, your shoulders are so stiff. Have you been working too hard lately?"

Yang Kai thought, How could a man's body compare to Bing Yun's soft, fragrant one? Of course it feels different to the touch.

He wanted to refuse, but worried Ji Yao would overthink it and it would affect her state, so he could only force himself to say, "A little."

Ji Yao smiled. "Just relax, Master. It's been years since I served you—I'm not sure if my skills have gotten rusty."

Hearing this, Yang Kai realized that back in Ice Heart Valley, Ji Yao must have often massaged Bing Yun like this, which was why she was so skilled.

Unable to refuse, Yang Kai could only enjoy it. Gradually, his body and mind relaxed, and as Ji Yao's jade hands worked with varying pressure, he felt as if he were floating on clouds, even humming with pleasure.

Ji Yao blushed at the sounds he made, wondering why her master would make such strange noises, but she was too embarrassed to ask.

After his shoulders, she massaged his arms, then his head, and even his thighs weren't spared.

After all this, Yang Kai felt completely relaxed and praised Ji Yao's skills, making her beam with joy.

Still, seeing Ji Yao kneeling in front of him, massaging his thighs, made Yang Kai feel both excited and awkward.

After enjoying himself, Yang Kai's face turned bitter again, thinking that once Ji Yao fully recovered, he'd have another crime to answer for. He was filled with regret.

The night passed peacefully. Yang Kai and Ji Yao each meditated and rested, one on the bed and one on the floor.

Ji Yao, too, showed no signs of any ill effects, which put Yang Kai’s mind at ease.

By noon the next day, they left the room and went to the front desk to check out.

The shopkeeper saw Yang Kai looking so pleased and couldn't help but envy him. With a meaningful smile, he said, "Did you rest well last night, guest?"

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded, fully aware of the man's dirty thoughts, but couldn't be bothered to say more.

"Since you enjoyed your stay, please be sure to visit our inn again next time you're in Taiping City." The shopkeeper bowed and sent Yang Kai and Ji Yao out.
