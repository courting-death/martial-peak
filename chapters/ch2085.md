## Chapter 2085 — Extraordinary

Yang Kai laughed and said nothing further; he turned to the old swindler, flashed to his side, gave him a kick and said, "Don't play dead, get up quickly."

"My lord, I've been beaten so badly, please uphold justice and punish the culprit!" the old swindler lay on the ground and looked at Yang Kai with pitiful eyes, blowing his nose and crying as he complained, "If you cannot teach them a lesson, I won't get up."

"Then lie there and talk."

The old swindler was instantly left speechless.

Yang Kai crouched down, his deep gaze fixed on him, and in a low voice asked, "I ask you, how did you get in from outside?"

Qin Chaoyang also stepped forward, smiling as he looked at the old swindler and chuckled, "I, Qin, am curious as well."

Under the intense scrutiny of the two Dao Origin Realm experts, the old swindler shivered and hurriedly said, "Sirs, you must be misunderstanding; I came to Fenglin City to seek aid."

"Seek aid?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, while Qin Chaoyang showed a pensive expression.

"I came from Musen City," the old swindler said.

Yang Kai could not help but frown.

Qin Chaoyang remarked, "Musen City is thirty thousand li from Fenglin City; it is smaller than Fenglin City and its martial standards are lower," then his expression suddenly changed and he sharply asked, "Could it be that Musen City has already..."

"Musen City is in crisis, sirs!" the old swindler cried out anxiously, then looked around and sighed, "It seems Fenglin City cannot be guaranteed safety either—what are we to do?"

"What is Musen City's situation now?" Qin Chaoyang demanded with a grim face.

"Very bad. Although, like Fenglin City, it is besieged by Demonic Qi and demonic beasts, you know what Musen City is like; it probably cannot hold out long, and... there is also a demon there who seems to have already reached the Dao Origin Realm!" the old swindler exclaimed.

"Jiang Taisheng!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

"The Jiang Family's patriarch?" Qin Chaoyang's face changed drastically.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "No wonder I haven't seen Jiang Taisheng's trace. When I was outside I was on guard against him, fearing he might suddenly appear to ambush me, but I did not see him. It turns out he was not in Fenglin City but went to Musen City. If that's so, does he intend to use that Demonic Qi to convert more people into demons?"

"That is possible, and very likely!" Qin Chaoyang's face also went ashen. "Musen City may be small, but it has over a hundred thousand people; if all were converted into demons..."

At those words, a chilling image flashed through his mind, and he couldn't help but shiver.

“Apart from coming to Fenglin City to seek assistance, did you go anywhere else?” Yang Kai asked.

The old swindler nodded. "There were, of course, other places, but Fenglin City was the closest and I'm very familiar with it. So I volunteered to come—who knew I'd almost fail to get through."

"You do have some skill!" Yang Kai said, looking at him with a meaningful gaze.

The old swindler gave an awkward smile. "Just luck, just luck. If it were not for you attracting a large number of demonic beasts, I could not have safely entered the city."

Yang Kai smiled, inclined his head slightly, and then barked, "Take this old swindler away and keep an eye on him—do not let him escape!"

As he spoke, he suddenly reached out and touched the old swindler; Law Power flowed and was injected into the man's body, sealing his cultivation.

The old swindler was stunned into a wooden stare.

Qin Chaoyang had not expected Yang Kai to change his expression so suddenly and was momentarily dumbfounded.

Qin Yu's beautiful eyes shone; she too stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, not knowing what he was up to.

"My lord, you..." the old swindler widened his eyes and looked at Yang Kai with a face full of grievance.

"Take him away!" Yang Kai shouted again when he saw the surrounding warriors standing idle.

Only then did two guards from the City Lord's mansion step forward, each taking one side of the old swindler and hurrying toward the lord's mansion, clearly intending to lock him in the dungeon.

"My lord, it's a misunderstanding! I'm only here to seek help, I'm one of your own, you can't do this to me!" the old swindler wailed as he was carried off, his cries growing more distant.

"Young Brother Yang, you wouldn't imprison him just because he often swindles, would you? Is there some deeper meaning?" Qin Chaoyang asked, looking at Yang Kai thoughtfully.

Qin Yu also surveyed him with curiosity.

"Of course not," Yang Kai shook his head. "But this man, with a cultivation at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, could pass unscathed through the Demonic Qi blockade—he must be hiding some secret, and I'm very curious."

"So you want to get that secret out of him?" Qin Chaoyang's eyes brightened.

Fenglin City was hardly short of Void King Realm fighters; if they could all move freely through the Demonic Qi like that old swindler, there would be no need to fear the present crisis—everyone could break out and slaughter the demonic beasts.

"That old rascal looks crafty; extracting his secret will not be simple. Moreover, even if he reveals it, not everyone might be able to use it... anyway, do what you can," Yang Kai said calmly.

Qin Chaoyang nodded in agreement and then pointed to the man whose cultivation had been suppressed and who was still roaring, Jiang Chuhe, asking, "What do you think should be done with him?"

Yang Kai glanced at Jiang Chuhe and said, "I originally intended to take him alive to learn about the outside situation from his mouth, but looking at him now..."

He could not help but smile bitterly.

Jiang Chuhe now showed no sign of sanity and could not provide any useful clues; only someone willing to risk retaliation could try to use secret arts like soul-searching to probe him.

But to perform such secret arts one must possess a cultivation far beyond Jiang Chuhe's, otherwise his brutal consciousness would very likely lash back.

Across all of Fenglin City, the highest cultivation reached only the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, which was simply insufficient for that task.

Yang Kai's own Divine Sense was comparable to an expert of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but he had never studied the Soul-Searching Technique; if he forced it, he might not extract anything useful.

"If that's so, perhaps I can help," Qin Yu suddenly spoke up.

"You?" Yang Kai looked at Qin Yu in astonishment, almost thinking he had misheard, because by all appearances Qin Yu's cultivation was clearly the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

"Do not be reckless!" Qin Chaoyang warned, his face turning pale.

Qin Yu smiled faintly. "Patriarch, I'm not being reckless. With my cultivation alone I cannot perform the secret art on this demon, but if we use an array and combine the efforts of Patriarch and Lord Yang, we can give it a try."

Yang Kai's heart stirred; he stared at Qin Yu and said, "When I first saw the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, I felt Miss Qin was no ordinary person, and now it seems I was right."

"Lord Yang flatters me," Qin Yu smiled gently. "I am weak and frail and do not deserve such praise, but Lord, you rose to the Dao Origin Realm at a young age—your future is boundless, and I admire you greatly."

"Sir Qin," Yang Kai turned to Qin Chaoyang and asked, "are all your daughters so eloquent?"

Qin Chaoyang laughed. "If Young Brother is interested, come to my Qin Family and take a few home—there are many unmarried girls in my Qin Family; I'm sure one will catch your eye."

Yang Kai scowled. "Sir Qin, you really know how to joke."

Qin Chaoyang replied with a laugh, "I'm not joking."

Yang Kai cleared his throat and changed the subject, looking at Qin Yu: "Miss Qin, you must know your cultivation is far lower than Brother Chuhe's. If you are not confident, don't take such risks lightly; it would be bad if something happened."

"Thank you for your concern, Lord Yang. I know my limits; I will act with restraint," Qin Yu nodded lightly, wearing a calm expression. "I do have some confidence."

"That's good," Yang Kai nodded and ceased his admonition.

No one would gamble with their life; since Qin Yu said that, she must be relying on something.

"What is your opinion, Sir Qin?" Yang Kai turned to Qin Chaoyang.

Qin Chaoyang's expression grew solemn. After pondering for a long moment he looked at Qin Yu and said, "You really need not do this; this crisis concerns the whole of Fenglin City. At worst we could have the City Lord risk performing the Soul-Searching Technique."

Qin Yu replied, "The City Lord bears the responsibility for the city's safety; if something goes wrong then all of Fenglin City would be finished. I am different—if something happens to me it won't change the overall situation! Patriarch, all my Qin Family are inside the city; if the city falls, my Qin Family will perish. I want to do something!"

Qin Chaoyang was at a loss for words and did not know how to dissuade her.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly; he looked at Qin Yu with some surprise—he had not expected such a young girl to be so concerned for the bigger picture.

"But before that, I have one question I wish to ask Lord Yang," Qin Yu suddenly smiled and turned to Yang Kai.

"What is it?"

Qin Yu's lips quivered but she produced no sound.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, fell silent for a moment, and then nodded lightly.

A look of joy crossed Qin Yu's face and she clapped her hands, "In that case I have about an eighty percent chance, and I only need Lord Yang's assistance alone—Patriarch can remain here to continue defending."

"You don't need me?" Qin Chaoyang asked in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled, "Lord Yang is extraordinary."

Qin Chaoyang sighed and said, "If that's the case, then I have nothing more to say; however, since this concerns all of Fenglin City, I must notify the City Lord. Also… the situation in Musen City must be reported to Duan Yuanshan. Please wait a moment."

With that he took out the Transmission Compass, poured his Divine Sense into it, and relayed the matters of Musen City and Jiang Chuhe to the Dao Origin Realm experts inside the city, prioritizing notice to Duan Yuanshan.
