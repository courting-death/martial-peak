## Chapter 1684 — My Patience Is Limited

The onlookers, many of them powerful themselves, nearly leapt to their feet in shock. Before their eyes, Yang Kai’s punch shattered Tang Fushui’s entire head—blasting it apart completely.

They could even clearly see the whole process of Tang Fushui's head being crushed, as if the scene had been slowed down a thousand times, the image engraved in their minds.

Everyone fell silent like the cold had gripped them, and the looks they gave Yang Kai changed in flavor.

Those Origin Returning Realm experts who had originally looked down on Yang Kai were now filled entirely with dread.

They knew better than anyone what level of cultivation Tang Fushui possessed; among the Origin Returning Realm experts present, Tang Fushui certainly ranked among the top three.

And yet such a powerhouse was blown apart by a single punch from Yang Kai, dead beyond revival — and throughout the whole process Yang Kai had shown no sign of using Saint Yuan; it seemed he had achieved that feat by sheer flesh and a single fist.

No one would be so foolish as to think Tang Fushui had underestimated his opponent or made some other mistake leading to this end. As the Hall Master of Piaomiao Hall, Tang Fushui was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had fought countless battles in his life and possessed abundant experience; how could he have been careless?

And judging from the way he struck, he had been giving it his all.

Yet he was still killed in a single blow.

This meant Yang Kai's strength had already far surpassed Tang Fushui's, which was why he could not even withstand a single strike.

Tang Fushui was Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — could Yang Kai possibly be at the Void King Realm?

At that thought, a rush of cold air seemed to fill everyone's lungs; audible gasps followed.

"Kill every one of Piaomiao Hall's people for me!" Yang Kai would not relent, shouting angrily.

Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao had all been holding back their fury, but since Yang Kai had not spoken they could only watch and wait; the moment they heard his order they let out a long howl together and each unleashed their Saint Yuan and Domain Field, charging toward a dozen or so people.

Those dozen or so had come with Tang Fushui and wore Piaomiao Hall's attire, easy to recognize.

It was clear Yang Kai intended to leave none alive.

Like a tiger descending the mountain or wolves entering a flock of sheep, Yang Xiuzhu and the others charged into Piaomiao Hall's ranks; amid cries of pleading and resistance, in less than ten breaths those ten-odd Piaomiao Hall Origin Returning Realm practitioners were utterly annihilated, offering no proper resistance.

Strictly speaking, this Piaomiao Hall faction was not weak: apart from the dead Tang Fushui, there was another cultivator of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm stationed there, with three at the Second Stage and seven or eight at the First.

But they had long been cowed by Yang Kai's terrifying methods, and Yang Xiuzhu and the others were top survivors who had emerged from the Blood Prison; how could they withstand the trio's fierce assault?

Ten breaths later, the square was littered with corpses and the stench of blood rose into the sky.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others returned to Yang Kai's side without a word and stood there quietly.

The whole place was hushed; everyone could hear their own heart pounding in their chests as they stared at Yang Kai and Yang Xiuzhu and the others as if looking at a pack of merciless devils, faces full of horror and dread.

"Y‑you… how could you be so ruthless!" Feng Yan's small frame trembled as she pointed at Yang Kai in disbelief. "These were the Dark Star's last high-tier fighting forces — you killed them, who will fight the Corpse Spirit Sect's army? Are you trying to annihilate the Dark Star people?"

Hearing her naive words, Yang Kai sneered coldly: "Is that so? If their combat strength is truly so advanced, why haven't they gone out to fight? Why are they hiding inside my Lingxiao Sect instead?"

Feng Yan was momentarily at a loss for words, about to say more when Old Woman Feng suddenly shot her a glare.

Only then did Feng Yan come to her senses; she had no idea what had possessed her to blame Yang Kai's actions. Old Woman Feng's look sobered her, a cold sweat breaking out on her delicate body and her clothes dampening.

"My patience is limited!" Yang Kai reiterated.

Faces shifted and everyone stared at Yang Kai in terror, yet no one answered.

Earlier they had relied on their numbers and not taken Yang Kai seriously, thinking he could not possibly lose his temper and turn on them on the spot — that at worst they'd sit down and talk. But after witnessing Yang Kai's savagery and terrifying power they realized their mistake.

This young Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect had no need to negotiate with them; he alone could slaughter everyone present.

Before absolute force, all schemes and plans dissolved like bubbles.

After a long silence, Old Woman Feng finally let out a heavy sigh and said, “Each generation brings forth new talent—we yield, Sect Master Yang. Mark out a path and we'll step forth!"

Yang Kai snorted coldly: "I only want to know what on earth is going on in my Lingxiao Sect!"

Old Woman Feng glanced around; every pair of eyes that met hers quickly looked away, clearly unwilling to be the one to converse with Yang Kai. Her face fell and, with a forlorn tone, she said, "Sect Master Yang, it's a long story, but we had no choice."

"So you still want to test my patience!" Yang Kai smiled wickedly, and the signs of Saint Yuan beginning to circulate appeared about him.

Old Woman Feng's expression changed drastically; she hastily stepped back and assumed a defensive posture.

"I'll tell you what happened to Lingxiao Sect."

Just then a resonant voice came from not far away; Yang Kai found it familiar and turned to see a black‑faced old man striding over.

Beside the old man walked a middle‑aged man of about forty, following in step; as he arrived at the square and saw the corpses he let out a startled exclamation.

Yan Pei and his disciple from Jubao Tower!

Yang Kai had dealings before with the auctioneer known as the old black‑faced man and knew his relation with Qian Tong was good, so though still angry he restrained himself and nodded: "So it's Elder Yan."

"Sect Master Yang, you're too polite; Yan has come to tell you what happened here." Yan Pei the old black‑faced man bowed and candidly began to relay everything he knew; Yang Kai listened solemnly.

Two years ago the Corpse Spirit Sect burst onto the scene, and its power rolled like a snowball, growing ever larger!

Many sects and clans were exterminated root and branch, and the well‑known sects became prime targets of the Corpse Spirit Sect.

Against such overwhelming force and numbers, virtually no faction on the Dark Star could stand.

Yingyue Hall, Piaomiao Hall, Liuli Sect, Qiantian Sect, Myriad Beasts Mountain, Medicine Pill Sect… one after another were wiped out, with countless dead and wounded.

Lingxiao Sect, due to its special geographic position, was largely beyond the Corpse Spirit Sect's reach.

While Yang Kai was away, Ye Xijun had been in charge of Lingxiao Sect and did not ignore the affairs on the Dark Star; out of duty she frequently dispatched the sect's experts to aid those sects.

Ye Xijun personally went into action herself.

Although Lingxiao Sect's strength was not weak, against the behemoth that was the Corpse Spirit Sect those supports were merely a drop in the bucket; not only did they greatly deplete their own strength, they failed to reverse the situation.

In the end they had no choice but to open Lingxiao Sect's doors and accept the fleeing cultivators.

The thousands Yang Kai had sensed came to Lingxiao Sect for that reason.

Entering Lingxiao Sect felt like being transported from hell to paradise; the contrast made nearly everyone ecstatic.

Outside they had to fear the Corpse Spirit Sect's pursuit at every moment, unable to heal in peace and constantly on guard; inside Lingxiao Sect, guarded by the Three Flames Ring, they no longer had to worry; they could live comfortably and safely, unaffected at all even if the world outside crumbled.

Moreover, the Spiritual Qi within Lingxiao Sect was the densest on the entire Dark Star; even Star Emperor Mountain could not match Lingxiao Sect's weakest peak.

They had fallen deeply in love with the place.

Before, no one knew what the Flowing Flame Sand Field was like inside. But after Ye Xijun took them in, they realized—it was a land of abundance, overflowing with riches!

Who would not covet such a treasure?

Warriors from every sect envied and resented Lingxiao Sect.

That alone might have been tolerable; they were not foolish enough to turn on Lingxiao Sect immediately after being accepted.

But when Ye Xijun later expected them to accompany her on missions to rescue other factions, things changed.

Having barely scraped by to reach here and reclaimed their lives, who would willingly go back out to live in constant fear?

So no sect cooperated.

They feared that offending Ye Xijun might lead to being expelled and so they dared not antagonize her.

In the end, after much plotting, they struck first and caused a commotion inside Lingxiao Sect.

Lingxiao Sect had become fairly strong since taking in the Star Emperor Mountain's experts, but over the past two years many masters had fallen in battle and the survivors returned wounded and weakened — they could not match the combined high‑tier forces of the Dark Star's great sects.

Ye Xijun and her people had to fight a retreat, gradually falling deeper into the heart of Flowing Flame Sandland.

This had taken place only two months ago.

After Ye Xijun and the others withdrew, these newcomers naturally took over the Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters.

Although they feared Ye Xijun would recover and retaliate, they feared the Corpse Spirit Sect massing outside Flowing Flame Sandland even more.

Staying here at least gave them a chance to survive; leaving Lingxiao Sect meant certain death.

So despite misgivings they each occupied favorable positions and settled into Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters.

"That's the situation," Yan Pei finished and fell silent.

His apprentice, Ren Tianrui — the little black‑faced one — opened his mouth to protest: "Jubao Tower had no part in this matter, and there were other forces that didn't participate either!"

Yang Kai glanced at him and sneered: "Even if you didn't participate, you didn't stop it, did you?"

Ren Tianrui's face went pale as he stammered: "We informed Great Elder Ye!"

"Should this Sect Master be grateful to you then?" Yang Kai looked at him coldly.
