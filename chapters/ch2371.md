## Chapter 2371 — The Giant Shadow Appears Again

As Yang Kai flew toward the small island, his mind was already immersed in the jade slip Ling Yinqin had given him, studying the method to set up the Purification Array.

Although he had little experience with the Dao of Formations, the jade slip’s instructions were extremely detailed and easy to understand. With the Formation Foundation and array flags, setting it up shouldn’t be difficult at all.

A mere five hundred li lay between them, yet Yang Kai arrived in just over a dozen breaths—only because he had deliberately slowed down to study the jade slip along the way. Otherwise, were he to fully employ the spatial divine arts at his command, he could have made the journey in three breaths’ time.

Looking ahead, it was indeed a true small island, about a hundred zhang in circumference, utterly barren, looking more like a reef. The sky was clear, not a cloud for ten thousand li, and the sea was calm and peaceful.

Yang Kai hurriedly landed and began arranging the array as described in the jade slip.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he finally finished setting everything up. A faint light suddenly enveloped the entire island, purifying all the transforming force from the world around them. However, the Spiritual Qi was also diminished somewhat as a result.

It seemed even a high-grade Purification Array couldn’t let all the Spiritual Qi flow in. By this logic, even the top-grade Purification Array probably wouldn’t be much better.

Time was tight, so he only checked the array briefly. After confirming it was fine, he waved his hand and released Zhang Ruoxi from the Small Xuan Realm.

“Sir, I’ve troubled you again.” Zhang Ruoxi’s face was strained, her aura boiling like boiling water, and as soon as she appeared, she looked at Yang Kai with guilt.

She clearly knew what situation Yang Kai was in now.

Yang Kai waved his hand and said, “Don’t overthink it. Calm your mind. Breaking through is what matters. I’ll guard you here and keep all distractions away!”

Zhang Ruoxi gently nodded, closed her beautiful eyes, formed seals with her hands, and began to comprehend in silence.

In just a short while, the aura surging from her body grew fiercer, and the flow of Saint Yuan within her became more and more intense.

The surrounding Spiritual Qi seemed to be given life, rushing into her body one after another.

But because of the Purification Array’s obstruction, the Spiritual Qi was clearly insufficient for her breakthrough, leaving Zhang Ruoxi in a dilemma.

Seeing this, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate to take out handfuls of Source Crystals from his Spatial Ring. With a burst of power, he shattered them into powder, turning them into dense Spiritual Qi that filled the island.

With the help of these Source Crystals, the strain on Zhang Ruoxi’s face eased considerably.

Yang Kai kept taking out Source Crystals and shattering them. In just a short while, the Spiritual Qi on the island became so dense it turned into mist, shrouding the whole island. Even though Yang Kai was ten zhang away from Zhang Ruoxi, he couldn’t see her figure clearly.

Feeling it should be enough, Yang Kai finally stopped.

Ever since Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline awakened, she seemed like a different person. Her talent was indescribably good, and every cultivation session was like devouring Spiritual Qi itself. Because of this, her cultivation improved so quickly.

Back then, the Zhang Family’s Family Head, Zhang Gaoxuan, obtained a Dao Origin Fruit in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, but was ambushed and gravely injured. Before dying, he used the Dao Origin Fruit as a price to have Yang Kai visit the Zhang Family and ensure a Dao Origin Pill would be left for their descendants.

Yang Kai went, but at that time, Zhang Ruoxi was only at the Saint King Realm. In just a few years, she had reached the point of breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm.

Yang Kai still had the Dao Origin Pill he’d prepared for Zhang Ruoxi, but looking at her now, it was clear she didn’t need it at all. In just a few short years, the once shy little girl had blossomed into a graceful young woman.

For a moment, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a surge of emotion.

The sound of rushing air continued as Zhang Ruoxi seemed to become a bottomless pit, constantly devouring the Spiritual Qi on the island. In just a short while, the dense Spiritual Qi thinned out again.

Yang Kai had no choice but to take out more Source Crystals and shatter them.

After doing this three times, Yang Kai estimated he had used at least ten million Source Crystals before Zhang Ruoxi suddenly let out a soft hum. Immediately, an indescribable Dao resonance rippled out.

She’s about to break through! Seeing this, Yang Kai didn’t dare linger. He darted off the island to a suitable distance, closely watching Zhang Ruoxi’s movements. This way, he wouldn’t disturb her breakthrough, but could still help if anything went wrong.

At this stage, Zhang Ruoxi’s breakthrough was going smoothly, thanks to the millions of Source Crystals he’d provided. But Yang Kai knew—the real challenge hadn’t come yet!

For Zhang Ruoxi, the hardest part now was the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy! The Spiritual Qi here was filled with endless transforming force. If she absorbed it, who knew what would happen.

But if she didn’t absorb it, she couldn’t break through. It was a true dilemma.

Rumble rumble…

A buzzing sound came from the sky. The once clear sky suddenly changed, turning pitch black. Above the island, a massive black cloud formed, slowly spinning into a vortex. Within the cloud, lightning flashed and thunder roared, displaying the might of the Heavenly Dao.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but tense up, raising his head to look at the sky.

Meanwhile, five hundred li away, a group of martial artists stood on the deck of a multi-deck ship, pointing toward the island. They thought the phenomenon was caused by Yang Kai, not knowing there was someone else involved.

In Ling Yinqin’s room, she leaned by the window, a trace of surprise flashing in her eyes as she muttered, “He actually triggered a Heaven-and-Earth phenomenon?”

Triggering such a phenomenon meant the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy was coming, and there was truly a sliver of hope for a successful breakthrough.

Ling Yinqin suddenly felt she had underestimated Yang Kai. Earlier, she’d said his chances of breaking through were low, but now it seemed he was more capable than she thought.

What puzzled Ling Yinqin was that the power of this phenomenon seemed off. She could clearly feel it was weaker than expected. Although she’d never seen a breakthrough to the Emperor Realm before, it obviously shouldn’t be this mild.

In another cabin, Liu Qianyun also gazed out the window, her face full of worry and tension. She didn’t dare go watch, so she could only clasp her hands, kneel, and sincerely pray for Heaven’s blessing.

Meanwhile, ten thousand li away, another multi-deck ship sailed slowly across the sea. Even from so far, the phenomenon caught the attention of those on board.

A moment later, the ship suddenly changed course, heading toward the island, clearly intending to investigate.

……

Above the island, the dark clouds were as heavy as mountains, thunder rumbling nonstop.

Suddenly, a surge of Heaven’s might descended from the sky, striking straight toward the island, seemingly about to fall right on Zhang Ruoxi’s head.

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly, but he forcibly resisted the urge to help.

Boom…

A loud crash rang out as the massive Heaven’s might struck the island. The Purification Array Yang Kai had set up instantly collapsed; the Formation Foundations and Array Flags hidden around were all damaged, and the light covering the island vanished at once.

The high-grade Purification Array was destroyed just like that!

Before the Heaven’s might could fall on Zhang Ruoxi, her delicate body trembled, and a giant phantom suddenly appeared behind her.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened as he stared intently.

It wasn’t the first time he’d seen this phantom. Back in the Four Seasons Land, when Zhang Ruoxi broke through to a higher realm, it had appeared before. Yang Kai had never figured out what it was, only guessing it was closely related to Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline.

Now, the phantom was even more solid than last time. What puzzled Yang Kai was that he couldn’t see it clearly—he only knew it was a giant female figure, twenty or thirty zhang tall, even larger than Xiaoxiao after transforming. She stood with a giant sword, her head nearly touching the sky and her feet planted on the ground, giving an overwhelming visual impact.

Though enormous, the woman was certainly not ugly. She was like a peerless beauty magnified countless times, every part of her body flawless and perfect.

She seemed like Zhang Ruoxi’s guardian deity, suddenly appearing behind her, heroic and imposing, as if she could block a thousand troops alone.

The Heaven’s might struck, entering her body like a stone sinking into the sea, not causing the slightest ripple.

The next moment, the phantom raised her head, gazed at the sky, opened her mouth, and gently inhaled.

The power gathered in the sky was sucked into her mouth. In just three breaths, the dark sky cleared again, and the sea returned to calm.

Even though he’d seen it once before, Yang Kai was still deeply shocked, speechless for a long time.

For martial artists breaking through to a higher realm, the Baptism of Heaven’s might was common knowledge. No one could avoid it. If you could endure it, you could glimpse the next realm’s mysteries. If not, you’d either die or be crippled.

Yang Kai had gone through it like this for years.

But compared to Zhang Ruoxi’s breakthrough, Yang Kai felt his own were utterly lacking, not even on the same level.

As he was lost in thought, the giant phantom suddenly flashed into Zhang Ruoxi’s body. The next moment, the aura of the Dao Origin Realm spread from her, her bones crackling, her power surging fiercely within.

Yang Kai grew anxious, unsure if the phantom swallowing the Heaven’s might on its own would cause problems. After all, the Spiritual Qi of this world was filled with endless transforming force, and as the phantom devoured the Heaven’s might, it surely swallowed that as well.

He watched Zhang Ruoxi closely, deciding to bring her into the Small Xuan Realm at the first sign of trouble.

But no matter how he looked, Zhang Ruoxi showed no discomfort. Instead, she looked delighted, clearly happy with her breakthrough, still sitting there forming seals. This left Yang Kai completely baffled.
