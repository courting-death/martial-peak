## Chapter 903 — Spirit Body

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox brightened at the words and could not help but show a pleased look: "So the entrance must be nearby?"

"Should be." Yang Kai nodded.

They all looked around but couldn't find any trace of the faintly glowing entrance they'd encountered before; while they were puzzled, Yang Kai waved his hand again. "This way!"

Saying so, he changed direction and headed that way.

"Lei Long, this kid seems unperturbed—has he been here before?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox sidled over and asked quietly.

"Don't know." Lei Long, the Great Lord, shook his head slowly. "In any case, let's follow him. I thought he'd only hold us back this time, but I didn't expect we'd need to rely on his strength now—quite interesting..."

"Maybe he's just a lucky cat stumbling on a dead mouse?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox mused.

Lei Long glanced at him and fell silent, then hurried to keep pace with Yang Kai.

He'd noticed that although the ground smoothed where Yang Kai passed, that stability would collapse soon after he moved on; if they didn't follow, they'd constantly have to expend power to resist the surrounding pressure.

Feeling the turbulent currents beneath their feet breaking apart, none of them dared to relax.

After about the time it took an incense stick to burn, a faint glimmer suddenly appeared ahead, entering their sight.

"It's the entrance!" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shouted, brazenly passing Yang Kai and rushing toward it, disappearing in an instant.

After him, Lei Long the Great Lord and Caidie each used their methods to quickly pass through the entrance.

Yang Kai remained unhurried and, together with Li Rong, walked over; when they neared, he sent his Divine Sense in to probe, and only after confirming there was no danger did they enter.

In the blink of an eye, when his vision cleared they found themselves in a strange space.

There were no sun, moon, or stars above—only chaos and emptiness, a thick dark cloud pressing overhead, and at times energies like spirit-serpents weaving through it.

The structure matched that of a standard Small Xuan Realm.

But Yang Kai frowned; he felt a subtle difference between this place and other Small Xuan Realms he'd seen.

The four yao who had gone in first waited; only after confirming Yang Kai and Li Rong had arrived safely did they withdraw their attention.

Standing in that Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai glanced around and frowned more deeply.

He found the place utterly barren—no grass grew, no sign of life; the entire Small Xuan Realm seemed desolate.

Looking ahead a li or so, everything was shrouded in gray and he couldn't see far; his Divine Sense was bound by some invisible force and couldn't probe inside.

"Be cautious, this place is strange. When Old Ox and I reached here before, we explored less than ten li and were forced back," Lei Long the Great Lord warned gravely.

Yang Kai nodded earnestly; he didn't need reminding—he wouldn't act rashly in such a bizarre place.

"This is where the demon script is carved," Lei Long said, pointing ahead with a trace of apprehension on his face. "But I advise you only to glance at it—don't stare. Otherwise you might die!"

Yang Kai looked in the indicated direction and indeed saw a stone pillar standing not far off. It had clearly been here for years; weathered and pitted, its surface was uneven.

The pillar was made of ordinary stone, commonplace material.

Yet the demon script carved upon it exuded a murderous intent.

When Yang Kai looked at those characters he distinctly felt a cold, cutting killing intent, sending a chill through his heart.

The demon script's strokes were bold and forceful—clearly the handiwork of someone with great power.

But the faint aura it gave off made Yang Kai involuntarily mutter in surprise and linger a moment longer.

In merely three breaths, the strokes on the script seemed to come alive, transforming into sharp attacks that shot out from the pillar and rapidly enlarged in Yang Kai's pupils.

"You brat, courting death!" Lei Long's face changed; he snagged Yang Kai and threw himself in front of him as his massive Divine Sense erupted with a series of muffled bangs in midair. Only after stepping back to steady himself did the Great Lord look intensely grave.

"Didn't I tell you not to stare?" Lei Long scolded him harshly.

Yang Kai, knowing he was at fault, said nothing and gave a sheepish chuckle; he exchanged a look with Li Rong and saw the same surprise and doubt in her eyes.

Although the demon script had been carved here for countless years, a faint lingering aura unmistakably belonged to the Great Demon God.

Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox didn't recognize it, but Yang Kai and Li Rong would not be mistaken.

Moreover, just a few ancient characters left behind for countless years could make two Great Yao Lords behave so cautiously—aside from the Great Demon God, no one else could command that kind of power.

Those characters were certainly the Great Demon God's handiwork, Yang Kai realized in an instant.

To see the Great Demon God's true writing in his lifetime surprised Yang Kai; but why had the Great Demon God come here, and why leave such characters?

Yang Kai suddenly felt this trip had been the right decision.

There might even be unexpected gains.

Li Rong wore an eager expression as well; she clearly cared about the place's mysteries.

"Don't look any longer," Lei Long warned sternly. Seeing Yang Kai acting obedient, thinking he'd learned his lesson, he added gravely, "The killing intent in those characters is not to be underestimated—even Old Ox and I dare not take it lightly. You're only a Third Stage Transcendent—if you linger another breath you'll instantly die!"

"Mm, I know," Yang Kai hastily nodded.

"I don't know who left those characters, but such means are terrifying," the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox said with deep feeling.

"Though I don't know who he was, it must be a powerful figure of the demon race, and very likely the legendary Great Demon God," Lei Long guessed with a furrowed brow.

His speculation was spot on.

"Let's move forward and see what secrets lie ahead," Lei Long waved and volunteered to lead.

The last time he and Old Ox had breached this place, after passing the pillar they walked less than ten li before encountering danger and prudently retreated.

Thinking of the demon expert beside Yang Kai, Lei Long sent Caidie to fetch her.

Another Saint-Realm expert might not help avoid all dangers, but if they ran into any demon script Li Rong could help interpret it in time.

On the way, Lei Long recounted the situation he and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox had encountered and casually asked, "Kid, what do you make of this place?"

"I don't know anything," Yang Kai shrugged.

"If you know something, speak up—don't hide it." Lei Long seemed intrigued by Yang Kai's odd behavior in the void fissure before and paid attention to his thoughts.

He secretly suspected the kid might have been here before.

But Lei Long's suspicion was wrong; Yang Kai only knew the void turbulence well enough to find the correct path through the fissure—he truly knew nothing about this strange Small Xuan Realm.

"If I knew anything I'd surely tell you," Yang Kai said earnestly.

After advancing about ten li, Lei Long suddenly paused and pointed ahead, "This is where Old Ox and I retreated last time."

"The place just looks weirder the more you look at it—no idea what energies are hidden inside," the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox muttered, shaking his head.

Yang Kai's expression changed when he gazed ahead.

The road ahead seemed to break off abruptly; the six of them stood at the edge of a cliff.

Below the cliff spread a strange jade-green sea filled with an inexplicable, viscous power; intermittent cries and howls came from beneath, bloody and sinister, chilling one's heart.

Looking down from the cliff, they could clearly see twisted, hideous human faces bobbing and sinking in the jade-green viscous sea, struggling and writhing but unable to break free from its pull.

Bubbles churned up from below, rising and bursting above with dull thuds.

Caidie and Li Rong both turned a bit pale.

Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox also wore grave expressions, their strength quietly gathering as they braced against the tide of unwillingness, shame, and bitter resentment surging from the emerald sea.

Those disturbing grievances were all emitted by the faces, continuously forming an invisible assault upon the six of them.

"A reminder—don't use Divine Sense to probe below," Lei Long said solemnly. "If I'm not mistaken, those faces bobbing below are all Spirit Bodies."

"Spirit Bodies?" Yang Kai's face altered drastically.

"Yes!" Lei Long nodded heavily. "Each face is the Spirit Body of a strong expert, somehow exiled here. Last time I carelessly sent my Divine Sense to probe and nearly was dragged in by them."

Speaking of that visit left Lei Long still shaken: "Many of them in life were experts who rivaled me; Spirit Bodies are terrifyingly powerful. Though their physical bodies may have been destroyed elsewhere, their Spirit Bodies are imprisoned here. Once you are infected by them, there's no escape—you will end up as one of them."

"You say many of them in life rivaled you?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"Many!"

"Where could so many experts come from? Today, the number of cultivators who reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm should be no more than fifty, right? That's the situation in every age."

Yet in that jade-green sea there floated uncountable thousands of faces; even if only a small portion had been as strong as Lei Long in life, it was still a staggering number.

Yang Kai knew of no era when martial strength was so abundant.

He could also sense the formidable nature of those Spirit Bodies below.

"I don't know either—maybe in some ancient time long ago, the continent had countless experts," Lei Long shrugged, unable to explain further.
