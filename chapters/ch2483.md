## Chapter 2482 — The Struggle of the Emperors’ Daughters

The Beast Great Emperor was one of the current Ten Great Emperors, commanding all beasts, his strength extraordinary, his means unfathomable.

However, because he kept a low profile throughout his life, few knew of his deeds. Unlike the Radiant Moon Great Emperor or Great Emperor Youhun, he never established a Sect, choosing instead to live in seclusion on Spirit Beast Island.

Mo Xiaoqi was the Beast Great Emperor’s daughter, her status anything but ordinary. Who would dare make a move against her here? If anything were to happen to her, who could bear the consequences?

Even someone like Feng Xuan could perform Soul Descent on his own son. If Mo Xiaoqi’s life were ever in danger and the Beast Great Emperor also used Soul Descent, who here could withstand his wrath?

Seeing Mo Xiaoqi in the midst of a fight, Yang Kai grew anxious and asked with a bitter face, “Why aren’t you going up to help?”

Liu Yan replied calmly, “We can’t intervene.”

Yang Kai was stunned. Only then did he see clearly who was fighting with Mo Xiaoqi.

The one locked in fierce battle with Mo Xiaoqi, exchanging blows in a seemingly even match, was also a young woman—radiant, her dress fluttering, incomparably beautiful.

Yang Kai recognized this woman as well.

She was none other than Princess Lan Xun of the Southern Territory’s Star God Palace, daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor!

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Both of these young women had extremely sensitive identities, and both were daughters of Great Emperors. Only they would dare to fight each other like this.

“Why are they fighting?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

“No idea. They just looked at each other and suddenly started fighting,” Liu Yan replied.

“There’s actually something like that!” Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat.

But judging by this, the two girls must know each other and are aware of each other’s identities. Maybe it’s just youthful competitiveness between girls of similar backgrounds, making them want to test themselves against each other.

Still, even if they want to compete, shouldn’t they consider the time and place? This is the Shattered Star Sea, not a place for reckless fighting.

After a few years apart, both Mo Xiaoqi and Lan Xun had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. As daughters of Great Emperors, their talent was clearly extraordinary, allowing them to achieve so much in such a short time. Yang Kai knew Lan Xun had inherited the Radiant Moon Great Emperor’s Moon Illusion Body, while Mo Xiaoqi, though lacking a special constitution, was born able to command all kinds of Demonic Beasts to fight for her. As the Beast Great Emperor’s daughter, she had learned the most profound and mysterious secret techniques since childhood.

At this moment, the two girls were fighting fiercely above. Compared to Lan Xun’s elegance and composure, Mo Xiaoqi appeared much wilder. No one knew what secret technique she was using, but she moved as nimbly as a leopard, with faint beast-like markings appearing on her face. The aura she emitted was wild and untamed.

Neither of them showed any intention of using Secret Treasures, relying solely on their own skills to compete.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai could tell neither of them could gain the upper hand. Lan Xun’s Moon Illusion Body was truly mysterious—her movements were unpredictable, shifting like moonlight, making it impossible for Mo Xiaoqi’s fierce attacks to break through her defenses. When Mo Xiaoqi’s strength waned, she would switch from offense to defense, and Lan Xun would seize the chance to strike back. And so, the cycle repeated, neither side able to claim victory.

Not far away, a young man watched nervously, occasionally shouting, “Princess, be careful! Don’t get hurt!”

Xiao Chen!

As Princess Lan Xun’s loyal protector, this guy always appeared wherever she was.

He was sweating with anxiety. If anyone else dared to fight Lan Xun, he would have already stepped in to teach them a lesson. But Mo Xiaoqi was no ordinary person, so even though Xiao Chen had now reached the Emperor Realm, he could only stand by and watch, unable to intervene at all.

Just as he was getting anxious, Xiao Chen sensed someone flying toward him. Turning his head, he saw Yang Kai standing there with a big smile.

He looked Yang Kai up and down and snorted, “It’s you!”

Clearly, he remembered Yang Kai. Back in the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had refined the Supreme Mystic Pill, causing quite a stir. Of course, Xiao Chen would remember someone like that.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Brother Xiao, it’s been years. Congratulations on advancing to the Emperor Realm.”

Xiao Chen said proudly, “What’s there to congratulate? This Young Master’s talent is overflowing. Reaching the Emperor Realm was only a matter of time.”

His shameless boasting made Yang Kai’s face darken.

Still, to be fair, although Xiao Chen was a bit arrogant, he did have talent. Otherwise, he couldn’t have reached the Emperor Realm.

Xiao Chen said, “I remember you took a Supreme Mystic Pill in the Four Seasons Land. Why are you still in the Dao Origin Realm? Tsk tsk, your talent is really lacking. What a waste of such a divine pill!”

Yang Kai laughed it off, “Yeah, if I’d given that Supreme Mystic Pill to you back then, maybe you’d have reached the Emperor Realm even sooner.”

“Of course!” Xiao Chen said smugly, then suspiciously, “So, what do you want with me?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he looked toward the two girls locked in battle. “Brother Xiao, why are you just standing here watching? Princess Lan Xun’s status is incredibly distinguished—how can you let her fight someone like this? If word of this reaches Lord Radiant Moon, do you think he’ll let you off lightly? If anything happens to her, the consequences would be unimaginable. Hurry up and separate them!”

Xiao Chen’s face fell, his earlier pride vanishing. He complained, “If I could separate them, I would have done it already. Do you even know who the girl fighting the Princess is?”

“Who?” Yang Kai asked innocently.

“You country bumpkin, you don’t even know her background!” Xiao Chen curled his lip. “But then, her identity isn’t something just anyone would know. Fine, I’ll let you broaden your horizons today. Listen up, that girl is the Beast Great Emperor’s daughter!”

“The Beast Great Emperor?” Yang Kai looked shocked.

Xiao Chen snorted, “Scared now? Now you know why I can only watch and not get involved. Both of them are princesses. Offend either one and you’re doomed… Ah, it’s tough being a man.”

He sighed deeply, looking utterly miserable.

Yang Kai said, “But we can’t let them keep fighting like this. Right now, it looks like just a spar, but if things get serious, the consequences could be dire! You know how competitive young girls can be. If this drags on, it might turn into a life-and-death struggle.”

Xiao Chen shuddered at Yang Kai’s words, his face turning pale as if he could already picture some terrifying scene. “Would it really come to that? Don’t try to scare me.”

Yang Kai said seriously, “Anything is possible. Separating them now is what matters most.”

Xiao Chen swallowed hard. “How? The Princess won’t even listen to me. Unless I go up and intervene directly…”

“Then go up and intervene! Separate them!” Yang Kai said sternly. “Brother Xiao, you’re an Emperor Realm expert now. How hard can it be to separate two girls fighting?”

“Of course it’s no trouble!” Xiao Chen snorted, giving Yang Kai a meaningful look. “But why do I feel like… you’re trying to set me up? Is it because I’m better looking than you, so you’re jealous?”

“How could that be!” Yang Kai said righteously. “I’m only thinking of the Princess’s safety. I’m a martial artist from the Southern Territory, after all. I don’t want to see the Princess get hurt. She’s so perfect—any harm to her would be blasphemy!”

Xiao Chen nodded in agreement, his eyes burning with passion. “You’re right. The Princess can’t be harmed at all. We must separate them immediately.”

“Brother Xiao, hurry up!” Yang Kai urged.

Xiao Chen grabbed Yang Kai’s arm. “Since you’re so loyal, come with me. I’ll stop Princess Lan Xun, you stop the other Princess. It’s settled.”

As he spoke, he dragged Yang Kai forward, not caring whether Yang Kai agreed, moving as fast as lightning.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, cursing in his heart.

He’d planned to trick Xiao Chen into intervening and ending this pointless fight, but who would have thought this guy, who seemed simple, was actually quite shrewd and dragged him along too.

But things had come to this, and Yang Kai had no time to argue. He could only cooperate with Xiao Chen as he said.

As they got close, Xiao Chen suddenly exerted force and threw Yang Kai right into the center of the girls’ fight, shouting, “Princesses, please stop! Let’s talk things out, no need to fight!”

Xiao Chen, damn you!

Yang Kai cursed furiously in his heart. He never expected Xiao Chen to be so despicable, using him as a hidden weapon. Obviously, this would distract Lan Xun and Mo Xiaoqi, making it easier for Xiao Chen to intervene.

In midair, Yang Kai twisted his body to steady himself, not daring to act rashly, and quickly circulated Origin Qi to protect himself.

The next moment, he charged into the center of the girls’ battle.

Several loud explosions rang out, mixed with Yang Kai’s muffled groans.

Lan Xun and Mo Xiaoqi both stopped in shock, each retreating dozens of zhang, staring blankly at Yang Kai.

Neither girl was the type to kill indiscriminately, so when they saw someone rush into the fight and get hurt, they immediately stopped.

Mo Xiaoqi looked at the newcomer uneasily, unsure if he was seriously injured. But the next moment, her beautiful eyes lit up, and the beast markings on her face faded away completely.

“Eldest Brother Yang!” she called out in surprise and delight, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned at her, and as he rushed over, he took the opportunity to pull her aside, putting distance between her and Lan Xun.

“Hiss…” On the other side, Xiao Chen, who had followed Yang Kai, couldn’t help but gasp when he saw this, shocked and secretly impressed.

He’d only wanted Yang Kai to help separate the two princesses, but never expected this guy to actually put his arm around Mo Xiaoqi.

This… this guy must have nerves of steel! How dare he be so disrespectful to a princess?
