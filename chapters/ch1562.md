## Chapter 1562 — Arrangement

Although the Little Senior Sister had already advanced to the Origin Returning Realm and far exceeded the Hu sisters in cultivation, it was only because she had gained an immense opportunity and refined the Stellar Origin that she could do so.

The Hu sisters certainly had not received such heaven-defying fortune; on this land so barren and Spiritual Qi so thin, to reach that level by sheer effort shows their aptitude was truly extraordinary.

Seeing Yang Kai's face full of puzzlement, the woman on the left pursed her lips and smiled, saying, "I'm Jiao'er!"

"I'm Mei'er!" the woman on the right added.

Their voices were soft and honeyed, utterly enchanting. Their temper and bearing seemed very different from before, fusing the elder's bold abandon with the younger's coy restraint; now, joined as one in spirit, they appeared all the more alluring.

"If you hadn't said anything, I really wouldn't have noticed," Yang Kai said, scratching his head.

That somewhat childish gesture drew a suppressed laugh from the two women.

"Very few people can tell," Hu Jiao'er said, pursing her lips and laughing coquettishly, "even Father often confuses us."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded lightly. Even Hu Man could not tell his two daughters apart, so there was nothing strange that he himself could not either. "By the way, you've heard about what happened earlier; do you intend to stay, or..."

"We'll go with you!" Before Yang Kai could finish, the two answered in unison, as if sharing one mind and needing no discussion.

"Very well, then prepare yourselves; I don't plan to wait long — I'll depart in half a month."

"Alright, we'll first go see Father, and we'll also send word to Master," Hu Jiao'er said, and without delay she and Hu Mei'er left together.

Yet they seemed somewhat reluctant to part.

They had not seen one another for so many years. They longed to speak with Yang Kai at length, but thinking that they could meet often in the future, they were in no hurry in that moment.

As they passed Xia Ningshang, the two women nodded lightly; admiration flashed in their lovely eyes.

Xia Ningshang could so naturally accompany Yang Kai; they could not...

"Senior Sister, during these half a month I'll teach you something." Once the hall had emptied, Yang Kai quickly approached Xia Ningshang and led her toward the inner chamber.

What Yang Kai intended to teach Xia Ningshang was naturally the knack of refining one's own Shi and the points that required attention.

His refinement of Shi relied on borrowing the Imperial Might emanating from the Imperial Garden — a kind of clever shortcut. Though the results were astonishing, it was not suitable for Xia Ningshang.

Yet this understanding, perception, and experience of Shi were universal. Moreover, he had earlier gleaned many valuable experiences from Qian Tong and others.

He now passed all of these on to Xia Ningshang.

Besides that, Yang Kai also transmitted the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Little Senior Sister possessed the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, a special constitution that instinctively knew how to refine pills and required no instruction. The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy was vast and profound, exceptionally arcane. Xia Ningshang could readily draw from it what was useful and thereby raise her alchemical skill.

Half a month — neither long nor short.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang did not leave the inner chamber's doorstep.

Naturally there was no lack of romance and tender moments: spring's beauteous light, heaven's thunder stirring earth's fire, overturned rains and rolling clouds...

Since setting foot in the Star Domain, Yang Kai had kept himself from women; now, reunited with a beauty, passion surged to such depths he was like a beast breaking free — wildly courageous.

Xia Ningshang's complexion grew ever better, and her already fair skin became increasingly lustrous and dewy, seemingly as delicate as if it would give to a breath.

A beautiful flower must, after all, be nourished by rain and dew...

Half a month later, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang left in company.

In so short a span, Xia Ningshang could not truly refine her own Shi. But having absorbed the experiences Yang Kai taught her, she understood what Shi was and had gained a modest comprehension of that wondrous power; now she only lacked her own practice.

She found the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy effortless to study; the various methods and spirit formations recorded within often made her eyes light up and struck her deeply.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land was now teeming with people—nearly ten thousand gathered here from the human, yao, and demon races alike.

Among that ten thousand were two thousand disciples of the Sacred Land, three to four thousand from Zhongdu, over a thousand yao, and two thousand demons.

Despite the vast number gathered, the place was utterly silent—no one dared raise their voice, not even whisper to another. All simply waited quietly for Yang Kai’s arrival.

They were all eager to know by what means Yang Kai would bring so many into the Star Domain at once.

A flash of light, and Yang Kai appeared; over ten thousand pairs of eyes turned to him.

Scanning below, Yang Kai nodded lightly. "Since everyone is here, let's begin!"

"Yang Kai, what do you want us to do? Just give the order!" Lei Long shouted from below.

"Yes, we'll cooperate fully," Changyuan nodded in assent.

"Nothing special, just relax — don't resist!" Yang Kai smiled faintly, then opened his mouth and spat out an unremarkable-looking bead. The bead hovered before him, drawing everyone's attention.

They had no idea what marvel the bead contained, nor what Yang Kai intended by producing it now.

The answer was revealed quickly: Yang Kai reached out, flicked the bead with a finger, and it shot forth like an arrow loosed from a string, flying directly to the space above the gathered masses.

With a soft pop, a bursting sound seemed to come from within the bead, and a strange power swept outward; everyone who felt it had the sensation of being restrained.

Trusting Yang Kai, they did not activate their inner power to resist.

The world blurred for a moment, and when they regained their senses the crowd found themselves in a completely unfamiliar place.

This was clearly not the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, yet the scenery was strikingly beautiful.

Moreover, the world's Spiritual Qi seemed incredibly dense — at least a hundred times richer than on the Tongxuan Continent — and the realization sent a jolt through everyone!

“Huh? What’s that?” A Demon suddenly shouted, as if discovering a new continent, staring wide-eyed at a certain spot.

Following his gaze, they immediately spied a long, shuttle-shaped object over ten zhang in length, jet-black and quietly hovering in midair.

"Warship!" the Demon Lord Changyuan barked, eyes full of astonishment.

Although he had earlier heard from Demon General Meng Ge that Yang Kai possessed an intact warship, he had not seen it with his own eyes and had doubted the truth; now, with the ship before him, he realized the report had been true.

Beneath the Demon Capital lay a similar warship—though that one was battered and broken, and in class, it wasn’t even fit to carry the shoes of the one before their eyes.

Changyuan indeed had a keen eye; at a glance he discerned the extraordinary nature of this intact warship.

What surprised him further was that under the warship stood several people; when they looked toward his side they showed astonishment and pointed with curiosity.

Changyuan habitually swept his Divine Sense over those warriors, and his expression changed at once!

He discovered that each of these people far surpassed him in cultivation; though they lacked Yang Kai's oppressive force, they were unquestionably of the Saint King Realm!

Could it be that they had already reached the Star Domain?

Were these the warriors from the Star Domain?

A flicker of doubt passed through Changyuan's mind — many present shared the thought.

"Don't be nervous!" Yang Kai's voice came from somewhere, his figure flickering as he appeared before those Saint King Realm warriors and explained, "These are my disciples."

"Disciple pays respect to the Sect Master!" Those beings who had seemed unattainable to all cultivators of the Tongxuan Continent bowed to Yang Kai.

“Mm.” Yang Kai gave a slight nod, then turned to the one leading the group and said, “Liu Ping, these are relatives and friends from my homeland. I’ll be taking them back to Dark Star. They’ll stay here for now—see that they’re well looked after.”

"Yes!" the disciple called Liu Ping hastily promised.

Yang Kai then approached Chu Lingxiao and Ling Taixu and bowed, "Grandmaster, here is a Small Xuan Realm. Though not large, it can hold ten thousand people, which will be sufficient; you will be safe here. When I arrive at the place I will have you released. This humble disciple established the Lingxiao Sect on a place called Dark Star and needs you two to go and take charge. The journey will be somewhat long and will consume time, perhaps several years. If you have any questions, ask these disciples — they will fully cooperate."

"Very well. Tend to your affairs; do not worry about this place," Chu Lingxiao said with a benign smile.

He had no idea how precious and heaven-defying the Xuan Realm Pearl and the Void King-Grade Warship were; had he known, he would not have been so composed.

"Then this disciple will depart for now and will come to visit when I have the time," Yang Kai said, and left the Small Xuan Realm.

After Yang Kai left, the disciple Liu Ping immediately scampered over, fawning and asking after Ling Taixu and Chu Lingxiao's wellbeing.

He had heard plainly that Yang Kai had addressed the two elders as Master and Grandmaster; although his cultivation surpassed theirs considerably, he dared not slacken in their presence and treated them with the utmost respect of a junior.

Seeing the youth behave so properly, Chu Lingxiao and Ling Taixu did not hold back. They questioned Liu Ping about Dark Star and the Lingxiao Sect there, and upon learning that the Lingxiao Sect now dominated Dark Star — virtually ruling it — they were filled with comfort and pride.

In just over thirty years, Yang Kai had by his own strength made an entire cultivation star submit and obey — something hardly achievable by mere mortal means — and they suddenly formed a new appreciation for his power.

Immediately they began to inquire for more news.

The Xuan Realm Pearl lay peaceful in his hand. Yang Kai put it away, swept his Divine Sense once through the empty Nine Heavens Sacred Land, hid any trace of lingering affection in his eyes, and said to Xia Ningshang, who stood waiting at his side, "Senior Sister, help me find someone."
