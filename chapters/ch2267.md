## Chapter 2267 — Eighteen Star Array

In just over a dozen breaths, eighteen Spirit Sources appeared within a radius of ten thousand zhang underground.

The weakest of these were Middle-Grade, and there were even three Upper-Level Spirit Sources.

These eighteen Spirit Sources seemed to follow a special pattern beneath the earth: fifteen Middle-Level Spirit Sources encircled the periphery, while the three Upper-Level Spirit Sources were positioned at the very center.

The whole formation seemed to contain profound mysteries.

With all eighteen Spirit Sources erupting at once, the scene was spectacular beyond words, leaving everyone speechless in shock.

After the initial excitement and astonishment, everyone quickly realized something was very wrong.

The appearance of a single Middle-Level Spirit Source would draw the intervention of top forces. Now, with eighteen Spirit Sources at once, including three Upper-Level ones, even the likes of Qingyang Shrine, Tianwu Sacred Land, and Wuhua Hall might be alarmed, and perhaps even Star God Palace would send people.

This was an event that would shake the entire Southern Territory, even the whole Star Realm!

The name of Fenglin City would surely spread across the world and become known to all.

“It’s over, it’s all over now!” someone muttered, lips twitching.

Though he didn’t say it clearly, everyone knew what he meant: the opportunity here had nothing to do with their own Sects anymore.

“This arrangement of Spirit Sources... could it be... could it be the Eighteen Star Array?” Someone in the crowd looked around with shock in his eyes.

“Eighteen Star Array?” someone asked suspiciously, staring at him. “Friend, are you skilled in arrays?”

“I know a little...” the man nodded. Everyone grew curious and looked at him expectantly. “Since you know arrays, tell us—what is the Eighteen Star Array for?”

The man’s face was pale and unsightly. After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice, “I can’t be sure it’s the Eighteen Star Array. After all, this formation has long been lost, a thing of ancient times. There are only a few brief descriptions in the records, not detailed at all.”

“An ancient grand array!” someone exclaimed. The Ancient and Primeval Eras were both very special periods. It was said that during those times, the tides of the world surged, Law Power was dense, and many great experts were born. But as time passed, Law Power gradually thinned, making it harder and harder for martial artists to advance. Anything related to the ancient or primeval eras was bound to be something extraordinary. So when they heard this Eighteen Star Array was an ancient wonder, everyone grew interested and wanted to know more.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly as he looked at the man and asked, “Friend, is your surname Gong?”

“From the Gong family of Tianhe Valley?” someone immediately called out. To recognize an ancient array at a glance, this man’s attainments in arrays must be extraordinary. In the entire Southern Territory, only the Gong family of Tianhe Valley was deeply versed in arrays—every member was a master. Yang Kai had dealt with Gong Wenshan of the Gong family in the Four Seasons Land and had experienced their mastery firsthand, so he asked this question.

“Hiss... it’s you, that fiend...” Only now did the martial artist beside Yang Kai come to his senses, jumping in fright and quickly moving away. The others also looked terrified and retreated a few steps. In an instant, there was no one left around Yang Kai.

Yang Kai touched his nose and said, “I’m just here to look around. No need to be so nervous.” He hadn’t expected these people to be so wary of him. Seeing he was being friendly and not showing any killing intent, everyone relaxed a little.

“Brother Gong...” Yang Kai looked at the man again. The man gave a bitter smile. “I’m not surnamed Gong... but I’m half a member of the Gong family.” His words left everyone confused. He explained, “My wife is from the Gong family, so I’ve learned a lot about arrays from them.”

“I see!” Everyone looked enlightened, thinking he must be a son-in-law, which explained his knowledge of arrays.

“Friend, tell us about this Eighteen Star Array,” Yang Kai said. “I’m very curious—what is it for?”

“The Eighteen Star Array is an ancient wonder. The requirements to set it up are extremely strict. As you can see, it needs eighteen objects brimming with Spiritual Qi, and they must be sources that can continuously produce it. Spirit Sources are the best foundation for the array!” The Gong family’s son-in-law became solemn as he spoke, his words flowing smoothly, clearly well-versed and convincing. “And the purpose of this ancient array...” He paused, then continued, “is to suppress and seal!”

“Suppress and seal?”

“Seal what?” The crowd was confused.

“I don’t know.” The man shook his head, then turned to Duan Yuanshan. “City Lord Duan, has anything unusual happened here before?”

Duan Yuanshan’s mouth twitched. He glanced at Yang Kai and said, “Since you’ve all been in Fenglin City for some time, you must know that a few months ago, the city was surrounded by Demonic Qi.”

“Hiss...”

“Could it be that what’s sealed here is... ancient Demonic Qi?” Everyone’s faces changed, some nearly losing their balance.

Yang Kai’s face also showed realization, secretly admiring the methods of those ancient experts. Of everyone present, he knew best what was sealed here. It wasn’t ancient Demonic Qi, but the black pupil of an Ancient Giant Demon! The black pupil that could create a world of darkness! All the ancient Demonic Qi was merely born from that black pupil. Sealing Demonic Qi with Spiritual Qi was indeed a good method, but even those ancient experts underestimated the black pupil’s strangeness. After countless years, the black pupil had not disappeared. Though it had lost its spirit and will, it still existed, and finally broke free, to be obtained by Yang Kai.

“No need to worry, everyone. When the city was surrounded by Demonic Qi, three Emperor Realm masters came to handle it. The Demonic Qi should have been completely dispelled. In any case, we haven’t sensed any Demonic Qi these past months,” Duan Yuanshan reassured everyone. He had always thought the retreat of the Demonic Qi was thanks to Gao Xueting and the others.

“So, the Eighteen Star Array was used to seal that demon thing!” The Gong family’s son-in-law also looked a bit pale, clearly unsettled. The others sighed in relief as well.

After a long silence, someone finally said, “Let’s not worry about ancient Demonic Qi. Now that these eighteen Spirit Sources have appeared, it might be a great opportunity for us.”

“Right, right! Since we can’t keep them forever, why not take this chance to absorb as much as we can? What are you all waiting for!” someone shouted, and his figure flickered as he rushed toward a Spirit Source. He was decisive, heading straight for an Upper-Level Spirit Source, wanting to absorb as much Spiritual Qi as possible. There were only three Upper-Level Spirit Sources, but there were twenty or thirty Sects and families present, so he had to act first.

As soon as he moved, everyone else couldn’t hold back either, and they all rushed toward the Spirit Sources. Yang Kai moved as well, instantly using his space technique to teleport above an Upper-Level Spirit Source, standing in midair and looking coldly ahead. Several martial artists charged over, apparently from the same Sect, all with strong cultivation—the weakest at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and the leader at the Third Stage. They seemed intent on seizing this Upper-Level Spirit Source. But before they could arrive, Yang Kai had already beaten them to it. Their faces turned ugly and they stopped in place. The leader, a middle-aged man, looked dignified and steady. After a moment’s thought, he cupped his fists and said, “Brother Yang, can we discuss this?”

“No,” Yang Kai replied decisively. The man’s face darkened and he forced a smile. “I haven’t even said anything yet.”

“It’s still no.”

“Don’t be like that. We’re all just trying to get by. Give us some face, will you? Besides, this Spirit Source is so big, you can’t use it all yourself. How about my Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters take half, and you take half? Everyone’s happy.”

“I like to have things to myself. I never share,” Yang Kai said arrogantly, nose in the air.

“Don’t be so cocky, brat! Don’t think we’re afraid of you—we just don’t want to embarrass everyone,” someone behind the middle-aged man suddenly shouted. The man frowned but didn’t stop him, clearly annoyed as well.

Yang Kai glanced at the speaker and said, “If you’re not afraid, don’t shout—just come and take it!” The man was furious, his hair bristling, and looked ready to fight. The middle-aged man was startled and quickly blocked him, looking at Yang Kai. “Brother Yang, really not possible?”

Yang Kai said coldly, “If you talk nicely, I’ll give you face. If you try to take it, don’t blame me for slapping you.”

“Slap...” The man’s face changed, suddenly recalling how Ning Yuanshu and Zhuang Pan had been slapped by Yang Kai, and his scalp tingled.

Yang Kai glanced into the distance. “If you go for another Spirit Source now, you might still have a chance. But if you keep wasting time with me, you won’t even get the scraps.”

The man looked back and panicked, waving his hand. “Let’s go!” As Yang Kai said, most of the eighteen Spirit Sources had already been seized, and people were even fighting fiercely for spots. The other two Upper-Level Spirit Sources were especially contested, with Sects and families battling in chaos. The scene was utter bedlam.

Duan Yuanshan and the others were quite sensible and showed no interest in the Upper-Level Spirit Sources. Instead, they joined the Drunken Old Man and several family patriarchs from Fenglin City to seize a Middle-Level Spirit Source, and for the moment, all was peaceful.
