## Chapter 1427 — Convenient Exception

When Qian Tong asked, Yang Kai naturally showed no sourness; he chuckled and, with polite clasped fists, said, "Junior greets Senior Qian, and greets City Lord Fei."

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exchanged a glance, both wearing pleased expressions.

They could clearly see that Yang Kai harbored no hint of contempt because of his fame or the powerful warship under his command; the youngster still treated them as elders and showed proper manners. Their past care for him had not been in vain.

Thinking this, both men felt a weight lift from their hearts.

"Brother Wei, Miss Dong, you two have come as well!" Yang Kai turned to the man and woman standing behind Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, smiling as he greeted them — of course they were Wei Guchang and Xuan'er.

The two hastened to return the courtesy, though there was still a faint look of astonishment on their brows, as if they hadn’t quite recovered from the scene just now.

"Yang Kai, about that rumor…" After the younger ones finished their pleasantries, Qian Tong and the others pressed the matter further.

A glint of sharpness flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes as he said in a clear voice, "Indeed, the rumors outside are true. At present my disciples, friends and I have actually taken up residence within the Flowing Flame Sandland."

His voice was not loud, but everyone heard it distinctly; at once a hubbub rose — some expressed doubt, some envy, and some ground their teeth in fury.

"Good, good, good!" Qian Tong, shocked, could not help but feel happy for Yang Kai. "If you have a place to stay, all the better, and such a precious location no less. I imagine those previous troubles will not happen again."

Living within the Flowing Flame Sandland meant one could sleep easy, with no concern of being attacked in concert. To strike at Yang Kai, one would first have to force one’s way through the Heat-Flame Zone — who could do such a thing?

Not a single person on the Dark Star could.

"Thanks for your concern, Elder Qian, but I believe from now on there truly won’t be any more thoughtless fools disturbing my cultivation," Yang Kai said with a grin, his gaze casually sweeping over where some experts stood.

This made many faces fall, but they dared not say anything.

“This junior should have sent word earlier, but I’ve been occupied these past days and couldn’t find the time. Fortunately, the two Seniors have come in person—since you’re here, why not join with Brother Wei and Miss Dong inside for a chat? There are a few matters this junior wishes to ask your advice on,” Yang Kai suggested. He wasn’t merely being polite—he truly had questions he wanted to consult them about.

"Enter inside?" Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu brightened at his words; after exchanging a look they nodded without hesitation. "Very well. The two of us have been thinking the same. We only feared you wouldn’t welcome us, Yang Kai."

"Senior, you jest. I should be the one to humbly invite you; how could I not welcome you?" Yang Kai stepped aside with a smile. "Please!"

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exchanged a smile and did not dally; in a flash they entered the cabin of the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle. Wei Guchang and Xuan'er hurried after them. From the outside the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle seemed small, yet it could comfortably hold twenty to thirty people without crowding, and inside there were many rooms. Once they entered, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu grew greatly interested and began to look about, clicking their tongues in admiration and offering continuous praise.

When they noticed Ye Xijun standing there with an indifferent expression behind Yang Yan, the two hurried forward to pay their respects.

They dared not put on airs before Ye Xijun. In fact, they were many years younger than her; if anyone were to act haughty, it would be Ye Xijun’s place, not theirs.

"No need for formalities, just find a seat anywhere. Once the Sect Master finishes handling matters outside, we’ll return together," Ye Xijun said lightly, waving her hand.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu quickly acknowledged her and found chairs, sitting with proper posture.

Seeing their elders so cautious and walking on eggshells, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, as juniors, dared not say a word. They stood stiffly behind Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, barely daring to breathe.

Outside the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, Yang Kai stood upright in the same spot, his expression calm. Though many experts present had cultivation realms higher than his, on his own territory Yang Kai had no fear.

After a moment’s thought he spoke in a loud voice: "You all must have heard what I said just now. From this day forth, this Flowing Flame Sandland shall be the territory of my Lingxiao Sect. I ask you all not to linger here; otherwise it will be regarded as a provocation against my Lingxiao Sect, and the consequences will be… heh heh…"

"Lingxiao Sect?"

"What is that?"

"We have such a sect on the Dark Star?"

A chorus of puzzled voices rose. Many wore expressions of bafflement, though Mo Xiaosheng, Cheng Pengxuan and others frowned, sensing something.

"The Lingxiao Sect is a sect established by myself and a group of like-minded friends, and our main base is within the Flowing Flame Sandland. Is that clear to everyone?" Yang Kai shouted again, taking the opportunity to officially proclaim the founding of the Lingxiao Sect to the world.

"Found a sect?"

"You, of all people?"

Louder doubts and commotion broke out.

It was no wonder they reacted so; founding a sect was not a trivial matter. At the very least one needed power that could hold the field. Looking around, the founders of the various powers on the Dark Star were all at the Origin Returning Realm level. Occasionally a Saint King Realm would rashly attempt to establish a sect, but such enterprises rarely lasted long and would fade from history for a variety of reasons.

Thus, no one paid any real attention to this unfamiliar Lingxiao Sect, nor did they hold Yang Kai, a mere Saint King Realm cultivator, in any regard.

Letting them clamor and look down on him, a mocking smile tugged at Yang Kai’s lips; he remained unmoved.

"You brat." A sharp voice rang out. Yang Kai turned toward it and saw Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance scowling at him. "Are your words just now true?"

"What does Elder Mo think?" Yang Kai answered with a question rather than a reply. Though Mo had partaken in the siege at Dragon Lair Mountain last time, Yang Kai had no intention of settling accounts with him now; his strength still had room to grow. He would settle scores in time, and the Battle Sky Alliance would not vanish overnight.

Mo Xiaosheng narrowed his eyes and, after a moment’s silence, said: "I’ll take your words as if you were not joking. I wonder who your Sect Master is?"

“This junior is unworthy, yet happens to occupy the seat of Sect Master. I must ask all seniors for your guidance in the days to come,” Yang Kai said with a bright grin.

"Indeed…" Mo Xiaosheng, a man of great scheming, well understood that Yang Kai would not let matters rest, yet at this moment he showed no inclination to make trouble. Instead he adopted a genial smile and said slowly, "Young friend Yang is a man of talent; it is hardly inappropriate for you to be a sect’s head. Given time, your sect may well grow into a force comparable to, or even surpassing, my Battle Sky Alliance. Truly auspicious; congratulations, truly congratulations."

An unusual light passed through Yang Kai’s eyes and he chuckled, "Elder Mo flatters me. Lingxiao Sect came into being simply because my friends and I wanted a place to reside. Lingxiao Sect and I have no grand ambitions — we only wish to secure a corner of peace. If others don’t provoke us, we won’t provoke others."

Old fox — trying to push himself into the limelight, utterly sly.

Yang Kai silently resented it. He wasn't fooled by Mo Xiaosheng’s warm words and gentle tone; his remark had obvious malice. With Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect already strong on the Dark Star, another equal or greater power would threaten the survival of the others.

Mo Xiaosheng was clearly trying to draw hostility toward the Lingxiao Sect. These old foxes—each one shrewder than the next—truly weren’t easy to deal with.

“What a fine line—‘if others don’t provoke us, we won’t provoke others!’” Mo Xiaosheng’s eyes flashed with sharp light, and a trace of anger surfaced. With his shrewdness, he naturally caught the meaning behind Yang Kai’s words. The other was clearly reminding him of the incident at Dragon Lair Mountain—warning that since he had once provoked him, Yang Kai would not simply let it pass. Still, now was not the time to fall out. After a brief thought, Mo Xiaosheng said, “Since your sect has only just been established, there must be many matters awaiting attention. This old man would be interested in taking a look inside—perhaps I might even offer a small measure of help. What does Sect Master Yang think of that?”

“That proposal doesn’t sound very suitable,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, showing not the slightest intention of giving him face. “As Elder just said, my humble sect has only just been established and indeed has countless matters to set in order. It’s not the right time to receive guests yet. If there’s an opportunity in the future, I’ll be sure to invite Elder then.”

Mo Xiaosheng fell silent. His desire to enter the Lingxiao Sect was not to spy on secrets; rather, since the Imperial Garden mysteriously appeared here, he was unwilling to wait outside the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Once the Imperial Garden opened, those inside would have a great advantage, while those waiting outside would—at best—require an extra half day to a day to circumvent the Flowing Flame Sandland’s flame barrier and arrive at the Imperial Garden.

After all, the Flowing Flame Sandland covered a considerable area.

Do not underestimate half a day to a day; getting in early might secure a tremendous advantage.

It was not only Mo Xiaosheng who thought thus; most of the other experts shared the same sentiment.

Seeing Mo’s failed negotiation, Cheng Pengxuan stepped forward and shouted, "We have come from afar. Sect Master Yang, why be so unneighborly as to reject people at a thousand li? Why not lift the restriction and let us enter to rest a while and drink a cup of tea?"

“Yes, yes, if there’s something to discuss, everyone can sit down and talk it through slowly.”

"Indeed, Sect Master Yang, open for convenience’s sake!"

Many voices immediately chimed in, and some shamelessly played the aging card, insisting Yang Kai show face.

How could Yang Kai possibly bother with them? He stood there, face cold and expressionless, waiting for the clamor to fade before finally speaking: “It’s not that I, Yang, am unwilling to offer a convenient exception—but you have already trespassed upon my Sect’s territory without permission. If the same thing happened to your own Sects, how would you handle it? I imagine you’d strike first and ask questions later, driving the intruders out by force, wouldn’t you? Still, my Lingxiao Sect has only just been established and has yet to announce itself to the world. Considering this is your first offense, I won’t hold you accountable. Now, please take your leave.”
