## Chapter 995 — You Still Dare Return

Inside the Purple Star warship, in an exquisitely luxurious cabin, a short, stout elder anxiously held a compass Secret Treasure, pouring his divine sense into it to try to contact Ke Meng in the engine room, but no matter how hard he tried he could not get a response.

"What on earth is going on?" the Fat Elder wiped the sweat from his brow and stamped his foot in agitation.

After a moment's thought, he hurriedly opened the door, intending to go personally to the engine room to see what had happened.

The moment the door opened, two youths radiating murderous intent came hurtling toward them.

The elder did not think twice and barked angrily at the two, "You two, come here!"

The youth leading them, Shen Tu, brightened and whispered, "It's this old fellow—he's the chart master on this warship. I saw him go to the engine room that day!"

Yang Kai subtly nodded and followed behind Shen Tu, quickly arriving in front of the elder.

"What's happening over at the engine room? Why isn't Ke Meng answering my transmission?" the elder shouted in fury.

Shen Tu grinned, baring sinister fangs. "Ke Meng is dead; of course he can't reply to you!"

The elder froze, suddenly realizing something was wrong. As he turned to retreat, a brilliant electric serpent surged from Shen Tu, as if alive, coiling around the elder and binding him.

The powerful current numbed the elder's body in an instant, leaving him stiff and unable to move.

"Take him and get out of here!" Shen Tu glanced around to ensure no one was watching, then sped off in another direction.

Yang Kai's face was cold as he lifted the elder bound by the electric serpent and said evenly, "If you want to live, cooperate quietly—otherwise we'll kill you."

Although the chart master on this Purple Star warship was not young, his strength was low—only Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—so Shen Tu had easily taken him in a single exchange, and Yang Kai could carry him with no resistance.

Chart masters generally do not cultivate deeply, for they pour much of their energy and time into studying Star Charts and the mysteries of the starry sky, leaving little time for cultivation.

That means they often lack the means to protect themselves when danger strikes.

"Who are you people?" the elder barked.

"That's none of your concern. Just get us out of this Chaos Abyss—once we're away we'll let you go, and we guarantee not to harm a hair on your head!" Shen Tu said coldly as he ran.

"Fine. I'll get you out. But you must first go to the warship's engine room. If you don't, you'll be walking into death!" the elder blurted anxiously.

Shen Tu sneered. "You think we're fools? We barely escaped the engine room—it's filled with Purple Star people now. Going back would be walking into a trap."

"You don't understand. I have my reasons for needing you to go to the engine room—it's not to send you to your deaths!" the elder said sorrowfully. "If you don't take me there, not only will the three of us die, this warship can't be saved either."

"Good riddance if the warship's lost—none of my concern!" Shen Tu said with malicious delight.

"How can you be so unreasonable... A great danger is about to sweep the entire Chaos Abyss. If we don't act quickly, no one will survive," the elder urged.

Shen Tu's steps came to an abrupt halt; he stared blankly at the elder. "What do you mean? Be clearer."

"Look outside!" the elder did not answer with words but gestured toward the window.

Shen Tu and Yang Kai exchanged a look, both feeling that the elder was not crying wolf, and hurried to the corridor to peer out through the transparent window.

Outside, the same enormous and beautiful stars hung in the void, but now their surfaces—so full of Heaven-and-Earth Energy—were overlaid with an ethereal halo, appearing nebulous as if drifting in clouds.

The powerful fields generated by those stars seemed to be in disorder.

The fighters of the Sword Alliance and Purple Star who had been locked in fierce combat had ceased fighting and instead were mounting beams of light, racing back toward their respective warships.

"They're coming back—what's going on?" Shen Tu's face changed. "It can't be because of that Crystal Cannon I fired, can it?"

Yang Kai watched him quietly, saying nothing.

Shen Tu, feeling embarrassed under Yang Kai's gaze, shrugged. "I didn't expect this... I only wanted to vent my anger."

"I don't think it's your doing. If it were, the Sword Alliance wouldn't be retreating; they'd press on. Both sides are withdrawing—they must have sensed some approaching danger," Yang Kai said, looking at the elder he carried. "What exactly is that danger?"

"Field turbulence! You can't feel it in here. They're all returning because the domain fields of the Chaos Abyss's stars are very different from before, so no one dares linger outside. We must leave at once; if we're late, even hiding within the warship won't keep us safe!"

"Field turbulence?" Shen Tu's expression shifted.

"The greatest danger within the Chaos Abyss!" the elder hurriedly explained. "You think those chaotic fields merely cause disorientation? You are wrong. The stars within the Chaos Abyss hold unimaginable Heaven-and-Earth Energy, and that energy is kept in a saturated state—the limit this space can bear. Normally it maintains a balance, but if excessively strong force disturbs it, that balance will be broken and the fields will burst. You can imagine the consequences."

Yang Kai and Shen Tu both cast brief glances, their faces draining of color.

"Do you lot even understand?" the elder spat, showing no sign of being cowed despite his captive state.

“Do you?” Shen Tu asked in a low, ghostly voice.  

"Of course! I'm a chart master—if I don't understand, who does?" the elder shot back, overwhelming Shen Tu into silence.

"If you understood, why didn't you stop them before the battle? Their fighting would have upset the field balance, wouldn't it?" Yang Kai asked coldly.

The elder looked embarrassed, his earlier arrogance gone. He mumbled, "I only realized it after they started. My Star Observation Technique isn't omniscient... who could have foreseen such danger?"

"Star Observation Technique?" Yang Kai frowned.

"A mystery all chart masters are well versed in—I'll explain it another time. What do we do now? This old fellow doesn't seem to be lying," Shen Tu said, momentarily at a loss.

If the elder's claim was true, then capturing him had been useless—once the fields in the Chaos Abyss erupted, there would be nowhere to hide.

Staying aboard the warship at least offered one layer of protection.

This was a Saint-Grade Upper-Level warship, after all!

But many Purple Star experts were about to return to the ship; remaining here was far from a perfect option.

"Come up with something—aren't you supposed to be quick-witted?" Shen Tu looked at Yang Kai expectantly, hoping he'd suggest a way out.

"What is this chart master's standing within Purple Star?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

"Very high!" Shen Tu said, eyeing the elder. "Master Wusuo ranks among the top three within the entire Purple Star faction when it comes to drawing Star Charts; other major powers have long tried to recruit him."

"You know me?" the elder asked Shen Tu in surprise.

"I've heard of you," Shen Tu smiled.

"Go to the engine room," Yang Kai said in a low voice.

Shen Tu's eyes narrowed; he hesitated but after pondering for a moment nodded, "Alright—if what he says is true, going outside would be suicide."

"Move!" Yang Kai hoisted the chart master called Wusuo and strode back toward the engine room.

The corridor outside the engine room was packed—fighters returning from the Chaos Abyss battlefield and those who had remained aboard had all rushed over, eager to know why a Crystal Cannon had been fired, killing many enemies and even some of their own.

They were furious, because if fortune had not favored them, the slain could have been any of them.

But upon learning the situation inside the engine room, their anger was instantly extinguished.

There were no survivors inside the engine room; Ke Meng and more than a dozen Saint Realm fighters had been slain by an unknown enemy.

Inside the engine room, a middle-aged man in a brocade robe stood with his hands folded behind his back, exuding a calm authority. His cold, stern eyes swept over the scene and paused on a pair of opened shackles; he snorted, "Trash!"

With his perception he could tell how Ke Meng had died—though he did not know every detail, he could roughly infer the situation.

The shackled fighters had made a desperate counterstrike, killing Ke Meng when he let his guard down, seizing the keys and freeing their companions, and had unleashed a massacre inside the engine room. After killing everyone, the two fleeing rats seized control of the warship and fired a Crystal Cannon at the battlefield, inflicting heavy losses on the Purple Star fighters.

That useless Ke Meng was not worth lamenting!

The middle-aged man was furious beyond measure.

As he prepared to order a search for the fleeing pair, a sharp voice suddenly sounded outside the engine room: "Who are you? Release Master Wusuo at once, or you'll regret it!"

The middle-aged man's expression chilled as he looked toward the entrance.

From outside came a somewhat flippant voice: "Make way—make way. Eh, don't try anything silly; if you move, your Master Wusuo will be finished."

Moments later, three figures appeared at the engine room entrance.

Two unfamiliar youths, one swaggering at the front while the other stood coldly, holding Wusuo's life in his grasp—his divine sense and Saint Yuan enveloping Wusuo as if ready to strike at any moment.

The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed as he growled, "You still dare come back?"

Though he had never met Yang Kai and Shen Tu, the middle-aged man was certain these two little rats were the ones who had escaped from the engine room and fired the Crystal Cannon, killing dozens of Purple Star fighters.

Standing before them, the man's fury surged and he longed to slay them on the spot to vent his hatred.
