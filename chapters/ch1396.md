## Chapter 1396 — Formation Array Unleashed

Ning Xiangchen’s expression shifted subtly, a flicker of shock flashing through his heart. It wasn’t the price of the Drunken Moon Wine that startled him—he had long heard of its fame and exorbitant cost. What truly surprised him was Chang Qi’s audacious tone.

He clearly didn’t take those people outside seriously at all!

Ning Xiangchen’s expression flickered between gloom and hesitation. Gritting his teeth, he steeled his heart and sat down as well, snorting, “Fine! This old man will see whether you’re courting death or luring the enemy into your trap. But if it’s the former, don’t blame me for slipping away when the time comes.”

Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a glance, nodded, and smiled: “As it should be!”

Saying that, they refilled Ning Xiangchen's cup.

The three harbored differing thoughts as they sipped fine wine and ate spirit fruit, utterly lacking the vigilance one would expect before a fierce clash.

Inside the Stone Residence, after Wu Yi had arranged many disciples, she and Qian Yue entered a secret chamber. From a spatial ring she drew out a formation plate that shimmered with alternating gold and silver light. She tossed it forward and said solemnly, “Sister Qian Yue, this is the master control formation plate for all the arrays in Dragon Lair Mountain. I alone may be insufficient to operate it—I'll need your assistance.”

“Very well.” Qian Yue nodded with weight.

Wu Yi then stretched out and produced several strands of Saint Yuan, pouring them into the formation plate. In an instant, the gold and silver hues alternated so rapidly the entire chamber was suffused with a glazed radiance.

Wu Yi's face was solemn. Suddenly she gave a soft, sharp call: “Open!”

The formation plate emitted a low, humming sound, and the interwoven gold and silver seemed to take on life, withdrawing to the left and right. In the blink of an eye the two colors split apart, distinct and unmixed.

Outside Dragon Lair Mountain's protective mountain array, more than thirty Origin Returning Realm experts led by Xie Li were frantically assaulting the array. Each had unleashed their trump cards, and the seemingly sturdy array began to tremble; its light dimmed considerably compared to before.

“Everyone, push harder! This damned array won't hold much longer!” Xie Li's eyes shone with cruel light as he called out. As he spoke he wielded the anti-array treasure White Rainbow Dagger, darting it through the array's shimmering curtain.

No one needed his reminder; the Origin Returning Realm attackers could estimate by the force of their blows that the array would fall soon. It would be broken in less than half a day, they feared.

For a moment all present were roused, pumping their Saint Yuan like warriors on war stimulants, pouring it into their secret treasures.

Multicolored lights flared and thunderous noises rang without end.

Then, accompanied by an eerie hum, Dragon Lair Mountain's protective array suddenly faded at incredible speed and vanished.

The attacks of more than thirty Origin Returning Realm experts struck nothing but air, carving the earth into rifts and furrows.

“It broke?” The surname Du elder from Myriad Beasts Mountain, who rode a Green-Eyed Blood Toad, raised his brow in surprise. He had distinctly felt the array could hold a while longer—its sudden disappearance astonished him; perhaps some change had occurred.

“It doesn't seem so—the array was withdrawn proactively!” The Demon Blood Sect's middle-aged man, wrapped in a red blood-glow, squinted toward Dragon Lair Mountain and grew wary.

“Hmph, looks like they know stubborn resistance ends badly, so they withdrew the array thinking that'll save them?” someone shouted.

Such a claim naturally found little favor among the crowd, but since the array had been withdrawn there must be some contingency in place. Mist writhed within Dragon Lair Mountain so that divine sense was severely limited and even mortal eyes could see little. No one dared act rashly; they stood stunned, exchanging wary looks.

“A pack of cravens!” Xie Li ground his teeth, about to urge others to probe inside, when he suddenly noticed the cloudbank covering Dragon Lair Mountain roll and contort.

Within moments, the rolling mists dispersed to each side, revealing the interior of Dragon Lair Mountain.

It was a sight of its own—pavilions and towers nestled against the mountains and waters, a place of pleasant scenery. The internal Spiritual Qi was abundant; it was no longer the barren hill it had once been.

To everyone's shock, very few came out to meet them. Silence lay all around; no figures were seen except three Origin Returning Realm elders who sat at a table, drinking and making merry.

This insolent scene chilled every onlooker's expression.

They clearly had no regard for their opponents—otherwise how could they lounge here, carefree, drinking?

“Hmph—playing tricks when death is at the door!” Xie Li snorted and probed Dragon Lair Mountain with his divine sense. Though he found nothing amiss, an inexplicable chill crawled over him, as if stepping into that little hillhead would be like walking through the gates of hell.

The feeling made him deeply uneasy. He looked to the others and saw the same grave expressions.

But with arrows already nocked, they could not afford to retreat. Xie Li knew many eyes watched this place; if they slunk away now, they'd lose all face.

With that thought he hardened his expression and announced loudly, “Everyone, the array is broken—if not now, when?”

He waved his hand, and over twenty Saint King Realm cultivators of the Xie Family broke from the ranks, using body techniques to charge into Dragon Lair Mountain.

Although those more than twenty Saint King Realm fighters might not be a match for three Origin Returning Realm elders, they were perfect to probe the mountain's depth. That was Xie Li's plan, and as they flew out he fixed his gaze upon them without flinching.

With the Xie Family taking the lead, Demon Blood Sect and Myriad Beasts Mountain were unwilling to be outdone. Hidden among the crowd, Lu Ye quietly issued an order; in moments more than sixty Saint King Realm cultivators divided into several forces and approached the spot where Chang Qi and his companions sat.

Sensing the swelling number of attackers, Ning Xiangchen's hand trembled and he nearly spilled his cup. Though he was Origin Returning Realm, he lacked confidence against so many Saint King Realm assailants.

Chang Qi, reading the situation, chuckled and said, “Brother Ning, be calm; it's not yet time for us to act.”

“Yes, Brother Ning, put your heart at ease.” Hao An echoed, not even glancing at the advancing Saint King Realm fighters.

Ning Xiangchen could not steady himself. Watching enemies close in, his Saint Yuan stirred beneath the surface—he looked ready to move at any moment.

But in the next instant, those Saint King Realm cultivators who had been charging forth so fiercely suddenly cried out in unison. Their faces were filled with shock and confusion as their bodies swayed uncontrollably. Amid startled shouts and exclamations, they tumbled one after another from midair, making the scene erupt into utter chaos.

“A suspended-air formation?” Ning Xiangchen's eyes nearly bulged. He never expected this tiny Dragon Lair Mountain to harbor such a thing.

This kind of array was supremely profound—normally only great cities or sect headquarters would set such formations. Once covered by it, cultivators could not take to the air. Of course, the array's strength varied, depending on the art of the one who cast it.

Ning Xiangchen tried to rouse his Saint Yuan and fly, but to his shock he rose only one zhang before a crushing pressure from above pinned him, stopping any further movement.

This suspended-air formation could at least restrain cultivators of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; even Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts couldn't fly freely here!

Who had arranged such a formidable array?

While he fretted, the dozens of Saint King Realm warriors fell like raindrops, landing hard and raising clouds of dust.

Fortunately they hadn't fallen from great height; Saint King physique was exceptional, so though they fell awkwardly none had life-threatening injuries. They groaned and crawled up, faces full of resentment.

What a humiliation—they now hated Dragon Lair Mountain to the bone.

Before they could recover, something unexpected occurred.

All around, strange ripples of energy suddenly surged to life. These fluctuations were exceedingly well-hidden, seeming almost insignificant at first. Yet in the next instant, a tornado abruptly took shape in one spot. When it first appeared, its force was still weak, but in the blink of an eye, it swelled into a massive vortex. Countless Wind Blades spun and darted within it, sweeping up a nearby Saint King Realm cultivator and dragging him straight into its heart.

A shrill scream rang out, followed by the chilling sound of flesh being sliced echoing in everyone’s ears, sending shivers down their spines. In an instant, the tornado was dyed a deep red, with severed limbs and torn flesh faintly visible, rising and falling within the raging winds.

Elsewhere, several ice spears the thickness of thighs manifested in midair and, with a twitch, shot forward like arrows, passing clean through two distracted warriors' chests and spraying a cloud of blood.

Elsewhere, fireballs the size of washbasins drifted aimlessly through the air. Yet once one struck, any Saint King Realm cultivator hit by it would be instantly burned to death. A few unlucky ones failed to dodge in time and met a gruesome end.

Others simply vanished from sight, as if they had never existed, yet their places echoed with heart-rending screams.

The stench of blood rose heavenward. The first wave of more than eighty Saint King Realm attackers could not even penetrate deep into Dragon Lair Mountain; they were slaughtered as soon as they stepped within its range.

Whether in an instant or an eternity, of the more than eighty Saint King Realm warriors only a little under half remained alive. Those survivors staggered like headless flies inside Dragon Lair Mountain, blindly running about with no way to return.

The spectacle chilled the onlookers to the bone.

Though it might seem absurd, everyone realized those men had fallen into an illusory formation—what they saw was different from what others perceived, so even a few steps' worth of distance could be a chasm between life and death.
