## Chapter 1325 — Undying Five Elements Sword

All these things had been swallowed by the Stone Puppet inside the Corpse Den. At the time Yang Kai and Yang Yan were busy extracting the Sun's True Essence and had little time to deal with the mountains of ore and Saint Crystal, so they let the Stone Puppet handle it.

Within the Corpse Den there were seven or eight small mounds of various ores and Saint Crystals. Although the Stone Puppet devoured only about half, the quantity was still astonishing.

Some of the minerals had been absorbed by it to strengthen itself and to repair the damage caused by the Sun's True Fire; the rest had been heaped in front of Yang Kai.

Things had been too hurried back then for Yang Kai to inspect the quality and types of these ores, but since they were stacked outside rather than stored in Spatial Rings, they were certainly inferior in quality and rarity. After sweeping them with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai confirmed his suspicion.

None of this was his concern, however; all those minerals were to be handed over to Yang Yan for processing.

Just as he was about to stuff them into his Spatial Ring, Yang Kai gave a soft sound of surprise. His gaze fixed on a spot within one mound, and with a casual gesture he picked up a fist-sized, smooth, flawless white orb that looked almost like a perfect sphere.

He stared at the sphere with a mix of doubt and curiosity. Then, as if remembering something, his eyes widened. After rotating his cultivation technique and sensing the vast, pure energy seeping from the orb, Yang Kai's expression turned odd. He stared at the Stone Puppet in astonishment and asked, "You can purify something like this too?"

The Stone Puppet cocked its head and said nothing.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, realizing it could not convey its feelings—after all, the Stone Puppet's intelligence was limited.

He reached for the talisman restricting the stone abode that Yang Yan had given him, poured some Saint Yuan into it, and sent a thought-command.

Moments later, the restriction on the residence was opened from the outside. Yang Yan strode in and asked curiously, "Weren't you in seclusion? Why call for me?"

"Look at this!" Yang Kai tossed the sphere to her. Yang Yan took it, glanced at him with suspicion, then examined the orb carefully.

After a short while Yang Yan's beautiful eyes went wide. Surprise and delight washed her face as if she had discovered something of great consequence. She hurried to Yang Kai's side and asked impatiently, "Where did you get this? Are there more?"

Yang Kai pointed at the mound before them.

Yang Yan turned to look. When she noticed that the mound contained many orbs identical to the one she held, she momentarily lost herself in amazement.

It took over ten breaths before Yang Yan let out a sharp cry and dashed to the mound, swiftly stuffing every single orb into her Spatial Ring.

"Leave me some," Yang Kai said, looking dejected.

"What would you do with it?" Yang Yan snorted, then covered her Spatial Ring with one small hand as if to hide it.

"For cultivation. You saw what this was transformed from, right? I just broke through not long ago; this will help stabilize my realm." Yang Kai scratched his face.

"Of course I saw it. This must be what Xiaoxiao transformed, right?" Yang Yan scooped up the Stone Puppet and peppered its stony face with kisses, leaving Yang Kai dumbfounded; the Stone Puppet looked utterly bewildered.

"I never expected Xiaoxiao could even purify and compress Saint Crystals. This solves a problem I worried over—heh heh!" Yang Yan's eyes shone as she looked at the Stone Puppet, as if she wanted to smother it with more kisses.

“How can the Stone Puppet even purify and compress Saint Crystals? You didn’t know that before?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

Yang Yan shook her head. "I tried before; Xiaoxiao didn't have this ability. The Stone Puppet, however, is born with an instinct to absorb mineral essences and convert them into its own power. Now it can do this—I'd wager it's related to the Sun's True Essence. I can't be certain, but it seems likely."

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai nodded slightly. The Sun's True Essence, said to be refined from a Stellar Origin, was an extremely hot essence. If the Stone Puppet had absorbed and refined a trace of Sun's True Fire, a change in its abilities would not be surprising.

But the fact it could even purify and compress Saint Crystals into those spherical forms was truly astonishing.

In the Star Domain, the best-known Saint Crystal quality so far was only Upper-Level Saint Crystal, yet these orb-like creations shattered that common knowledge and set a precedent.

The energy contained within one orb was purer and far greater than an Upper-Level Saint Crystal. When Yang Kai felt it briefly, he estimated that the energy in one orb was roughly equivalent to the combined total of five or six Upper-Level Saint Crystal.

That did not mean a single orb's value equaled only that amount; its worth far exceeded that figure.

Theoretically, the exchange ratios among Upper-, Middle-, and Lower-Level Saint Crystal were one to ten, but every martial artist knew ratios aside, the higher the grade the greater the intrinsic value.

High-quality Saint Crystal provided more aid when a cultivator broke through bottlenecks, recovered Saint Yuan, or sat in healing meditation; at crucial moments it could mean life or death.

Although one orb's internal energy equaled only about five or six Upper-Level Saint Crystal, if circulated widely it could be exchanged for at least ten, maybe even twenty Upper-Level Saint Crystal.

Of course, that's while in widespread circulation. If a single orb were sold alone, prices of ten thousand, a hundred thousand, or more were possible.

After all, rarity commands pricelessness.

Yang Kai had no intention of profiting. From Yang Yan's behavior, these orbs—compressed from Saint Crystal by the Stone Puppet—would be of great use to her.

It was also likely connected to something she had mentioned earlier. Yang Kai didn't press; since Yang Yan promised him a surprise, he'd wait and see rather than pry.

After confirming that these orbs could only be purified once the Stone Puppet had refined some Sun's True Fire, Yang Kai relaxed and asked Yang Yan about Qian Yue. He learned that Qian Yue had fit in well with the local cultivators since arriving, and Wu Yi had provided her with abundant cultivation resources and a good environment; she was now in seclusion cultivating.

After a tea, Yang Yan left in high spirits, taking not only the orbs and various ores but even the Stone Puppet itself.

According to her, if Yang Kai hadn't opened the stone residence's restriction she would have burst in earlier to requisition the Stone Puppet's help. With the Stone Puppet at her side, her forging efficiency would be greatly increased, which would significantly aid her grand plan.

When Yang Yan departed, Yang Kai reopened the stone residence's restriction, rubbed the ring Yang Yan had specially forged for him, and smiled slightly. Inside that ring were only two things: a Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform and the Sun's True Essence. Those two items were the most valuable spoils from this trip—if word leaked about either, it would stun Dark Star.

After a while Yang Kai took out a book and his expression turned grave as he pondered silently.

This book had also been obtained from the Corpse Den and belonged to one of the Guyang Sect's tomes. There had been too many such books at the time for Yang Kai to inspect carefully, but when Yang Yan forged the ring to store the Sun's True Essence, Yang Kai casually flipped through some volumes and discovered this particular tome, which piqued his interest.

For this tome did not record any ordinary technique, but a method specifically for tempering the physical body.

Yang Kai's body was far stronger than most peers of the same rank, but this was down to countless chance encounters over the years rather than deliberate cultivation. Dedicated body-tempering and Divine Sense cultivation methods were exceedingly rare; even those that circulated were often trash unworthy of a master's eye, and Yang Kai himself had no interest in them.

He had not expected to find such a manual—the Undying Five Elements Sword—hidden in the Guyang Sect's underground Corpse Den.

At first Yang Kai assumed it was a secret on swordsmanship; upon closer study he discovered it was actually a body-tempering technique.

He had skimmed the method before and understood its profundity and rarity. According to the Undying Five Elements Sword, if one refined the technique to its extreme, the body could reach a state of deathless immortality. After gaining some success in the method, one could even turn one's life blood into the Profound Heaven Five Elements Sword, a weapon of tremendous power against foes.

The prospect stirred Yang Kai deeply, but the prerequisites for practicing the method were harsh beyond measure.

The body's physical strength must at least be more than twice that of cultivators of the same rank in order to withstand the pains and ravages during training; on this Yang Kai felt confident—he believed he met the requirement.

Secondly, one's qi and blood must be exceedingly vigorous, for the method inflicted great injury during practice. If the qi and blood were even slightly lacking, one might die before the art matured, making the attempt futile. Yang Kai thought he passed this test too; though he would not claim to be the strongest in the Star Domain in that regard, his Golden Blood's strangeness left few able to surpass him.

Thirdly, to cultivate the Immortal Five Elements Sword, one must seek out heaven-and-earth treasures aligned with the Five Elements, absorb and refine the energies contained within these treasures, cleanse and transform the body’s meridians and essence, and, after countless years of accumulation, finally achieve mastery of the Immortal Five Elements Sword.

What constituted a heavenly treasure was explained crudely in the Undying Five Elements Sword manual: the required materials for practicing this art must at minimum be equivalent in grade to the Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast.

On Dark Star, this alone would be impossible; a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast equaled a Void King Realm expert, and there were none to be found on Dark Star.

Yang Kai did, however, possess two items that certainly met the conditions: the Sun's True Essence he had just obtained and the Profound Yin Moon Water he had earlier acquired. The Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform also qualified, though Yang Kai had no intention of using that; he had greater plans for it.
