## Chapter 586 — Divine Root Hall

Zhongdu, Yang Family.

The head of the Eight Great Families was located due south of Zhongdu, so the recent invasion of the Cangyun Evil Land did not bring even the slightest harm to the Yang Family. When Yang Kai returned this time, nothing about the entire Yang Family had changed.

The only change was the way the Yang Family treated him.

As if they knew Yang Kai would come back today, the guards in the family all straightened their backs and stared straight ahead with solemn expressions.

No sooner had Yang Kai entered the Yang Family estate than he saw a group of people waiting for him, led by the third youngest of the young generation of the Yang Family, Yang Tie.

“Salutations, Family Head!” Yang Tie suddenly shouted loudly, and the group behind him hastily bowed.

Yang Kai’s expression was strange as he quickly approached and whispered, “Third Brother, what’s all this about?”

“Eldest Uncle ordered us to welcome you here,” Yang Tie quietly replied, “You’re now the head of the Yang Family and should have the bearing and ceremony befitting the Family Head.”

“I’m just the acting Family Head...” Yang Kai said seriously.

“It’s the same.” Yang Tie straightened up again, smiling and loudly announced, “Family Head, please, the elders have been waiting for some time.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, adjusted his expression, and stepped forward.

Behind him, Fourth Master Yang and his wife, along with Di Mo, followed closely. The couple’s faces were radiant with pride.

Yang Kai had become the head of the family, and naturally his parents were proud.

Di Mo was on constant alert, always watching for any movement in the surroundings. As an old demonic master, suspicious by nature, he was somewhat worried that the Yang Family had hurriedly brought Yang Kai back for some ulterior motive.

Led by Yang Tie, Yang Kai and the others soon arrived in front of a grand hall.

Before the hall stood two rows of people, almost forty in total — all elders of the Yang Family. Yang Zhen, and those elders Yang Kai had met before, were among them.

Those elders who once mocked and scoffed at Yang Kai now viewed him with complicated feelings, secretly worrying whether he would come after them. But Yang Kai ignored them completely, walking straight past as if he did not know them at all.

They breathed a sigh of relief.

At the front stood Yang Yinghao, shoulders back and hands folded behind him, exuding a dignified aura without a trace of anger. His eyes shone brightly, locking onto the approaching Yang Kai.

When Yang Kai arrived, everyone saluted in unison: “Salutations, Family Head!”

Yang Kai nodded calmly, suppressing his unease, and walked directly between the two rows of elders with a solemn expression.

Arriving beside Yang Yinghao, Yang Kai cupped his hands and said, “Uncle.”

“Family Head!” Yang Yinghao smiled slightly. “Please come in.”

He then took the lead inside the hall.

Beside him, three Grand Elders of the Yang Family suddenly stepped forward to block Di Mo and Fourth Master Yang with his wife.

“Heh heh, what’s this about?” Di Mo chuckled strangely, his aura gradually turning threatening.

“Forgive us, sir. This is the Yang Family’s core area; no one can enter apart from the Family Heads throughout history. Please wait here,” one of the Grand Elders, at the Transcendent Realm, said coldly.

“That won’t do. I must always accompany Young Master,” Di Mo shook his head slowly, showing no intention to yield.

He had come specifically to protect Yang Kai, and now that others wanted to separate him from Yang Kai, he would never agree.

“Di Mo, you stay here,” Yang Kai looked back and ordered.

“Young Master...” Di Mo hesitated.

Yang Kai shook his head, signaling he was fine.

“Then Young Master, be careful,” Di Mo frowned and warned sternly.

Yang Yinghao’s expression flickered, then he smiled wryly: “Are you worried we would do harm to the Family Head?”

“You can’t judge a man merely by his face,” Di Mo sneered.

“Di Mo, do not be impertinent,” Yang Kai coldly rebuked.

“Yes, sir,” Di Mo quickly replied.

The three Grand Elders exchanged looks, then suddenly laughed and praised Di Mo’s loyalty to the Family Head. “Might we inquire your name? We know of you, yet have never known it.”

Di Mo smiled indifferently. “I go by Di Mo.”

The Grand Elders understood and paid no more mind. One said, “Brother Di, please wait here. The Family Head will come out in a few hours at the soonest, maybe three or five days at the longest. Someone, bring tea!”

Someone hurried off to prepare fragrant tea to entertain Di Mo.

Following Yang Yinghao’s lead, Yang Kai entered the great hall. After a long distance, they reached the door, and Yang Kai muttered, “Divine Root Hall?”

“That’s right, Divine Root Hall,” Yang Yinghao nodded gently. “This is the most important hall of the Yang Family, the foundation of our clan. Except for the Family Heads throughout history, no one is qualified to step inside. Even the Grand Elders of the Yang Family cannot enter here unless specific conditions are met.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. He had heard of this hall before and knew it was a sacred place to the Yang Family, its level of secrecy even surpassing that of the Transformation Dragon Pool, yet he had never known what truths lay within.

“Uncle, I’m only an acting Family Head, and I won’t be managing any of the Yang Family’s affairs. The headship name is nominal — originally attached because the Eight Great Families wanted my estate to help resist the Cangyun Evil Land. Is it really okay for me to enter?” Yang Kai frowned and asked.

“An acting Family Head is still a Family Head,” Yang Yinghao smiled softly. “Rest assured and go inside.”

With that, he reached out and pushed open the doors of the Divine Root Hall.

With a creak, the doors parted, and Yang Kai peered inside. To his surprise, the hall was empty except for a brazier at the front emitting gentle smoke.

Following Yang Yinghao deeper inside, Yang Kai glanced around and noticed some peculiar things.

In each corner of the hall stood four imposing and lifelike stone statues.

Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise — four statues stood at the four corners, faintly connected by some subtle, unseen link.

Yang Yinghao led Yang Kai to the center of the hall, curled a finger, and scratched his fingertip, drawing a line of blood.

With a casual flick, four drops shot out swiftly, accurately landing in the mouths of the four stone statues.

An extraordinary reaction followed. Intricate array patterns glowed on the four stone sculptures, and strange energies poured from their beastly mouths, rapidly converging into the air above.

Yang Kai raised his eyes to see a faintly luminous, pure white light blossom in midair. As the energies from the statues fed into it, the glow grew brighter and larger.

“What you’re about to see is the treatment enjoyed by the Family Heads of the Yang Family’s history, and it is also our clan’s highest secret. I once asked you why every Family Head of the Yang Family could reach beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Now the secret lies before you. Rather than telling you, it’s better you experience it yourself—that is also one of the benefits of becoming head of the Yang Family,” Yang Yinghao explained as he gazed at the glowing light in the sky.

“Uncle, is this appropriate to do?” Yang Kai hesitated.

“What could be inappropriate?” Yang Yinghao lifted an eyebrow.

“If it’s a benefit I take, then when my eldest or second brother comes here, won’t they get nothing?” Yang Kai was worried. Taking a benefit meant bearing responsibility, and he wasn’t willing to be bound to the Yang Family forever.

Yang Yinghao stared at him in disbelief, then smiled wryly, shaking his head. “You have quite the appetite, wanting to take it all yourself. If you had the ability, you wouldn’t have to worry. Take as much as you can, but I don’t think you can take it all. Don’t ask me too much; once you go in, you’ll understand why I say that.”

The more he spoke, the more confused Yang Kai became.

“But remember, there are dangers once inside. If something feels wrong, leave immediately.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

At that moment, the glow in the sky stabilized; the energies no longer poured from the four stone beasts' mouths, and everything returned to calm.

When Yang Kai looked back to the light above, a bright idea sparked in his mind. Suddenly this scene felt familiar, and after some thought, he recalled it.

The sphere of light in the sky now resembled the one he had seen inside the Fengshen Hall.

Inside the Fengshen Hall, the Transcendent Realm experts of the Eight Great Families gathered their divine sense powers to open a mental space accessible only to them, where they sparred in martial skills and comprehended the Dao of Martial Arts. This allowed them to exert themselves fully without worrying about damaging surrounding structures or causing casualties.

Now, the huge light sphere inside the Divine Root Hall was nearly identical in origin and nature.

Subtly, Yang Kai began to sense the secret hidden within.

“You may enter now; release your divine sense,” Yang Yinghao said.

Yang Kai did not hesitate. He unleashed his divine sense and flowed into the light sphere.

Yang Yinghao glanced back at him with a quietly hopeful look.

When he entered years ago, he had received considerable benefits and rose swiftly with no cultivation bottlenecks, advancing step by step beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Among the Yang Family’s generations and generations, perhaps only Yang Kai’s talent was the most extraordinary. Yang Yinghao was sincerely curious about how much Yang Kai could gain inside.

The place contained the precious experiences of countless generations of the Yang Family.

Within the great light sphere, Yang Kai’s spirit body gradually manifested.

Just as when he unintentionally trespassed into the will-space of the eight inside the Fengshen Hall, this realm seemed unlike reality—a purely illusory world.

A swift breeze blew, the sky was an immaculate azure, filled with birdsong and fragrant blossoms, stunningly beautiful.

Around him floated groups of faintly glowing white dots, dancing around Yang Kai.

Curious, Yang Kai studied the dots carefully. Suddenly, his expression turned serious as he stared at them warily.

A loud laugh echoed out, and the white dots quickly scattered, then formed a circle enveloping him completely.

Soon, the dots writhed and shifted, transforming into clear, visible spirit bodies. Each was incredibly powerful, all at the Transcendent Realm, male and female alike. Yet regardless of gender, every one had white hair.
