## Chapter 1811 — Moon Blade

The moment that thought arose, Xu Wei broke out in a cold sweat, and the expression on his face as he looked at Yang Kai turned grave.

His intuition told him Yang Kai was absolutely not simple; from how he had acted at the Medicine Valley in the Lost Realm it was plain to see—if he had been an ordinary martial artist, how could he have withstood a strike from Zi Long?

And now he had easily neutralized his full-force eruption—this brat…

Xu Wei, puzzled and suspicious, swept his Divine Sense over Yang Kai, and his face immediately changed; he cried in alarm, "You… you… you have truly advanced to the Void King Realm!"

"What?" Zi Donglai's face went suddenly ashen; his cold, fierce gaze fixed on Yang Kai as if he wanted to pierce his body and kill him with his eyes.

Void King Realm! That bastard had actually reached the Void King Realm.

He had advanced to the Void King Realm earlier than himself…

Earlier even than Xue Yue, earlier than Gu Jianxin!

In the Star Domain, the three great young prodigies had all been left behind by him; the thought that one day he would surpass Xue Yue and Gu Jianxin and become the leader of the younger generation now seemed absurd.

This bastard had silently achieved the very goal he had fought for so many years.

Unforgivable! In this world, nobody else but himself was allowed to do this… Zi Donglai felt fury burn in his chest as if it would consume him; his face contorted as he yelled, "Xu Wei, what are you standing there for? Kill him at once!"

At his shout, Xu Wei finally snapped out of it; his expression became solemn as he said, "Kid, you are the most talented and also the most terrifying young man I have seen. If it were possible, this old man would like to make your acquaintance, but since the Young Master has given orders, today you will surely die!"

"So much talk." Yang Kai sneered coldly at him and curled his lip in disdain.

Xu Wei snorted coldly, "You just broke through to the Void King Realm; you should be consolidating your realm. Running out here in such haste is courting death. I'll show you what a true Void King Realm is!"

With that he suddenly opened his Domain, instantly enveloping Yang Kai within it.

Xu Wei smiled with pride and strode toward Yang Kai step by step. He said calmly, "Within this Domain Field, I can command everything, including your life!"

"Are you the only one with a Domain Field?" Yang Kai scoffed and reached out, pointing forward. "I have one too!"

An invisible force spread from his fingertip. The surrounding space emitted crisp, cracking sounds, as if something were breaking.

With the sound, Xu Wei seemed as if he had been grievously struck; his already aged face suddenly looked years older. His complexion went pale and he cried in shock, "How is this possible? Your Domain Field… how can it be so solid? How can it suppress the Domain Field this old man has steeped in for years? You only just broke through—this can't be real!"

He roared wildly, unable to accept what he was seeing.

"If longevity alone made one powerful, there would be no difference between geniuses and dullards in this world. Old geezer, accept your fate." Yang Kai waved his hand and his Domain Field spread outward, blasting Xu Wei's Domain Field to powder and instead wrapping the other man inside his own Domain Field.

"Secret Art, Moon Blade!" Yang Kai snapped his fingers in rapid succession; crescent-shaped Space Blades shot out like moons, covering Xu Wei.

These were his improved Space Blades, upgraded after his spatial power had advanced—an enhanced version of his old Space Blade. Though their shape was identical, both the power and the profound intent contained within them were entirely different.

A dozen or so Moon Blades sealed off Xu Wei's escape routes, rapidly drawing larger in his sight.

Xu Wei was terrified beyond composure; he bit the tip of his tongue, spitting a mouthful of Essence-Blood and forcing his Saint Yuan to flee.

Yang Kai shot him a cold smile; his figure shifted and the potency of his Domain Field suddenly intensified.

Xu Wei felt as if a mountain had been pressed upon him; he could barely move as he frantically drove his Saint Yuan, and just as he was about to dodge the Moon Blades, Yang Kai opened his mouth and his tongue unleashed a startling thunder.

"Secret Art, Jingkong Roar!"

Xu Wei felt as though a great mountain had been pressed down upon his entire body, its weight unbearable. He desperately urged his Saint Yuan, barely managing to move his limbs. Just as he was about to dodge the Moon Blade’s strike, Yang Kai suddenly opened his mouth and let out a thunderous shout, his voice booming like rolling thunder.

Sure enough, a blast of sound exploded by Xu Wei's ear; the tone contained the intent of spatial power, shifting between near and far so that Xu Wei could not determine its origin. Hesitation was all it took for the Moon Blades to close in.

"No!" Xu Wei shouted.

The cry cut off abruptly as the dozen or so Moon Blades pierced his body. Xu Wei's form suddenly tore apart into pieces; from those wounds one could clearly see his still-twitching entrails.

Yang Kai watched quietly, raised an eyebrow, and murmured, "Not bad!"

He had intended to test the results of his recent insights, so during the fight with Xu Wei he had gone almost all out, using only the secret techniques he had acquired these past few months.

Whether it was the Exile Art, the Moon Blades, or the Jingkong Roar, these were all skills he had only recently come to understand.

With those three techniques unleashed together, an established Void King Realm like Xu Wei had actually been killed.

One could catch a glimpse of just how difficult it was to guard against spatial secret arts.

Not far off, Zi Donglai was already dumbstruck.

He had never expected Xu Wei to be wiped out in a matter of breaths. Wasn't Xu Wei a Void King Realm? How could he fall so easily? Even if Yang Kai had also advanced to the Void King Realm, he should not be so weak.

Was something wrong somewhere?

Right—Xu Wei had recently had too much of his source power drawn off by the Skybreaking Shuttle, so he had long since lost the true strength of the Void King Realm; that was why Yang Kai had been able to take him down so easily.

Thinking this, Zi Donglai relaxed and his face improved; as long as Yang Kai wasn't too powerful, he was pleased.

"Trying to run? Once you're in my Domain, without my permission you won't get away!" Yang Kai suddenly turned his gaze toward a patch of void and snorted; a pure wave of Divine Sense pierced the void and slammed toward it.

From the empty spot a figure flickered and abruptly appeared, wearing an expression of utmost fear as he gritted his teeth and stared at Yang Kai.

Kong Fa!

When Xu Wei had charged at Yang Kai, Kong Fa had sneaked over under cover of stealth, intending to find an opportunity to rob Yang Kai of his Spatial Ring.

Although Kong Fa was also a Void King Realm, he paled in comparison to the Ghost Ancestor and Zi Long. He knew that if he wanted the Everlasting Tree he would have to use tricks, and Xu Wei's attack on Yang Kai had been a perfect chance.

He never could have imagined that Xu Wei, whom he had known for years and conspired with on many occasions, would be so easily done away with.

The moment he saw Xu Wei's death, Kong Fa broke out in a cold sweat and dared not harbor any further crooked ideas; he retreated quickly.

But within the Domain, Yang Kai's eyes watched all directions and his ears heard everything; he had long sensed Kong Fa's presence and would not allow him to have his way.

A blast of Divine Sense from Yang Kai forced Kong Fa to reveal himself; his face registered even greater shock.

He could feel the overwhelming force of that Divine Sense attack—nothing a newly advanced Void King Realm should possess! It could rival the Second Stage of the Void King Realm or even the Third Stage!

Kong Fa's eye twitched; trapped inside Yang Kai's Domain Field he felt extreme unease and after a long silence he said hoarsely, "Young friend, this old man bears you no ill will. Allow this old man to leave, will you? I promise I won't interfere here again."

"No ill will toward me?" Yang Kai sneered. "Then why did you sneak up here?"

What else could he say? Kong Fa cursed inwardly but could not answer; he forced a wry smile and said, "I was mistaken earlier. But after seeing your godlike methods, I understand this is no place I can remain. I ask only that—"

"You came here—don't think you'll leave." Yang Kai cut him off before he could finish, eyes glittering with cold killing intent. "Since you dared to covet what I have, you must pay the price."

Kong Fa frowned, anger faintly showing on his face. "This old man only seeks safety—can't you grant even that?"

"Stop acting all high and mighty with your age!" Yang Kai's face hardened. "Today you will surely die!"

“Arrogant junior!” Kong Fa roared in fury. He had swallowed his pride and endured humiliation for so long, yet Yang Kai refused to give him even the slightest bit of face — this was far too great an insult!

Although Yang Kai's means of killing Xu Wei had shocked him, Kong Fa also saw that Xu Wei had not been at his peak, which was why he had been so easily finished by Yang Kai.

But Kong Fa considered himself unscathed and a genuine First Stage of the Void King Realm; this insolent brat had just broken through and dared to seek his life—how outrageous.

“Arrogant or not, you can ponder that yourself once you reach the Underworld,” Yang Kai sneered coldly. With a single thought, the power of his Domain Field surged once more.

Hissssss……

In that slice of void, countless fine spatial fissures suddenly appeared, drifting like schools of fish.

At the same time, the aura on Yang Kai surged in a burst.

"Peak of the First Stage? That's impossible!" Kong Fa cried out, nearly biting his tongue.

Previously Yang Kai had not revealed his power fluctuations, so Kong Fa had been unable to assess his strength. Now that he saw it, he almost popped his eyes.

This brat was not a newly advanced Void King Realm at all.

He was clearly at the peak of the First Stage!

After breaking through to the Void King Realm, reaching the peak of a Stage within it was impossible without spending several decades, if not centuries — and that was already the pace of a genius. For those beneath that level, taking a few hundred years was nothing out of the ordinary.

Take himself and Xu Wei for example — after advancing to the Void King Realm back then, they had to seclude themselves for a full century just to stabilize their cultivation. Only after another three hundred years did they finally reach the peak of the First Stage.

This brat had only been gone for a few months and had already reached parity with him?

Kong Fa suddenly felt as if he had wasted all his years; he felt as though his whole life had been lived in vain.
