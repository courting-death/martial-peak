## Chapter 1666 — The Dust Settles

However, in the present circumstances this was good news for the Fire Bird; with those eight chains constraining the Qiantian Thunderflame, the Fire Bird could at least contest it for a time.

The moment Yang Kai appeared on that battlefield, the Qiantian Thunderflame took notice; a bright flash ignited in its huge single eye, gathering into a beam of light that swept toward Yang Kai.

"Another insignificant ant, yet conveniently fit to become nourishment for my power — consider it your honor!"

The Qiantian Thunderflame's voice buzzed, making the very heavens and earth tremble.

A devouring force descended upon Yang Kai; that beam seemed to carry an irresistible tug, intent on swallowing Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

Yang Kai snorted coldly as the power of his Divine Sense surged like a tidal wave.

In the darkness came a crisp cracking sound; the pulling force was torn free by Yang Kai and shattered into nothing.

"An ant dares resist my will — unforgivable!" The Qiantian Thunderflame seemed enraged. A thick, tentacle-like arm swept toward Yang Kai, bearing the momentum of thunderous force.

"Kree!" The Fire Bird cried, spewing a pillar of flame that arrived in an instant to block the tentacle, driving it back.

Yang Kai stood there with an indifferent expression, watching carefully and not in any haste to act.

He still did not know how to deal with such a strange being as the Qiantian Thunderflame.

Now that he was here in Spirit Body while his physical body remained trapped within the volcanic mouth, he could not employ his Saint Yuan to aid the Fire Bird; all he could use was the power of his Divine Sense.

He did not wish to alert the enemy prematurely.

One by one, tentacles swept in from all directions. The Qiantian Thunderflame seemed to perceive Yang Kai's importance to the Fire Bird, and despicably gave up attacking the Fire Bird to focus on Yang Kai instead.

The Fire Bird was forced onto the defensive.

Yang Kai's rash arrival had, it seemed, only worsened the Fire Bird's situation.

The two strange existences once again began their battle, with Yang Kai at the center.

Time flowed bit by bit; the Fire Bird's aura gradually waned, while the Qiantian Thunderflame remained as ferocious as ever, showing no sign of weakening.

"Here, I am the sovereign — you ants must all submit!" the Qiantian Thunderflame's will declared again.

A gleam erupted in Yang Kai's eyes. He could not help but laugh heartily: "So that's how it is!"

Feeling Yang Kai's joy, the Fire Bird's aura was greatly stirred; dazzling radiance flashed across its body as it again tangled with the Qiantian Thunderflame, the two consuming each other's energy.

"I've seen through your trick. Today shall be your death!" Yang Kai shouted low, then suddenly swept his hand forward.

A strange fluctuation of Shi shot out.

A patch of space beside the Qiantian Thunderflame was severed.

That was Spatial Force!

Although Yang Kai's Spirit Body could not draw on his physical body's Saint Yuan, his mastery over Spatial Force was still at his command.

Using Spatial Force, he severed the Qiantian Thunderflame's contact with a certain direction.

The Qiantian Thunderflame froze for a moment; a trace of panic flickered in its huge single eye. It abandoned its attack on the Fire Bird and, instead, launched a frenzied assault on Yang Kai.

"Just as I thought!" Yang Kai laughed — the Thunderflame's action confirmed his suspicion.

Without hesitation he unleashed wave after wave of wondrous Spatial Force from his Spirit Body, spreading outward and arranging another prison around them.

In barely more than ten breaths the prison took form!

The invisible spatial cage severed the Qiantian Thunderflame's links with the outside world, enclosing it together with the Fire Bird.

This cage had no effect on the Fire Bird, but it posed a mortal threat to the Qiantian Thunderflame.

The Qiantian Thunderflame would no longer be able to draw power from the surrounding environment to recover.

Yang Kai observed for a long while and found that the Qiantian Thunderflame had an invisible connection with the surrounding magma and subterranean heat; no matter how much essence the Fire Bird devoured, the Thunderflame could recover quickly.

The Fire Bird, by contrast, had no such advantage!

No wonder — this place was, after all, where the Qiantian Thunderflame had been bound. Having existed here for tens of thousands of years, it naturally knew how to use the environment to create advantage.

The spatial cage carved by Spatial Force instantly shattered that advantage.

“Let’s finish it together — it won’t be able to recover this time!” Yang Kai shouted to the Fire Bird, and his Spirit Body, breaking from its usual stillness, advanced rapidly toward the front.

“Pathetic tricks of mere ants, and you dare think to oppose me? Without the aid of external power, you could never be my match!” Qiantian Thunderflame growled disdainfully.

"Then let's see who's stronger!" Yang Kai sneered, then roared, "World-Ending Demon Eye!"

His left eye suddenly shone with golden light; a vertically narrow, golden pupil appeared.

From that pupil a column of arcane light surged forth, aimed straight at the Qiantian Thunderflame's massive single eye.

The Thunderflame's immense body trembled with a great roar, as if wounded.

The World-Ending Demon Eye inherently possessed the power to purify souls.

The Qiantian Thunderflame had developed intelligence and formed a soul; naturally it would be vulnerable to the World-Ending Demon Eye.

Its giant form twisted as countless tentacle-like arms flailed wildly, seeming intent on collapsing the very space around them.

The Fire Bird lunged, opened its great beak, and bit into the Thunderflame's body.

Visibly, waves of pure power flowed from the Fire Bird's gullet into its body.

The Qiantian Thunderflame's aura rapidly sank.

"I will make you die — you ants have angered me!" it roared, whipping its tentacles back to bind the Fire Bird and fling it far away.

Immediately its single eye turned to Yang Kai; a murderous, annihilating aura descended on him. From that eye a profound light shot forth that could contend with the World-Ending golden radiance, slowly advancing on Yang Kai.

It was easy to imagine that, once that light enveloped Yang Kai, his Spirit Body would be annihilated.

"Bloom, Lotus!" Yang Kai shouted.

At the left golden pupil, a budded lotus suddenly appeared.

The moment the lotus manifested, it trembled and then vanished.

Yet in the Qiantian Thunderflame's perception, the lotus had burst into its Sea of Consciousness.

The lotus, drawing upon his own Divine Soul power as its source, began to devour and absorb madly, slowly unfolding its petals.

For each measure it bloomed, the Thunderflame's soul wilted a degree; when the lotus had opened halfway, the Thunderflame's body reeled like a drunk. Its once-solid corporeal form grew somewhat insubstantial.

Yang Kai's head throbbed as if split open; he could hardly restrain himself and let out a miserable howl.

To counter the Qiantian Thunderflame he had poured out nearly all the power of his Divine Sense in an instant, solely to condense that lotus.

The effect was gratifying. The Thunderflame had been grievously wounded and no longer had the strength to target him.

Anguished roars and pained howls issued from the Thunderflame.

Seizing the opportunity, the Fire Bird broke free from the grip of those several tendrils. It opened its beak wide, and its life-bound artifact furnace slowly emerged.

Under the Fire Bird's frantic urging the furnace spun, and an astonishing suction poured from its mouth.

The Thunderflame, already reeling, could not resist the pull and gradually drifted toward the Refining Furnace.

"No!" the Thunderflame screamed wildly, but to no avail.

The Blooming Lotus secret technique planted in its soul had consumed most of its Divine Sense, leaving it powerless to resist the Fire Bird's assault.

Amid terrible wails, the Qiantian Thunderflame was drawn into the Refining Furnace like a wisp of smoke!

The Fire Bird glanced toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pressed a hand to his forehead and, their gazes meeting, he gave a slight nod that conveyed encouragement.

The Fire Bird beat its wings, became a globe of firelight that wrapped the Refining Furnace, and then sank into the magma below.

Their struggle had not ended!

The next battle would take place within the Refining Furnace — this time on the Fire Bird's home turf, where it would undoubtedly hold the advantage.

Yang Kai was powerless to intervene.

He trusted that when the Fire Bird reemerged it would bring him a surprise.

Turning to look around, Yang Kai did not linger; he immediately left and returned his Spirit Body to his physical form.

Opening his eyes, Yang Kai saw the Stone Puppet's anxious gaze.

He offered it a reassuring look, then quickly took some Spiritual Pills, placed them in his mouth, and closed his eyes to refine them.

Time passed.

The tearing pain in Yang Kai's mind gradually subsided. With a treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus, his Divine Sense recovered unusually fast; in barely a day's time he was out of danger.

Moreover, from this battle Yang Kai discovered that his Divine Sense had actually grown.

This was good news.

A waft of fragrant wind swept from behind, and without even turning his head, Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Congratulations, Senior. Now that Ice Heart Valley stands unrivaled on Chi Lan Star, you’ve essentially become the ruler of this world. Truly a cause for celebration.”

Luo Li's voice came calmly from behind: "I had no wish to rule; all my deeds were merely to settle old scores. If Fire Radiance Sect does not perish, Ice Heart Valley will see many die in the future."

Yang Kai nodded slightly — those words matched Luo Li's disposition.

"But this time we owe you, Young Hero Yang. Had you not tied down the Qiantian Thunderflame, Ice Heart Valley's plans could not have gone so smoothly," Luo Li said gratefully.

"We each took what we needed; no need for thanks, Senior." Yang Kai waved slowly. "By the way, what of the people of Fire Radiance Sect?"

"Above Origin Returning Realm, all were slain. Those below Origin Returning Realm who killed Ice Heart Valley disciples were also slain. The rest... had been stripped of their cultivation and were released," Luo Li replied.

"You are merciful, Senior."

"You want to call it a woman’s soft-heartedness, don’t you?” Luo Li said with a gentle smile.

"I wouldn't dare. What you did has its reasons; I wouldn't presume to judge." Yang Kai beamed.

Luo Li smiled gently: "Say it if you want — what is there to fear? Still, Fire Radiance Sect has tens of thousands of disciples; were we to slaughter them all... Heavens would not allow it."

Yang Kai nodded and fell silent.

Warriors act according to their hearts. Luo Li was not a person given to slaughter; to truly betray her own nature by exterminating Fire Radiance Sect could harm her disposition. Releasing those disciples, though seemingly merciful, matched Luo Li's inner Dao.
