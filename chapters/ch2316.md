## Chapter 2316 — Risking Life to See It Through

“Master Yang, the outcome is already decided. I hope you won’t keep resisting, or you might truly get hurt.” Ke Tian said solemnly, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Oh? So the old man wants to play the whore and still put up a chastity memorial arch?”

Ke Tian’s face darkened. “I’m just offering you some advice.”

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “In that case, I have something to say to you as well, Sir.”

“What?” Ke Tian frowned slightly.

Yang Kai’s gaze turned cold as he said in a deep voice, “If you know what’s good for you, back off now, or else, Sir, you might not be able to preserve your reputation in your old age!”

Ke Tian’s heart skipped a beat at these words. Luo Jin also seemed uneasy, quickly and quietly signaling someone in the crowd.

In the next instant, a burst of sword light erupted from the crowd. Qiu Yu of Tianzhao Palace, sword in hand and body wrapped in light, turned into a streak of rainbow as he slashed toward Yang Kai. This strike seemed capable of shattering the very sky—Qiu Yu was clearly going all out.

Everyone present had their attention drawn by the earlier battle and never expected Qiu Yu to make a move at this moment. Only when they saw that flash of sword light did they suddenly realize—Qiu Yu and Luo Jin had clearly conspired in secret.

Although Qiu Yu was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, this sneak attack was like a thunderbolt. In an instant, he was upon Yang Kai, his momentum unstoppable.

Instead of being alarmed, Yang Kai smiled. “You finally couldn’t hold back, huh?”

“What?” Qiu Yu’s face changed dramatically at these words. Looking up, he saw Yang Kai’s eyes full of mockery, as if he had expected this all along.

“Not good!” Qiu Yu was shocked, his sword trembling as he tried to retreat, but in his haste, how could he possibly make it in time?

Suddenly, a crackling explosion rang out. Multicolored radiance burst from Yang Kai’s body, his entire form swelling in an instant. A pressure far surpassing the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm erupted forth.

Crack—

The lightning chains binding Yang Kai shattered in an instant. Ke Tian trembled all over, staring ahead in shock, involuntarily stumbling back several steps.

“Young Master Qiu, watch out!” Luo Jin shouted.

Qiu Yu’s heart turned cold as ice. He watched helplessly as Yang Kai swung his fist at him.

In this moment of crisis, Qiu Yu twisted his sword, sending out a wave of sword light to shield himself, hoping to escape danger.

Fist wind met sword light with a thunderous crash.

The entire void trembled slightly. The dazzling sword light instantly shattered under the force of the punch, the remaining power crashing toward Qiu Yu.

“How dare you!” A furious shout rang out. The two old men who had been following Qiu Yu, both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, made their moves. One pointed at Yang Kai from a distance, while the other lunged at Qiu Yu, trying to rescue him.

Yang Kai stood firm, ignoring the force of that finger, his fist exploding with power.

A deafening boom sounded as wild energy surged in all directions.

With a muffled groan and the sound of bones breaking, Qiu Yu was sent flying like a ragged sack.

Even though the old man beside him acted quickly to save him, Yang Kai’s punch still left Qiu Yu severely injured, blood spraying in midair, his aura withering.

In that instant, Qiu Yu couldn’t help but recall what Yang Kai had said to him earlier.

“Brother Qiu, your brow is dark and your eyes lack focus; lips cracked, tongue parched, spirit in disarray, with a faint flush upon the face. I fear a blood calamity is close at hand.”

Qiu Yu was filled with grief and indignation, thinking that this bloody disaster had indeed come from this man. He even felt like dying.

Before the thought finished, his head lolled to the side and he completely lost consciousness, his fate unknown.

“Young Master!” The old man holding Qiu Yu turned pale in an instant.

The other old man also stared blankly in that direction, unable to react for a long time. Qiu Yu had struck first, and they had supported him in secret, yet Yang Kai still managed to injure Qiu Yu, leaving them utterly humiliated. They wouldn’t be able to explain themselves to the Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace.

Before the old man could recover, Yang Kai suddenly flashed to his side. The Myriad Sword appeared casually in his hand, sword intent rising, its sword aura humming.

“Myriad Sword’s brilliance, chasing the moon and devouring the wolf.”

The sound of the sword tearing through the air was endless.

Countless sword auras swept in all directions, rampaging wildly.

“Imperial Treasure!” The old man’s eyes narrowed, a flash of terror in their depths. Sensing the Emperor Intent surging from the Myriad Sword, he began to tremble all over.

Under that terrifying Emperor Intent, his cultivation was suppressed by more than thirty percent. With Yang Kai’s close-range sneak attack, how could he possibly dodge?

In this moment of crisis, the old man could only muster all his Origin Qi for defense, retreating with all his might.

Pfft, pfft, pfft—

Blood splattered through the void. The old man was like a lone boat in a stormy sea, on the verge of capsizing at any moment.

Rumble—

A loud crash sounded as the entire hall collapsed, dust flying everywhere. The guests cursed as they scrambled to escape.

When the dust settled, everyone looked around and couldn’t help but gasp.

Yang Kai stood calmly in place, holding the broad Myriad Sword, sword aura swirling around him. His figure was unyielding, his expression cold and severe.

Not far from him, the Tianzhao Palace elder stood covered in blood, gasping for breath and on the verge of collapse, his face ghastly.

The other expert from Tianzhao Palace guarded the gravely injured Qiu Yu. Though unharmed himself, he no longer dared to attack Yang Kai recklessly.

If he made a move, Qiu Yu would be left unprotected, and with Yang Kai’s unpredictable speed, he could take Qiu Yu’s life at any moment.

All the guests looked on in shock and disbelief. Staring at Yang Kai was like facing a towering mountain, the pressure immense.

In that brief moment, Yang Kai had been beset on all sides, surrounded by four Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts, yet he was unscathed and even gravely injured one of them.

Who else could achieve such a feat?

Du Xian, off to the side, twitched at the corner of his mouth and quietly asked Ye Qinghan, “Young Master Yang… is he really at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Or is he some Emperor Realm senior pretending to be weak?”

His words echoed everyone’s thoughts. No Dao Origin Realm cultivator could accomplish such a thing alone, so they all suspected Yang Kai was hiding his true strength.

Ye Qinghan smiled bitterly. “He entered the Four Seasons Land not long ago, and at that time he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. How could he possibly have advanced to the Emperor Realm in such a short time?”

Du Xian thought that made sense. All the cultivators who entered the Four Seasons Land had been personally inspected by experts from the major sects. If Yang Kai had really hidden his cultivation, there was no way he could have fooled those experts’ discerning eyes.

Thinking of this, Du Xian was even more shocked. Compared to Yang Kai, his own strength was a joke. For a moment, his feelings were extremely complicated.

“Yang, we of Tianzhao Palace will remember this debt. One day, we will repay it in full.” The old man holding Qiu Yu glared at Yang Kai, gritting his teeth.

Yang Kai sneered at him. “You were the ones who attacked first, and now you have the nerve to bite back? What are you, some dogs?”

The old man was left speechless, his face flushed. He could only grit his teeth and say to the other old man, “Let’s go!”

With that, the two of them carried the unconscious Qiu Yu and rushed out together.

The City Lord’s mansion’s barrier had been destroyed in the earlier battle, so the two left effortlessly and disappeared in the blink of an eye, clearly eager to return to Tianzhao Palace to heal Qiu Yu.

Seeing them leave so decisively, Luo Jin’s face turned ugly.

Although he had only openly invited Ke Tian to help, he had already made a secret deal with the people from Tianzhao Palace, planning for them to launch a sneak attack. He thought that with four Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts working together, no matter how strong Yang Kai was, he wouldn’t be able to stir up any waves.

Who could have guessed that because of Qiu Yu’s mishap, Tianzhao Palace’s two major helpers would leave just like that?

The situation instantly reverted to just him and Ke Tian facing Yang Kai. Cold sweat beaded on Luo Jin’s forehead, the pressure immense.

Yang Kai made no move to stop the experts from Tianzhao Palace as they departed. He understood well the principle of not pursuing a desperate foe. Right now, the most pressing matter was to force Luo Jin to release Ghost Ancestor and the others—everything else could wait.

So, after the two old men from Tianzhao Palace disappeared, Yang Kai turned to Ke Tian and grinned menacingly. “Old thing, you still aren’t leaving? Believe it or not, I’ll split you in two with a blink of my eye!”

Ke Tian’s expression turned angry.

If anyone else had spoken to him like this before, he would never have let it go and would have taught them a lesson. But since it was Yang Kai, he didn’t have the confidence to get angry.

Not even the Heavenly Thunder Order could do anything to Yang Kai. Ke Tian really couldn’t think of any way to defeat him.

Seeing his shifting expression, Luo Jin quickly said, “Sir Ke, don’t listen to his nonsense. If we join forces, he’s dead for sure!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Then why am I still standing here? Is City Lord Luo’s vision clouded? Maybe check the situation before you speak.”

Luo Jin ignored him and continued to persuade Ke Tian, “Sir Ke, if we can kill this scoundrel today, I’ll give your sect five years’ worth of profits from Tianhe City!”

At this point, he couldn’t care about saving face, openly negotiating with Ke Tian in front of all the guests.

Ke Tian was indeed tempted. Tianhe City was thriving, and five years of profits was no small sum. But when he saw Yang Kai looking at him with a half-smile, his heart began to pound.

Luo Jin gritted his teeth. “Sir Ke, are you going to be stopped by a mere brat? If so, your Martial Dao ends here. You’ll never glimpse a higher realm.”

These words made Ke Tian’s expression tremble. He knew Luo Jin was right—if he hesitated here, today’s events would become a heart demon, hindering his cultivation. He could forget about breaking through to the Emperor Realm, and might even go mad with shame in the future.

With this thought, Ke Tian’s expression grew resolute. He gritted his teeth and shouted, “Fine! Today, I’ll risk my life to accompany you and teach this youngster how to behave!”
