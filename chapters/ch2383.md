## Chapter 2383 — Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill

Yet Yang Kai was a bit puzzled. Ice Heart Pavilion was a place that sold materials, so why would they want to hire an Alchemist? Judging by the material and wear of the wooden sign, it was clear it had been there for quite a few years. In other words, Ice Heart Pavilion had been recruiting Alchemists for a long time.

When Fan Xin led Yang Kai inside, the few female disciples of Ice Heart Pavilion seemed quite surprised. Their beautiful eyes all glanced over at them. These girls were all young maidens, each with delicate features and pure, flawless looks. It seemed they all cultivated the same technique, but their cultivation levels varied greatly. Fan Xin herself was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while these girls hadn’t even reached the Dao Origin Realm. The strongest among them was only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while the others were at the Saint King Realm or even the Saint Realm. Who knew how the Ice Heart Pavilion Master chose her disciples?

“Junior Sister Fan, how many Alchemists does your Ice Heart Pavilion have now?” Yang Kai didn’t pay attention to the girls’ gazes and casually asked.

“We had one, but she was dismissed a few days ago,” Fan Xin replied.

“Dismissed?” Yang Kai was surprised. “Was she not diligent in her alchemy?”

Since they went through the trouble of hiring someone, why dismiss her? Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out.

Fan Xin smiled faintly but didn’t answer this time. Whether there was some hidden reason or it was inconvenient to say, they had already reached the third floor.

Along the way, Yang Kai noticed that Ice Heart Pavilion was filled with materials, and the higher they went, the higher the grade of the materials.

At the corner of the third floor was a room that looked like a secret chamber. After Fan Xin led Yang Kai inside, she said, “Senior Brother Yang, let’s do the test here. There’s no Earth Fire Source on Tongtian Island, so the conditions are a bit simple. Please bear with it.”

“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai waved his hand, noticing that the room was quite spacious, with more than a dozen cauldrons of various sizes placed inside. Each cauldron was at least Dao Origin-Grade, and three of them had even reached Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level.

Ice Heart Pavilion had no Alchemists, yet so many cauldrons were collected here. Clearly, they had been gathered intentionally.

Yang Kai was full of doubts. Logically, since Ice Heart Pavilion sold materials, they could just focus on that. Why insist on hiring high-level Alchemists? And why prepare so many cauldrons? The Pavilion Master was at least a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert and surely didn’t lack cultivation resources. After thinking it over, Yang Kai could only guess that the Pavilion Master wanted to refine some kind of Spiritual Pill, which was why she was seeking high-level Alchemists.

“You can use any of these cauldrons as you like, just don’t damage them,” Fan Xin said, pointing at the cauldrons.

“Understood. But Junior Sister Fan, what kind of Spiritual Pill do you want me to refine?” Yang Kai turned and asked.

“Any Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill will do. Senior Brother, just give me the pill recipe and I’ll fetch the materials for you.”

Yang Kai nodded and pondered for a moment. “Then let’s refine the Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill.”

The Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill was a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill. Its effect was to let a cultivator erupt with greater combat power after taking it, but it had some side effects. Once the medicinal effect wore off, the user would be weak and powerless for two months, unable to use their strength. Not only that, it would also damage the meridians and foundation.

A lower-quality Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill could boost a cultivator’s strength by ten percent, a medium one by twenty percent, and a high-quality one by thirty percent. If it had Pill Patterns, the boost could reach as much as fifty percent.

The Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill was extremely potent. Cultivators below the Dao Origin Realm couldn’t take it; forcing it down would only result in death by explosion. But for those who had reached the Dao Origin Realm, who would be willing to risk their meridians and foundation for a temporary boost? If those were damaged, they might never advance again.

So this Spiritual Pill was basically a chicken rib—useless for most, with little market demand. Only desperate people would keep one or two on hand for emergencies.

Yang Kai listed the materials for the Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill, and Fan Xin memorized them carefully before immediately going to prepare them.

The reason he chose the Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill was because its materials weren’t hard to find. Even on Tongtian Island, they should be available.

Sure enough, not long after, Fan Xin returned with ten sets of materials.

Handing the materials to Yang Kai, she said, “Senior Brother Yang, as long as you can produce two batches of pills, you’ll pass. I’ll wait outside. Just call me when you’re done.”

Ten sets of materials and two batches of pills—this wasn’t a difficult test for a true Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Alchemist. As long as they were careful, it should be no problem.

For Yang Kai, it was even less of an issue.

He could even refine Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills now, let alone Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level ones.

Fan Xin clearly knew that Alchemists shouldn’t be disturbed while refining, so she took the initiative to wait outside.

After she left, Yang Kai took out his Ink Jade Cauldron, placed it in front of him, and activated his Divine Sense Fire to begin refining.

Although it was his first time refining the Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pill, he wasn’t the least bit unfamiliar. His movements were extremely skilled, and his control over the fire and timing of adding materials was perfect.

Very soon, Yang Kai was fully immersed in the process of alchemy.

Just as he was completely focused, the Soul-Severing Blade in his Sea of Consciousness suddenly trembled slightly, jolting him out of his clear-minded state.

His expression didn’t change, and his hands didn’t pause at all, but he began to carefully examine himself.

The Soul-Severing Blade wouldn’t act up for no reason. The only explanation was that something was wrong with him.

He searched himself over and over but still found nothing unusual.

After a while, he suddenly realized—someone was spying on him! He sensed a Divine Sense nearby that didn’t belong to him, which was why the Soul-Severing Blade had reacted.

And for someone of his ability to be unable to detect the spying, it meant the person’s cultivation was far above his own.

The Ice Heart Pavilion Master!

Yang Kai immediately understood who was secretly watching him! In Ice Heart Pavilion, aside from the elusive Pavilion Master, who else could have such ability?

It seemed he’d been mistaken before. He thought that a powerhouse like the Pavilion Master would surely live in the best cave mansion in the inner city, but unexpectedly, she was right here in Ice Heart Pavilion.

The entire Ice Heart Pavilion had six floors. He was on the third floor. The Pavilion Master was most likely on the sixth floor!

Why would such a powerhouse secretly watch him refine pills? And why a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill? What use could it be to her?

Or perhaps... this expert was interested in his alchemy skills?

Yang Kai’s thoughts flashed like lightning, but his hands didn’t stop for a moment.

He had originally planned to refine two batches of pills and then wait for the right time to hand them over to Fan Xin. But now that he knew the Pavilion Master was watching, how could he dare do that?

He quietly altered a spirit array inside the cauldron. Not long after, the cauldron suddenly let out a muffled bang, and a burnt smell wafted out.

Yang Kai showed a dazed expression, then sighed heavily after a while, as if regretting the failure of this batch.

Dumping out the dregs, Yang Kai rested for a moment before starting again.

When Yang Kai left Sangde’s place, night had already fallen. Immersed in his alchemy, he worked straight through until dawn the next day.

When Yang Kai opened the door, Fan Xin, who had been waiting outside, immediately came up to him.

“Fortunately, I didn’t let you down. I produced three batches. Junior Sister Fan, please check them.” Yang Kai handed over three jade bottles, each containing four or five Seven Star Dragon Tiger Pills of varying quality.

This was the normal standard for a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Alchemist.

Fan Xin took the jade bottles, but didn’t even look at them, as if she’d expected the result. She smiled gently and said, “Senior Brother Yang, you’ve passed the test. As long as you’re willing, you can become the Alchemist of our Ice Heart Pavilion.”

“Of course I’m willing!” Yang Kai replied, bracing himself.

He’d come to Ice Heart Pavilion hoping to meet the Pavilion Master and get acquainted, but now that he sensed the complicated situation inside, he wasn’t sure if applying for the Alchemist position was the right move.

But things had come to this, so he could only grit his teeth and agree.

“That’s wonderful!” Fan Xin was overjoyed. “Senior Brother Yang, you don’t know how hard it is to find a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist on Tongtian Island. There are only a few of that level on the whole island, and none of them meet our requirements. Luckily, we found you.”

Yang Kai wanted to ask what requirements the others didn’t meet, but swallowed the question.

He felt sure Fan Xin wouldn’t answer anyway.

“Senior Brother Yang, here’s the thing. If you refine pills for our Ice Heart Pavilion, you’ll get half the profits from all the pills sold.”

“Half?” Yang Kai looked surprised.

He wasn’t dissatisfied—if anything, it was too much!

He didn’t need to prepare materials, just refine pills here, and he’d get half the profits. This was an incredible deal.

“Sixty percent is fine too,” Fan Xin said quickly, thinking he was unhappy with the pay. “And as you’ve seen, we have plenty of materials. As long as you refine pills here, you’ll be able to improve your skills, and becoming an Imperial Alchemist won’t be just a dream.”

That was the truth. Ice Heart Pavilion had plenty of materials, and for an Alchemist to improve, they needed lots of materials to practice with. Any Alchemist who joined Ice Heart Pavilion would probably never want to leave.

“No need, half is fine,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Fan Xin was momentarily stunned, then smiled. “Senior Brother Yang, you’re so generous. So, when can you come to refine pills?”

"Not immediately. Three days from now—well, actually, two days from now—I have something to take care of. Once I’m done, I’ll come over," Yang Kai said.

Fan Xin was a bit disappointed, but didn’t press him. “Of course, Senior Brother Yang’s matters come first. Please be sure to return to Ice Heart Pavilion as soon as you’re done.”
