## Chapter 1646 — A Series of Twists and Turns

“Boy, your courage is commendable, but you have bravery without wisdom! Repent well for your sins in hell! In your next life, don’t even dream of a toad trying to eat swan meat — there are some people far beyond your reach!” Ran Yunting roared, frantically urging her own Shi.

Within each of those crystalline snowflakes was embedded her comprehension of the Martial Dao; her nearly perfected Shi lagged only a hair behind a true Domain — in the Origin Returning Realm it would be unrivaled.

Yang Kai's body was covered in snow.

His aura suddenly plummeted; frost visible to the naked eye crawled across his exposed skin, freezing him...

More and more snowflakes settled onto Yang Kai.

It seemed as if all the world's cold poured into Yang Kai's body.

After two breaths, Yang Kai was frozen into an ice statue, still holding a punching posture, eyes wide with rage, suspended in midair, even a lock of black hair frozen in a backward sweep.

He looked like a work a master had carved with meticulous care.

A few li away, Qing Ya, who had only just steadied herself, looked up and, seeing this scene, was thrown into panic, crying out, "Yang Kai!"

Her voice was filled with grief.

Yang Kai actually couldn't withstand one move from the Great Elder! Was the gap in strength truly that vast? But if he really died here, then Su Yan...

Qing Ya could hardly bear to think further; she froze, her mind in turmoil.

At this moment, she would rather have been the one slain by Bing Die than see Yang Kai fall because of this trouble.

"Kill that traitor!" Ran Yunting, several li away, cast a cold, indifferent glance at Qing Ya, then issued orders to Bing Die not far off, a look of utter loathing in her eyes.

After speaking, she didn't look at Qing Ya again.

To her, Qing Ya's life or death was utterly trivial; as long as it could mend the breach in Su Yan's spirit, she would cut down anyone connected to Su Yan.

Bing Die had been injured by Yang Kai earlier but was not in any mortal danger, so she soon recovered her breath. Hearing the order, she rushed toward Qing Ya without hesitation. Her gaze was ice-cold, Saint Yuan surging within her, a thread of cold qi curling about her body, she looked at Qing Ya with absolute indifference: "Let's see who can save you this time!"

As she spoke, she closed to about five zhang in front of Qing Ya and slapped out a palm.

Qing Ya did not move an inch. She paid no heed to Bing Die's killing blow; she stared blankly at the ice statue of Yang Kai hanging in midair — her eyes saw nothing but that ice sculpture.

Her expression was full of grief and desolation.

Forget it. Since Yang Kai was going to die at the hands of the Great Elder, she would have no face to see Su Yan again. To be buried here along with Yang Kai wasn’t such a bad choice after all—at least on the road to the Yellow Springs, she would have a familiar companion.

Facing Bing Die's finishing blow, Qing Ya slowly closed her eyes, resigned to death.

Bing Die did not relent because of her lack of resistance — to her, the Great Elder's order was absolute.

The disciples of Ice Heart Valley all cried out. No one expected this matter would twist and turn so much, yet end with Qing Ya and that man apparently dead.

Many wore sullen expressions, showing regret.

At that moment, in the ice and snow before Qing Ya, a small head suddenly popped up; the head's angles were distinct as if carved from stone, yet its two black bean-like eyes were bright and lively, sparkling with sentience.

Immediately the small head pulled upward, popping free like pulling a radish and revealing its whole form.

In front of Qing Ya stood a strange creature less than three chi tall.

Clearly no breath of life flowed from it, yet from its nimble movements and quick eyes it was obvious it possessed intelligence and spirit.

It was like a stone puppet!

"What is that..." Bing Die frowned. Suspicious, she looked at the suddenly appearing Stone Puppet before Qing Ya, her thoughts briefly lost.

Then she saw something utterly incredible.

The little Stone Puppet leapt up in place, blocking Qing Ya, swinging an arm a bit disproportionate to its body — rather long — its fist clenched, meeting Bing Die's attack.

There was no fluctuation of energy, yet when that stone puppet’s fist struck out, her icy force was as weak as clay chickens and pottery dogs—completely worthless, shattered in an instant.

In the next moment, a force so huge it made Bing Die despair came crashing in!

Power crushes all skill! Only when one’s strength reaches a certain level can they ignore all elemental attacks—using sheer force to shatter ten thousand techniques!

Bing Die was aghast!

With a cry, she was flung backward again, and this time the injuries she sustained were far worse than when Yang Kai struck her; she collapsed and immediately passed out, her life uncertain.

Many heard the crack of the bones in her arm breaking.

Hiss...

Sounds of shocked inhalation rose from all directions.

Bing Die was an inner-island disciple, a member of the Enforcement Hall, with the cultivation of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

What in the world was that thing that suddenly appeared to defend Qing Ya? With just a light punch it had done this to Bing Die.

Where had it come from?

Even Qing Ya herself was baffled. She bowed her head, staring at the hunchbacked, amiable Stone Puppet standing before her, her beautiful eyes full of confusion.

"What is that!" Ran Yunting, hovering in midair, cast her gaze at the Stone Puppet, her face extremely grave.

Although she couldn’t sense any vitality or energy fluctuations from the Stone Puppet, that strange being still gave her an overwhelming sense of danger—a feeling that in a one-on-one fight, she would stand no chance at all!

Her heart skipped, and she instinctively glanced at the ice-encased Yang Kai.

At that look, Ran Yunting almost screamed.

Yang Kai, whom she believed surely dead, had grinned mockingly at her from within the ice crystal — that smile full of ridicule and scorn.

"A proud Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley, and this is all you can do? Honestly, you're disappointing. If this is your limit, Su Yan really shouldn't be training under you — you have no qualification to continue guiding her!" Yang Kai's voice came from the ice; Ran Yunting looked as if she had seen a ghost, her expression drastically changed.

Below, the Stone Puppet's two black eyes spun as if recalling something, then it suddenly reached up and slapped its chest hard.

Clang, clang...

The tremendous vibration made the nearby Ice Peaks tremble; countless chunks of snow and icicles fell.

Amid the great noise, the Stone Puppet's body suddenly swelled — the figure that had been less than three chi high instantaneously became two zhang tall.

It then turned, hoisted up Qing Ya, whose face showed surprise, and, looking up at Yang Kai with delight, ran away at blinding speed.

On the pure white snow, only a trail of faint smoke remained, stretching far into the distance!

That scene looked just like a notorious bandit chief who, after seizing a bride that pleased him, was rushing back to his mountain stronghold in giddy triumph.

The female disciples of Ice Heart Valley were dumbfounded!

Qing Ya, their Junior Sister... had been snatched by a stone man?

But they soon understood why the Stone Puppet had to leave in such haste.

A horrifying aura suddenly spread from the air. Yang Kai, who should have been frozen, now exuded a shocking aura; the ice crystals around his body cracked with clicking sounds, splitting into countless seams like a spiderweb.

The ice crystal was about to shatter!

Ran Yunting's face changed in alarm; the female disciples of Ice Heart Valley were terrified!

They no longer dared remain and fled en masse to the far distance.

"Delusion!" Ran Yunting roared, and crystalline snowflakes appeared again, covering Yang Kai as if attempting to re-freeze him.

"Break!" Yang Kai bellowed.

Crash...

The ice crystals shattered, bursting into fine powder that scattered through the air.

Shattered along with it was Ran Yunting's Shi!

The flying snow suddenly vanished and was replaced by innumerable spatial rifts roaming the void like black little snakes, chilling to behold, centered on Yang Kai and covering a range of three hundred zhang!

"How is this possible? How is this possible?" Ran Yunting stumbled backwards, staring blindly at Yang Kai's location, utterly unable to accept it.

She had been utterly routed in a contest of Shi with this youth!

She, the Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley, her Shi was nearly perfected — by what merit could this youth suppress her on every front?

Moreover, his Shi contained an extremely strange force.

Not only did it fill the area enveloped by his Shi with countless spatial cracks and deadly traps at every step, but it also interfered with her judgment.

She could not see clearly where Yang Kai was! His position shifted near and far, constantly changing distance from her.

Spatial Force! Ran Yunting's face suddenly went pale.

Only Spatial Force could form so many spatial rifts, and only Spatial Force could distort her judgment about distance.

This youth had cultivated such an esoteric power? And had fused it into his own Shi?

Ran Yunting truly thought she had seen a ghost!

“Die!” Yang Kai’s voice was icy cold. He showed no mercy just because she was Su Yan’s master. With a flick of his Divine Sense, space suddenly solidified, and countless spatial cracks swam forth, pressing in toward Ran Yunting.

“You want me dead? Let’s see if you have the ability!” Ran Yunting shrieked like a madwoman, having completely lost the dignity and bearing a Great Elder should possess. With a furious roar, she suddenly drew out a token from her Spatial Ring and poured her Saint Yuan into it.

The next moment, something extraordinary happened all around!

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; looking around, he discovered the surrounding ice and snow had surged to a terrifying degree, and these frosts had a faint connection with the token in Ran Yunting's hand.

Deep beneath the ground, within the supreme Earth Vein of Icebound Island, Heaven-and-Earth Energy surged and radiated in all directions, springing from ground fissures and merging into the world; through that token it transformed into a force Ran Yunting could wield.

The icy cold gathered like a swimming dragon about Ran Yunting; in only three breaths it had pushed back Yang Kai's Shi.
