## Chapter 1526 — Lingjue Peak

The Void King-Grade Warship eased into view, and everyone gaped in stunned silence.

With almost no pause, it unleashed its Crystal Cannon, and a horrifying ripple of energy spread outward; the Crystal Cannon fixed its aim directly on where Bai Xi stood.

"Yang Kai, how dare you!" Bai Xi's face changed in alarm; he never expected Yang Kai to be so decisive and ruthless.

He had bickered with him and failed to reach an agreement, and now Yang Kai meant to strike without leaving any room to maneuver.

Was he truly not afraid that they might end up perishing together, like fish dying and the net tearing?

"Kill!" Yang Kai barked coldly.

Bai Xi's expression grew frantic as he watched the Crystal Cannon's energy aimed at him swell stronger and stronger; faintly, a pure white column of light seemed about to burst forth. He let out an angry roar, "You brat forced my hand — even if I die, I won't let you go unpunished!"

Saying that, he poured his Saint Yuan into the Extinction Thunder Bead with reckless abandon.

The power of Imperial Might grew even stronger; everyone felt an immense pressure bearing down on them.

Yang Kai's face was grave, Ye Xijun's expression solemn; both of their gazes locked tightly on the Extinction Thunder Bead in Bai Xi's hand.

One by one, rice-grain-sized runes rose from the Extinction Thunder Bead, and as Bai Xi poured in Saint Yuan, tiny arcs of electricity began to appear across the bead.

The arcs were unassuming, yet they undulated with an energy that made hearts tremble — even a single, small arc seemed capable of annihilating a person's soul.

In the next instant, Bai Xi flung the Extinction Thunder Bead upward; it split into two, two into four, four into eight...

In the blink of an eye, the sky swarmed with Extinction Thunder Beads, each bead crackling with arcs of lightning like living things.

Then those arcs all shot forth together, draping over the Void King-Grade Warship.

Yang Kai could tear space itself, and Ye Xijun’s strength was formidable. Bai Xi knew he couldn’t kill either of them in a single strike—so he set his sights on the Void King-Grade Warship instead!

If he could destroy that warship, his aim would be achieved — Yang Kai would be left wailing.

After unleashing the Extinction Thunder Bead, Bai Xi's aura was left extremely weak.

The Imperial Treasure was overwhelmingly powerful, but for a mere Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner to use it required an enormous price; his Saint Yuan had nearly run dry. This was the cost Bai Xi had to pay.

Though he knew death was certain, he laughed wildly.

His laughter soon died away when he discovered that both Yang Kai and Ye Xijun were looking at him with pity, showing no concern for the Void King-Grade Warship at all.

What did that mean? Bai Xi's heart lurched. Realizing something was wrong, he widened his eyes and scanned the Void King-Grade Warship.

The sky was wrapped in thunderous arcs that burst with terrifying force; the proud, invincible Void King-Grade Warship couldn't withstand it — in an instant it was smashed to pieces, scattering and then vanishing into the sky.

Just as when it had first appeared — utterly uncanny.

As if it had never been in that spot at all.

Bai Xi stood stunned, his face drained of color, and blurted, "An illusion?"

“The old man isn’t completely stupid after all!” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

As his laughter rang out, another Void King-Grade Warship materialized in midair — identical to the previous one, but completely intact; the Extinction Thunder Bead had left no trace upon it.

Bai Xi's face went ashen; by now he knew he had been tricked.

The strike he had pinned his hopes on had not hit anything real, merely an illusory warship, which was why it was so easily destroyed!

Ye Xijun's coercion and Yang Kai's pressure had all been to disturb his judgment, preventing him from distinguishing illusion from reality.

But how could an illusion of such a huge warship be formed? How could it deceive his Divine Sense? It was simply unbelievable.

"Old man, it's time to see you off!" Yang Kai coldly ordered; with a snap of his fingers, Golden Blood Threads appeared, bouncing before him, taut and straight like a lethal arrow.

“Leave this to me. I came here this time for the very purpose of cleansing the sect!” Ye Xijun called out sharply.

Yang Kai tilted his head to look at her and gave a slight nod, relinquishing the matter.

He knew Ye Xijun acted in the sect's interest; whether Bai Xi had truly betrayed them or not, he was, after all, a member of Star Emperor Mountain, and if an outsider killed him, others might take issue.

But if Ye Xijun struck, it would be different.

Her purge would be righteous and proper.

Without Saint Yuan, Bai Xi was like a venomous snake whose fangs had been pulled — unable even to wield ordinary Secret Treasures, he was no match for Ye Xijun.

In just a moment, Bai Xi lay dead under Ye Xijun's hand.

"As for the two of you — will you cripple yourselves, or shall I act?" Ye Xijun coldly looked at the two who had come with Bai Xi.

The two men had no stomach left for resistance; they cried out, "Master, we beg your forgiveness! We did not know you were still alive, we were deceived by the traitor. Please spare us!"

"Do you think I will believe such words now?" Ye Xijun remained unmoved.

Since they had followed Bai Xi here, they must have known something of the outside news; having learned of her return and still chosen to oppose her, they must pay the price.

But with Bai Xi dead, Ye Xijun did not wish to exterminate them completely.

"It's all true, we were deceived — please, Sect Master, see reason!" the two cried in terror.

"Fine. Since you're so stubborn, I'll personally send you to meet Bai Xi!" Ye Xijun's expression turned cold as her Saint Yuan surged.

"No! We'll cripple ourselves, we'll cripple ourselves!" Seeing Ye Xijun ready to strike without hearing their explanations, the two had no calm left.

A wretched life was still better than a clean death. Though crippling one’s own cultivation was a miserable fate, it was still preferable to losing one’s life entirely.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others watched like wolves; the two dared not attempt any tricks and obediently shattered their own meridians, dissipating their Saint Yuan, becoming ordinary people who could never again tread the Martial Dao.

"Begone!" Ye Xijun coldly ordered.

The two supported each other and fled in abject terror.

After they left, Ye Xijun turned to the crowd, pondered a moment, and said, "I know some among you may have colluded with that man and served him. But in any case, you did not tarnish the Sect's honor or ruin its foundation, so I will let bygones be bygones. Now that I have returned to cleanse our ancestors' house, I ask you to wait here; after I deal with him, I will speak with you."

"Sect Master, your magnanimity humbles us — we are grateful and wish you swift success!" Yang Xiuzhu bowed and declared.

"May the Sect Master succeed!" the crowd shouted in unison; now was the time to show fealty, and who would be foolish enough to dissent? Even those once swayed by the current Sect Master to serve him were not close confidants like Bai Xi.

The law does not punish the masses—Ye Xijun didn’t wish to take things too far, and these people were more than willing to accept that. After all, their numbers were few, and they had no way to resist the Ye Xijun of today.

"Sect Master, shall we depart?" Ye Xijun looked up at Yang Kai.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded lightly and cast his eyes over the two hundred people, sighing softly.

If they could have helped, things would not be so troublesome; so many experts rushing in together could have overwhelmed the current Sect Master even if he had godlike means.

Alas, these were Star Emperor Mountain disciples; they couldn't turn on their fellow disciples, or else the whole mountain would be punished.

It was an ancestral injunction everyone must obey.

Yang Kai and Ye Xijun's figures receded into the distance, with that Void King-Grade Warship following at a leisurely pace.

Lingjue Peak was the highest summit of Star Emperor Mountain, towering tens of thousands of zhang into the clouds, its mid-slopes shrouded in drifting white clouds and exquisite beauty.

This place honored the Imperial Ancestor and Star Emperor Mountain's ancestors; at the summit sat an altar displaying the plaques of past Sect Masters and elders, and at the top rested a Star Emperor Token.

A Star Emperor Token that had already released its power.

It was the symbol of the Great Emperor!

Every year on a certain day, all of Star Emperor Mountain gathered here for a ritual.

At this moment on Lingjue Peak, two figures stood facing the wind.

One was a vigorous elder who, though advanced in years, had skin as tender as an infant and a ruddy complexion; the other wore a green robe and was a middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man looked anxious, while the elder remained composed.

Dozens of zhang away, a youth stood with his head bowed.

If Yang Kai were here, he would surely recognize two of the three: the middle-aged man was none other than Fang Peng, Sect Master of Leitai Sect, who had indeed come seeking refuge at Star Emperor Mountain.

The youth was Leng Qing, a man Yang Kai had once met.

Back then on the fourth layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland outside Lingxiao Sect, the two had met once; at that time both were Saint King Realm, and now Yang Kai had reached the Origin Returning Realm and Leng Qing had advanced to that realm as well — his cultivation had been astonishingly swift.

Now the youth stood motionless like a fossil, his expression resolute and cold.

Nearby Fang Peng's anxious voice carried: "Brother Tianche, it seems they've already arrived at Star Emperor Mountain — shouldn't we act?"

The elder chuckled: "Brother Fang, do you think we should?"

Fang Peng frowned. "I know not what Brother Tianche intends, but if we do nothing, the situation may already be lost."

"Brother Fang, you worry too much. Whose favor will the tide turn to is still unknown, no need to rush."

"I am dull; pray tell, Brother Tianche, enlighten me."

"It is not that you are dull; only — until I have settled the score with Sister Ye, any action is futile. The decisive factor will be who of us survives; let them brawl however they like, I only need one battle with Sister Ye!"

Fang Peng's brow knit tightly; after a moment's thought he suddenly understood and hesitated, "Then Brother Tianche, how do you rate your chances?"

The elder smiled without answering, his countenance mysterious.

Seeing his expression, Fang Peng's face brightened and his tension eased — though he did not know the elder's backing, the look suggested great confidence.
