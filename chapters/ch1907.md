## Chapter 1907 — Medicine Master Hall

"If Yang Kai insists on this, he must have something to rely on; perhaps he has another set of materials. Just hand the prepared one to Master Zuo De." Long Tianshang's voice echoed from the void.

Hearing that, Ai Ou was taken aback, turned his head to look at Yang Kai, his face full of questioning.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, flipped his wrist, and an inner core appeared in his palm, radiating seven-colored light; the iridescence was actually more vigorous than the inner core Chairman Ai Ou had taken out earlier.

"So he does have one!" they exclaimed; many alchemists gazed greedily at the inner core in Yang Kai's hand.

If the two inner cores were placed side by side, they were almost identical, but...

"Why do I feel this inner core is somewhat different from the one Chairman Ai Ou took out?" someone muttered to himself in puzzlement.

"They are indeed a bit different; though they look the same, there are subtle differences—could this really be the Seven-Colored Stag's inner core?"

"This is the inner core of a variant of the Seven-Colored Stag, not that of a true ancient beast, but that yao did carry a trace of Seven-Colored Stag blood in life," Yang Kai explained with a smile.

The thing had been kept in his spatial ring for many years; it had been obtained years ago when he went to the Imperial Garden, after hunting a variant of the Seven-Colored Stag on the plains outside the Imperial Garden. It had never been of use until today, unexpectedly finding its occasion.

"I see — what a pity," Zong Ao sighed.

"What do you mean by that?" Ai Ou, who had already regarded Yang Kai as one of his own, asked a little nervously upon hearing Zong Ao.

"One of the main materials for refining the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is the inner core of the Seven-Colored Stag. The one on Yang Kai's hand only barely meets the requirement and is not pure, making refining much more difficult. The one you collected earlier, Chairman, though its energy has waned considerably, is a true Seven-Colored Stag inner core; using that to refine would undoubtedly give some advantage," Zong Ao explained.

He was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level alchemist; although he had not personally refined the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, he had proposed the formula and thus had substantial research on it. His words therefore carried authority.

Hearing him, Ai Ou's expression turned somewhat sullen.

"Ha! Thinking to use a defective inner core to contend with an old man? Kid, I advise you to concede now, lest you embarrass yourself later," Zuo De laughed.

"If a defective core isn't enough, how about adding this?" Yang Kai smiled slightly. As he spoke, another item appeared in his palm; the moment it appeared a strange fragrance wafted through the air, and all who breathed it felt their minds clear and many negative emotions swept away.

"A musk gland that pairs with the inner core!" Zong Ao's eyes brightened; he slapped his thigh and laughed, "That's perfect — now you can stand on the same starting line."

Ai Ou was also shaken; knowing that with a musk gland matched to the inner core assisting, Yang Kai's disadvantage would be instantly erased.

Zuo De's face darkened as he spoke: "You even managed to hunt down a variant of the Seven-Colored Stag? Even so, do you truly think your alchemy can beat mine? I'll give you one last chance — concede; you have no chance."

"I, Yang, will also give the Master one last chance; otherwise today's contest will become a stain on your life, tarnishing your reputation," Yang Kai retorted.

"Hmph, words that don't align need no further parley. Since you have materials too, then begin; I will make you accept defeat wholeheartedly!"

Yang Kai turned to Ai Ou, cupped his fist and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, please find a suitable place."

"The Medicine Master Hall is not far from here; let's go there — it has a pure earth-fire to use, and Void King-Grade alchemy furnaces," Ai Ou said, leading the way.

The others hurried to follow; the Origin-Grade alchemists seemed pumped with adrenaline, faces flushed, uncontrollably excited, crowding around Master Zuo De to seize the chance to ask him questions.

Void King-Grade alchemists were not people one could see at will; given today's rare opportunity, how could they not seize it?

Regardless of Zuo De's character, his alchemical skill was indisputable; a few of his pointers years ago had propelled Zhan Yuan to the Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemist. Among the assembled alchemists, many believed their talent better than Zhan Yuan's; if they could receive a few words of instruction from Zuo De, it would benefit them for life.

Perhaps to preserve his reputation, Zuo De accepted every question and thorny problem the alchemists hurled at him, answering each one with meticulous care.

Many reaped great gains and voiced their gratitude.

Only Zong Ao, who had been following Yang Kai, paid no heed to the commotion over there.

That petty, successful Zhan Yuan kept glancing at Yang Kai from time to time, a gloating, mocking smile on his face.

"Master, I recently encountered a problem I don't know how to solve; please advise," Zhan Yuan suddenly asked aloud.

Many alchemists pricked up their ears to hear what Zhan Yuan would ask.

"Oh? What problem? Tell me," Zuo De asked indifferently.

"There is a brat who, having just entered the path of alchemy, wants to compete with me and has vowed to win. I don't know whether I should compete with him — if I agree it would be bullying the weak; if I refuse people would think my skill is lacking. It's a troublesome situation," Zhan Yuan said.

"What's so troublesome? The honor of an alchemist must not be profaned. Give him a severe lesson so he knows the path of alchemy isn't something any cat or dog can dabble in," Zuo De said.

Zhan Yuan immediately looked enlightened, cupped his fists: "I see, thank you for your instruction; I am taught."

Xue Yue, who had been beside Yang Kai, almost exploded with rage; she clenched her silver teeth so hard they clicked in fury.

Yang Kai's place in her heart was incomparable, perhaps surpassing even Ai Ou; now that Zuo De had called Yang Kai 'any cat or dog,' if not for Zuo De's status, Xue Yue would likely have drawn her sword to strike him down at once.

Some Origin-Grade alchemists frowned, displeased by Zuo De's words, for they did not suit his status, yet they could say nothing and pretended not to have heard.

A few Origin-Grade alchemists emitted obsequious laughter.

They moved quickly; within the time it took to burn an incense stick they arrived before a great hall whose surroundings were arrayed with restriction formations. Ai Ou waved them open and led everyone inside.

"Such a dense concentration of fire power," Yang Kai breathed in astonishment; he felt the air saturated with pure, potent fire elements, not much inferior to Lingxiao Sect's Earth Lung Fire Vein.

"This is the Medicine Master Hall in my Shuitian City," Ai Ou explained with a smile. "Beneath this Hall runs an excellent earth-fire vein; the Hengluo Commerce Guild's alchemists all refine pills here."

Yang Kai nodded, immediately understanding why the accompanying alchemists were not at all surprised — they were members of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and frequented this place, long accustomed to it.

"Never seen the world," Zhan Yuan snorted coldly, unwilling to pass up any chance to mock Yang Kai.

"Chairman, what is this about?" An elderly man in an alchemist's robe approached as they entered the Hall and asked in puzzlement.

Ai Ou forced a smile and briefly explained the situation's origin.

"What? Someone is competing in alchemy with Master Zuo De?" the old man exclaimed.

In an instant, within the Hall countless compartment doors flew open and disheveled, filthy, gaunt-faced alchemists who looked like beggars rushed out of their respective alchemy rooms.

Someone burst out shouting, "Where's the Master? Where's the Master?"

Upon seeing Zuo De, the alchemists all fell solemn, kowtowing to the ground and greeting him.

Zuo De returned the gesture, putting on an affable demeanor.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked; he discovered that the alchemists who had rushed out of this Hall numbered no fewer than seventy, each of them at least Saint King-Grade; though their ranks were not high, their numbers were not to be underestimated.

Moreover, this was only the first level of the Hall.

Under Yang Kai's Divine Sense, he sensed there were eight more levels below the Hall!

That meant the entire Hall had nine levels, each populated by alchemists of different ranks refining pills.

The number of alchemists inside a single Hall was likely four to five hundred!

This was one of the Hengluo Commerce Guild's foundations!

These four to five hundred people produced countless spiritual pills for the Hengluo Commerce Guild each year.

For a time, there was great bustle before Zuo De, while Yang Kai's front was deserted, forming a stark contrast.

Upon learning it was Yang Kai who would compete with Zuo De, the uninformed alchemists cast indignant looks at Yang Kai, as if he had profaned something.

To spare Yang Kai embarrassment, Ai Ou waved his hand and led everyone downward.

As Yang Kai sensed, the Hall comprised nine levels; the deeper they went, the stronger the earth-fire force became, and the higher the level of alchemists able to refine within.

With each level they descended, the number of alchemists trailing them increased.

By the time they reached the ninth level, Ai Ou had over five hundred alchemists following him.

This gave Ai Ou a headache; he wanted to send them back to their work but could not bring himself to say so, knowing Zuo De's standing among them and how a Void King-Grade alchemist's refining drew their fascination.

Even if he forced them now, these stubborn alchemists would likely not obey his orders.

He could only let it be and whispered to Yang Kai, "Brother Yang, don't feel pressured. I didn't expect this to blow up. Just treat these guys like cabbages."

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Rest assured, Chairman Ai Ou — these people... are not even worth my notice."

"That's good," Ai Ou breathed a sigh of relief.

"Since we're here, then let's begin!" Zuo De shouted, turning to the hundreds of alchemists with a faint smile. "Fellow practitioners, today I'll be testing my alchemy against this… youngster. There are reasons for it, but if it seems the old are bullying the young, then I hang my head in shame!"
