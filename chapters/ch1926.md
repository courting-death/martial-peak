## Chapter 1926 — Starry Sky Trembles

Over the years, Yang Kai had laid down a Great Space Array across the Star Domain that connected nearly the entire domain into one, making travel back and forth extraordinarily convenient.

In the past year he had toured mountains and waters with his four women, setting foot in the old Zhongdu world, spending time in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land on the Tongxuan Continent, and visiting countless beautiful stars, enjoying the splendour of the whole Star Domain.

That year had been an incredibly full and joyful one for Yang Kai and the four women.

There had been no disputes, no battles, not even cultivation—only mutual care and wandering the Martial World—so everyone forgot all else and cherished what they had before them.

But the day had finally arrived: Yang Kai, with his four women, returned to Lingxiao Sect.

The instant Yang Kai's figure appeared, the Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts who were debating the Dao all turned their heads toward the Space Array.

"That brat's back," Long Tianshang grinned.

"That stinking brat finally deigns to show himself," Chi Yue snorted coldly, clearly displeased.

Ghost Ancestor chuckled: "The Sect Master is enjoying the blessings of many—it's already rare he remembers to return on time; don't expect too much, friends."

Ai Ou transmitted plainly: "Boy, you have three days to tend to trifles; after three days, proceed according to plan."

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he cupped his fists and saluted toward the main peak where the others stood.

Then he turned to the four women and smiled: "I have three more days."

Each of the four women could not help but look a shade dimmer.

Although they had been mentally prepared, when the day truly came none of them could bear it; they were filled with worry for the unknown place Yang Kai was going.

Over the next three days Yang Kai remained at Lingxiao Sect, summoned many senior figures to discuss the sect's development plans, appointed Ye Xijun as acting Sect Master to oversee the entire sect, and promoted Su Yan and Xia Ningshang to elders to assist.

That way, even if he and Ghost Ancestor left Lingxiao Sect, with three First Stage of the Void King Realm experts stationed here, aided by the sect's natural array, the Sect would remain safe unless attacked by a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert.

Yet even if a Third Stage expert did invade, Lingxiao Sect still had the strength to fight.

After arranging all this, Yang Kai finally relaxed.

He also left behind a large number of cultivation methods and secret arts, Spiritual Pills and miraculous medicines, stored on one of Lingxiao Sect's main peaks for the disciples to practise and use.

The three days passed in the blink of an eye.

On that day the whole Lingxiao Sect wore a solemn atmosphere.

Countless disciples left their seclusions and gathered on the plaza, craning their necks to look up at the man who had forged Lingxiao Sect.

Fourth Master Yang and his wife Dong Suzhu had tears in their eyes as they bade Yang Kai farewell.

Su Yan and the other women clustered around Yang Kai and spoke to him one by one.

"If you meet someone over there who can look after you, take them with you; a man away from home should have a woman at his side to put us at ease," Su Yan admonished earnestly.

"Junior Brother, take care of your body; do not force yourself," Xia Ningshang said softly, her eyes reddened.

"However wild you are out there, you must leave a place for us in your heart!" Xue Yue murmured.

"If you dare to court us sisters and then abandon us, next time we meet I will—" Shan Qingluo made a swordlike gesture with two fingers, smiling coquettishly yet threateningly.

Yang Kai gave a dry chuckle, then his expression turned solemn as he said, "While I'm gone, my parents will be in your care."

"Of course—go in peace," Su Yan said solemnly.

"How fortunate I am to have you all!" Yang Kai said, full of feeling.

The four women couldn't help blushing. Shan Qingluo, fanning herself, pouted coquettishly, "Hurry up and go—those elders over there are watching and getting a good laugh at us."

Yang Kai laughed, paid no mind to others' glances, gathered each of the four women into his arms and hugged them fiercely as if to keep their softness and warmth, then turned and shot off into the distance without looking back.

The women all parted their lips, but none of them called out.

"We see off the Sect Master—may the Sect Master win at the first strike and achieve swift success; may the elders' martial fortune flourish and may you all return safely!" Ye Xijun's voice rang out from behind.

At the next moment the entire Lingxiao Sect cried in unison: "We see off the Sect Master—may the Sect Master win at the first strike and achieve swift success; may the elders' martial fortune flourish and may you all return safely!"

Their voices were like dragons, their spirit like rainbows, reverberating through the Nine Heavens.

"I'll take those auspicious words!" Long Tianshang laughed heartily and replied from afar.

Several beams of light shot swiftly into the Starry Sky and vanished in the blink of an eye.

Only then did many people silently shed tears.

......

Somewhere in the Starry Sky a group of seven had come to a stop.

Aside from Yang Kai, the others were all Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts.

For Yang Kai, nearly everyone here was an old acquaintance: Ghost Ancestor and Chi Yue, Ai Ou of course, and Long Tianshang—who, while he and Yang Kai hadn’t crossed blades often, had met on several occasions. The Sword Alliance’s master, Gu Cangyun, was a small, elderly fellow; during Yang Kai’s year with the Sword Alliance they frequently exchanged cultivation experiences. Gu Cangyun was gentle and unassuming, without a trace of arrogance, and had won Yang Kai’s good will.

The two men had a fairly good rapport.

The final person... Yang Kai did not recognize.

Seeing his inquisitive look, Long Tianshang smiled: "Come, Yang Kai, let me introduce you—this is Brother Wudao, the oldest and most powerful Third Stage Void King in the Star Domain!"

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed in surprise: "Are you Lord Wudao?"

Wudao did not look particularly impressive—dressed in a gray robe, white hair and beard, with an otherworldly bearing yet a thin frame; had Long Tianshang not introduced him, Yang Kai would never have guessed this was the legendary Wudao.

Wudao was both a name and a symbol of an era.

Rumour had it he had lived for over five thousand years, witnessed countless great events in the Star Domain, and seen many powers rise and fall.

Though he appeared and disappeared like a dragon, among Void King Realm experts he was unanimously recognised as the foremost.

Yang Kai had first heard the name Wudao on Cuiwei Star.

It had been during the Blood Prison Trial when Yang Kai met a youth called Xu Binbai, who was Wudao's disciple; because of that, Star Lord Luo Hai had shown special favour to Xu Binbai, which demonstrated how great Wudao's renown was.

He was, quite literally, a living fossil of the Star Domain.

What made him all the more rare was that, though his power rivalled the heavens, he lived reclusively and never used force to bully others; his reputation had always been good and many warriors revered him.

"Junior Yang Kai greets Lord Wudao!" Yang Kai said respectfully.

Wudao smiled faintly. "Sect Master Yang, you flatter me. Brother Long's words are nothing but praise—don't take them so seriously. I'm but a man with a tortoise's luck, having lived a bit longer than most; there's nothing remarkable about me. It is Sect Master Yang who discovered a way to peer into the Star Realm and probe the higher Martial Dao, and Wudao admires you greatly. This time, I'll have to trouble Sect Master Yang to lead the way."

Yang Kai hastened to protest and then, casting his eyes around at those present, said, "You have risked life and limb to aid me in opening a path to the Star Realm—I am deeply grateful; please accept my bow!"

He cupped his fist and inclined his body in salute.

Chi Yue laughed: "Don't make this all about you; we agreed for our own sake—once strength reaches Third Stage of the Void King Realm, the only way to breakthrough is to go to the Star Realm. As warriors, who wishes to stand still? Wudao coming himself is the best example."

Wudao gave a wry smile: "Indeed; when Brother Long mentioned this matter, I knew I simply had to come. If I didn't come, I wouldn't have much time left to live!"

Being a Third Stage expert and having lived over five thousand years, Wudao's own lifespan was limited; to advance further he had to break through his cultivation, and going to the Star Realm was his final hope—how could he fail to come?

"That said, I still must thank you all," Yang Kai said, feeling a twinge of guilt since he had not disclosed everything, including the matter of the Star Domain's guardian; but there was no point in speaking of it now, so he did not elaborate.

"Enough idle talk—boy, tell us what to do now," Ai Ou impatiently urged.

"Are you all going to the Star Realm?" Yang Kai asked.

"Uncle Long won't go—he's only come to assist," Ai Ou explained. "My Hengluo Commerce Guild is large and must have someone to stay behind, so this time I'll accompany you."

Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

He had already arranged things at Lingxiao Sect—three Void King Realm experts were stationed there, not to mention the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

If the Hengluo Commerce Guild lacked a Third Stage expert, it would likely be carved up by others within a few years.

"In that case, I'll begin." Yang Kai's face turned stern as he waved, and nine Star Emperor Tokens suddenly flew out.

The nine Star Emperor Tokens had originally been unremarkable; their inner seals had long been used, leaving only a trace of Imperial Might, yet when they all appeared together they emitted a humming sound.

Immediately, lines etched on the tokens began to flicker.

The patterns were intricate and complex, seemingly hiding great mysteries; with no one controlling them, the nine Star Emperor Tokens nonetheless rotated along fixed trajectories.

Gradually one Star Emperor Token fixed in the center while the other eight spread around it, forming a regular Eight-Pointed Array.

From it some tugging force emanated, drawing scattered energies within the Star Domain into the array, causing the tokens' humming to grow louder and their patterns to shine ever more brightly.

At that moment Yang Kai shouted: "Everyone, together now—channel Saint Yuan into it!"

With that he was the first to unleash his power and pour it into the eight-pointed formation.

The others did not lag—some let out long cries, some low shouts, some were silent—but each expelled the strength of a lifetime.

In an instant the Starry Sky trembled within a radius of ten thousand li.
