## Chapter 58 — Recruitment and Threats

Knowing full well that Hu Jiao’er was furious and humiliated, Yang Kai quickly spoke to soothe her, “Miss, there’s no need to take it to heart. Honestly, if one doesn’t look closely, it’s impossible to notice such a detail.”

Hu Jiao’er’s expression turned cold, her murderous intent blazing as she stared at Yang Kai. “So, you did look closely just now?”

Yang Kai coughed a few times, feeling somewhat embarrassed. “I may have glanced a few extra times.”

He thought to himself, How can I be blamed? You yourself were presenting your rear to me—how could I pretend not to see? He felt a bit wronged inside.

“With these doubts, if I still can’t tell that you and Hu Mei’er are two different people, then I might as well have wasted the use of my eyes,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

After her initial anger, Hu Jiao’er thought carefully and was somewhat shocked.

She realized this man named Yang Kai possessed unparalleled insight. From the moment he entered the room to exposing her, no more than the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea had passed, yet he had already uncovered so many suspicious points. Such ability was not common. Moreover, she had personally tried to seduce him earlier but failed. This man’s willpower and character were admirable; he was not swayed by beauty. He was a man of firm resolve.

A talent! Though young and weak in strength, there was no denying he was indeed a talent.

With this thought, Hu Jiao’er’s eyes flickered as she cast a coquettish glance at Yang Kai. “Yang Kai, is it? Since you offended me just now, I’ll give you two choices.”

“What choices?” Yang Kai asked.

“The first choice: whichever hand touched me must be severed, whichever eye looked at me must be gouged out. Only then will I forgive your earlier offense.” Hu Jiao’er smiled the entire time she spoke, her tone gentle as if a wife whispering to her husband, yet beneath her words lay a cruel and bloody resolve.

Yang Kai shook his head. “Let me hear the second choice.”

“Wise,” Hu Jiao’er smiled. “The second choice: leave Lingxiao Pavilion and join my Blood Battle Gang. I will report to my father and secure you a position as a squad leader. As far as I know, you are but a lowly trial disciple in Lingxiao Pavilion, constantly bullied and lacking good cultivation resources. But if you come to Blood Battle Gang, your treatment will be hundreds of times better. How about that? I think my offer is quite generous.”

“Are there any other choices?”

“None!”

“Then I choose neither.” Yang Kai quietly activated his True Yang Technique, watching Hu Jiao’er warily.

“Do you want to force me to act?” Hu Jiao’er sneered.

“I don’t think you would really strike. This is not the Blood Battle Gang’s territory. If even a trace of fighting were to spread, the guarding disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion would come to investigate, and then you would find yourself in trouble.”

“A mere trial disciple, I can kill you if I want. What can Lingxiao Pavilion do to me? At worst, I’ll offer some compensation. I doubt they care about your life or death!”

“If you truly wanted to kill me, you wouldn’t be wasting words with me now.” Yang Kai appeared calm, but inside he was tense. The heart of a woman was like a needle at the bottom of the sea—who could tell what she was truly thinking?

He already regretted speaking so frankly earlier. Women’s words could never be trusted, especially beautiful ones. His experience was still too limited.

“Besides, as I said before, I used my most precious Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment to heal your wounds. You shouldn’t dwell on my offense.”

“One bottle of ointment to make up for what you did to me? You actually…” Hu Jiao’er’s anger flared. She wanted to say that he had both embraced and touched her, but the words caught in her throat. Her loss was great, not something a mere external medicine could compensate.

“If you put it that way, there’s nothing I can do. You know what happened just now—it was you who took the initiative.”

This was like pouring fuel on the fire. Hu Jiao’er was both ashamed and angry, ready to strike. But then she glanced at the spot where Hu Mei’er was imprisoned. Seeing her urgently calling out from inside, her anger softened. Taking a deep breath, she said, “Forget it, I won’t hold it against you this time.”

Yang Kai exhaled deeply. “Thank you for your understanding, Miss.”

Hu Jiao’er chuckled softly. “Actually, everything you said was correct—except for one thing.”

“What is that?” Yang Kai asked.

Hu Jiao’er did not answer immediately but waved her hand. The imprisoned Hu Mei’er gradually appeared. Yang Kai was startled and moved. Though he knew this woman was powerful, he had not expected her strength to be so profound. With a mere wave, she summoned a person—only a master above the True Yuan Realm could accomplish such a feat.

Hu Mei’er was freed and glanced at Yang Kai, her expression relaxing. She had been extremely nervous earlier, fearing her sister would kill Yang Kai in anger.

Looking at her sister, Hu Mei’er couldn’t help but chuckle. She recalled what Yang Kai had said earlier.

Heavens, there really are men in this world who dare to speak to my sister like that—and walk away unscathed.

“Sister!” Hu Mei’er rushed to Hu Jiao’er’s side, acting coquettish. “Don’t be angry. This time, it’s not his fault.”

“I never said I blamed him!” Hu Jiao’er was still somewhat resentful. She turned to Yang Kai. “The one thing you got wrong was that Mei’er and I are not twins.”

“Not twins?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Looking closely, the two women were indeed identical in every way. If he were to meet them again, he would be unable to tell who was who.

“No, I am a few years older than Mei’er,” Hu Jiao’er smiled slightly. Seeing Yang Kai’s astonished expression, she felt somewhat vindicated.

“Truly, the world is full of wonders,” Yang Kai sighed. Though they were sisters, being born years apart yet looking so alike was probably unique in all the world.

“You don’t know me?” Hu Jiao’er asked, puzzled. She was a rising star in the Blood Battle Gang, her reputation well known. How could he not know her?

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head, looking quite ignorant.

Seeing he was not lying, Hu Jiao’er had no choice but to believe him. She naturally did not know of Yang Kai’s recent years of isolation, during which he had no contact with others.

“Did you come to see me for something today?” Hu Mei’er turned to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai explained the purpose of his visit. Hu Mei’er glanced at her sister, seeking approval. Hu Jiao’er waved her hand. “Go ahead, but don’t cause trouble in the mining area.”

“Thank you,” Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief.

“Come, I’ll take you there. The mining area isn’t far from here,” Hu Mei’er said, looking cheerful, her face radiant as she led the way.

After Yang Kai and Hu Mei’er left, Hu Jiao’er slowly rose, her jade hands stroking her firm, rounded hips. She rubbed and compared them, murmuring, “Where is one side bigger than the other? They’re clearly the same! That brat, talking nonsense—how infuriating.”
