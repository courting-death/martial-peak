## Chapter 1156 — Sudden Fortune

Although everyone privately despised Qian Tong, more felt envy—after all, he had seized this prime chance to fatten his purse. The Jubao Tower auction was only held once every two or three years and had been staged on the grounds of major powers; turning such a grand event into a moneymaking opportunity required both timing and discernment.

No one spoke up for Jiang Huai’an. Never mind that Qian Tong had a point—at an auction it was natural to drive up bids for excitement—besides, Yingyue Hall and Sea Hall had their own grudges, so Qian Tong targeting Jiang Huai’an was as much a matter between two factions as anything; the others wouldn’t rashly wade into those muddy waters.

"I know." Wu Yi suddenly murmured.

"Know what?" Yang Kai looked at her and asked.

"I know why Jiang Huai’an would pay such a high price for a single Origin Condensing Pill." Wu Yi pursed her lips and smiled. "He’s the Third Hall Lord of Sea Hall. I’ve heard he has a doted-upon son named Jiang Zhiren, but the boy’s talent is mediocre. Over the years Jiang Huai’an has expended countless heavenly treasures to force his son’s cultivation up to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Unfortunately, Third Stage of the Saint King Realm is all Jiang Zhiren can achieve; without a Origin Condensing Pill he can never breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm. I’ve heard Jiang Huai’an has been buying up Condensing Void Pills everywhere, even gathering several sets of materials for refining them and hiring pill-masters to try, but none succeeded."

"So he absolutely must have this Origin Condensing Pill?" Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. No wonder Qian Tong had been so shamelessly raising the price—he’d simply found Jiang Huai’an’s weak spot and wasn’t afraid Jiang Huai’an wouldn’t buy.

"That seems to be the case. If Sea Hall’s Third Hall Lord is willing to offer such a high sum, he clearly intends it for Jiang Zhiren."

“Still, one should know when to stop. The other side isn’t stupid,” Yang Kai said with a hint of concern. “If Elder Qian keeps pushing the price up, he might just end up with that Origin Condensing Pill stuck in his own hands.” Qian Tong had treated him well, so naturally Yang Kai didn’t wish to see him suffer a loss.

Wu Yi smiled. "What are you afraid of? Didn’t you hear Elder Qian just claim he picked up tens of millions of Saint Crystals? That might have been bragging, but Elder Qian truly has money. By the way, how many did he give you just now?"

"I don’t know." Yang Kai had only just remembered the Spatial Ring he still clenched. Qian Tong had hurried away after handing over the ring and the Origin Condensing Pill auction had immediately begun. Yang Kai had been drawn to the rising and falling chorus of bids below and hadn’t had time to check.

When his Divine Sense checked the Spatial Ring, Yang Kai’s expression froze instantly.

"How many?" Wu Yi saw his face go pale and anxiously asked. For some reason her heart thudded wildly; even Yang Yan craned her neck, waiting for Yang Kai’s answer.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and handed the Spatial Ring to them. "See for yourselves."

Wu Yi took it suspiciously. After using her Divine Sense to probe how many Saint Crystals were inside, she exclaimed and covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes full of shock.

Yang Yan snatched the Spatial Ring and probed in turn; her reaction wasn’t much better than Wu Yi’s.

Three million Upper-Level Saint Crystals. The Spatial Ring Qian Tong had given contained a full three million Upper-Level Saint Crystals! That absurd figure sent Wu Yi and Yang Yan nearly mad with excitement, and even Yang Kai stood there stunned.

He had thought Qian Tong only meant to hint—two or three hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals would have been generous. He hadn’t expected ten times that amount. No wonder Qian Tong had said that, as long as they didn't buy anything too extravagant, those Saint Crystals should be plenty for them.

Three million—what could that buy?

"Looks like Elder Qian really did pick up tens of millions of Saint Crystals; he wasn’t merely boasting." Yang Kai’s expression was odd. He understood these Saint Crystals were tolls Qian Tong had collected, but he hadn’t expected Qian Tong to be so bold—collecting tens of millions in tolls. This three million might be only a tenth or less of the total.

Wu Yi glanced cautiously at the two disciples from Yingyue Hall, then leaned close to Yang Kai and hissed, "Do not curry favor needlessly...be careful."

Yang Kai snorted. "Afraid of what? I deserve a good share of that toll—without me Elder Qian couldn’t have collected so many Saint Crystals. We can take this three million with a clear conscience. Don’t worry about it."

"That’s best." Wu Yi still looked a little worried.

While the others were speaking, Qian Tong and Jiang Huaian had already been trading barbs for quite some time. Seeing that they still showed no sign of stopping, Yan Pei — sipping tea in one of the A-Class private rooms — finally lost his patience. With a cold snort, he said, “Are you two finished yet? Everyone’s waiting for the auction to proceed. If you really can’t stand each other, go outside and fight it out — what’s the point of this useless bickering? Don’t delay Jubao Tower’s business!”

When the Jubao Tower steward spoke, Qian Tong and Jiang Huai’an finally quieted. You could be rude to others, but not to Jubao Tower—otherwise you’d be banned from future auctions, which would be a huge loss; many priceless items on Dark Star were brought out by Jubao Tower for auction.

Qian Tong chuckled slyly and said, “I just can’t stand how stingy some people can be. Forget it—no point talking more. What’s meant to be whose will still end up theirs. So then, young lady, what was the last bid on the Origin Condensing Pill?”

The beautiful auctioneer pursed her lips and smiled. "Elder Qian, Hall Lord Jiang has bid nine hundred thousand."

"Nine hundred thousand—quite a sum, tsk tsk...enough to buy three Condensing Void Pills." Qian Tong clicked his tongue.

No sooner had Qian Tong finished speaking than the sound of a chair being crushed came from Jiang Huai’an’s private room; the Sea Hall Third Hall Lord clearly wanted to tear Qian Tong limb from limb. Qian Tong had raised the price, and now he was speaking mockingly—he wouldn’t stop until Jiang Huai’an was furious.

Qian Tong raised his voice again: "One million!"

The hall erupted once more. After three hours of auctioning, an item finally reached a value of one million. Everyone knew this far exceeded market price, but this was an auction—people fought, and the price climbed.

Sounds of objects shattering rang again from the A-10 Room belonging to Sea Hall.

Qian Tong laughed. "Jiang Huai’an, don't say I don't accommodate you. We’ve known each other for years; now to fight over a Origin Condensing Pill so others will laugh at us is unbecoming. This is my last raise—if you can outbid me, I’ll willingly let the pill go to you."

"One million and ten thousand!" Even knowing Qian Tong was baiting him, Jiang Huai’an had to raise the bid.

By this point the matter was no longer merely about the pill but about face. Besides, he had invested so much trying to secure a Origin Condensing Pill—materials he’d gathered over the years, many destroyed in refining, had cost nearly a million Saint Crystals. Now that a ready-made pill lay before him, he naturally had to seize it.

What sickened Jiang Huai’an was that he’d clearly spent several times the actual value to obtain this Origin Condensing Pill, but to onlookers it would seem Qian Tong had let it slide to him. If this weren’t a Jubao Tower auction, if this weren’t Tianyun City, Jiang Huai’an would have gone down to find Qian Tong for a death match.

It was simply too much to bear!

After the bid of one million and ten thousand was called out, no one raised the price further, and Qian Tong also fell silent. The beautiful auctioneer quickly stepped forward, calling out three times, and in the end, that Origin Condensing Pill was won by Jiang Huaian.

If Qian Tong hadn’t padded things with the three million Saint Crystals he’d given them, Yang Kai and the others would have been thrilled at the extra million. But with three million already in hand plus this extra million, the three of them remained calm—when money reaches a certain amount it becomes a jumble of digits.

That didn’t dampen their interest in the other lots. Yang Kai was eager to see how much his other Origin Condensing Pill might fetch, and Yang Yan’s Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure would surely be valuable as well.

The auction had now reached its latter half.

Starting from the appearance of the Origin Condensing Pill, the items Jubao Tower unveiled in the second half were notably different—both in rank and quality—and the prices naturally climbed steadily.

By now most of the martial artists seated in the main hall had lost their eligibility to bid; all the active bidding came from those in private rooms—those in the hall were mere spectators.

Nearly every lot sold for at least two to three hundred thousand; a few fine pieces broke the million mark. Yang Kai again marveled that Dark Star harbored so many wealthy individuals—ordinary folk just never saw them. Jubao Tower’s auctions gathered these rich together.

With three million Saint Crystals now in hand and another million unpaid, Yang Yan and Wu Yi were eager to bid. Yang Yan, being an Origin-Grade artificer, wouldn’t buy Secret Treasures; she had intended to buy pills but Yang Kai stopped them.

Yang Kai, a pill-master himself, wasn’t about to let them waste money.

Yang Yan ended up buying only precious raw materials for setting arrays and forging, nothing extravagant.

A chunk of star-iron the size of a human head cost two hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystals; ten pieces of high-quality Qingling wood cost three hundred and seventy thousand; some ninth-tier demonic-beast body parts and inner cores neared a million. Three million Saint Crystals shrank fast.

Yang Kai hadn’t bid because he hadn’t seen anything he wanted.

It wasn’t until a pitted, uneven stone — odd-shaped and roughly the size of a washbasin, with no discernible quality or origin — appeared at the auction that Yang Kai finally made a purchase, buying it for the base price of one hundred fifty thousand.

According to the auctioneer, even the appraisal masters of Jubao Tower couldn’t determine the origin of the strange stone, and some artificers had tried to melt it down—but none had succeeded.

Countless masters in the auction hall had also probed it with their Divine Sense and found nothing—nearly making it the first lot to go unsold.

Because no one knew what it was, yet if artificers couldn’t melt it, it clearly wasn’t ordinary; thus Jubao Tower set the starting price fairly high.

At the last moment Yang Kai lazily called out the starting bid and it sold with ease.
