## Chapter 1374 — Spirit Storage Pearl

In the auction hall, a middle-aged man dressed like a scholar strolled up to the high platform; the beams cast from the strange light stones around him fell across his figure, making him appear singularly poised. In his hand he held a paper fan, which only enhanced his jaunty elegance.

The man naturally had rosy lips and white teeth, and the slight creases at the corners of his eyes did not make him look old but rather lent him a seasoned, composed maturity. Seeing him now gave people a dreamlike, unreal feeling. At the very least, many of the young women and married ladies attending the auction could not hide their fascination; their hearts secretly surrendered.

By contrast, several martial artists who recognized the middle-aged man's identity fell silent, their faces darkening.

A stream of low voices and whispered gossip rose up.

“Damn it, it’s that young black-faced bastard hosting the auction this time—what the hell is Jubao Tower thinking?”

"We're done for, done for, we've fallen into a trap again."

"I knew Jubao Tower wouldn't act out of goodwill. I just didn't expect this fellow to show his face; hasn't he been out of the public eye for over ten years?"

"……"

Those comments were numerous and varied. Though quiet, the cultivators attending the auction were by no means weak and heard everything clearly. The middle-aged scholar, who had been dubbed 'young black-faced', showed no anger; instead he smiled warmly, as if utterly unconcerned by their criticisms. The young women who had been enchanted by him, however, glanced about fiercely with beautiful eyes, ready to defend him.

"Young black-faced?" In private room B-13, Yang Kai narrowed his brow. He pondered aloud, "Does this man have any connection to Old Master Yan?"

Since Yan Pei is the original black-faced figure, this man must have some relationship with Yan Pei to be called the young black-faced; Yang Kai, however, could not understand why the cultivators below treated him with such caution, as if he were a tiger to be feared.

Yang Yan also turned an inquiring look to the nearby young woman, hoping for an explanation.

Qing’er pressed her lips together, looking as though she wanted to laugh but didn’t dare lose her composure. After some effort, she managed to hold it back and softly said, “In answer to the two Elders, that man, Ren Tianrui, is one of Jubao Tower’s auctioneers. Elder Yan is his master—so everyone calls him…”

Qing'er fell silent, not daring to speak further. Nicknames like 'young black-faced' or 'old black-faced' were harmless to call out, and although merely sobriquets, they were reputations that Yan Pei and Ren Tianrui had earned through their own deeds. As a member of Jubao Tower, the young woman naturally dared not gossip about the tower's seniors behind their backs; were anyone to know, she would certainly not escape the consequences.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and nodded, "I see. Understood."

It seemed this Ren Tianrui had indeed received Yan Pei's true teachings; otherwise he would not have been addressed in such a manner. If he took part in any bidding later, one would have to be a bit careful.

On the high platform, Ren Tianrui's face carried a warm smile as he cupped a fist in greeting and loudly proclaimed, "Friends who have traveled from afar, thank you for braving the journey to attend this Jubao Tower auction. Jubao Tower is much obliged. This auction will be presided over by me, Ren; if there are any shortcomings, please grant your understanding."

His words were impeccably proper, leaving no room for fault. Regardless of how he presided over the proceedings, at the very least this opening had already won the goodwill of many.

Ren Tianrui continued, "To tell the truth, this auction was originally to be personally hosted by my master…"

Once those words fell, many faces in the hall altered. People reflexively clenched their Spatial Rings and watched the platform with guarded expressions, as if afraid Old Master Yan might suddenly leap out from some corner.

Ren Tianrui flashed a slight smile and added, "But this junior believes my master is advanced in years and should remain behind the scenes; let us younger folk take the stage for occasions like this."

"Well said!" a chorus of approval rose from below.

"Brother Ren has guts and boldness!"

"Let Old Master Yan remain forever behind the scenes!"

A burst of laughter followed.

Ren Tianrui laughed and glanced toward a certain spot in the hall, nodding, "That is precisely my intention. After this auction concludes, I shall persuade my master to enjoy his retirement and not toil so hard."

Though the remark bordered on audacious, it undeniably struck a chord and quickly won many over; the earlier wariness melted away as people felt fortunate he stood there to preside.

"He's not simple," Yang Kai murmured, eyes narrowing as he regarded Ren Tianrui. With only a few words he had woven himself into the crowd. That brief opening had already established sufficient auction capital; when bidding commenced, even if he set a higher price, few would balk.

This Ren Tianrui was well versed in human nature—no wonder he was dubbed the young black-faced. His hosting style, however, seemed markedly different from Yan Pei's, which was rather intriguing.

"Enough idle talk, many friends are surely anxious; let this auction begin!" Ren slapped his folding fan once, pivoted, and made a signal behind him.

A woman in palace-style robes, smiling gracefully, stepped up onto the platform. Upon her jade-like arm rested a jade tray; she set it down before Ren Tianrui and stood still.

Though the woman was attractive, with spring at the corners of her eyes, few glanced at her—everyone's attention had already been drawn to the jade tray she carried.

The thing on that tray was, of course, the first lot, but it was covered with red cloth, concealing its form. Many attending the auction craned their necks impatiently to peer.

Ren Tianrui read the room and played coy in a restrained way: "By auction custom, though the first lot may not be comparable to the finale, it is far from ordinary. If you have interest, be certain to secure it—miss this and you'll regret it for life!"

Saying this, he drew back the red cloth. Immediately a colorless, egg-sized round pearl appeared before the crowd. It looked transparent, but within it swam strange filaments like little fish darting about. Stranger still, the pearl gave off no energy fluctuation; it seemed nothing more than an ornamental curiosity, devoid of practical value.

"What is this?"

"Never seen anything like it!"

"If Jubao Tower dares to put this out as the first lot, then there must be something special about it—let Mr. Ren explain."

…

"Spirit Storage Pearl?" In Private Room B-13, Yang Yan's eyes brightened as she blurted the name of the first lot.

Yang Kai gave her a sidelong glance, unsurprised. He suspected there was little Yang Yan did not recognize; otherwise he would not have brought only her along to the auction.

Yang Kai did not bother to ask what the Spirit Storage Pearl did, knowing Ren Tianrui would surely demonstrate and explain.

On the platform, Ren reached out and took the pearl, holding it aloft for all to see. He said nothing; instead he stirred his Saint Yuan and violently poured it inward. Under the watchful gazes of the crowd, the colorless orb seemed a bottomless pit, swallowing up every scrap of Saint Yuan he forced into it.

As time passed the pearl began to emit a faint glow, and then a ripple of Saint Yuan identical to Ren Tianrui's own radiated outward from the pearl.

After a moment, Ren stopped his motion, smiled oddly, and silently cued his technique once more.

To everyone's astonishment, the Saint Yuan that had been swallowed by the pearl returned to Ren Tianrui's body. His expression betrayed no discomfort or ill effect.

In an instant the pearl resumed its original transparent state, but inside there was no longer any energy fluctuation.

The entire process had been witnessed by all; by now, ninety-nine percent of the cultivators present had formed a rough conjecture about the pearl's function, and they stared at the platform with excited expressions.

Ren Tianrui chuckled and announced loudly, "I dare say most of you already suspect the purpose of this Spirit Storage Pearl. Indeed, it can store a martial artist's Saint Yuan and return it to the body when needed, supplying the fighter with combat energy. Everyone here has engaged in combat and knows that replenishing Saint Yuan usually relies on taking pills or drawing energy from Saint Crystals; both methods act slowly. This pearl, however, can restore a drained Saint Yuan to its peak in a very short time—provided the pearl contains sufficient stored energy."

Once he had explained, the hall burst into uproar. Though people had guessed, Ren's detailed account made them realize they had underestimated the pearl's worth.

If that were true, then this pearl was equivalent to a second life!

Many cultivators perished because their Saint Yuan failed them in battle; with a Spirit Storage Pearl to replenish their Saint Yuan they could turn defeat into victory.

A multitude of hungry eyes turned to the platform, filled with greed and possessiveness. Were it not for the dozens of masters placed in and around the hall by Jubao Tower to maintain order, someone would surely risk everything to seize it.

Even Yang Kai in Private Room B-13 showed a flicker of interest on his face.

An item like this verged on the miraculous; even with his means he could not treat it lightly, let alone others.

Yet it held no use for him—Yang Kai had never suffered a shortage of Saint Yuan—so the notion passed in a flash and left him unmoved as he watched. After all, such a rare treasure would fetch an exorbitant price at auction; though he had brought seventy million Saint Crystal with him, he could not be certain he could win every item he desired. To spend those crystals now and later find funds lacking would be a poor trade.
