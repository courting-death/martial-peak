## Chapter 316 — Yielded?

A light, ethereal sensation enveloped him, as the lovely Yunli's long, slender fingers seemed to carry a mystical force, dispersing the exhaustion within Yang Kai’s body and mind, urging him to relax wholly and feel an extreme comfort.

The comforts of tenderness and the graveyards of heroes—there was no falsehood in that saying.

Yang Kai remained at ease, closing his eyes to savor this intoxicating sensation.

He was not a man given to affectation. With Shan Qingluo having dispatched Yunli, Ruoyu, and Ruoqing to attend to him and clearly stating she would satisfy any of his requests, Yang Kai understood that as long as he wished, he could indulge in any whim with these three women.

Of the three, one was mature and voluptuous, another gentle and serene, and the last elegant and dignified; each had her own charm, yet all possessed the same alluring quality that attracted men.

Now, with the lovely woman proactively attending to him, there was no need for Yang Kai to refuse; to do so would only appear self-conscious and pretentious.

The room fell into a tranquil silence. Yang Kai did not speak, and the lovely woman Yunli remained quiet as well, focused solely on her ministrations.

As time passed, Yang Kai could clearly sense the lovely woman behind him, who was half-kneeling, breathing slightly heavier. The warmth of her body gradually increased, and her breaths became soft and delicate, while the heartbeat within her chest quickened.

He could not tell whether it was intentional or accidental, but as she massaged him, that voluptuous and elastic bosom occasionally brushed against his back, coming close and retreating in tandem.

Two cherry-like peaks grazed his spine, sending waves of sharp sensations through him.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered in surprise, his mood becoming slightly strange.

Could it be that this lovely woman Yunli was truly, as Biluo suggested, lonely and eager for companionship? Was this the moment she felt like a wolf starving for a hunt, feeling desolate and mournful? 

Otherwise, how could there be such an intense reaction?

The lovely woman’s unusual response stirred some tumult within Yang Kai’s heart.

To be honest, Yunli was not very old herself, scarcely reaching the age of twenty-five. While not precisely in the bloom of youth, it was nonetheless a beautiful time in one’s life.

The most important factor was that she possessed a maturity in both body and mind greater than that of those younger women; should something occur between them, she would not entangle him with complications.

She had been married a decade ago, yet her husband had been dead within a month, leaving her in a solitary plight for ten long years.

Ten years prior, she had been merely fifteen. Having tasted such wonders, after so long without any new encounters, it was understandable for her emotions to stir.

Seemingly aware of Yang Kai’s reaction, the lovely woman Yunli flashed a soft smile, deliberately distancing herself from him a little, and gently said, “Young Master, Miss Biluo should arrive shortly.”

“En.” Acknowledging that she was reminding him, Yang Kai simply nodded and chose not to speak further.

The lovely woman looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, not expecting him to be so easygoing. She could not help feeling a trace of disappointment within her heart.

Moments later, a sound of Biluo’s teeth grinding and cursing echoed from outside the loft, as though she had been startled from a critical moment in her cultivation by Ruoyu and Ruoqing, yet under Shan Qingluo’s command, she had no choice but to hurry over, full of displeasure and frustration.

“Yang Kai!” Upon reaching the loft, Biluo stood with her hands on her waist, tilting her chin defiantly.

Yang Kai stood up and approached the window, leaping down effortlessly, landing steadily before her.

“Women should behave like women; why act so fierce?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Mind your own business!” Biluo snapped, her silver teeth gritted as she glared at Yang Kai, indignantly saying, “Don't think that just because you pleased me last time, I won't dislike you anymore. Let me tell you, if it weren't for Lord's orders, I wouldn't give you the time of day.”

“Then give me back that item!” Yang Kai said earnestly, extending his hand.

“What item?” Biluo asked in surprise.

“That pair of earrings.”

Biluo quickly took several steps back, looking at Yang Kai incredulously, her face twisted in distress, “You can’t be serious?”

“I have no use for flattering you; why should I flatter you? Just return it!” Yang Kai replied with a cold expression.

“Hey, hey, hey, are you still a man?” Biluo was momentarily stunned and retorted sarcastically, “Once something is given away, it’s as good as spilled water; how can you demand it back? You’re too petty!”

“That’s just your ignorance!” Yang Kai scoffed, “Who said gifts can’t be reclaimed?”

“I said so!” Biluo raised her delicate neck defiantly, “I won’t give it back! I wouldn’t even return it if you killed me! You gave it to me of your own accord. Once it’s in my hands, it’s mine!”

“Will you give it back or not?”

“No!” 

“Fine!” Yang Kai nodded, striding toward the exit.

“What are you doing?” Biluo sensed something was off and quickly moved to block his path.

“I’m going to tell your Lord that you stole a secret treasure from her treasure vault!” Yang Kai provocatively glared at her, smirking coldly.

“You... you...” Biluo staggered back a few steps, a finger trembling as she pointed at Yang Kai, her face flushed with rage, “How can you be so shameless and despicable? That was clearly something you took from the treasure vault and threw to me. You even said that day...”

“I didn’t say anything that day!” Yang Kai interjected, a smug smile gracing his lips.

Little girl, you’re still too naive; did you really think I was so kind-hearted as to gift you something?

“And besides, that day, I took nothing but two bottles of pills,” Yang Kai calmly added.

“Don’t be so unreasonable!” Biluo sulked completely, finally understanding what it means to owe a debt after feasting. Although she wished to shred Yang Kai into pieces for her humiliation, she put on a pitiful expression.

With tear-filled eyes, she looked at Yang Kai, her voice almost breaking, “You’re not that kind of person, are you? I was rude before, but I sincerely apologize. Can you bear to see me misunderstood by the Lord and then punished?”

Biluo gazed at him with a pitiful look, her eyes reddening as she played her role of the wronged.

Yang Kai was completely unmoved, his face cold as he stated, “Sorry, I am indeed that shameless and ruthless person, and... especially vengeful, so provoking me is definitely not a wise choice.”

“You... I’ll remember this!” Biluo finally dropped her soft act, her patience waning, and gritted her teeth, demanding, “What do you want?”

“I don’t want anything; I’m simply bored and plan to talk to your Lord!” 

Biluo’s True Yuan surged violently, gazing at Yang Kai with a menacing glare, seemingly unable to hold back from teaching him a lesson.

Yang Kai remained calm, chuckling lightly. Biluo’s cultivation at the True Yuan Realm Seventh Stage was not something he felt threatened by. If she dared to attack here, it would provide the perfect excuse for him to create a ruckus in front of Shan Qingluo, thereby freeing himself from this enchantress’s restraints.

The two faced off for a moment, until Biluo’s momentum suddenly crumbled, and she weakly said, “State your conditions; this lady has conceded!”

Having received a gift for the first time in her life, Biluo thought it had become a fatal hindrance!

From now on, she'd never accept gifts from anyone again, especially men! Biluo felt her tender heart deeply wounded, overshadowed by an indelible shadow.

“Either show me some respect, or return the item,” Yang Kai said leisurely.

“I understand!” Biluo replied feebly, “What more?”

“I’m going out to stroll; you’ll accompany me.”

“Okay.”

“Now, that’s more like it!” Yang Kai laughed heartily as they left.

As the two departed, the lovely woman Yunli and the two girls Ruoyu and Ruoqing were left in stunned disbelief, gazing at their retreating figures.

The lady Biluo... yielded?

In Piaoxiang City, Biluo was known to fear nothing; aside from Shan Qingluo, there had never been anyone capable of rendering her so obedient. But now, this mysterious man Yang Kai had somehow made her yield?

The lovely woman and the two girls felt an overwhelming sense of disbelief, left utterly speechless.

“By the way, did Shan Qingluo mention I can buy anything with her footing the bill?” Yang Kai suddenly asked as they exited the palace and stepped onto the street.

“En.” Biluo, lacking in spirit, simply nodded.

Suddenly recalling something, she angrily said, “How dare you refer to Lord by her name!”

Before she could finish, Yang Kai lightly tapped her mouth.

“In front of your Lord, I dare to call her that; she has no objections, so what are you, a little girl, chattering about?”

“You...” Biluo bared her teeth, “I warn you; don’t take things too far!”

Ignoring her, Yang Kai continued walking, feeling the weight of a resentful gaze boring into his back from behind.

After wandering within the city for a while, they arrived at a pharmacy.

This was a well-respected establishment in Piaoxiang City, and as the two stepped in, the shopkeeper rushed out from behind the counter, bowing repeatedly before Biluo, a sheen of cold sweat appearing on his forehead. “Miss Biluo, your esteemed self graces this place; forgive us for not welcoming you adequately!”

With this cry, the shop's assistants tumbled over each other in their haste, while the customers fled like scared rabbits, leaving only the shopkeeper behind.

Yang Kai stared at this scene in astonishment, realizing that Biluo’s reputation in Piaoxiang City was likely not very respectable.

“En.” Biluo responded coolly.

“Miss Biluo, what brings you here today? What would you like to purchase?” the shopkeeper asked while wiping the sweat from his brow.

“I’m not the one buying; he is! You take care of him,” Biluo said, pointing unkindly at Yang Kai.

“Um?” The shopkeeper looked confused, glancing back and forth between Yang Kai and Biluo with a skeptical expression.

“Do you have any pills that nourish the soul and restore Divine Sense?” Yang Kai directly inquired.

“Yes!” The shopkeeper nodded repeatedly, “Soul Nourishing Pill, Spirit Restoring Pill, Divine Recovery Pill; all these are essential for you, honored guest. Which one do you require?”

“How many do you have?” Yang Kai asked.

“This type of pill is usually not abundant; each variation only has about three or four bottles, but we have five bottles of the Divine Recovery Pill.” 

“I'll take them all!” Yang Kai declared grandly.

After all, with Shan Qingluo acting as the accommodating benefactor, why not take full advantage? Moreover, Shan Qingluo held authority over a thousand li and, as the so-called Evil King, this sum of wealth meant nothing to her.
