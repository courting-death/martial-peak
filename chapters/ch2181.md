## Chapter 2181 — The Next One

At this point, Pang Hai would never admit Yang Kai was right, for that would be slapping his own face before so many people. So he could only snarl, “Brat, there should be a limit to your nonsense! What do you know? I am a Void King-Grade Alchemist. If I say this is the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus, then it is the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus!”

His words restored some confidence in the others, since they didn’t know Yang Kai and couldn’t tell if he was telling the truth or not.

Yang Kai chuckled, “I’m a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist myself…”

He was telling the truth, but no one believed him.

“You all see? This brat is full of lies and madness, not to be trusted,” Pang Hai added, kicking him while he was down.

The others nodded slightly.

“Enough!” Yang Kai suddenly patted his backside and stood up, rolling his neck and stretching his arms backward. As his bones shifted, a series of cracking sounds rang out…

Everyone stared at him in astonishment, not knowing why he suddenly looked ready for a fight.

"That’s enough idle chatter!" Yang Kai said as he swept his gaze over the group. Anyone who met his eyes felt a chill in their hearts, as if some terrifying being was staring at them. “Since you’re all here, do me a favor…” He grinned, his voice deep: “Hand over your Spatial Rings!”

“Huh?”

Everyone was stunned, as if they couldn’t believe what they’d just heard.

But soon, they all flew into a rage.

“Bastard, what are you trying to do?”

“You’re trying to defy the heavens, friend! Just a mere First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, and you dare to rob us? Hahaha, what a joke—you’ll make us die of laughter…”

“This brat really is crazy!”

“Since you said it, then hand over your Spatial Ring. Maybe we’ll spare your life!”

The group all spoke at once, some angry, some mocking, some threatening to rob him in return. No one took Yang Kai seriously or thought he was capable. They just thought he’d lost his mind.

Yang Kai smiled, unconcerned, and looked at Zhou Huai. “Just now, this friend asked why, after such a long phenomenon, no one else came to investigate… I’ll tell you now: it’s not that no one came, but that I drove them all away!”

“Just you?” Zhou Huai couldn’t help but sneer. “Are you joking?”

Yang Kai shook his head. “Some overestimated themselves and tried to attack me, but their end was like this…”

As he spoke, he pointed down. Everyone followed his finger and saw, among the rocks, a headless corpse lying in a pool of blood. Nearby, a woman had apparently fallen from the sky and was smashed to pieces.

“Those two… are from the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect!” Jing Li exclaimed in shock after a glance.

“Yes, they called themselves Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples,” Yang Kai nodded.

“You actually killed them!” Jing Li stared at Yang Kai in disbelief. “You actually killed them!”

“No wonder there’s been a bloody smell all along. So that’s it…” Zhou Huai frowned. “The scent was masked by the strange fragrance. Damn, I didn’t notice at all!”

“Even if you did kill those two, so what?” Pang Hai suddenly stared coldly at Yang Kai. “Those two from the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect weren’t that strong, and there weren’t many of them. Do you think you can take on all five of us?”

At these words, everyone felt reassured. They thought, that’s right, he’s just one person. Even if he has some tricks, two fists can’t beat four hands.

“Sigh…” Yang Kai let out a long sigh. “If possible, I don’t want to fight you. I just want to find a few herbs! But if you won’t cooperate, then…”

As he spoke, his figure suddenly flickered and vanished from sight.

In an instant, the five all turned pale and released their Divine Sense, searching for Yang Kai.

But their Divine Sense found nothing—Yang Kai seemed to have vanished from the world.

This bizarre situation left all five with ashen faces and a deep sense of unease.

Suddenly, a large hand landed on Jing Li’s shoulder. At the same time, Yang Kai’s figure appeared mysteriously behind him, his voice drifting from the shadows like a ghost: “I can do this myself, but I advise you all—don’t resist. If you do, I might slip and accidentally kill someone…”

Jing Li felt as if struck by lightning, cold sweat pouring down his back. He stood rigid, not daring to move.

He could feel the hand on his shoulder contained vast power, like an ocean that could swallow him. The strength was so overwhelming he felt no will to resist.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

The other four instantly darted away from Jing Li, each activating their Origin Qi and watching Yang Kai warily.

Before Yang Kai spoke, none of them had any idea how he’d gotten behind Jing Li. Each wondered if they could avoid him if he attacked them.

Clearly, the answer was no!

At this thought, cold sweat broke out on everyone…

“Friend…” Jing Li swallowed, sweat dripping from his forehead, and stammered, “There’s no grudge between us, I haven’t…”

“Enough.” Yang Kai interrupted before he could finish. “I don’t want your life. Though it would be easy, we have no enmity, so there’s no reason to kill you, right?”

“Right, right!” Jing Li nodded repeatedly, forcing a smile. “Glad you understand, friend.”

“Like I said, I just want a few herbs!” Yang Kai said as he reached for Jing Li’s Spatial Ring.

Without any effort, he took the ring, swept it with his Divine Sense, frowned, and tossed it back.

“You can go!” Yang Kai patted Jing Li’s shoulder with a smile.

Jing Li nearly collapsed, but managed to hold on. He checked his Spatial Ring with Divine Sense, then looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

Yang Kai frowned. “You don’t have what I need in your ring…”

“So that’s it!” Jing Li suddenly understood, overjoyed, and cupped his fists. “Thank you!”

With that, he quickly used his movement skill and fled.

Though he’d been frightened, he was unharmed and hadn’t lost anything. He couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome, so of course he left at once.

“Next!” Yang Kai looked at the remaining four, grinning. “Be proactive, don’t make me do it! If you don’t have what I need, I won’t take anything. If you do… well, blame your luck.”

The four looked at each other, faces pale, not daring to leave.

After seeing Yang Kai’s movement skill, none of them had any confidence in escaping. They feared any rash move would get them caught.

“Friend, what are you looking for? If you don’t mind saying, if Zhou has it, I won’t hide it!” Zhou Huai finally spoke.

The others nodded vigorously. “Yes, if we have it, we’ll give it to you!”

Judging by Jing Li’s reaction, Yang Kai hadn’t taken anything from his ring. But everyone had their own secrets—usually kept in their Spatial Rings…

No one wanted to hand over their Spatial Ring for inspection!

“No need, I’ll look myself!” Yang Kai snorted. “I’ll count to three. If you don’t hand over your Spatial Rings, suffer the consequences!”

His face was murderous, and he started counting immediately.

“Sigh…” Zhou Huai could only sigh, not bothering to resist. He took off his Spatial Ring and tossed it to Yang Kai, forcing a smile. “I hope you’ll keep your word!”

Yang Kai said nothing, checked the ring, and after a moment, returned it without taking anything.

Zhou Huai happily took it back and left without another word.

Of the five, the two strongest had already left like this. The remaining three had no courage to resist. After exchanging glances, they handed over their Spatial Rings to Yang Kai.

After checking, Yang Kai frowned deeply.

He hadn’t found a single thing he needed.

Neither the three herbs for refining the Supreme Mystic Pill nor the Calamity Fruit he needed…

If he couldn’t gather the herbs, he wouldn’t be able to refine the Supreme Mystic Pill. If that happened, he’d have no choice but to swallow the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus when it matured.

But that would waste much of the Spiritual Medicine’s effects, so Yang Kai avoided it unless absolutely necessary.

After sending the last three away, Yang Kai sat cross-legged again, waiting for the next person to take the bait.

He’d already decided: before the real experts arrived, he had to gather what he needed, or there would be a fierce battle when they came!

Over the next two days, Yang Kai guarded the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, never leaving its side.

Many martial artists were drawn by the phenomenon. Luckily, or perhaps inevitably, none of those Yang Kai feared appeared—only weaker ones.

Their fate was the same as Jing Li and the others: they came excited, left dejected!

The smart ones obediently handed over their Spatial Rings for Yang Kai to check and left safely. The foolish ones were subdued by Yang Kai, who took their rings and checked them himself.
