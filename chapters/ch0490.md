## Chapter 490 — Lü Liang Requests an Audience

The sun shone high, the azure sky as clear as washed.

Yang Kai’s residence was bustling with unprecedented activity, like the festive atmosphere of the New Year; every martial artist coming and going wore bright smiles, their joy obvious.

In last night’s great battle, Yang Kai had emerged almost the sole victor. Those martial artists who had followed or sought refuge under him naturally felt elated.

Within the large courtyard lay thousands upon thousands of materials for alchemy and refining, dazzling to behold.

All these materials had been confiscated from the estates of Yang Kang and Yang Shen.

Before the succession war began, Yang Kai had already been gathering alchemical and refining materials, and others naturally did the same. After the succession war started, those forces who had previously supported Yang Kang and Yang Shen also brought significant supplies.

Coupled with what they had collected over these months, each young master’s estate amassed tremendous wealth and resources.

Now, what originally belonged to Yang Kang and Yang Shen had all been seized by Yang Kai, becoming his alone.

Moreover, each box and every material bore a label stating its name, use, and year of origin.

Any skilled alchemist or refining master who glanced upon them would instantly know how to make use of these materials.

The leaders of all factions gathered here, their expressions animated.

“Look through these yourselves. If any materials suit your cultivation, feel free to take them,” Yang Kai instructed.

Hearing this, everyone immediately grew excited, abandoning all formalities and scattering among the materials to search.

The women, naturally more modest, hesitated at first. Yet seeing Huo Xingchen and others stuffing armfuls of materials into their arms, they clenched their teeth and stepped forward to seek their own.

Before long, all had found one or two materials suited to their needs, happily tucking them away. Even Qiu Yimeng found a pearl-like object emitting a faint, misty glow and carefully pressed it to her chest.

“Aren’t you going to look for something?” Qiu Yimeng glanced at Yang Kai.

“They’re all mine. What would I look for?” Yang Kai smiled faintly and ordered, “Have someone sort these materials by category and deliver them to the pill workshop and refining room.”

“Understood.” Qiu Yimeng accepted the task without complaint, her eyes flicking; “Who is the next target?”

“We’ll see when the time comes.”

Last night’s battle not only yielded these materials but also gained the allegiance of four Blood Servants: Tu Feng, Tang Yuxian, Luo Hai, and Yan Lingxing—all exceptional warriors, each possessing eighth stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivation.

However, both Tu Feng and Yan Lingxing had the Sealing Yuan Curse and were seeking a cure with Meng Wuya.

Tang Yuxian and Ying Jiu had clashed savagely and suffered considerable injuries. Ying Jiu was also not unscathed. Both had unleashed the Blood Fury Technique in true combat without holding back.

Though bound by camaraderie, their loyalty to the Yang Family meant they spared no effort in protecting the young masters.

Qu Gaoyi, wounded gravely while guarding the central hall last night, bore immense strain from uncontrolled eruptions of True Yuan and Divine Sense.

Thus, despite the apparent strength of Yang Kai’s estate, only Xiao Shun and newly sided Luo Hai remained fully capable Blood Servants.

Relying solely on these two Blood Servants plus Di Mo, striking any one of the other three Blood Servants would not guarantee overwhelming advantage.

Especially now that Yang Ying, having united with Yang Shen’s forces, had greatly increased in strength, clearly the one with the greatest allies and support.

First Brother Yang Wei always appeared calm and composed. Yang Kai suspected he had yet to reveal all his forces.

Yang Zhao, the most cunning among the brothers, was perhaps even harder to contend with than Yang Ying.

Therefore, Yang Kai had no plans for action in the near future. Firstly, his martial artists needed rest and recuperation; secondly, he himself needed to consolidate his ninth stage True Yuan Realm cultivation.

Once the Blood Servants restored their strength, he would be free to wreak havoc!

News of last night’s battle quickly spread throughout Zhongdu and War City.

Yang Kai’s victory over his two elder brothers shocked all, while Di Mo’s brutal methods were exaggerated into bloodthirsty atrocities. Everyone knew Yang Kai’s estate housed a devil with unparalleled means.

Many secretly admired Yang Kai’s audacity.

The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu had long been at odds with the Cangyun Evil Land, and just over half a year ago, they had suffered a fierce war causing losses on both sides. Yang Yinghao, head of the Yang Family, was severely wounded by a joint assault of the Yinming Ghost King and the Destruction Poison King, forcing him to use forbidden methods that cost thirty years of his lifespan.

In such a sensitive period, Yang Kai daring to ally with demons was considered reckless beyond measure.

If schemers took advantage of this, it could bring unforeseen twists to the succession war.

Surprisingly, while Di Mo slaughtered mercilessly in War City, the eight elders above the Divine Roaming Realm within Fengshen Hall did not intervene, leading to speculation that they tacitly permitted the devil’s actions.

Looking back on last night’s battle, everyone realized the Yang Family had likely played right into Yang Kai’s hands.

The family grew impatient with the slow progress of the young masters in the succession war and baited them with a thousand treasure items to provoke conflict. They even seeded the eight Mystery-Grade treasures with the Sealing Yuan Curse, instantly imprisoning six Blood Servants.

With these six Blood Servants neutralized, the succession war would accelerate.

But Ying Jiu unexpectedly lifted the Sealing Yuan Curse, adding Xiao Shun to Yang Kai’s side, effectively giving him two more top-tier combatants than the rest.

Without them, Yang Kai could never have performed last night’s feat.

In other words, the treasure war at Po Jing Lake, orchestrated by the Yang Family, had indirectly advanced Yang Kai’s astonishing rise.

The complex intrigues were gradually revealed by the keen-eyed.

Following this battle, Yang Kai’s forces had utterly surpassed his rivals! Everyone knew that if things continued this way, he was undoubtedly the one to laugh last in the succession war.

It was almost certain.

After everyone found materials suited to their cultivation, they all withdrew to secluded meditation. Yang Kai was about to seek out his senior sister to ease his fatigue and request some pills for cultivation when a clear shout came from outside.

“Ninth Young Master, Lü Liang requests an audience. We hope the Ninth Young Master will kindly grant us a meeting!”

Lü Liang? Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and glanced at Qiu Yimeng beside him. “Your uncle has arrived.”

Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes and frowned, “I guess it’s because of Lü Song’s matter.”

“You go meet him. I’ll sit this one out,” Yang Kai said casually.

“That wouldn’t do. He’s come seeking an audience with you. If you avoid him, it could seem arrogant.”

“What’s wrong with that? He’s just here to apologize for Lü Song’s actions. If I go out, who knows what he might say? You’re relatives, so be direct. That’s that.” Not waiting for further argument, Yang Kai headed to the rear hall.

Qiu Yimeng sighed but agreed with Yang Kai. She instructed nearby martial artists to send the materials to the pill workshop and refining room. Then she stepped outside, her expression somewhat resigned. She roughly guessed why Lü Liang came and what he might say. Precisely because of this knowledge, she felt helpless.

At the gate, Qiu Yimeng saw Lü Liang standing there. Behind him was none other than the eldest young master of the Lü Family, Lü Song, whose swollen face looked like that of a bloated pig.

Last night, he was badly taught a lesson by Dong Qinghan. Thinking of that fat man’s outrageous methods, Lü Song shivered but also seethed with resentment. His hatred was starkly clear on his face. Qiu Yimeng shook her head silently—this man was truly hopeless.

Lü Liang’s expression was extremely embarrassed. The succession war belonged to the younger generation, and as head of the Lü Family, he should not have come personally. But his disappointing son’s misdeeds left him no choice but to shamelessly make this visit.

However, at the gate, two guarding martial artists stopped them.

Coincidentally, those two were from the Dong Family!

Upon seeing Lü Song, they mocked and sneered, speaking in veiled insults that left Lü Song utterly humiliated. Lü Liang forced a smile but could do nothing.

He could not strike them. Though capable, if he did, he likely wouldn’t escape unscathed himself—Yang Kai’s estate had many formidable experts.

“Uncle!” Qiu Yimeng offered a faint smile and warmly called out, easing Lü Liang’s embarrassment.

“Not at all. It is the honor of this old wretch to be greeted by Young Lady Qiu!” Lü Liang humbly lowered himself. While chatting, he glared back at Lü Song and ordered, “Kneel at once!”

Lü Song froze, stunned, with swollen cheeks and slurred speech, “Why should I?”

“Because I am your father!” Lü Liang roared.

Lü Song stiffened in the neck. “I won’t kneel! I’ve never knelt before anyone in my life.”

“If you dare refuse, I’ll break your legs!”

“If you can, try!” Lü Song was unafraid. In his entire life, Lü Liang had never beaten him—his father’s attitude was one of indulgent love.
