## Chapter 1118 — Ethereal Crystal Vein

In this world, to keep a secret, silencing someone — even slaughtering their entire family — is nothing out of the ordinary; Yang Yan had seen Yang Kai's ruthless hand in killing, and a First Stage of the Saint King Realm fighter was of no consequence before him. She knew clearly that if Yang Kai truly wanted to move against her, with that strange Demonic Flame, no amount of Secret Treasure on her person would necessarily be able to stop him.

At this moment, Yang Yan somewhat regretted knowing such a colossal secret.

Yang Kai glared at her. “What nonsense are you spouting?”

Yang Yan immediately laughed. “I knew you weren't the sort. Put these Ethereal Crystals away quickly — it'd be bad if anyone saw them.”

Yang Kai agreed and hurriedly stored the few hundred Ethereal Crystals into the Demon God's Secret Codex.

Even now he felt dazed; if these Ethereal Crystals had indeed been newly discovered and mined by the Stone Puppet recently, then there was only one plausible place beneath Dragon Lair Mountain, since the Stone Puppet always burrowed underground.

What puzzled Yang Kai was that he had clearly inspected the underground before and found no signs of any vein — if a Kongming Stone vein truly existed here, the Haike Family of Wu Yi could not possibly be unaware, after all this family had been rooted here for countless years.

It was necessary to get to the bottom of this matter.

Yang Kai reached out, picked up the Stone Puppet, and said to Yang Yan, “Come with me.”

Yang Yan asked no questions; seeming to know what Yang Kai intended, she quickly followed behind him, her pretty face full of expectation.

They left the cave and soon reached a hollow in the mountain over ten li away from the entrance. Finding a hidden spot, Yang Kai set the Stone Puppet down and ordered it to dig deeper.

The Stone Puppet vanished quickly, leaving only a small hole big enough for a person to enter.

Previously, when the Stone Puppet dug, it only ever produced a small opening. But this time, since Yang Kai had to investigate below, he had the mouth of the tunnel made larger.

Yang Yan grew even more excited; her cheeks flushed. Wordless, she stood by, waiting to go down with Yang Kai.

Half an incense-stick's time later, Yang Kai signaled Yang Yan and leapt into the deep pit in front of him.

One had to admit, the tunnel the Stone Puppet had excavated was extraordinary — cylindrical in shape, the passageway smooth as if polished by tools. After Yang Kai jumped in he met no obstruction and slid straight down, with no sense of blockage.

The passage was very deep. It was hard to believe it had been dug in only half an incense-stick's time; Yang Kai truly gained a deep appreciation for the Stone Puppet's abilities.

He slid down for the length of a whole incense-stick before he suddenly felt the passage end and experienced a fleeting illusion of falling from a great height. He steadied himself and, in the next moment, his feet touched solid ground.

A rapid clacking reached his ears. Without looking Yang Kai knew it was the Stone Puppet gnawing at ore. He drew up a luminous oddstone for light, and before he could fully take in his surroundings Yang Yan's exclamation came from above: “Yang Kai, help me — I'm stuck!”

Yang Kai looked up and his face darkened immediately.

Yang Yan was indeed caught — trapped by the pair of massive weapons at her chest. Her lower body dangled above Yang Kai's head, legs kicking rapidly, while her upper body could not descend through the passage.

He grabbed her ankle and hauled her down hard; amid her screams he pulled her free.

“That hurt like hell!” Yang Yan, once on the ground, clapped her hands over her chest and squeezed hard, teary-eyed as she looked at Yang Kai, as if reproaching him for being so unmindful of a woman's tenderness.

Before she could make trouble for him, the light from the illumination stone revealed the surroundings and Yang Yan froze on the spot, her lips rounded in surprise, her small body trembling — she immediately forgot the pain of her breasts being rubbed.

Yang Kai too seemed struck by a tremendous shock; he kept turning his head to take in the scene, his heart so stirred he nearly cried out.

The two stood in an underground cavern, one that the Stone Puppet had apparently excavated recently. The chamber measured only a dozen or so zhang across, yet under the oddstone's light the walls reflected a dizzying array of brilliance.

Pieces, large and small, bright and dim, of Ethereal Crystal were embedded everywhere as if worthless, and among those Ethereal Crystals were countless Kongming Stones of lesser value.

In the underground cavern there was only the two of them's heavy breathing and the Stone Puppet's gnawing on ore.

After a long while, Yang Yan suddenly cried out and, with astonishing speed, darted to a piece of Ethereal Crystal the size of a millstone that hadn't been mined yet. She threw herself onto it, face full of contentment, murmuring like a cat.

It wasn't that Yang Yan was easily surprised; Yang Kai's mood was little different.

He had never imagined that several thousand zhang below Dragon Lair Mountain — a place without Spiritual Herb or Spiritual Medicine and with no rich veins — there would be such an abundant deposit of Ethereal Crystal!

Judging by the vein's composition, it could no longer be called merely a Kongming Stone vein, for Ethereal Crystals accounted for nearly half of it; it fully qualified as an Ethereal Crystal vein and was no longer merely an accompanying mineral to Kongming Stone.

Yang Kai immediately understood why even he had failed to detect this place.

First, the location was extremely deep so he hadn't inspected thoroughly; second, there were simply too many Ethereal Crystals here.

This rare mineral was precisely the primary material used to make Spatial Rings, and it had the function of blocking Divine Sense detection — otherwise a sweep of Divine Sense would reveal what anyone's Spatial Ring contained.

The massive quantity of Ethereal Crystals insulated against Yang Kai's Divine Sense probe, and so the hiding was perfect.

If Yang Kai's Divine Sense couldn't probe it, the Haike Family certainly couldn't have detected it either. Ridiculous that they, as the owners of this place and sitting on a treasure mountain, knew nothing — merely because Wu Yi was a woman, they had assigned this pleasantly scenic wasteland to her as her territory.

Had the Stone Puppet not been innately sensitive to rare ore, such a treasure trove might have lain buried and unknown for countless years.

Yang Kai had never had any dealings with the Haike Family, but because of Wu Yi’s situation, he held little goodwill toward them.

This mountain had been given to Yang Kai to live on by Wu Yi; now that he had found such wealth here, he genuinely felt he ought to thank her.

However, her strength was low — she wasn't qualified or capable of holding such a vein. If she did, it would only bring calamity upon herself and the Haike Family.

He resolved to find an opportunity later to compensate her properly.

“Yang Kai, we're rich!” Yang Yan reappeared somehow and stood prettily before him; green light shone in her eyes, giving her an unsettling look.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I'm the one getting rich.”

Yang Yan pouted and tugged at his arm, coaxing, “Don't be so distant — there's so many Ethereal Crystals. Share some with me.”

“What would you do with them? They can only be refined into Spatial Rings. If too many Spatial Rings leak out from your hands, even a fool would know you possess Ethereal Crystals, and that will only bring you trouble.”

“I won't refine Spatial Rings. I need Ethereal Crystals to study an array formation. I never had the materials before, but now I do — share some with me. The array I'm researching is very powerful.”

“What array?” Yang Kai was taken aback, suddenly alert.

“A Space Array — ever heard of it?” Yang Yan did not hide it and said proudly, “It's the kind of wondrous formation that can transmit between cultivation stars. Hmm, you probably haven't heard of it, but once I research it you'll see how powerful it is.”

“You understand Space Arrays?” Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he looked at her with some disbelief. “How would you know this? Weren't they long lost?”

The last time on Shuiyue Star he and the yao expert Xue Tong had used a Space Array from the Hengluo Commerce Guild; Xue Tong said that current Space Arrays were relics from the ancient era — they only knew how to use them but couldn’t fathom their principles.

Even someone as brilliant as Ghost Ancestor had spent nearly a thousand years on the Floating Continent studying Space Arrays, and in the end it was a mess — he had caused many deaths and achieved no real usefulness.

So Yang Yan claiming she understood Space Arrays astonished Yang Kai.

He had always had a question he never asked Yang Yan: how someone so young could already be an Origin-Grade artificer. He himself was only an Upper-Level Saint King-Grade alchemist; Yang Yan was younger than him, and no matter how gifted, she shouldn’t have reached such heights purely by effort.

Now that she claimed to know Space Arrays, Yang Kai was even more shocked.

Yang Yan hesitated a few moments, seemingly reluctant to answer.

“Forget it, you don't have to say.” Yang Kai didn't press her; everyone had secrets, and he didn't like prying into others'.

“So will you give me some…?” Yang Yan wore a sour look, afraid he would refuse, then hurried on, “If I research the Space Array, we could not only teleport across Dark Star — we might be able to transmit to other cultivation stars.”

“What?” Yang Kai was genuinely shocked now.

“You don’t want to be trapped on Dark Star for the rest of your life, do you?” Yang Yan read his expression and quickly pressed the advantage. “There’s so much out there we haven’t seen yet! I’ve heard that in the Star Domain there are masters of the Void King Realm, and countless Void King-Grade materials. With those materials, I could refine Void King-Grade Secret Treasures! When that time comes, I’ll forge you a full set of treasures of that level—then even if you just stand there as target practice, you won't get hurt!”

The little girl knew exactly how to tempt him with profit!

But undeniably, Yang Kai truly felt moved.

His heart stirred not because of Yang Yan's uncertain promise, but because of his relatives and friends back on Tongxuan Continent.

If Yang Yan truly could research a Space Array capable of transmitting between cultivation stars, then once he gained a foothold in the Star Domain he could bring his family and friends into the Star Domain to let them enjoy its abundant training resources.
