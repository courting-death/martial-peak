## Chapter 2422 — A Spectacular Sight

"Since the Wenqing Sect won't give up so easily, doesn't that mean Ice Heart Valley is going back on its word?"

"I heard the Wenqing Sect's Vice Sect Master and Young Sect Master are both inside Ice Heart Valley. Why haven't they shown themselves yet?"

"A storm is brewing in the Northern Territory... I fear the sky is about to change."

"Brother Zhou, you must be joking. Ice Heart Valley may be strong, but how could they possibly contend with the Wenqing Sect? Everyone in the Northern Territory knows that Ice Heart Valley's reputation as a top Sect is no longer deserved. If the Wenqing Sect really decides to hold them accountable, Ice Heart Valley won't be able to withstand it!"

"I heard that on the day of the grand celebration, the Wenqing Sect Master, Lord Feng Xuan, will personally come to Ice Heart Valley. If you count the days, that's tomorrow! If he finds out Ice Heart Valley refused the marriage..."

Seven or eight Emperor Realm experts chattered away, all a bit confused about the situation. Everyone only knew one thing: Ice Heart Valley was in big trouble this time. No one knew where these women found the courage to back out of the marriage at such a critical moment. Wasn't this a public slap in the Wenqing Sect's face in front of the entire Northern Territory? How could Feng Xuan possibly let this go?

"Brother Hu Yuan, should we try to persuade Valley Lord An and the others? I remember your wife is from Ice Heart Valley. If something really happens to Ice Heart Valley, your Hua Yi Sect can't just stand by."

Hearing this, Hu Yuan's expression changed slightly. After a moment of hesitation, he hurried off in the direction An Ruoyun and the others had left, clearly intending to try and talk some sense into them.

The other Emperor Realm experts exchanged glances, then quickly followed after him.

Although they were only here to offer congratulations, now that things had escalated to this point, they were all eager to know what had happened in Ice Heart Valley to make them dare to break off the marriage with the Wenqing Sect.

A short while later, the group arrived in front of an inn in Binglun City. There, An Ruoyun and the others stood quietly. More than a dozen Emperor Realm experts looked solemn, saying nothing, simply gazing reverently and excitedly in a certain direction.

Within a hundred zhang radius, not a soul could be seen. All unrelated people had retreated far away, watching from a distance.

Hu Yuan flew over and hurried forward, just about to speak, when he saw An Ruoyun suddenly lower herself and kneel down.

Following her lead, the many Ice Heart Valley Emperor Realm experts all knelt to the ground in unison.

Hu Yuan's eyes nearly popped out of his head. He stood there dumbfounded, staring blankly. He had no idea what An Ruoyun and the others were up to.

The other experts who arrived one after another were also stunned, shocked to their core.

"Brother... Brother Hu, what's going on?" someone whispered beside Hu Yuan.

Hu Yuan was just as confused. He shook his head repeatedly, "I don't know. When I got here, they were already like this."

"Who in the world is staying in that inn, to make Valley Lord An and Elder Sun pay such respects?"

Among the Ice Heart Valley group, An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu were both at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. Aside from one disciple at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the rest were all at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Such a force was truly terrifying.

Yet here they were, kneeling in the middle of the street, in front of the inn, under broad daylight and the eyes of the crowd, without the slightest shame; on the contrary, it seemed only natural.

An Ruoyun was the acting Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley. Sun Yunxiu was the Great Elder. Every word and action of theirs represented the face of Ice Heart Valley, yet here they were, kneeling without a care, saying nothing. This could only mean that someone inside the inn was worthy of such submission.

Hu Yuan's expression changed, as if he had thought of something, and he exclaimed softly, "Could it be..."

He didn't finish his sentence, but his face was filled with excitement.

"Brother Hu, what do you mean?" someone asked anxiously, not understanding.

One person mused, "In this world, even if one of the Ten Great Emperors came in person, it wouldn't be enough to make Valley Lord An and the others pay such respects. There's only one person who could make them willingly do this!"

"The Founder of Ice Heart Valley, Senior Bing Yun?" someone cried out in surprise.

"Could it be that Senior Bing Yun is staying in that inn?"

"Wasn't it said that Senior Bing Yun had already perished? There hasn't been any news of her for three thousand years."

"No news doesn't mean she's dead. Maybe Senior Bing Yun has been in seclusion somewhere, or perhaps trapped. When she disappeared all those years ago, she was at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. With such cultivation, how could she die so easily?"

As the founder of Ice Heart Valley, Bing Yun's name was still thunderous even after three thousand years of disappearance. Now that they suddenly guessed she was in the inn, everyone reacted differently. Some were close to Ice Heart Valley, others to the Wenqing Sect, so their feelings naturally varied.

"At such a critical moment, Senior Bing Yun suddenly appears, and tomorrow Sect Master Feng Xuan will also arrive. If these two powerhouses meet..." someone shuddered mid-sentence, not daring to continue.

Under normal circumstances, it wouldn't matter if Bing Yun and Feng Xuan met. Both were leaders of top Sects in the Northern Territory and had crossed paths countless times. But just now, An Ruoyun had said the arranged marriage between the two Sects was off. Once Feng Xuan arrives, he'll surely demand justice for his son.

No wonder An Ruoyun and the others dared to break off the engagement at this time—it turned out Bing Yun had already returned.

But for some reason, even though An Ruoyun and the others were kneeling in front of the inn, there was still no sign of Bing Yun. No one dared to casually release their Divine Sense to investigate, so they could only wait anxiously.

In front of this small inn, nearly twenty Emperor Realm experts had gathered, making for a spectacular sight.

Yang Kai stood at the inn's entrance, looking rather helpless.

He hadn't expected the Ice Heart Valley Emperor Realm experts to suddenly pull such a stunt, turning him into a spectacle for countless onlookers.

Fan Xin and the others came out of the inn after hearing the commotion. Glancing at An Ruoyun and the rest, they approached Yang Kai and asked suspiciously, "Senior Brother Yang, who are those people, and why are they all kneeling here?"

Yang Kai twitched his mouth and said, "They're all your Senior Sisters."

"Senior Sisters?" Fan Xin was stunned for a moment, then covered her mouth in surprise. "They're from Ice Heart Valley..."

Yang Kai nodded.

Only then did Fan Xin hurriedly lead a few Junior Sisters forward. She respectfully saluted, "Fan Xin greets all Senior Sisters!"

"You are...?" An Ruoyun looked at her in surprise.

"Junior Sister Fan Xin. I was accepted as a disciple by Master in the Jixu Secret Realm, and so were they." As Fan Xin spoke, she pointed to the girls behind her.

These girls were even less accomplished than her. Seeing so many Emperor Realm experts kneeling before them, they were all so nervous they couldn't speak. To them, Emperor Realm experts were like legends, but now they were to call them sisters. The shock and joy left them dizzy and bewildered.

"You were all accepted as disciples by Master?" An Ruoyun's eyes lit up.

Fan Xin smiled slightly and activated her cultivation technique, her entire aura instantly turning icy cold.

Sun Yunxiu nodded, "That is indeed the authentic Ice Heart Valley technique!"

Hearing this, the women's gazes toward Fan Xin and the others softened.

"Good, good," An Ruoyun said with a gentle smile. "Master has finally accepted new disciples again. All these years, it's thanks to you for taking care of her. As Senior Sisters, we thank you."

Fan Xin shook her head, "It was Master who took us in. We couldn't help her much. But Senior Sisters, why are you kneeling here? Please, get up."

Changsun Ying smiled, "We made a mistake. This is our punishment. Junior Sister, don't mind us."

An Ruoyun said, "Junior Sister, you just mentioned the Jixu Secret Realm. Has Master been there all these years?"

Judging by her tone, she clearly didn't know about the Jixu Secret Realm. That was understandable—no one who had ever been trapped inside had escaped. To the entire Star Realm, the Jixu Secret Realm was a complete mystery.

"Yes, we were all trapped in the Jixu Secret Realm and only managed to escape recently," Fan Xin nodded.

"Was Master's injury also related to the Jixu Secret Realm?" An Ruoyun asked nervously.

Fan Xin replied, "There was a fellow named Chi Ri in the Jixu Secret Realm, whose cultivation was on par with Master. Master wanted to leave, but Chi Ri wouldn't allow it, so the two fought..."

The group of Ice Heart Valley Emperor Realm experts knelt in front of the inn, listening intently to Fan Xin's story. When things got tense, they felt as if they were experiencing it themselves, their expressions nervous. Yang Kai could tell they had endless questions for Fan Xin, wanting to know how Bing Yun had fared all these years and how her health was now.

So he simply returned to his own room and began sorting through the rings of Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo.

This time, he had no choice but to use an Emperor Extinction Pill, but in return, he obtained two Spatial Rings. It wasn't a loss. The rings contained countless treasures, and after a thorough inventory, Yang Kai found that not only had he not lost out, he had actually profited greatly.

The only thing he regretted was losing the Emperor Extinction Pill. Without it, he'd have one less trump card in the future.

The rings of Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi held so many things that it took Yang Kai an entire day to finish sorting. Just the Source Crystals alone amounted to over one hundred million, including many Middle- and Upper-Level ones. If converted to Lower-Level Source Crystals, there would be at least three or four billion, not to mention the value of the heaven-and-earth treasures.

The Wenqing Sect's wealth truly opened his eyes.

Yang Kai had always been well-off, but now, with such a windfall, his personal fortune was terrifying. Thinking back to when he first arrived in the Star Realm, running around with Liu Qianyun for Source Crystals, those days felt like a lifetime ago.

In high spirits, Yang Kai tossed all the rare minerals into the Small Xuan Realm for his Incarnation to devour and refine.

Ever since his Incarnation used the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to refine an Emperor Realm expert, his aura had reached a peak, seemingly just a step away from breaking through to the Emperor Realm.

Not only that, but Hua Qingsi was the same, and even Liu Yan was making rapid progress cultivating in the Small Xuan Realm.

The only one lagging behind was Zhang Ruoxi, who was now at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. With her special constitution, as long as she had enough Spiritual Qi, her cultivation would catch up sooner or later.
