## Chapter 1372 — Overcrowded

Brilliant stars streaked by one after another; Qian Yue felt as if she could even reach out and touch them, yet she understood these apparently real stars were merely reflections cast by the Star Chart and did not truly exist.

Drifting through the world of the Star Chart, Qian Yue felt as though she were inside a dream.

Here there were suns blazing with dazzling light, moon-stars emitting a tranquil glow, countless lifeless dead stars, and the terrifying Meteorite Sea that made her pale at the sight of it; everything seemed to have compressed the entire Star Domain down many times and set it here.

She flew forward silently beside Yang Kai. It seemed like a moment, and yet like a very long time, before Yang Kai suddenly stopped, a complex expression appearing on his face as he stared ahead in silence.

Following his gaze, Qian Yue saw a faintly azure star. In the whole Star Domain it was not particularly conspicuous—there were countless stars larger and brighter than it—but at that moment this single star became the whole world in Qian Yue's eyes.

She stared blankly, a feeling of seeing home quietly welling up, warmth spreading through her heart.

Tongxuan Continent!

That star was precisely the homeland she had longed for day and night, the Tongxuan Continent that had given her life and nurtured her.

Back when she had entered the Starry Sky from the Ice Sect, she had once glanced back and seen a scene identical to this. That azure star was like a brilliant blue rose that obsessed and enchanted her, made her reluctant to leave, yet at the time she had no choice but to follow Ice Lord Qing Ya away from that native land.

Qian Yue burst into wailing sobs!

Even though she was now a Saint King Realm warrior and had cultivated for decades, she still could not control her emotions now—like a wanderer separated from home. The yearning deep within her heart erupted completely in that instant.

Yang Kai said nothing. When he had once explored the Star Chart and found the star where the Tongxuan Continent lay, his emotions had been no weaker than Qian Yue's; only that as a man, he expressed them differently.

After a long while Qian Yue gradually stopped sobbing and turned to Yang Kai, asking softly in a weak voice, "Yang Kai. Can we still return there?"

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded, decisive.

Surprise lit Qian Yue's eyes. Although Yang Kai's answer had no basis and she could see no hope now, hearing it instantly filled the hollow deep in her heart.

"Thank you, thank you!" Qian Yue suddenly felt a little embarrassed. To lose herself before a junior like this was improper, yet upon seeing that homeland she could not control her emotions; the grievances she'd suffered for so many years in Hehuan House surged up like a tide.

Fortunately those things were now in the past, and she soon calmed herself.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. His Divine Sense flared and enveloped Qian Yue again, gradually drawing them away from the faintly azure star.

After a moment the two of them stopped at a spot within the Star Chart world. Yang Kai asked, "Look carefully. Is this the place where you and Su Yan were separated?"

Qian Yue looked around and slowly shook her head after a moment: "Not here. I remember the Meteorite Sea there was larger than the scale of this one."

Yang Kai nodded, wrapped Qian Yue up once more, and resumed traversing.

......

Half a day later, the sealing formation of the Stone Residence opened and Qian Yue walked out of it. Yang Kai sat alone inside the Stone Residence, a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

At last, by relying on Qian Yue's recognition, he had located the place where she and Su Yan had been separated. Although Su Yan and the others had also passed through a Void Passage and their destination was unknown, this was nevertheless an extremely precious clue.

When the time came, if his strength were sufficient, he could go directly to that place, find the Void Passage, and follow the thread—there might well be a chance to meet Su Yan again.

Of course, all of this had to be built upon great strength; thinking about it now was premature.

After settling his thoughts, Yang Kai took out his alchemy furnace and many medicinal ingredients, and began refining pills to calm his mind.

Time passed in the blink of an eye—one month later the sealing array of Dragon Lair Mountain activated and two figures slowly emerged from it: Yang Kai and Yang Yan.

The two of them were on their way to attend the auction at Jubao Tower.

In truth Yang Kai had been indifferent about attending the auction at first, but the moment he saw one of the items listed on the gilded invitation he changed his mind.

That thing would be of great use to him; he had to obtain it at all costs. For that reason he had even taken all the Saint Crystals from Wu Yi and was prepared to risk it all.

At present Dragon Lair Mountain did not possess an enormous amount of Saint Crystals, but it was far from insignificant—seventy million by their reckoning. By Yang Kai and Yang Yan's estimate, that amount of Saint Crystals should be enough to bid for the item.

After all, although the item was precious, it was only a single material; except for someone like Yang Kai who had a special use in mind, few would spend a fortune to compete for it.

Yang Kai had a measure of confidence on that score.

The distance was a mere fifty li, and in the Star Shuttle the two of them arrived at Tianyun City in little time.

Right now, Tianyun City was teeming with all sorts of people—dragons and snakes mixed together—and the city was packed to the brim. To maintain order within the walls, City Lord Fei Zhi Tu was running himself ragged. He was, by nature, someone who disliked trouble; otherwise, the old Hall Master wouldn’t have sent him out here to serve as City Lord in the first place. Yet fate had other plans—when the Imperial Garden suddenly emerged and just so happened to hover above Tianyun City, it drew in countless cultivators from every corner of Dark Star.

The city's great formation had been fully activated; no one could act rashly within the walls for fear of severe punishment, and once inside the city powerful restraints prevented flying.

This was different from before. Previously Yang Kai could fly straight into Tianyun City and then fly out again. Now, upon approaching the city he had to descend to the ground and enter through the gate with Yang Yan.

The gate area was packed with people. Yang Yan tucked herself under Yang Kai's wing and only managed to pass through with some effort.

Once inside and seeing the shoulder-to-shoulder throng, both Yang Kai and Yang Yan felt a headache—the population of Tianyun City now was at least an order of magnitude greater than before.

Fortunately the auction began today and special personnel had been posted at each major gate to clear passageways straight to Jubao Tower, saving them from the crush and preserving the dignity of the big names attending the auction.

At the reception Yang Kai produced the gilded invitation and showed it. The warrior in charge of reception immediately put on an ingratiating expression and said respectfully, "Welcome to our tower's auction. Please, right this way!"

As he spoke, he instructed a young woman beside him, "Qing'er, take these two honored guests to the tower's private chamber!"

Although Yang Kai and Yang Yan were not high in cultivation, the gilded invitations were rare. Yan Pei knew Dragon Lair Mountain's staggering wealth and hoped Yang Kai could bring some top-tier auction items back, so Dragon Lair Mountain had issued very high-grade invitations—though not on par with the first-tier sects, they were not far behind.

The warrior receiving guests at the gate could hardly be discourteous upon seeing such an invitation.

Hearing his instruction, the girl—only seventeen or eighteen by appearance—responded at once, a gentle smile on her face as she sweetly said, "Please follow me."

The girl's looks were not extraordinary, but she had a certain beauty. Her cultivation was only at the Divine Roaming Realm level, yet her voice was exceptionally pleasant—like a songbird—and every frown and smile carried alluring charm, hinting that she cultivated a kind of Charm Technique.

Seeing this, Yang Kai gave a slight, unreadable nod. He knew Jubao Tower had put effort into this auction; likely each participating force would be greeted by a dedicated girl. Cultivators of that level and training were numerous in the tower and easy to produce, but this arrangement would please those who favored female company.

Perhaps, in a moment of pleasure, they would spend freely.

Qing'er walked ahead, leading Yang Kai and Yang Yan toward Jubao Tower while explaining in a soft voice, "I will handle all auction matters for the two Elders. If you win anything, I will pay the Saint Crystal on your behalf and retrieve the item. If you have any other requests, please don't be shy—the tower's lord has instructed me to fulfill all your requirements."

"All requirements?" Yang Yan raised an eyebrow, a half-smile playing on her face.

"Yes." The girl Qing'er nodded lightly, her delicate earlobe flushing an enticing pink.

Yang Yan giggled softly, casting a meaningful glance at Yang Kai before leaning close to Qing'er and whispering something. Qing'er's face reddened but she still nodded.

Yang Kai sniffed. Though he had not deliberately eavesdropped on their conversation, he knew what Yang Yan had asked.

Ever since that time she’d fallen unconscious, this girl’s personality seemed to have changed a little. Yang Kai mused to himself—she was never this bold or unrestrained before. Still, it was nothing bad; in fact, he found it rather welcome. He’d always thought Yang Yan’s temperament was far too reserved, so seeing her open up like this was something he was happy to see.

The way was crowded and noisy, yet the passage Jubao Tower had specially cleared made the trio's travel remarkably smooth.

In no time at all the three of them arrived before Jubao Tower.

There were only two people before the tower, but when Yang Kai saw them his eyes narrowed.

For both of them were experts of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

One of them was the city lord Fei Zhi Tu, standing there with an unsightly expression, his face dark. He had wanted an easy life and never expected to be burdened with this mess; otherwise the former Hall Master would not have sent him out to Tianyun City to serve as its ruler. He looked as if he would be in a foul mood no matter what, only a little better than the man beside him.

The man beside him looked even darker—Yan Pei. That old gloomy-faced man was darker in countenance and darker in heart; everything auctioned under his watch seemed to fetch astronomical sums. The last auctioned Origin Condensing Pill, bearing Pill Patterns, had even broken the one hundred-million mark and created a miracle.
