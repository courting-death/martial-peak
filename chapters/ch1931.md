## Chapter 1931 — Half a Sentence Too Many

Yin Lesheng slapped his palms together and laughed as if no one else existed, which made Yang Kai and his companions extremely displeased; Ai Ou, who was being stared at by him, couldn't help feeling a prickling danger run through him, every pore on his body suddenly tightening.

Out of courtesy, Ai Ou did not lose his temper; he gathered himself, cupped his fist, and said, "I am Ai Ou. May I ask how you all are called, and what brings you to this place?"

Yin Lesheng grinned, utterly composed, and said, "I am Yin Lesheng of the Huangquan Sect from the Great Wilderness Star Domain. Which Star Domain do you hail from?"

Which Star Domain?

Yang Kai and the others looked at one another, unsure how to answer.

They had all heard from Yang Kai before that the world was not limited to the single Star Domain they came from; there were many Star Domains undetectable to ordinary folk, separated by barrier forces so that without great divine arts one could not pass between them.

So when the other party gave his name and mentioned the Great Wilderness Star Domain, they could accept it.

"You don't mean you don't even know what your own Star Domain is called, do you?" The bald young man Feng De looked at Yang Kai and the others with a strange expression, as if he were staring at a bunch of country bumpkins.

Ai Ou laughed awkwardly. "Well… we really don't know. Our Star Domain has been sealed for tens of thousands of years and has never contacted the Star Realm, so we don't know what the outside calls our place."

"Sealed for tens of thousands of years?" Feng De and Liu Qianyun both looked astonished; the latter asked, "Then how did you find the Starlight Passage and come here?"

She knew that some Star Domains had lost contact with the Star Realm — laws of heaven and earth could be disturbed, preventing martial practitioners from advancing, or passageways might collapse so there was no route to the Star Realm.

They were therefore very curious how Ai Ou and the others had repaired a passage after tens of thousands of years.

"This…" Ai Ou's face clouded; he did not want to explain, for the matter touched upon the Starry Sky Emperor. The man before them was a stranger met by chance, hardly someone to be confided in.

Liu Qianyun read the situation and smiled lightly, saying, "It was my rashness."

"No matter!" Seeing her look amiable, Ai Ou's resistance eased considerably. He then asked, "Are you all headed to the Star Realm as well?"

"Indeed!" Liu Qianyun nodded.

"Then why have you stalled? Lost your way?"

Liu Qianyun and Feng De hesitated, and shifted their gazes toward Yin Lesheng.

Ai Ou immediately realized the man who gave off the unpleasant feeling was the one in command of the three. He turned his attention to Yin Lesheng to ask again, but at that moment Yin Lesheng suddenly raised his brow. He stared in shock at Yang Kai, who had been kept at the back by the others, and a terrifying brilliance erupted from his eyes.

While Ai Ou chatted to glean intelligence, Wudao, Chi Yue and the others quietly observed the three. All had lived for millennia and each dominated a corner of their Star Domain; in perception, experience and discernment they had long since reached the summit.

One glance often revealed a person's character. They could form a rough judgment at a sweep of the eye.

Liu Qianyun and Feng De gave fairly good impressions, but Yin Lesheng gave each of them a bad feeling — there was simply too much killing intent about him.

Seeing him suddenly take an interest in Yang Kai, they knew matters had changed; in an instant the group shifted slightly to shield Yang Kai's figure.

"Hahahaha!" Yin Lesheng suddenly laughed loudly. "There isn't just one Star Lord. There are two! Heaven truly blesses me!"

Within the Starlight Passage, Star Lords were visibly distinct by the speed at which they absorbed the surrounding starlight.

Earlier Yin Lesheng's attention had been on Ai Ou and he had not noticed Yang Kai; only later did he realize Yang Kai, hiding at the very back, was absorbing starlight at a speed more than an order of magnitude greater than Ai Ou's.

What made him even more incredulous was that the man before him was a warrior at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

How could he not be overjoyed?

He had waited here miserably for five years, intending only to bring a gift to the Huangquan Sect — now the heavens had delivered two great presents to him.

Greed flashed in Yin Lesheng's eyes in an instant.

"This friend…" Ai Ou's face grew cold; he flashed forward to stand before the group and watched Yin Lesheng intently.

"Friend?" Yin Lesheng cast a contemptuous glance at Ai Ou, clearly not even bothering to regard him. He strode toward the edge of the Huangquan Nether Veil and said leisurely, "Who are you to call yourself my friend?"

"What do you mean by that?" Ai Ou's face darkened; he could not fathom why the leader's attitude toward the others was so different from the earlier cordiality — why had he suddenly turned hostile?

"Nothing special!" Yin Lesheng reached the edge of the Huangquan Nether Veil and looked coldly ahead. He said casually, "You ants, if you do not want to die, open your Sea of Consciousness and let me plant a soul-branding on you. Depending on my mood, perhaps I will spare you a path to live!"

"What?"

"Ants?"

"How dare you!"

"You think you can enslave us? Ridiculous!"

Ai Ou and the others were enraged. The six of them, leaving Yang Kai aside, were each at the pinnacle of their Star Domains — weren't they the strongest experts there, the masters who held sway?

They had always stood on the summit looking down on the myriad mortals; they had never been so scorned.

They had not heard the word 'ant' for a very long time.

Worse still, Yin Lesheng demanded they open their Sea of Consciousness to be branded with a soul-mark!

If that happened, they would have to obey Yin Lesheng for the rest of their lives; their life and death would be in his hands.

To be trampled and humiliated like that enraged Ai Ou and the others beyond endurance.

Yang Kai's face also darkened; he knew misfortune had come disguised as blessing. Although the other party was only a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, to act so disdainfully suggested he had backing.

Yang Kai still could not understand what that backing was — only by striking later could he hope to get a glimpse.

"Are you angry?" Facing Ai Ou and the others' fury, Yin Lesheng unexpectedly remained calm and said coldly, "Ants have no right to be angry. You should know that having me plant a soul-brand on you is your honor, not your disgrace!"

"Honor my ass!" Chi Yue spat and cursed, "If you think it's an honor, then open your Sea of Consciousness and let me plant a soul-brand on you!"

Yin Lesheng's gaze chilled; he stepped forward and finally emerged beyond the Huangquan Nether Veil.

In an instant a chilling, hair-raising aura burst from him and pressed toward the group like a mountain.

The sudden appearance of that aura made everyone's faces change dramatically.

Yin Lesheng lifted a finger; a mote of light appeared on his fingertip and he pointed it toward Chi Yue's position, quietly intoning, "Nether Prison — Finger Spear!"

With a hiss, a concentrated attack of energy formed, tore through spatial obstruction, and descended directly before Chi Yue.

Feeling the terrifying killing force within the strike, Chi Yue's pretty face blanched. She formed a hand seal and a huge silver-white spider illusion rose behind her, baring its fangs and claws in a ferocious display. On the spider's forehead was a crescent-shaped white mark that glowed faintly with lunar power.

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!

Chi Yue herself was a descendant of the ancient aberrant Heavenly Moon Demon Spider; its blood flowed in her veins, which was precisely why she had taken Shan Qingluo as an adopted daughter and treated her with boundless care.

Chi Yue was a Yao King-level expert; when a yao of that rank used bloodline power to unleash secret techniques, the result was naturally extraordinary.

The spider illusion opened its beast mouth and spat a mass of white energy that instantly became a web, appearing incredibly tough, as if unbreakable, to block before Chi Yue.

"Oh? A descendant of an Ancient Aberrant Species?" Yin Lesheng seemed slightly surprised at the sight, but his expression remained indifferent. "Some spectacle, but if that's all, then… die!"

No sooner had he finished speaking than the Finger Spear struck the web.

With a sputtering sound, the seemingly sturdy web could not withstand the attack and was torn open, leaving a large hole.

Seeing this, Chi Yue went pale; she realized the gap in powers was huge and that his attack was beyond her ability to stop.

"Reverse the Heavens!" Wudao gave a low shout and thrust his hand into the void, as if drawing a gleaming long sword out of nothing. Power coalesced on the blade and swirled into a vortex.

Wudao swung the long sword and slashed forward.

"Heh heh heh heh… Ten Thousand Souls Devour the Heavens!" Ghost Ancestor cackled as the Ten Thousand Souls Banner became a black curtain that shrouded the vast sky, voices of wailing and howling emanating from it while twisted faces writhed upon the banner in a grisly display.

"Great Sun Golden Wheel!" Gu Cangyun struck out.

"Overbearing Body Shattering Fist!" Ai Ou unleashed his move.

The five Third Stage Void King Realm experts in an instant unleashed their full strength, each casting secret arts; in a flash, a storm of power surged forward to intercept Yin Lesheng's Finger Spear.

Boom……

The space trembled, and boundless force sprayed across the void.

The ferocious noise shook Ai Ou and the others; their bodies trembled and they involuntarily retreated several paces.

The Finger Spear was stopped, and their secret arts dissolved into nothing.

But everyone's faces were grim!

For only by combining the five of them had they managed to stop a casual strike. If Yin Lesheng had gone all out, what kind of terrifying might would that have been?

They could not conceive of it.

They had never felt so powerless: even facing any opponent of equal rank they could rally their fighting spirit and, even in death, bite off a chunk of their foe. But facing Yin Lesheng, they felt like they were before an unclimbable mountain, craning their necks and unable to see its peak, their view filled with swirling mists.
