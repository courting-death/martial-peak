## Chapter 2295 — Just a Joke

“Miss Ye, please don’t make things difficult for this Lord. I’m just following orders.” Si Ming’s face was all smiles, putting on an official air as he said, “If you enter the city without registering and the City Lord finds out, I won’t be able to bear the consequences.”

"Fine, very well!" Ye Qinghan could no longer endure it. She laughed in her fury and said, "Tianhe City, I’ll remember this. This city... isn’t worth entering. Senior Brother, let’s go!"

Hearing her say this, not only did Si Ming not show any fear, he actually laughed even more heartily.

Ye Qinghan had already turned around, looking as if she truly intended to leave.

But Du Xian grabbed her arm and slowly shook his head at her, signaling her to calm down.

This time, Luo Jin was taking a concubine. Though it was just a ceremony, guests had come from all directions, involving nearly all the powers within a hundred thousand li. The stakes were high. If Chiyue Sect really left like this, it might spark some conflict and give Tianhe City an excuse to fall out with Chiyue Sect. If not for this, Ye Hen wouldn’t have told Du Xian and the others to endure humiliation before they left.

Du Xian was after all more mature and steady. Seeing Si Ming so gleeful, he immediately realized there was a trick. Maybe Si Ming just wanted Chiyue Sect to turn back, so Tianhe City could completely break with them.

Realizing this, how could Du Xian let him have his way? After pulling Ye Qinghan back, he moved his lips as if sending her a sound transmission.

Ye Qinghan’s chest heaved with anger, her teeth clenched. After hearing him out, she was silent for a long while before nodding bitterly.

Du Xian smiled slightly, cupped his fists, and said, “Elder Si Ming, we just need to register, correct?”

Si Ming frowned and replied, “Exactly!”

“That’s simple!” Du Xian nodded, walked straight over, and wrote his name and sect on the crimson registration book.

With him taking the lead, the other Chiyue Sect disciples, though reluctant, stepped forward one by one.

But then a scene that made the Chiyue Sect disciples even angrier appeared. The names and sects written in the registration book were all from insignificant families and sects. Any sect with real influence was never asked to do this. Chiyue Sect was the first.

In other words, Si Ming had forcibly lowered Chiyue Sect’s status to that of those small families and minor powers.

Though furious, the Chiyue Sect members still endured.

In no time, everyone had finished registering.

When it was Yang Kai’s turn, Ye Qinghan’s beautiful eyes flickered with worry as she glanced at him. But Yang Kai also stepped up to the desk and wrote his name.

She couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. She’d really been afraid Yang Kai wouldn’t cooperate and would just walk away.

“Hold on!” Si Ming suddenly barked, staring intently at Yang Kai, sizing him up. “You look unfamiliar, friend. Are you also from Chiyue Sect?”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “That’s right.”

Si Ming snorted coldly, “You’d better think carefully before answering. Tianhe City is on high alert. If you’re trying to sneak in under Chiyue Sect’s name, this Lord will have to have a good talk with you.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and smiled, “Elder Si Ming, how can you be so sure I’m not from Chiyue Sect? Do you know every member of Chiyue Sect?”

Si Ming said, “I wouldn’t claim to know everyone, but I’ve seen most, especially those of your cultivation.”

Yang Kai said curiously, “That’s odd, Elder Si Ming. If you recognize most with my cultivation, why didn’t you recognize Brother Du Xian earlier? He’s our sect’s Senior Brother, after all. There’s no reason you wouldn’t know him!”

Du Xian sneered from the side, “I’m curious too. Elder Si Ming, though we’ve never spoken before, we’ve at least met twice. Why did you pretend not to know me just now?”

Si Ming coughed lightly, awkwardly wiping the sweat from his brow. “I just didn’t see clearly earlier.”

“Looks like Elder Si Ming’s eyes aren’t what they used to be. You’d best get them checked, or you might not have long to live!” Du Xian’s words were laced with barbs, his tone full of mockery.

Si Ming’s expression changed slightly. “But you don’t have any Chiyue Sect insignia on your clothes. How do you explain that?”

“The City Lord is taking a concubine, so I specially changed into new clothes to show my sincerity. I just haven’t had time to sew the insignia on yet.” Yang Kai grinned, making up an excuse.

“That explanation... I’m afraid it’s not convincing!” Si Ming sneered.

“Si Ming, what’s your problem!” Ye Qinghan saw Si Ming refusing to let Yang Kai go and grew anxious. Yang Kai was the one she’d invited to repair the cross-boundary Space Array, which concerned Chiyue Sect’s rise. How could she not care? Besides, Yang Kai himself was extremely powerful. If he got angry, there’d be blood at the city gate. So as soon as she saw things going wrong, she stepped forward, glaring at Si Ming. “You keep making things difficult for us. Do you really think Chiyue Sect is easy to bully? We came to congratulate Luo Jin, but you’ve blocked us here and made things hard again and again. If we leave now, no one will blame Chiyue Sect. It’ll be Tianhe City that’s slighted its guests!”

Si Ming frowned, not understanding why Ye Qinghan was so furious. When he’d made things hard for Du Xian and the others earlier, she hadn’t been this impatient. Now she’d even called out his and the City Lord’s names directly, with no respect at all. Clearly, she’d lost all patience.

Realizing this, Si Ming forced a smile. “Miss Ye, please calm down. This Lord is just being cautious. I only wanted to have a few words with this friend.”

“Either let us through, or we leave. You have three breaths to choose!” Ye Qinghan’s face was ashen as she stared coldly at Si Ming.

Si Ming’s expression changed. Though he did want Chiyue Sect to leave so Tianhe City could find an excuse to sever ties and swallow up Chiyue Sect’s assets in the city, for some reason, he felt something was off. He had a sense that if things broke down here, it would be disastrous.

The feeling made his heart pound with fear.

“So it’s you being so arrogant, Ye'er.”

Just then, a voice suddenly came from not far away. As it sounded, a streak of light flashed over, revealing three figures.

The three were two old men and a young man.

The two elders both had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Their cheekbones were high, their eyes deep and reserved, and their bearing was naturally imposing—clearly masters. The young man was about thirty, at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, with red lips and white teeth, handsome and elegant, holding a folding fan and gently waving it, exuding charm.

“Qiu Yu!” Du Xian’s expression tightened the moment he saw him, his face grave. Clearly, this man was no ordinary figure. The way he addressed Ye Qinghan also made Du Xian uncomfortable.

Qiu Yu’s face turned cold as he looked at Du Xian. “Is my name something you can just call out? Slap yourself!”

At these words, all the martial artists outside the city gaped in shock.

Du Xian was at least a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, yet just for calling out the other’s name, he was to be slapped! If he really suffered such a punishment in front of everyone, even if his Martial Dao heart didn’t collapse, he’d have no face left.

Hearing this, the Chiyue Sect disciples’ faces all changed. Each one surged their Origin Qi, ready for a fight.

But just as everyone was shocked, Qiu Yu suddenly laughed. “Just joking, Brother Du, don’t be nervous.”

Du Xian’s expression changed rapidly, a storm of emotions inside. He was furious, but helpless. After all, the other had two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts with him. If he acted rashly, Chiyue Sect would only suffer.

Qiu Yu ignored Du Xian and instead looked intently at Ye Qinghan, greeting her politely. “Ye'er, it’s been a long time. You’re even more dazzling than before.”

His demeanor now was a stark contrast to his earlier arrogance, leaving everyone astonished, wondering if he was even the same person.

“You’re as annoying as ever!” Ye Qinghan sneered.

As soon as she spoke, the two elders beside Qiu Yu’s eyes flashed, and two powerful auras pressed down on Ye Qinghan. She couldn’t help but groan, her face turning pale.

“Stop it, both of you!” Qiu Yu’s face changed and he shouted sharply.

Only then did the two elders withdraw their pressure.

“You two old fools, how dare you!” Qiu Yu turned and scolded them. “If you hurt Ye'er, what then? Next time, if you act without my order, you don’t need to follow me anymore.”

“Forgive us, Young Master!” The two elders bowed their heads and admitted fault, not the least bit angry, leaving everyone amazed.

“Ye'er, are you alright?” Qiu Yu asked with concern.

Ye Qinghan took a deep breath and gritted her teeth. “Keep your old dogs in check. Don’t let them bite people.”

Qiu Yu smiled, closed his fan, and pointed at Ye Qinghan a few times. “I just love your straightforwardness.”

“But you’re really annoying!”

“No harm, no harm,” Qiu Yu said with a calm smile. “This Young Master believes that with enough sincerity, even metal and stone can be moved.”

“Keep dreaming. Even if you were the last man under the sky, I wouldn’t spare you a glance.” Ye Qinghan sneered.

Qiu Yu’s face changed slightly, but he laughed it off and stopped pestering her. Instead, he looked at Si Ming. “What were you doing just now, making Ye'er so angry?”

Si Ming seemed very afraid of Qiu Yu. He wiped his sweat and said, “Nothing, nothing, just routine business!”

“Hmph, aren’t you going to apologize to Ye'er?” Qiu Yu snorted.

At once, Si Ming ran to Ye Qinghan and said obsequiously, “I offended you earlier, Miss Ye. Please don’t hold it against me!”

Ye Qinghan glanced at him and waved her hand indifferently. “Elder Si Ming was just doing his duty. Let’s leave it at that.”

“Thank you, Miss Ye!” Si Ming said, as if granted amnesty.
