## Chapter 2159 — Fruit of Time

With so many branching paths, it was clear that some were safe while others were dangerous. But Yang Kai had no idea how to choose, so he gritted his teeth and picked one at random, diving in.

And just as he disappeared, Lan Xun and Xiao Chen also emerged from the illusion array. Yang Kai’s departing figure caught Lan Xun’s eye.

“Oh…” Lan Xun’s eyes flashed with surprise. “He’s actually faster than me?”

“What?” Xiao Chen, following behind Lan Xun, hadn’t noticed what was ahead and asked suspiciously.

“It’s nothing.” Lan Xun shook her head, glanced back, and found that the two of them were only ten steps from the previous entrance. The surroundings were empty, with no sign of anyone else. She knew well how formidable the illusion array was and couldn’t be bothered with the others’ fates. She said to Xiao Chen, “Let’s keep going.”

Soon, the two arrived at the fork. Lan Xun deliberately chose a different path from Yang Kai and walked in.

Though there were many branches here, the light was not dim. Strange glowing stones dotted the walls, emitting a gentle radiance.

Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense twenty zhang outward, staying alert for possible dangers as he cautiously moved forward.

Not long after, Yang Kai’s expression turned odd. He cocked his ear to listen—faint sounds of fighting came from ahead, along with a trace of blood in the air.

Startled, he quickly withdrew his Divine Sense, held his breath, and crept forward.

Before long, he arrived outside a spacious hall. Though not as large as the place everyone had first entered, it was still quite sizable.

The situation inside the hall was clear at a glance. There was nothing particularly unusual, except for a pool in the center, more than four or five zhang deep. No one knew what it had once contained, but now it was empty.

On the left side of the hall stood a long table, upon which rested two spirit fruits.

No one knew how many years these spirit fruits had been here, yet they still looked fresh, even exuding a rich fragrance. The fruits weren’t large, only about the size of a fist, looking just like two ripe peaches, making one’s mouth water.

“These are… Fruits of Time?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He immediately recognized what kind of spirit fruit they were.

Previously, beneath Primordial Cauldron Mountain, he had obtained a jade slip left behind by Gongsun Mu, Third Brother of Great Emperor Miaodan. The jade slip recorded in detail the names, appearances, and refining methods of all kinds of rare spirit herbs and miraculous medicines in the Star Realm.

Yang Kai had long since memorized the contents of that jade slip by heart—how could he not recognize them!

“So the Fruit of Time is something that only exists in the Time Temple!” In that moment, Yang Kai suddenly understood.

Although he had known about the Fruit of Time before, he had never connected it to the Time Temple. But now, seeing the fruit here, everything became clear.

The Fruit of Time was a peculiar thing. Its effects were strange and didn’t provide any substantial help to a cultivator’s training.

Even so, that didn’t diminish its rarity or value.

According to the jade slip left by Gongsun Mu, the Fruit of Time had two completely opposite effects. One could make an old man young again, restoring youth in a short time. The other was like a poison of time, causing a young person to wither and age in the blink of an eye.

If one didn’t know how to distinguish between the different Fruits of Time, no one would dare to take them rashly.

Regardless of whether the second effect was useful, the first would certainly drive countless cultivators mad—especially female cultivators. Who didn’t want to remain forever young? No matter how high their cultivation or how exquisite their beauty-preserving arts, the ruthless knife of time would still leave traces on them.

As time passed, those traces would only become more obvious.

But if one had a Fruit of Time that could restore youth, even an old woman could become stunningly beautiful in an instant.

Of course, this didn’t mean the Fruit of Time was only useful for women. For those whose end was near and who had no hope of breaking through, the Fruit of Time was undoubtedly a life-extending miracle. It could return a cultivator to the state of decades or even centuries ago, essentially granting them dozens or even hundreds of extra years.

In some ways, its value surpassed even that of an Imperial Treasure.

After recognizing the Fruit of Time, Yang Kai’s spirits soared.

If such a spirit fruit fell into someone else’s hands, he didn’t know what use they’d make of it. But in his hands, it was extraordinary—he was an alchemist and could use the Fruit of Time as the main ingredient to refine a batch of Time Pills.

These were spirit pills that had almost disappeared from the world, representing immense capital and wealth!

Yang Kai swallowed quietly, his gaze shifting as he finally focused on the center of the hall.

There, a man and a monster were locked in combat.

The sounds of fighting Yang Kai had heard earlier were caused by them.

The man was none other than Kong Qi of the Qiyao Commerce Guild! The monster was a massive creature, blood-red all over as if forged from fresh blood, its entire body exuding a nauseating stench.

This blood monster had a humanoid upper body, a round head, and two arms. Its lower body was a spinning, flowing mass. It rampaged through the hall, swinging its fists, each blow wrapped in a thick bloody aura, as if it could shatter the air itself.

Light from Origin Qi shone from Kong Qi’s body. His expression was grave as he dodged about, occasionally launching probing attacks at the blood monster, seemingly testing for its weaknesses.

Cultivators like Kong Qi were usually cautious and careful. When facing a strong enemy, they wouldn’t attack recklessly without absolute confidence.

Before Yang Kai arrived, Kong Qi had already been tangling with the blood monster for quite some time. By now, he had basically figured out its patterns and moves, just waiting for a chance to deliver a fatal blow.

“How did I end up on the same path as this guy?” Yang Kai hid in the shadows, frowning. Of the dozen or so forks, he’d just picked one at random, not expecting someone else to have gotten here first.

Still, it was lucky Kong Qi was ahead of him. Otherwise, Yang Kai would be the one dealing with the blood monster now.

Glancing at the battlefield, Yang Kai’s gaze shifted to the two Fruits of Time on the long table. An unscrupulous thought surged up: “While that guy is distracting the blood monster, if I quietly take the Fruits of Time… it’s not too much, right?”

Before this, Yang Kai had never had any dealings with Kong Qi. There was no enmity or grievance between them, so when this idea popped up, Yang Kai didn’t feel the least bit embarrassed.

With that, he immediately used the Nothingness secret technique, concealing all of his aura, and cautiously moved toward the table.

After activating the Nothingness secret technique, Yang Kai didn’t actually vanish into the void. Instead, he completely isolated his aura, making it impossible for others to detect him with Divine Sense—unless their Divine Sense was strong enough to pierce the void.

The only weakness of this secret technique was—others could still see him with the naked eye!

The hall was small, and any abrupt move would expose him. Thus he waited, patient and precise, until Kong Qi and the Blood Monster entered a spot where their line of sight could no longer reach him—only then did he spring forward.

Since he didn’t have to worry about being detected by Divine Sense, Yang Kai could move without restraint.

In the blink of an eye, he reached the long table and reached out to grab the two Fruits of Time, intending to store them in his Spatial Ring.

Unexpectedly, at that moment, a barrier of light appeared above the table, blocking Yang Kai’s hand in midair.

“Damn!” Yang Kai cursed inwardly, knowing he could no longer act stealthily under their noses.

Sure enough, as soon as the barrier appeared, both Kong Qi and the blood monster, who had been locked in fierce combat, immediately noticed and turned their gazes over.

Kong Qi’s face was full of astonishment. He stared wide-eyed at Yang Kai, apparently not expecting someone to try to snatch his prize right under his nose!

He couldn’t help but mock, "Friend, your strength isn’t much… but your guts are impressive."

“Just average!” Yang Kai replied, but Origin Qi in his body suddenly erupted as he smashed a fist down on the barrier above the table.

Since he’d already been discovered, he might as well go all out and snatch them openly.

The barrier was indeed extraordinary, still functioning after countless years. But after taking Yang Kai’s blow, it finally shattered.

Yang Kai moved fast, grabbing a Fruit of Time in each hand and tossing them straight into his Spatial Ring.

“You…” Kong Qi’s face darkened in anger. Anyone would be furious in this situation.

After entering, he’d noticed the two Fruits of Time, but before he could take them, the blood pool in the hall had suddenly surged and formed the blood monster. Kong Qi had no choice but to fight it, planning to deal with the monster first and then claim his prize.

Who would have thought Yang Kai would appear halfway through and snatch what should have been his.

“Roar…”

After Yang Kai took the Fruits of Time, the blood monster, already filled with violent aura, suddenly let out a furious roar and charged at Yang Kai, swinging its massive fist at him.

“That strike…” Kong Qi’s eyes narrowed, his face showing a hint of shock.

He’d tangled with the blood monster for a long time and thought he’d figured out its strength, but now realized it hadn’t shown its full power. Just from the way it attacked Yang Kai, it was clear this blood monster was far more dangerous than he’d thought.

Turning to look at Yang Kai, Kong Qi sneered and muttered, “First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm… he’s going to be killed instantly, isn’t he?”

In his view, even he would have a hard time defending against that blow. For a mere First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, wouldn’t it be over in the blink of an eye?
