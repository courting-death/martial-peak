## Chapter 388 — Absolutely Willing

With Yang Kai's reminder, everyone suddenly snapped to attention.

"There is a gap!" Tu Feng said solemnly.

"Indeed, there is a gap!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, "A powerful force within a sect should have a tiered distribution of strength. Since they have experts at the first, third, fifth, and seventh layers of the Divine Roaming Realm, they must also have experts at the second, fourth, and sixth layers. The assassination of the Yang Family disciples is of great importance; if it is indeed a single force causing the chaos, they will certainly deploy all their experts and won't leave anyone behind."

He paused and said, "Tu Feng and Yuxian, when you were fighting those three, did you notice their sect affiliation from their techniques?"

Both shook their heads. Tu Feng said, "Those people were very cautious and did not use any specialized martial skills, fearful that we might discern something. However, I felt they were not very coordinated; their teamwork did not seem that intimate."

"They are certainly not familiar with each other. If I’m not mistaken, they are not from the same force at all," Yang Kai snorted coldly. "No force would dare act against the Yang Family."

"What do you mean?"

"These people… are gathered from several different forces, selecting some experts to check the movements of the Golden Feather Eagle and predict our whereabouts, lying in ambush here!"

Qiu Yimeng nodded in agreement, "That makes some sense. This can explain why there is a gap in their distribution of strength."

Experts from several forces gathering together and drawing some out will naturally lead to such a situation.

"Young Master observes carefully." Tu Feng chuckled.

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered as he suddenly smiled strangely. Looking at them, he said, "Since these are the experts from several forces gathered together, it is absolutely impossible that there are only a few of them."

The expressions of the two Blood Servants changed drastically as they exclaimed, "Are you saying they have other plans?"

Yang Kai shook his head, "No! The ones lying in ambush along our route are only those people… but have you considered where the remaining experts went?"

The few paused, suddenly struck with fear. They gazed at Yang Kai in terror.

Yang Kai's expression turned icy: "It seems my brothers haven't been calm on their journey either. This is a deployment aimed at all Yang Family disciples, quite a grand undertaking!"

If Yang Kai's speculation was correct, then this was indeed a substantial scheme. Experts from several forces had split up to trace the whereabouts of the Yang Family disciples and ambush them mid-journey.

The Golden Feather Eagle circling above Yang Kai was the guiding light for them.

Yang Kai had narrowly escaped danger this time, but what about the other Young Masters of the Yang Family? Were there truly people who had been ambushed on the way?

To dare carry out such an act, the one behind it was undoubtedly exceptional in both means and courage.

"You Yang Family have offended too many people; you brought this upon yourselves," Qiu Yimeng sneered.

"It is still not conclusive that this is the doing of our enemies," Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "The battle for the heirship involves too much."

Qiu Yimeng stared at him in disbelief, seemingly realizing what he was thinking.

"The family will investigate it; we don’t need to think much about it." Yang Kai suddenly smiled casually, standing up and walking to the side. "Tu Feng and Yuxian, come here."

The two Blood Servants’ expressions tightened. They quickly got up and followed.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman exchanged glances and scoffed, "So mysterious!"

When they reached the darkness to the side, Yang Kai finally halted, turning to face the two Blood Servants.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were both on edge, unsure why Yang Kai had called them over. They felt guilty about today's events; although they had resolved to be careful in the future, the incident still occurred.

The Young Master wouldn’t possibly reprimand us, would he? Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian remained silent, their hearts heavy in the dark, their faces slightly flushed.

"How are your injuries?" Just as they were guessing, Yang Kai suddenly asked.

Tu Feng was taken aback. He never expected Yang Kai would ask about this. Hearing Yang Kai's concerned inquiry, both he and Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but feel a ripple in their hearts.

Quickly, he replied, "I feel a bit weak and can only exert about sixty percent of my strength. Yuxian is better than I am but still has some internal injuries. To recover will probably take a few days."

Finishing, he hurriedly added, "Young Master, don't worry! Even if it costs us our lives, we will ensure your safe return to the family!"

Tang Yuxian murmured, "We won’t be so reckless anymore. Once we return to Zhongdu, we will apologize to the family!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly, not saying anything further. After a moment, he extended his hand and offered two pills, saying, "Each of you take one now in front of me."

The two Blood Servants were taken aback, unsure why Yang Kai was so serious. However, they knew he would not harm them and immediately accepted the pills and swallowed them.

It seemed like a regular healing pill, at most of high Earth-Grade quality! The two Blood Servants immediately discerned the grade of the pill and were puzzled; why did the Young Master make it feel like he was handing out some extraordinary elixir?

They were confused but did not show it on their faces.

Even if what Yang Kai gave them was a Common-Grade pill, it was still a gesture of his goodwill.

"You can consider it as me trying to win you over, or perhaps I’m just afraid of dying. On this journey back, I will still rely on you two for protection, so… I hope you can recover soon," Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

The two Blood Servants were even more bewildered; after all, how could a high Earth-Grade healing pill help them recover more quickly? What game was the Young Master playing?

Both secretly shook their heads, feeling perplexed.

"Head back, meditate to absorb the effects of the pill, and don’t waste it," Yang Kai waved his hand.

"Understood." Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian answered, turning to leave. After taking a few steps, they suddenly halted and glanced at each other, reading the meaning in each other’s eyes. They quickly turned back to face Yang Kai.

"What’s the matter?" Yang Kai looked at them in confusion, unsure what they still wanted to say.

"Young Master…" Tu Feng said solemnly, "If the family allows Blood Servants to participate in this battle for the heirship, both Yuxian and I wish to follow Young Master and offer our service. We hope you do not mind our low strength!"

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, staring at Tu Feng for a while before he chuckled and said, "Absolutely willing!"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's faces lit up with joy as they promptly knelt before him, earnestly saying, "Then the two of us will await Young Master’s esteemed presence in the Blood Servants Hall!"

"I will go," Yang Kai nodded gravely.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian then got up and withdrew, following Yang Kai’s instructions to sit cross-legged and refine the effects of the pills.

Watching the two meditate, Yang Kai's emotions stirred, and after a long while, he smiled faintly.

Finally, he had managed to win over these two Blood Servants!

On this journey, despite employing some deliberate means, more had been unintentional displays of talent, which indeed impressed Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, making them willing to pledge their loyalty.

Though whether the Blood Servants would participate in this battle for heirship was still uncertain, Yang Kai needed to be prepared.

If the Blood Servants were indeed permitted to participate, he would soon have two powerful allies.

Moreover, Tu Feng addressing himself as subordinate signified that they indeed intended to assist Yang Kai in the heirship struggle.

Looking up at the starry sky, Yang Kai smiled contentedly, filled with anticipation for this battle for heirship.

A night of peace.

The next day, at dawn, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian successively opened their eyes after their meditation. They exchanged glances and could see the abundant joy and astonishment in each other's eyes.

After a night of meditation to recover, miraculously, both their injuries had fully healed! The injuries that were supposed to take at least ten days or half a month to recover had completely mended in just one night.

Recalling the unusual and miraculous experiences during the refining and absorption of the high Earth-Grade healing pill last night, both of them felt as if they were floating in the clouds, completely at a loss.

That was clearly just a high Earth-Grade pill! Under normal circumstances, neither of the Blood Servants would even glance at it; if it hadn’t been given to them by Yang Kai, they wouldn’t have taken it at all!

Both already had top-quality Heaven-Grade healing pills in their possession.

Yet, that seemingly trivial high Earth-Grade pill had unexpectedly radiated a surge of astonishingly powerful healing effects that permeated their meridians and flesh, soothing the wounds they had just sustained, and even healing the hidden injuries left from previous battles.

Blood Servants were inherently trained for combat; every Blood Servant grown had faced hundreds of life-and-death battles, each of them carrying some hidden injuries.

These injuries were not something that mere pills could heal; only with the aid of medicinal ingredients and extended periods of deep meditation could there be a possibility of recovery.

But as Blood Servants, when had they the luxury of conceiving safely?

Tu Feng had hidden injuries—the slightest pain would arise in his abdomen when the True Yuan circulated, but he had long since ignored such subtle pains.

Tang Yuxian had hidden injuries as well; every time she felt angered, there would be soreness in her chest, a consequence of having not fully detoxified after previously being poisoned.

These hidden injuries were subtle—they would not affect their combat strength or impede the operation of True Yuan—but both understood that while they were currently unhampered by these hidden injuries, given time, they would eventually succumb under their subtlety.

However, now, they distinctly noticed that all their hidden injuries from previous battles had vanished without a trace.

Could this possibly be accomplished with just a high Earth-Grade pill?

In an instant, both realized that the Young Master must have hidden something within those high Earth-Grade pills, which gave rise to such miraculous effects.

That unknown substance must be invaluable and extraordinarily rare!

In a moment, the guilt and gratitude of the two Blood Servants deepened significantly.
