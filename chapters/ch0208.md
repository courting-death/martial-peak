## Chapter 208 — Beating the Dog Without Minding Its Master

“Two hundred thousand taels is already quite generous, are you not satisfied?” Bai Yunfeng frowned slightly, looking at Yang Kai with some displeasure. They had acquired quite a few martial techniques in recent days, but they had never offered such a high price to anyone. If it weren’t for the rumors about the extraordinary power of that martial technique, he wouldn’t have been so generous.

This kid is a bit ungrateful! Bai Yunfeng snorted coldly. He was the young master of the Bai Family; even if that martial technique was truly worth two hundred thousand taels, Yang Kai should still sell it to him for one hundred thousand taels!

Dong Qinghan noticed Bai Yunfeng’s irritation and could no longer sit still. Pretending not to know Yang Kai, he fanned the flames from the side, saying, “Kid, I, Dong, will raise the price as well. Two hundred thousand taels, plus a bottle of Dong Family’s special Xuan Yuan Pill, how about that?”

Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong both looked at Dong Qinghan in surprise. They didn’t expect him to be willing to part with a Xuan Yuan Pill, which was a Middle-Level Earth-Grade spirit pill. Although it wasn’t the highest grade, its effects were definitely appealing. Taking one could significantly enhance one’s cultivation efficiency.

Is that martial technique really that valuable? Right, Dong Qinghan must have talked quite a bit with Yang Kai before, so he surely knew something about that martial technique, which is why he was willing to offer a Xuan Yuan Pill.

“Two hundred thousand taels, plus a Common-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure!” Fan Hong immediately raised his bid as well.

Dong Qinghan frowned and said, “Fan brother, isn’t that a bit of malicious competition?”

Fan Hong didn’t reply, but Bai Yunfeng took over, “Dong brother, what are you talking about? That martial technique is indeed extraordinary. Since we all want it, we naturally have to use our own means; the one who offers the highest price wins, and that’s only fair. I’ll bid three hundred thousand taels, along with a Common-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure, and it’s a defensive secret treasure at that!”

Fan Hong was momentarily stunned, then bitterly smiled, “Bai brother, you’re really generous.”

This price was something he wouldn’t dare to offer, yet Bai Yunfeng was so decisive.

Dong Qinghan also smiled, “Since Bai brother is so determined to win, then I won’t compete with you any longer. Continuing to compete would only hurt our friendship.”

Bai Yunfeng laughed heartily and cupped his hands to the two, “You’re too polite! Once this matter is settled, I’ll definitely host a banquet to make amends!”

The three continued to bid, chatting merrily. From the looks of it, they seemed to have already determined the ownership of the Mark of the Stars, completely disregarding Yang Kai’s opinion.

Yang Kai frowned slightly and said indifferently, “I never said I wanted to sell this martial technique, did I?”

Bai Yunfeng’s smile immediately froze on his face, and Fan Hong was also taken aback.

“Three hundred thousand taels, plus a Common-Grade Upper-Level defensive secret treasure. Is that not enough to offset the value of that martial technique, kid? Don’t be greedy. Otherwise, you might lose both your money and your life.” Bai Yunfeng’s expression turned cold, his voice threatening.

Cao Zhengwen, who stood behind Bai Yunfeng, also sneered, “Yang Kai, don’t be ungrateful. Young Master Bai’s offer is already quite fair; what more do you want?”

Bai Yunfeng opened his folding fan and crossed his legs, leisurely watching Yang Kai, lightly fanning himself, his face filled with disdain and contempt.

Dong Qinghan continued to stir the pot, deliberately saying, “Oh? Do you want to join our forces?”

Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong frowned, unable to help but consider this possibility.

Before either of them could speak, Cao Zhengwen coldly interjected, “Young Master Bai, this person has been at Lingxiao Pavilion for three years and has only reached the third layer of the Body Tempering Realm. He is merely a trial disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Such mediocre talent is destined to have no future; bringing him into the Bai Family would only bring shame. Young Master should think twice.”

Before he finished speaking, Yang Kai suddenly flicked his hand, and a cup of wine shot out, splashing directly onto Cao Zhengwen’s face.

The expressions of everyone at the table changed dramatically. Especially Bai Yunfeng, whose face turned extremely ugly.

“Yang Kai, you’re courting death!” Cao Zhengwen roared in anger, about to attack, but was stopped by Bai Yunfeng.

“Kid, even when beating a dog, one must look at its owner.” Bai Yunfeng coldly gazed at Yang Kai, his eyes flashing with dangerous light. “If you don’t give me a satisfactory explanation today, don’t even think about leaving here alive.”

“An explanation?” Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent, his voice flat. “That martial technique of mine is of the Mystery-Grade; is that explanation enough?”

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone’s expressions changed again, even Dong Qinghan was stunned on the spot.

Mystery-Grade!

Previously, everyone had speculated that the martial technique Yang Kai mastered might be of the Heaven-Grade, but they never expected it to actually be of the Mystery-Grade.

Even among top-tier forces like the Dong Family, Bai Family, and Ziwei Valley, there were very few Mystery-Grade martial techniques. Any one of them was a closely guarded secret of these major powers, and only the future pillars of the family were allowed to practice them.

“Is that true?” Dong Qinghan’s voice trembled slightly, cursing inwardly. If I had known it was a Mystery-Grade martial technique, I wouldn’t have bothered watching the show. I should have just traded this martial technique with my cousin and everything would have been fine. Now look, Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong, these two idiots, have gotten involved, and it’s probably going to be difficult to settle this.

“In the Inheritance Celestial Cave, my strength was only at the seventh layer of the Open Origin Realm, yet I could heavily injure a sixth-tier demon beast. I don’t need to say more about the level of this martial technique, right?” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

Everyone’s breathing became heated, and as they looked at Yang Kai, there was no longer any trace of their previous disdain; each of them had eyes shining with excitement.

“The previous conditions remain unchanged; you can join my Bai Family as a disciple.” Bai Yunfeng took a deep breath and made a decision. Exchanging a disciple’s position for a Mystery-Grade martial technique would definitely be a huge profit for the Bai Family. As for Yang Kai’s treatment after joining the Bai Family, that would depend on his own talent.

“I can represent Ziwei Valley to accept you as a disciple and provide you with a good cultivation environment.” Fan Hong quickly added.

“I’m not interested in joining any of your families.” Yang Kai was too lazy to waste more breath with them. “If you want my martial technique, fine. Bring me a set of the same Mystery-Grade martial technique to trade!”

Fan Hong frowned, his expression strange. “You want our closely guarded secrets?”

“Since they are both Mystery-Grade, an exchange wouldn’t be unfair. What’s the matter? Is this trade unfair?” Yang Kai looked at him calmly.

Bai Yunfeng sneered, “That’s impossible. A closely guarded secret is a closely guarded secret. Except for the direct descendants of the Bai Family, outsiders are not allowed to practice them.”

“Then there’s nothing to discuss.” Yang Kai stood up, ready to leave.

“Want to leave?” Bai Yunfeng’s expression changed, and he suddenly sneered, reaching out to block Yang Kai’s path. “Unless you hand over that martial technique today, don’t even think about leaving here.”

With the deal falling through, Bai Yunfeng was prepared to forcefully seize it. A mere disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion was not something he took seriously.

“Get lost!” Yang Kai had already found him displeasing, and seeing him take action now, he had no more hesitation. He threw a fierce punch.

Bai Yunfeng coldly snorted and met it with his palm.

With a loud crash, a fierce surge of Primordial Qi erupted, and the small wooden house suddenly shattered into pieces.

Swish, swish, swish! Several figures rushed out from within.

Dong Qinghan, Bai Yunfeng, Fan Hong, Yang Kai, and Cao Zhengwen, along with another disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, all had disheveled appearances.

“How dare you lay a hand on me!” Bai Yunfeng was furious, his expression twisted. Although he hadn’t suffered a loss in that exchange, he also hadn’t managed to take Yang Kai down. He was only surprised by the overwhelming Primordial Qi of the other party. Despite only being at the first layer of the Separation and Union Realm, he had actually blocked his attack, which was quite unexpected.

“Young Master Bai, you are of noble status and should not stoop to his level. Let me take care of this for you!” Cao Zhengwen volunteered. He had just been splashed with wine by Yang Kai, losing a great deal of face, and naturally wanted to regain it. Moreover, he had already pledged allegiance to the Bai Family, so he was looking for an opportunity to perform well.

As long as he could beat Yang Kai up, relieve Bai Yunfeng’s anger, he would surely benefit in the future.

“Bai Yunfeng nodded coldly, “Break his arms and legs! Let him know the consequences of disrespecting me. A mere disciple of a small sect dares to be so arrogant!”

“Rest assured, Young Master. I’ve been wanting to teach this junior brother a lesson for a long time.” Cao Zhengwen sneered, looking at Yang Kai from a distance of several dozen zhang, he called out loudly, “Yang junior brother, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. If you kneel down now and crawl to Young Master Bai’s feet to kowtow a few times, perhaps Young Master Bai will spare you. Otherwise, you will definitely suffer!”

Yang Kai looked at him with derision, “After becoming someone else’s dog, your tone has become quite arrogant.”

Cao Zhengwen’s face flushed red, and he coldly replied, “Young Master Bai has treated me with kindness. What’s wrong with my allegiance to him? Even the elders of the sect have said nothing about it; what qualifications do you have to criticize me?”

“Degrading yourself and expecting others to respect you?”

“Since we are fellow disciples, I don’t want to make things too difficult for you. But if you seek your own death, don’t blame your senior brother for being ruthless.” Cao Zhengwen took a deep breath, suppressing his anger. His Primordial Qi circulated, and he no longer wasted words, using his movement technique to rush toward Yang Kai.

However, as soon as he moved, before he could charge forward, Yang Kai suddenly appeared in front of him in the blink of an eye.

Cao Zhengwen’s face showed a hint of astonishment, and then it changed drastically as he hurriedly attacked.

Yang Kai casually blocked his attack, and with a fiery glow on his fist, he unleashed the Flame Yang Triple Explosion.

It struck directly at his chest, and in an instant, Cao Zhengwen’s face turned pale, his chest caving in. He stumbled backward, using the retreat to dissipate Yang Kai’s punch’s force.

Just barely creating some distance, but the ferocious Primordial Qi that surged into his body exploded.

Three muffled sounds echoed, and Cao Zhengwen spat out a mouthful of blood.

One strike, and he was injured! This turn of events left everyone stunned.

Although Cao Zhengwen’s strength wasn’t particularly strong, he was still at the fifth layer of the Separation and Union Realm. Yet, such a person was actually forced to spit blood by Yang Kai with a single punch.

Even though it was aided by the power of the martial technique, Yang Kai’s elusive speed was truly fearsome.

Cao Zhengwen clearly hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so formidable. After spitting out blood, he hadn’t even regained his senses when Yang Kai charged at him again. In his panic, he hurriedly defended himself, but how could he withstand it? In a flurry of exchanges, he was struck again.

A crisp sound of bones breaking echoed from his chest, and Cao Zhengwen was drenched in cold sweat.

Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent, his attacks ruthless, every punch aimed at Cao Zhengwen’s vital points. After a fierce assault, Cao Zhengwen could only defend, with no ability to counterattack.

After ten breaths, Cao Zhengwen’s vision began to blur. Yang Kai leaped up, delivering a kick that sent him flying like a ragged sack, crashing to the ground and unable to get back up.

He wasn’t dead, but he must have broken several bones. At the very least, he would need to lie down for several months to recover.
