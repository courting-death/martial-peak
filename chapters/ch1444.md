## Chapter 1444 — Politely Declined

This turn of events genuinely surprised Yang Kai; he had never imagined the Imperial Garden's opening would be available to the entire Star Domain — he had always assumed only cultivators from Dark Star could enter.

For the cultivators on Dark Star, this unexpected change was more curse than blessing, for the pool of competitors had swelled and the peril had risen considerably.

At that thought, Yang Kai's heart tightened and he asked, "Island Master Min, are there any experts of the Void King Realm who have entered here?"

Hearing his question, Min Sha smiled faintly and waved his hand, "Young friend Yang, calm yourself; there are no Void King Realm experts here, you may rest assured on that point."

He himself had harbored the same worry earlier — after all, Qingmu Star's Spiritual Qi was not particularly dense and cultivation resources were scarce. Although not suppressed by world laws, those who could rise to the Void King Realm had always been few; in the past thousand years no Void King Realm cultivator had appeared on Qingmu Star. With his Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation, he was already among the planet's top figures.

In this regard Qingmu Star was no different from Dark Star at all!

Entering here with such a level, he had thought himself secure, but upon learning that cultivators from other stars could also come in, fear set in — the last thing one wanted was to meet an opponent far stronger here.

However, further inquiries brought pleasant surprise: for reasons unknown, this place did not permit any Void King Realm cultivator to enter. In other words, the strongest cultivators to reach this place were only of the same rank as he was.

After Min Sha's explanation, Yang Kai couldn't help but breathe easier and his expression softened considerably.

Although he had now advanced into the Origin Returning Realm and believed he could contend with a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, he would be helpless before the Void King Realm; to encounter a Void King Realm expert here would have unimaginable consequences.

The situation wasn't quite so dire...

Yang Kai pondered a moment, then asked with a suddenly grave expression, "May I ask, is this truly the Imperial Garden?"

Min Sha had not yet answered when the small woman in black battle garb beside him interjected, "Of course this is the Imperial Garden. We all entered through the Space Array holding Imperial Jade — if this weren't the Imperial Garden, what else could it be?"

She wore an amused look as she regarded Yang Kai with interest.

"If it is the Imperial Garden, then why..." Yang Kai frowned.

"Young friend Yang, you mean why it isn't what you imagined?" Min Sha said with a smile as he looked at him.

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"In your imagination the Imperial Garden, as the Great Emperor's retreat, should have vast, sprawling palaces, shouldn't it?"

"Indeed."

"There are such palaces; ten thousand li to the west of here sits that palace, and that is the true Imperial Garden!" Min Sha said, pointing in a direction as he spoke.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

Min Sha chuckled, "But since the Imperial Garden is the Great Emperor's retreat, it cannot consist of only that one grand palace. Around that palace lie wide territories; the grassland where we stand is only a part of them. Beyond the grasslands the Imperial Garden is ringed by marsh, desert, and sea, each area holding different dangers. Where an Imperial Jade carrier appears upon entry varies by location. Well, our luck's decent — the grassland is the least dangerous of them, but don't take it lightly!"

"I see!" Yang Kai adopted a receptive expression; had he not asked, he would not have known. Before speaking with Min Sha he had even doubted whether this truly was the Imperial Garden.

“Since the true Imperial Garden is over there, why are you all here, Island Master Min?” Yang Kai looked at the five of them in surprise, puzzled as to why they would pass up such a heaven-sent opportunity—remaining here on the plains instead of venturing deeper into the Imperial Garden.

Min Sha gave a bitter smile and said wearily, “It’s a long story. Simply put, while the Imperial Garden is filled with treasures, it’s also perilous beyond measure. Leaving aside the hidden restrictions and arrays, or those ancient puppets long lost to time—just the number of powerful experts gathered inside right now is countless! We originally entered this place with ten people, but, young friend, look for yourself—how many of us are left now?”

Hearing his explanation, Yang Kai immediately understood — these five had likely encountered a grave danger within the Imperial Garden and had been driven back.

It wasn't hard to understand; each person only has one life. Treasures and opportunities are tempting, but if you lose your life, what chance is left to enjoy them?

It seemed the Imperial Garden differed somewhat from when he last entered; the danger must have increased greatly, otherwise these five would not be so shaken.

Considering it, it wasn't surprising; when he had gone in before with Fei Zhi Tu and others the Imperial Garden hadn't been fully opened and some restrictive arrays were inactive.

Seeing Yang Kai deep in thought, Min Sha did not interrupt; after a moment he laughed heartily and, reinvigorated, said, "But Young friend Yang, do not underestimate the Imperial Garden's outskirts. Whether grassland, marsh, desert, or sea, each hides opportunities enough to make one's eyes gleam."

"Oh? How so?" Yang Kai asked, intrigued.

"The palace is indeed the Great Emperor's retreat, but think on it — the Great Emperor could not have lived alone. He must have had attendants and disciples. I won't presume the Great Emperor's cultivation, but even his attendants' levels would not be low, and his disciples too. They do not all reside within the palace but are scattered outside, so the Imperial Garden's outskirts conceal many hidden caves. Find one of those, and, heh heh... we won't have come for nothing!" Min Sha said, stroking his long beard as a flush rose to his face.

"Indeed, besides hidden caverns, one can find Spiritual Herbs and miraculous pills that have long vanished from the outside, rare minerals, and strange demonic beasts — like that variant of the Seven-Colored Stag just now. If one could slay it..." The small woman stopped mid-sentence, glancing awkwardly at Yang Kai as if recalling what had happened earlier and unsure how to continue.

Yang Kai chuckled and showed no sign of offense — not only had he suffered no loss but had made gains, and these five had shared much information with him.

For that alone, everything earlier was forgiven and forgotten.

"Has anyone found those hidden caverns?" Yang Kai asked casually.

"Yes!" Min Sha nodded solemnly, an envious look on his face. "Just three days ago someone found a hidden cavern on this grassland and brought out a Void King-Grade secret treasure and many Spiritual Pills!"

As he spoke his breathing quickened; Qingmu Star's circumstances were much like Dark Star's, and a Void King-Grade secret treasure was a powerful temptation.

"If the news has leaked, that person's fate is likely not good," Yang Kai said, a corner of his mouth lifting.

Min Sha looked at Yang Kai with admiration, "Young friend Yang, you hit the nail on the head. That man is indeed being chased by many. What became of him I do not know, but life surely won't be easy for him."

Yang Kai lightly nodded and said no more.

He had gathered all the necessary information; confirming this was the Imperial Garden and learning its direction was enough.

Yang Kai had no intention of lingering outside. Though he didn’t know exactly when the Imperial Garden would close completely, it was certain there was a time limit. Before that happened, he still had at least two things to do—two items to find. Both were things he had encountered during his last entry into the Imperial Garden but had neither the time nor the strength to deal with back then.

Now that his strength had increased, he intended to try.

"Young friend Yang, it seems you entered alone. If you trust us you could act with us. If we find anything good we six will split it evenly; we won't let you suffer a loss," Min Sha unexpectedly invited Yang Kai to join them.

“Island Master Min’s kindness is appreciated,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head without a second thought. “Though I’m alone right now, I didn’t come here by myself. I have companions waiting for me—I still need to find them!”

"I see..." Min Sha's face showed a trace of regret but he did not press, saying with easy grace, "Very well, then consider my words never spoken."

"Farewell, take care." Yang Kai rose, bowed slightly, then flickered from the hidden burrow and shot off in the chosen direction.

After Yang Kai left, the black-haired elder within the burrow looked at Min Sha suspiciously and said, "Min, why did you invite that brat? His strength isn't that great!"

The others wore puzzled expressions too, not knowing Min Sha's intention.

Min Sha laughed and explained, "Though his strength is modest, since he escaped alive from that variant of the Seven-Colored Stag his speed must be top-notch. I invited him only to use him as a scout. Since he declined, so be it."

The others suddenly understood.

"Putting that aside, we should study how to slay that Seven-Colored Stag variant; if we can kill it, the value of its musk gland and Inner Core would be considerable!" Min Sha's face turned serious.

They all nodded and began detailed planning, unaware that the Seven-Colored Stag variant had already been slain by Yang Kai and its musk gland and Inner Core were already stowed in his Spatial Ring.

At this moment Yang Kai was flying toward the Imperial Garden's direction.

According to Min Sha, the Imperial Garden lay ten thousand li to the west; even with Yang Kai's speed it would take him two or three days to reach, so there was no rush.

On the surface he appeared calm and indifferent, but inside his thoughts churned with anticipation!

Filled with longing.

He longed to encounter Su Yan here!
