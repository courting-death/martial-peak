## Chapter 1092 — Picked Up by Someone

In the vast Star Domain, a warship carefully steered clear of the ever-present meteorites as it pressed on toward its destination.

The warship was small, less than twenty zhang in length — the tiniest class of warship in the Star Domain — its grade barely qualifying as Saint King-Grade Lower-Level. The hull was not very sturdy; the pitted dents on its surface showed the scars left by meteorite strikes during previous voyages through the Star Domain.

If this had been a higher-grade warship, such damage would have been impossible.

This little vessel sailed like one walking on thin ice through the Star Domain, seemingly laden with cargo, and so it did not move quickly.

Inside the hull, about sixty warriors of varying cultivation sat performing their duties, each going about their tasks yet visibly bored within the ship.

They had been sent out to mine ore, spending half a year on a mining star; only a few days ago they finally filled the warship and set off to return.

A hundred had left, but nearly half were missing on the way back — for some reason the mining planet had been overrun by savage star beasts, and many companions were slain while they worked.

They were already grateful to return alive; there was nothing to complain about.

Six hard months could buy them many years of carefree living; everyone was pleased. On return they would receive generous rewards, opportunities to learn higher Martial Skills, and perhaps even obtain higher-grade Secret Treasures. All were lost in such daydreams as they awaited the ship's triumphal return.

Wu Yi was the supervisor of the warship, cultivating at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm. For someone her age on Dark Star, that level already marked her as having considerable talent, and the clan elders even declared that if she trained diligently she would eventually reach the Origin Returning Realm.

Her strength aboard the warship wasn't the greatest. The strongest was a clan devotee who had come along — a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — but he was very old. Apart from manning the ship and guaranteeing its safety, he paid no attention to anything else; even Wu Yi had no right to order him to do anything.

There were a few other Saint King Realm practitioners as well — when out mining, some measure of strength was a necessity.

Wu Yi now stood in the ship's engine room. Through the transparent window she gazed at the star-sprinkled Starry Sky, her beautiful eyes full of longing.

Dark Star was her homeland. But the Spiritual Qi there could not compare with the cultivation stars elsewhere in the Star Domain; resources were barren, supplies meager, there were no high-grade heaven-and-earth treasures, and no formidable experts.

The mightiest on Dark Star was only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, reportedly already two thousand years old and feeble with age — no one knew if he could still go toe-to-toe in combat.

Furthermore, Dark Star lay in a relatively remote corner of the Hengluo Star Domain. The state of the many nearby Dead Stars made it clear that reaching a mining star often required months of travel, and during that time everyone trembled with fear of encountering great danger that might destroy the ship and cost lives.

Because it was remote and barren, the major forces in the Star Domain seldom concerned themselves with this region; even those utterly villainous ruffians from the Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest would not come here to plunder.

Though Dark Star was part of the Star Domain, it seemed to have been left to itself and forgotten by the world.

Wu Yi longed to leave Dark Star and see the outside world. While she was still young she wanted to witness the splendour of other cultivation stars. Those who had been to other cultivation stars spoke of things unseen on Dark Star: Void King Realm experts, wonders beyond imagination, astonishingly rapid cultivation progress, Saint Crystals in abundance, and Pills in all varieties.

Compared to those from the cultivation stars, Wu Yi felt like an untraveled country bumpkin, a proper rustic.

She yearned for everything beyond, but the clan's circumstances bound her wings. From the time she was sensible she had been contributing to her people; everyone knew mining missions were perilous — of ten ships dispatched, five returning was considered fortunate — and no one wanted the assignment. She had no choice but to volunteer, and the elders' approving eyes entrusted the task to her.

They thought she was a woman; even if she died by accident out there it would not damage the clan's foundation, so they readily agreed.

Had it been one of the direct-line males, the elders certainly would not have permitted it.

A bunch of short-sighted fools — no wonder they could only wait to die on Dark Star!

What of being a woman? Wu Yi snorted softly, clenching her fist and vowing inwardly that one day she would leave Dark Star, break free from the suffocating cage, seek her freedom, and behold a vaster, more splendid world.

"Miss!" A practitioner at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm hurried over, his eyes greedily lingering over Wu Yi's perky curves and smooth back before he quickly dropped his gaze as if looking away.

"What's the matter?" Wu Yi turned to him. "I just saw Yu Feng lead people out — what did they go to do?"

"Lord Yu Feng just found a blood-red ore nearby. Thinking it might be something valuable, he took people out to retrieve it, but it turned out not to be what he expected," the man hurriedly reported.

"Oh? What was the situation?" Wu Yi immediately grew curious. She had earlier seen Yu Feng leading a few people on a Star Shuttle into the Starry Sky, and indeed he had returned carrying something — a blood-red ore.

"Better for Miss to see for herself; I can't describe it properly," the man forced a laugh.

Wu Yi's delicate brows knit; after a moment she said, "Lead the way."

Confined aboard the ship day after day was driving her nearly mad, and something novel naturally caught her interest. Perhaps Yu Feng had thought the same and rashly left the ship to snatch that blood-red ore from the Starry Sky.

In one corner of the ship a large group had gathered around a crystal roughly three zhang in diameter, like a blood-coloured silkworm cocoon, murmuring with amazement. Although everyone was wildly curious, no one dared approach the crystal except Yu Feng who had brought it back.

Yu Feng looked at his companions with disdain and snorted, "It's just that there's a corpse inside — what's to be afraid of?"

Saying that, he even patted the huge blood-red crystal.

"Yu Feng, what did you find?" A clear, melodious voice sounded from beside them. At the sound, everyone straightened, their formerly careless demeanors replaced with their best faces. Yu Feng straightened his spine and tried to look mature and reliable.

The crowd parted as Wu Yi approached, the fragrance she carried filling the small room and causing the men to sniff greedily at the air, each wearing a pleased expression.

Wu Yi shook her head; being the only woman aboard, these wolfish men were surely long starved for company. She paid little mind to her subordinates' vulgar displays — they were shameless enough that rebukes only made them grin, as if being scolded were an honor, which left Wu Yi exasperated.

Over time she had learned to ignore them; the more attention she gave, the bolder they became.

Yu Feng, however, would not tolerate it. He rushed at the most blatant sniffers and felled them with a few fists and kicks, bearing a ferocious expression as he declared, "Whoever dares be disrespectful to the Miss, I'll take their life — behave yourselves, no rude business."

He panted heavily as if gasping for air.

"Alright, enough." Wu Yi waved a hand and stepped up to the silkworm-like blood-red crystal. "Is this what you found?"

"Yes, Miss," Yu Feng hurried to her side and pointed to the crystal. "I thought it might be some treasure, but up close I found it wasn't as I imagined. There's a person inside — poor thing. I don't know how long he's been dead. I saw him drifting in the Starry Sky and couldn't bear it, so I brought him back intending to bury him on Dark Star."

Wu Yi nodded gently. "Compassion is good. Given how hot-headed you usually are, I didn't expect such a side to you."

Receiving praise, Yu Feng's grin split his face shamelessly as he boasted, "Actually I'm just rough-looking; inside I'm very gentle."

A sudden chorus of scornful hisses rose.

Wu Yi wanted to laugh but restrained herself, covering her mouth with a small hand to hide it, then steered the topic, "Are you certain the person inside is dead?"

Yu Feng paused. "He's in that state — how could he still be alive?"

Wu Yi studied the man sealed within the blood crystal carefully. He appeared no older than thirty, not particularly handsome but far better-looking than the ship's motley crew; even with his eyes closed a strange air of grace emanated from that cold countenance.

She sent out her Divine Sense to see if any life flickered within, but to her surprise the blood-red crystal blocked her Divine Sense entirely, which left her astonished and uneasy.

“Go and invite Elder Chang Qi,” Wu Yi said in a low voice. “Have him take a look and determine whether this man is dead or alive.”

Someone at once took the order. Gongfeng Chang Qi was the ship's strongest, at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; were he not so old he might have hope of breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm. He was widely experienced and might recognize what the blood-red crystallization was.

"Why bring Chang Qi here?" Yu Feng laughed loudly, hopping to the crystal and patting it lightly. "Even if this fellow were alive, I doubt he could get out. I tried just now — no matter how hard I struck, I couldn't break this crystal; not a single mark was left. I don't even know what it is."
