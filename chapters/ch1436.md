## Chapter 1436 — Baptism

Could a martial artist's ascent into the Origin Returning Realm possibly be accompanied by such overwhelming fanfare?

The answer was obviously no!

As a peak Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm expert, Ye Xijun naturally had the right to speak on such matters. She had witnessed many take this step to become Origin Returning Realm cultivators—back when Ge Qi underwent his own breakthrough, she had personally stood guard for him. Yet none of those scenes could compare to the one before her now.

This could already be called a heavenly anomaly!

Ye Xijun's expression was aghast, and she couldn't help but recall an entry she had seen long ago in an ancient tome: if a martial artist's strength was sufficiently great, then when they rose to a major realm they could cause certain changes in heaven and earth.

Of course, such martial artists were like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns in the rolling river of history—so rare that thousands or tens of thousands of years might pass without one appearing.

Could the Sect Master have that potential?

To be fair, Ye Xijun and Yang Kai were not especially close and were unfamiliar with each other; her staying in Lingxiao Sect and holding the title of Great Elder was entirely because of Yang Yan. Apart from Yang Yan, she had never given anyone else a second glance.

With her discernment, she could naturally see that Yang Kai was far stronger than an ordinary Saint King Realm, an elite among elites; yet even so, it did not affect her much.

But at this moment, she couldn't help but look at Yang Kai with newfound respect; if her guess was true, then no one could fathom the Sect Master's future!

At that thought, an unusual light flashed in Ye Xijun's beautiful eyes, and she found herself strangely hopeful.

In the sky, within the gigantic Spiritual Qi funnel, there were energy fluctuations enough to destroy heaven and earth, and as the five-element heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi kept pouring in, the funnel itself began to shimmer with brilliant colors, hanging inverted above Tianyi Palace and spinning, appearing terrifying beyond measure.

Even standing three li away, everyone could feel that crushing oppression raining down like mountains collapsing and the earth splitting—let alone Yang Kai beneath the funnel. No one knew how much pressure he was enduring now.

Outside Tianyi Palace, lights flashed wildly—those were the many restrictions of Tianyi Palace reacting to the pressure.

"Great Elder, how is the Sect Master?" Chang Qi and the others were anxious and uneasy, but dared not unleash Divine Sense to spy; they had to ask Ye Xijun.

"It looks fairly smooth—he's already touched the laws of heaven and earth," Ye Xijun replied calmly.

Chang Qi and the others brightened at her words; touching the laws of heaven and earth meant Yang Kai's breakthrough was imminent.

"But whether he succeeds depends on whether he can withstand the Heaven-and-Earth Energy's Baptism."

Faces changed; everyone fell silent, wearing looks of worry.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism was a necessary process for a martial artist ascending a major realm. In it, the martial artist would endure unimaginable trials and pain; it was the best test and measure of a martial artist's overall quality. If successful, their strength would increase dramatically, breaking through the bottleneck and reaching the next realm.

If he failed...

At best he'd be grievously wounded; at worst his body would explode and he'd die!

After all, this was the Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism—if one failed, the result certainly wouldn't be good.

Every year countless martial artists fell at this threshold, so for a martial artist, breaking a major realm was both opportunity and challenge—the survival law of the fittest was displayed in full.

Ordinary martial artists' ascents into a major realm never caused such shocking heavenly anomalies. Yang Kai had done it, which was both joyous and startling. But having reached this stage, success was the only acceptable outcome.

Judging by the degree of Heaven-and-Earth Energy gathering at this moment, if Yang Kai failed there would be only one ending—his soul scattered and vanished!

After all, the power contained within that brilliantly colored Spiritual Qi funnel was too immense; it was not something a Saint King Realm martial artist could endure.

Just as everyone fretted, the huge Spiritual Qi funnel in the sky suddenly changed, as if something within Tianyi Palace had attracted it. The funnel rapidly spun, and the vast ocean-like Heaven-and-Earth Energy followed the funnel's direction, thundering downward.

There was no pause or hesitation, as if it had been building up for a long time only for this one explosive release!

The layers of restrictions of Tianyi Palace were paper-thin before such unfathomably massive Heaven-and-Earth Energy; in an instant they were shattered. The dazzling five-colored Spiritual Qi that had made Ye Xijun's face change streamed straight into Tianyi Palace and quickly disappeared.

The gigantic Spiritual Qi funnel visibly shrank; in just a few breaths its volume reduced by a cycle.

"Sect Master!" Chang Qi and the others cried out in alarm, faces contorting.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy poured down like that— they could hardly believe their eyes! They had all ascended the Origin Returning Realm and experienced this stage.

But when they experienced the energy Baptism, the energy had struck like lightning in waves, surging into their bodies with time intervals; though immense, it had given them moments to catch their breath and adjust.

What unfolded now was clearly not like that—Yang Kai had no chance to pause and breathe.

Even if Yang Kai were extremely powerful, how could he possibly escape harm before such heavenly might?

Chang Qi and the others went deathly pale, instinctively thinking Yang Kai was as good as dead.

Even Ye Xijun couldn’t help but sigh softly, a trace of disappointment crossing her face. She had thought she’d encountered one of those peerless geniuses that appeared only once in millennia—but it seemed the boy was nothing more than a fleeting bloom after all.

But soon her brows knit and bright light flickered in her eyes; her expression turned to astonishment.

Because the huge Spiritual Qi funnel did not dissipate; it continued pouring that astonishing Heaven-and-Earth Energy, with thunderous sounds rumbling from within, deafening to the ears.

He wasn't dead!

Ye Xijun raised an eyebrow, greatly surprised.

If Yang Kai had died, the heavenly anomaly produced by his ascent would naturally have disappeared. The funnel's continued existence meant he had not died but was enduring the Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism!

That was also the crucial step in breaking a major realm.

Listening closely, Ye Xijun clearly heard, amid the rumbling, a muffled, tormented roar.

He truly wasn't dead. Ye Xijun's eyes brightened as she glanced at Yang Yan and found her even calmer than herself, seemingly having anticipated this; yet a closer look revealed Yang Yan's fists had quietly clenched, her eyes full of worry and anxiety.

The Lingxiao Sect crowd stood on tenterhooks. The experts from Yingyue Hall, Qiantian Sect's Liuli Sect, and Piaomiao Hall were all horrified as well.

"Elder, can Brother Yang withstand such an energy Baptism?" Wei Guchang asked urgently.

"I dare not judge rashly, but at this point, if he cannot endure it, there is nothing but death!" Qian Tong frowned and sighed—he had not expected Yang Kai's ascent to the Origin Returning Realm to cause such a commotion and such bizarre scenes, and he was worried for him.

"It's not necessarily that he can't endure it..." Gu Zhen, sect master of Qiantian Sect, pondered. "If his body is strong enough, he might accept these Heaven-and-Earth Energies in a short time—it's just... very difficult!"

The Hall Master and Great Elder of Piaomiao Hall did not speak, but when they looked that way their expressions flickered with doubt and astonishment.

After exchanging a glance, Gong Xinghe and Gong Aofu wore looks of shock. They had previously thought Lingxiao Sect's fame came from its special terrain and the presence of Ye Xijun.

But now, it seemed that the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect was far from an ordinary man. He was worth reassessing. If he were to fall here, all would be well—after all, with Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect already dominating Dark Star, Gong Xinghe had no desire to see another power rise among them. Yet if that man truly succeeded… then it might be worth forging a good relationship with him.

Thoughts differed among the crowd, but everyone's attention was fixed on the gigantic five-colored Spiritual Qi funnel. In a short time the funnel seemed much smaller—only half the size it had been—and it was rapidly shrinking.

After a while, to everyone's eyes, the huge five-colored funnel vanished; the Heaven-and-Earth Energy once contained within had all surged into Tianyi Palace. The oppressive atmosphere and that terrifying sense of pressure dissipated, the sky returned to clear, bright sunlight poured down, and the blue expanse was spotless.

Only a few residual streaks of five-colored Spiritual Qi drifted above Tianyi Palace like fish that had slipped through the net.

The entire Lingxiao Sect fell silent; all gazes focused on Tianyi Palace, wanting to know the outcome there.

But there was no movement there—only a stillness as if Yang Kai had truly perished.

Wu Yi and Qian Yue's faces drained of color!

Failed? Wu Yi and the others couldn't bear to think further; the scene could be explained by nothing else.

No martial artist could endure such a vast Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism in such a short time; even a peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not, let alone Yang Kai, who had originally only been a peak Saint King Realm.

Though the two women were not at that realm, their sight was at least somewhat perceptive.

Chang Qi and the others were ashen.

"Why the long faces?" Ye Xijun's brows lightly knit. "Do you think he's dead?"

Chang Qi's expression jolted; he looked at her in astonishment and hesitantly said, "Great Elder, are you saying..."
