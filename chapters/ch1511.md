## Chapter 1511 — Instant Kill

Among those dozen or so people, the leader was ruddy-faced, with a bulbous, drink-stained nose and squinting eyes, his hair a messy tangle that made him look rather comical, yet the powerful aura emanating from him could not be underestimated.

A Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert!

"It's Battle Sky Alliance's Second Elder, Lu Feng!"

"Even he was alerted; those around him are all Battle Sky Alliance's elite—this will be entertaining."

"What on earth is this Lingxiao Sect to be so arrogant?"

"Whatever their background, Lu Feng has a fierce temper; he won't let them off easy, heh heh—watch and see."

Voices chattered from all sides as people craned their necks to stare at the sky, waiting for the spectacle to unfold.

Within the Battle Sky Alliance, experts were plentiful; there were no fewer than ten at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm alone, but among them the one who could hold the rank of Second Elder—Lu Feng—was already famed far and wide.

Yang Kai had already met the Great Elder Mo Xiaosheng and the Third Elder Liang Yong—both were undoubtedly formidable—but compared to this Lu Feng, they lacked a certain viciousness. Thus, within the Battle Sky Alliance, Lu Feng held the post of Law Enforcement Elder, responsible for punishing disciples who violated the Alliance’s rules.

Those who fell into his hands rarely came out unscathed.

He was the one the Battle Sky Alliance's disciples feared most.

Lu Feng had been handling some trivial matters in the outer city and had not expected to run into this scene, so he rushed over at once.

At a glance he saw that Battle Sky City had been cleared by the enemy's Crystal Cannon to form a passage several hundred zhang long; houses nearby had collapsed to ruins and everything had been reduced to nothing, and fury flared up inside Lu Feng.

The Battle Sky Alliance had enjoyed its prestige for so many years—this had truly never occurred before.

Staring coolly at the dozen-or-so zhang-long, pitch-black warship, Lu Feng roared, "What rat scum dares to rampage in Battle Sky City? Come out at once and meet your death!"

His voice thundered like a great bell, deafening and earth-shaking, echoing across Battle Sky City; anyone could sense Lu Feng's rage in that instant.

The warship remained utterly silent, offering no answer, no retort. Not even the slightest movement could be detected; it simply hovered in midair, so still it seemed empty within.

Yet an inexplicable pressure pressed down like a ten-thousand-gold boulder upon the hearts of those present.

"Very well. You dare to hold this elder in contempt, thinking that hiding inside will render you untouchable? A mere warship—watch me smash it to pieces!" he roared.

As he spoke, Saint Yuan surged wildly through his body; with a flick of his wrist a massive axe appeared in his hand, heavy and powerful, a full man's height, snow-white throughout, its blade unmatched in sharpness.

Saint Yuan was poured into it; the secret-treasure axe burst into blinding light, and Lu Feng raised it high as a colossal axe-phantom formed from refined energy.

The axe-phantom stretched some dozen or so zhang in length, as if the great axe had been magnified a hundredfold, and from it rolled chilling waves of energy.

The onlookers' faces all changed.

Great reputations are not earned lightly; Lu Feng, as a Third Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance, was by no means an ordinary Third Stage expert.

The moment the Third Elder acted, the others who had come along would naturally not stand idly by; they unleashed secret treasures and secret arts, and in an instant a riot of colored lights erupted.

Under Lu Feng's control the enormous axe-phantom descended like a falling guillotine, ruthlessly cleaving toward the warship with overwhelming momentum.

Other attacks followed in succession.

Boom, boom, boom...

A string of violent detonations resounded as terrifying waves of energy collided where the warship hovered.

Yet the warship did not budge; only a faint, seemingly fragile film appeared on its surface.

All assaults were stopped by that thin membrane; none made the slightest impression.

Eyes everywhere widened; even the arrogant, haughty Lu Feng could not help gaping, almost thinking he had seen wrongly as he cried out, "Impossible!"

He knew the nature of his own strike; that blow, though appearing casually delivered, had been his full-strength, strongest attack—yet still it had failed to move the warship at all.

Even if that were a Void King-Grade warship, it should not be so indomitable!

That seemingly delicate protective membrane actually possessed such tremendous defensive power?

While he stood stunned, a soft hum came from inside the warship, and then from a point on the vessel a series of intricate, arcane patterns shot out, visible to the naked eye, assembling in midair.

In the blink of an eye those patterns condensed into a grand formation.

Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth poured madly and swiftly into the formation.

Something slowly revealed itself within the array, as if summoned from boundless emptiness.

Very quickly, the object manifested before everyone's eyes.

It was a spear formed purely of energy, as thick as a child's arm and seven or eight zhang long, fierce beyond measure.

The spear trembled slightly, tore through the heavens, disregarding spatial barriers, and thundered toward Lu Feng and the dozen or so Battle Sky Alliance disciples.

"No good!" Lu Feng's face changed dramatically as he shouted.

From his strike to the warship's counterattack it all occurred in a flash; he had not expected such decisiveness—without any warning they had struck a deadly blow, and by the time he sought to evade it was already too late.

Forced, he could only toss out his defensive secret treasure, which turned into a water-blue light curtain to shield them.

The water-blue curtain had barely formed when it was shattered.

A beam of light pierced through where Lu Feng and his dozen companions had stood and continued onward toward the inner city of Battle Sky City, and only after ten breaths did a violent impact sound from that distant inner city.

When everyone looked again, where Lu Feng and his men had stood there was not a single person; only crimson mist and blood hung in the air, scattering down in droplets.

The onlookers were aghast, staring at the void in disbelief as if they had seen a vengeful spirit.

That strike was not the power of a Crystal Cannon, yet it was even more terrifying.

Each person's spine chilled; dread swelled in their hearts, and their looks toward the warship had changed—no one could ignore the killing power it had just unleashed.

The commanding voice from within the warship sounded once more: "Time is short. Those who wish to leave Battle Sky City should depart at once. When the time comes, Lingxiao Sect will attack this place; those who remain will bear the consequences."

Battle Sky City fell silent for a moment, then countless warriors fled the city in droves, no longer daring to linger or to watch.

They had originally thought a single warship was nothing remarkable; the Battle Sky Alliance had innumerable experts—no matter how strong the ship, they believed lives could be thrown away to destroy it.

But Lu Feng's miserable death changed their minds.

Even someone like Lu Feng could not budge the warship, nor survive its single strike—today's events would spell grave trouble for the Battle Sky Alliance.

In that moment everyone regarded the warship as a force capable of threatening the Battle Sky Alliance.

Watching the show was one thing—but none of them intended to stake their lives on it. Naturally, they fled as far as their legs could carry them.

Inside the warship, Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction as he sensed those warriors departing.

From the intelligence he had gathered earlier, Yang Kai knew Battle Sky City housed tens of millions of warriors, yet only a few hundred at most were connected to the Battle Sky Alliance—he did not want to harm too many innocents and provoke mass fury.

No matter how formidable a warship, it could not withstand tens of millions attacking together; every defense had its limits.

Fortunately, the scene before him was to his liking.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, who had come to assist, stood rooted to the spot, stunned for a long while.

Though they had come to lend aid, they were truly shaken by the warship's power.

They had never seen how terrifying a Void King-Grade warship could be, but by their estimation this Lingxiao Sect vessel was likely a top-tier exemplar even among Void King-Grade ships.

"Sect Master, that Heaven-Punishing Sacred Spear Formation seems formidable," Ye Xijun reported softly. "Even if I were struck, I would likely be grievously wounded beyond recovery."

"Naturally—the things refined by Yang Yan are always top-tier," Yang Kai grinned.

After the Dragon Lair Mountain battle, the world only knew that the Lingxiao Sect possessed a Void King-Grade warship and that its Crystal Cannon was devastating; they had no idea Yang Yan had painstakingly equipped the vessel with countless terrifying killing devices.

The earlier Heaven-Punishing Sacred Spear Formation and the protective membrane were merely the tip of the iceberg.

With this single warship Yang Kai had confidence he could level Battle Sky City; otherwise he would not have come here so aggressively to strike at the Battle Sky Alliance.

"But the Origin Saint Crystal consumption is rather large—more than five times that of the Crystal Cannon!" Ye Xijun frowned.

"No matter; we are not short on Origin Saint Crystal presently," Yang Kai chuckled.

The warship's destructive power owed much to the Origin Saint Crystal; had they relied on ordinary Saint Crystals to power the protective membrane and the Heaven-Punishing Sacred Spear Formation, the potency would have been roughly halved.

The Origin Saint Crystals were different—the energy they contained was vast and pure, incomparable to Saint Crystals.

Only Stone Puppets could manufacture such things; three or four Upper-Level Saint Crystals swallowed into their bellies could be refined into a single Origin Saint Crystal, which shows how precious they were.

Previously Yang Kai had only one Stone Puppet, Xiaoxiao, but now he had two, so the rate of Origin Saint Crystal production had greatly increased; as long as Saint Crystals kept coming, Origin Saint Crystals would not be a problem.

"Yang Kai, about those Origin Saint Crystals..." Qian Tong snickered beside him, then fell silent, seeming somewhat embarrassed.

“If Elder wants some, once this matter is settled, I’ll give you and City Lord Fei a few. Using those for cultivation is indeed better than Saint Crystals,” Yang Kai said, fully aware of what he meant, and spoke generously.

"If so, I will accept with gratitude," Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exchanged a glance, both elated.

Since entering the warship they had been exclaiming in wonder; its interior was far grander than it appeared from the outside, clearly made using Spatial Force, and everything within set their hearts racing—especially those Origin Saint Crystals serving as power sources.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had never seen such things before.
