## Chapter 1995 — Altar

If someone like that martial artist from a moment ago were transported here, they would very likely meet with misfortune; after all, not every Void King Realm warrior could, like Yang Kai, shrug off the discomfort of such teleportation.

They all more or less experienced a wave of dizziness.

At that thought, Yang Kai immediately leapt lightly, intending to leave quickly.

But something he had never expected happened.

He had only leapt to a height of less than three zhang when a tremendous pressure suddenly came from the void, as if a mountain pressed down from the sky, and it forced him straight back to where he had been.

He did not even have a chance to resist.

"Flight-restricting Grand Array?" Yang Kai's face darkened as he instantly realized what it was.

Earlier, when Kang Siran was describing the interior of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda to him, he had said that within the pagoda there were many natural and artificial restrictions and traps, their functions varied wildly. Among them, flight-restriction was one of the most common.

In these zones, cultivators simply could not soar very high; the moment they rose past a certain altitude, the restriction would activate and slam them back down.

What Yang Kai had just run into was the rebounding force of the Flight-Restricting Grand Array.

For the moment he did not know whether this array was man-made or naturally formed.

He had no time to ponder, because the instant he fell, countless concealed crocodile demonic beasts leaped up from all directions and pounced on him; those gaping maws were chilling, hair-raising.

Yang Kai shifted his power and struck out with both fists. In an instant the sounds of impact rang out without pause.

In the blink of an eye he had knocked dozens of crocodiles aside, but these things possessed astonishing stamina; even when struck squarely by Yang Kai none were killed outright, instead they spun and dove into the mud and disappeared.

And more crocodiles came, advancing in ruthless succession.

Soon Yang Kai was covered in crocodiles—on his hands, his arms, his thighs—bitten and aching painfully.

Crocodiles naturally had terrifying bite force even among ordinary beasts and could not be taken lightly; moreover these were all Demonic Beasts that had reached the Ninth-Tier peak.

An ordinary Void King Realm cultivator, even if they exerted power to resist, could not withstand the bite of a single crocodile Demonic Beast.

Fortunately Yang Kai's body was hardy; when he activated the Undying Five Elements Sword body the fierce five-element sword qi caused heavy injuries to those crocodiles—many spat blood and were forced to release him.

Yet Yang Kai was still dragged down by those crocodiles and sank into the mud.

Underwater it was cold and dark, and most importantly it was not clear water but filthy mud; even if Yang Kai opened his eyes he could not see much. He flailed out a few punches only to find his situation worsening as he sank deeper, and the besieging crocodiles kept multiplying, which made his head throb.

"Secret Art, Moon Blade!"

His ten fingers flicked and one after another ink-black Moon Blades flew out with a hissing sound, greatly reducing the pressure on Yang Kai.

In the quagmire crimson blood surfaced along with the mangled corpses of dead crocodiles.

"Demon Eye, open!" When Yang Kai opened his eyes again his left eye glowed golden-yellow and his vision recovered considerably.

Under Divine Sense perception he realized that his slaughter had not driven the crocodiles away; instead the blood and the commotion had attracted even more Demonic Beasts.

"Reckless fools!" Yang Kai snapped in fury. With his current strength, even an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator shouldn't have thrown him into such disarray, yet from a single moment's lapse he had been driven into this state by a pack of demonic beasts.

This left him both angry and ashamed.

With a wave of his hand Yang Kai directly released the Yao Worm Matriarch, which was still repairing its body in the Small Xuan Realm, and issued orders to it by Divine Sense.

The Yao Worm Matriarch now counted as Yang Kai's Blood Beast and possessed a dim intelligence of its own; it naturally obeyed his commands strictly.

The Purple-Green Twin Swords swung, twin-colored light flashing as surging sword waves rose up.

Crackle...

A frigid profound intent spread, making Yang Kai involuntarily shiver, and the attacking crocodile Demonic Beasts slowed their movements.

Light flashed and sword radiance surged; one by one the crocodile Demonic Beasts were cut in two and died instantly, and even those further away were not spared.

With the Purple-Green Twin Swords in hand, the Yao Worm Matriarch seemed greatly empowered; even without using the Snow Like Clear Sky secret art, its simplest sword moves shone brilliantly.

Yang Kai snorted and was preparing to take the chance to break free when the corner of his eye suddenly caught sight of an odd spot.

In the depths of the quagmire there was a place emitting a clear radiance.

When he probed it with Divine Sense he detected a faint yet not weak fluctuation of energy.

Yang Kai could not help but brighten; he hastened to bolster his body with force and dove down, the Yao Worm Matriarch faithfully guarding at his side, and whenever anyone interfered a flash of sword light would split the enemy in two.

Before long Yang Kai had plunged deep and arrived at the place that emitted the clear radiance.

With the power of the World-Ending Demon Eye he at last saw clearly what the thing was.

It was a palm-sized object that resembled a lingzhi.

"What is this..." Yang Kai looked bewildered.

Although he knew a great deal about medicinal materials from his native Star Domain, after coming to the Star Realm he still felt his knowledge was insufficient, particularly regarding spiritual herbs and miraculous medicines—many things he had never even heard of.

He had neither seen nor heard of this lingzhi-like thing before.

As he observed, the clear radiance turned green.

After a while it changed to red...

Pondering within the limits of his knowledge, Yang Kai confirmed he did not recognize it, but judging from the aura it emitted it was undoubtedly a Dao Origin-Grade medicinal material.

He decided to collect it first; in any case the herb garden in the Small Xuan Realm still existed—he could transplant it there and some day learn its species and effects.

With that thought he immediately set to work.

After a short while he had transplanted this lingzhi-like herb into the herb garden of the Small Xuan Realm.

Having done this, he did not rush out but continued to search around.

He actually found several identical specimens.

Only half a day later Yang Kai burst out of the quagmire, the Yao Worm Matriarch close behind; along the way countless crocodile Demonic Beast corpses floated to the surface, and the marsh stretching for tens to hundreds of li had been stained red with blood.

It seemed the Yao Worm Matriarch’s savagery and tenacity had cowed the crocodile Demonic Beasts—or perhaps most of them had already been slain. In any case, Yang Kai finally met few further attacks and managed to break the surface unimpeded.

This time he did not act rashly; he rose to a height of one zhang above the water and proceeded outward.

There were many varieties of Flight-restricting Grand Arrays—some completely forbade flight, others limited flight height. Judging from his first encounter, the Flight-restricting Grand Array here was undoubtedly the latter, so as long as he did not exceed a certain height the array would not trigger.

The swamp covered a vast area; Yang Kai flew for a full half day before finally emerging.

He had already withdrawn the Yao Worm Matriarch.

The Yao Worm Matriarch was still repairing its body; throwing it into battle too early would not benefit it, and Yang Kai did not want others to know he had such an aid. The Yao Worm Matriarch had become his greatest trump card and was best kept hidden.

How vast the interior space of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda might be he did not know; Fenglin City had sent tens of thousands of martial artists in here, yet Yang Kai had not encountered a single person along his way.

He looked around but could not find his target and felt somewhat disappointed.

This ought to be the first floor of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Kang Siran had told him to try to reach the second floor; although both the first and second floors were suitable for Void King Realm cultivators to train, for those at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm it was naturally better to go to the second floor.

And the way to enter was to find a Five-Colored Pillar of Light that connected heaven and earth.

Yang Kai had been searching for that so-called Five-Colored Pillar of Light but had not found it, which left him somewhat disappointed and unsure which direction to go.

As he scanned the surroundings, the ground suddenly hummed and then shook violently; from deep within the earth there rolled a thunderous sound that stunned the ears.

Yang Kai's expression changed; he hurriedly circulated Saint Yuan and looked around warily for any disturbance.

There was nothing special nearby, but in a very distant spot a true dragon phantom suddenly materialized.

The true dragon's length could not be estimated; it was entirely fire-red, its tail swaying, it shot straight into the clouds, then descended at great speed to some unknown location before vanishing.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

He had never imagined that within the first floor of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda a true dragon phantom would appear.

It was absolutely not some secret art or technique, but a genuine true dragon phantom, and it was even related to the True Dragon's Secret Treasure, for when that phantom appeared Yang Kai distinctly felt heat at his chest.

At his chest a real dragon scale had fused and been refined.

That dragon scale was, at that moment, resonating with something in the distance.

Yang Kai immediately realized this might be an immense opportunity.

No wonder the rumors said that opportunities were everywhere inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; the lucky ones who entered might obtain many benefits, while the unlucky, no matter how powerful or how many times they entered, would gain nothing.

With that in mind he no longer hesitated and immediately rushed toward the spot where the anomaly had appeared.

The place where the true dragon phantom had appeared was far from him; even with Yang Kai pushing himself to the limit, it still took a full three hours for him to arrive.

When he looked up Yang Kai could not help but be stunned.

Many martial artists had already gathered there—by rough count there were hundreds—and cultivators who, like him, had seen the phenomenon kept arriving in a steady stream.

The terrain was valley-like, and at the very center a structure in the shape of an altar had suddenly appeared as if freshly unearthed, an ancient and desolate aura spreading out while the surrounding earth showed signs of freshly turned soil.
