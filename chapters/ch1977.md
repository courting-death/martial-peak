## Chapter 1977 — Pill Formula

In the side room, Yang Kai sat down, but he did not hurry to touch the tea before him.

The proprietor of the Spiritual Pill shop was a touch overly enthusiastic, which made Yang Kai feel the man was being obsequious for no reason—either scheming or thieving—so he showed the caution that was appropriate.

Kang Siran obviously noticed that too, but paid it no mind; he smiled faintly and said, "I heard the guest is here to buy pill formulas?"

"Exactly!" Yang Kai nodded.

Kang Siran's eyes brightened as he said, "If that's so, the guest must be an alchemist?"

Yang Kai frowned slightly and said coolly, "Does your establishment, while selling things, also probe into customers' backgrounds?"

There was a trace of reproach in his tone, yet Kang Siran showed no anger; wearing an apologetic expression he said, "Young Master Yang, please do not take offence — this old man is at fault. Allow me to offer my earnest apologies."

As he spoke, he truly drained the tea from his cup in a single swallow.

He wiped the moisture from his chin and said, "If the guest truly is an alchemist, and your alchemist rank is high enough, whatever pill formulas you need this old man can present to you."

"What do you mean by that?" Yang Kai was puzzled by him.

Kang Siran let out a wry smile and did not answer at once, as if weighing his words; after a moment he said, "In that case, this old man will be frank."

"Please, Shopkeeper Kang, speak."

"It's like this," Kang Siran murmured, "Our Spiritual Pill shop is a little short on alchemists at the moment... If the guest is an alchemist of Void King-Grade or above, this old man would like to hire you as the shop's alchemist. The compensation will be absolutely generous — I have two proposals you can choose from: a fixed monthly salary, or a profit-sharing arrangement with the shop. Everything is up to you."

Yang Kai was taken aback and asked, "Your shop is short of alchemists?"

"To be honest," Kang Siran admitted, seeming to have fretted over the matter for some time, and now seeing a glimmer of hope he made no attempt to hide it, "Our shop originally had three alchemists, but a while ago two left, leaving only one. The Spiritual Pills we're producing are frankly not covering costs. That's why... but rest assured, any formulas our Spiritual Pill shop has you may consult — this old man would never hoard them."

That answer made Yang Kai's heart stir slightly. After all, he did not have many Source Crystals on hand. If he were to buy formulas outright, he might only be able to afford one or two ordinary ones; as for the formula for the Origin Condensing Pill — it would certainly be priceless, and with his current means it would be absolutely unaffordable.

He had originally planned only to first inquire about the prices of formulas, then gather Source Crystals to make a purchase.

He had not expected that upon coming to this Spiritual Pill shop he would encounter such an unexpected surprise.

Yang Kai asked evenly, "Why did those two alchemists suddenly leave? Could it be that Shopkeeper Kang offered insufficient pay?"

"Not at all," Kang Siran smiled helplessly, "I pride myself on fair prices and honesty in Fenglin City; the pay we offered those alchemists was by no means low. It's just that people strive for higher things — an eternal truth — and when greater benefits appear, it's only natural they chose to leave the shop."

Hearing him say that, Yang Kai rather understood.

"They were poached!"

Kang Siran's expression showed a flash of annoyance as he nodded, "Exactly so. Our Spiritual Pill shop actually belongs to the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, while the Danqi Pavilion across the street is a business of the Qiyao Commerce Guild — it is only natural they'd target us."

"Ziyuan Commerce Guild, Qiyao Commerce Guild?" Yang Kai frowned.

"The guest hasn't heard of them?" Now it was Kang Siran's turn to be astonished.

Yang Kai gave an awkward smile and shook his head.

Kang Siran was stunned for a moment; he had not expected that Yang Kai, a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, would be unfamiliar with the names of these two major Commerce Guilds. In the Southern Territory, apart from the supreme overlord Star God Palace, the next tier of powers included great forces like the Ziyuan Commerce Guild and the Qiyao Commerce Guild.

How could Yang Kai's strength not be low, and yet he had not even heard of them?

But Kang Siran was a businessman above all and adept at reading people; to spare Yang Kai embarrassment he quickly smiled and said, "It seems the guest is a reclusive cultivator — no wonder you are youthful yet possess cultivation not inferior to this old man. I admire that."

Yang Kai gave a forced, dry laugh and said nothing further.

From what Kang Siran had let slip, it seemed the two Commerce Guilds were hostile toward each other, which was not hard to understand — competitors by trade naturally had rivalry between them.

The Qiyao Commerce Guild had offered higher pay and poached the two alchemists from the Spiritual Pill shop, leaving the shop in its current awkward position.

Without enough alchemists there would naturally not be sufficient Spiritual Pills, and over time patrons would stop coming; as the Shopkeeper, Kang Siran naturally watched this with great anxiety.

He had been searching for suitable alchemists, hoping to recruit them into the Spiritual Pill shop, but Fenglin City was not large within the Star Realm; even if there were alchemists, they already had affiliations, and the lower-grade ones, even if hired, were of little use.

That was why he had been so enthusiastic toward Yang Kai; when he heard Yang Kai had come to buy formulas he at once had the assistant bring him in.

Those who purchased formulas were undoubtedly alchemists; ordinary martial artists would not bother with formulas — they merely gathered materials and paid alchemists to refine them into pills.

"May I ask, what is the guest's alchemist rank?" Kang Siran laid out his predicament and then, somewhat nervous and somewhat expectant, looked at Yang Kai and asked.

If Yang Kai's alchemist rank was not high, there was no reason for him to waste time with him.

Yang Kai considered for a moment and said, "Refining Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills is no problem."

His answer was not complete and concealed something, but it was enough to satisfy Kang Siran.

Hearing Yang Kai admit he was a Void King-Grade alchemist in person, Kang Siran was overcome with excitement, his eyes full of earnestness.

Before Kang Siran could speak, Yang Kai interrupted, "Shopkeeper Kang, no need to explain. I refine pills only to obtain Source Crystals — a way to earn a living and a form of cultivation. I don't intend to do it long‑term; I might stop one day. You should seek someone more capable."

The man before him was sincere, and Yang Kai did not want to deceive, so he spoke plainly.

After all, to him pill refinement was merely a means of practice; he would not invest too much energy and time. If he agreed to Kang Siran's request it would be tantamount to selling himself to the Spiritual Pill shop, and his future time and freedom would be constrained.

That was not what Yang Kai wished to see.

"You won't refine long-term?" Kang Siran was taken aback for a moment, then laughed, "That is all right. If the guest can help this old man refine for three months... no, two months will do. I will not take up too much of your cultivation time."

"Only two months?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

"Indeed. Actually I have already reported this situation to the Commerce Guild headquarters, and they agreed to dispatch two alchemists here, but it will take some time — the road is long, and this place is small so the headquarters won't be overly attentive. It should take about two months, so guest, if you can help this old man through these two months that's all we ask."

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"What do you think? Will you consider it carefully?" Kang Siran asked anxiously.

He had been nearly driven mad by the matter; seeing a suitable candidate appear before him, he was determined not to miss the chance.

"If it's only two months... I suppose I could give it a try. But Shopkeeper Kang, about your shop's formulas..."

Before Yang Kai finished, Kang Siran waved his hand heartily, "If the guest truly becomes one of us, those formulas may be perused at will, and you may even copy them."

"May I ask what formulas you have? Do you have the Origin Condensing Pill among them?"

"The formula for the Origin Condensing Pill — almost every pill shop would have one, though each has some small differences. How is it that the guest, a Void King-Grade alchemist, would not be able to refine the Origin Condensing Pill?"

Kang Siran suddenly felt uneasy, thinking Yang Kai might have been bluffing — which Void King-Grade alchemist did not possess the Origin Condensing Pill formula? It was the pill most in demand by Void King Realm martial artists.

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly and could only say, "I was born in a rather remote place and there were not many formidable martial artists there, so..."

Although the explanation was full of loopholes, at least it was a reason.

Kang Siran did not press for details and did not want to be tiresome.

"Then, Shopkeeper Kang, list the formulas your shop has and give them to me; I'll go back and consider carefully. If it's acceptable, I will certainly return within three days." Yang Kai did not rashly agree — he was unfamiliar with this Spiritual Pill shop and with Kang Siran himself; who knew whether the man was outwardly respectable but inwardly false?

It was never wrong to be a little cautious.

"That will do. This old man will await your esteemed presence; please consider quickly — our Spiritual Pill shop is indeed a little short on pills now." Kang Siran knew the matter could not be rushed, so he agreed to Yang Kai's request.

He promptly compiled a catalogue of pill formulas and handed it to Yang Kai.

After taking his leave of Kang Siran, Yang Kai did not return to his lodgings but continued to wander the city.

Whenever he saw a shop that sold Spiritual Pills he went in and made inquiries.

Although his arrangement with Kang Siran had been tentatively made, he still wanted to see if he could purchase formulas from elsewhere; after all, working solo would be better than sharing profits with the Spiritual Pill shop, and the gains would be greater.

Of course, cooperating with the Spiritual Pill shop had its advantages — a steady clientele, ample materials, no worries about sales channels, and so on.
