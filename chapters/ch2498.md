## Chapter 2498 — The Bearing of a Great Emperor

While the two Great Emperors battled fiercely over there, Yang Kai here was gradually entering a wondrous state.

Threads of Emperor Intent slowly spread from within him. At first, it was barely noticeable, but as time passed, this Emperor Intent became increasingly distinct.

To ascend to the Emperor Realm, condensing one’s own Emperor Intent is the most basic requirement. Only by possessing one’s own Emperor Intent can one touch the threshold of the Emperor Realm and push open the supreme gate of the Martial Dao.

Dense Spiritual Qi gathered above Yang Kai’s head, forming a terrifying phenomenon. The oppressive Spiritual Qi clustered together like the sky was about to collapse. Thunder and lightning flashed within the clouds of Spiritual Qi, rumbling deafeningly.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, motionless, as scenes from his entire life flashed through his mind like a revolving lantern.

It wasn’t that he wanted to recall them; these memories simply surfaced uncontrollably, beyond his will.

Entering Lingxiao Pavilion, training arduously yet unable to find the way, bullied by many Senior Brothers, but never giving up his martial heart.

By chance, he obtained the Wordless Black Book, glimpsed the Demon God’s inheritance, and soared to the heavens from then on.

He fought in Zhongdu, traveled the Tongxuan Continent, entered the Starry Sky passage, broke into the Hengluo Star Domain, and entered the Star Realm…

The passion with Su Yan, the tenderness with Xia Ningshang, the tangled feelings with Shan Qingluo, and the fateful encounter with Xue Yue…

Tirelessly pursuing the peak of the Martial Dao, walking the path of seeking the Dao, accompanied by beauties. Though sometimes lonely, his heart always had something to hold onto.

In this life, no regrets, no resentment!

Along this road, no hatred, no remorse!

With no demons in his heart, no external force could invade!

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze clear and bright, shining like the stars. With a long howl, the surging energy within him instantly reached its peak.

Crackle…

Suddenly, countless cracking sounds came from all over his body. Bones, meridians, and flesh all writhed to their limits in that instant. His meridians became wider and tougher, and his flesh and bones grew even more solid.

Even his Divine Sense became incomparably clear, as if it had expanded greatly.

Rumble…

In the sky, a bolt of lightning thicker than a barrel suddenly struck down. Containing the might of the Heavenly Dao, it seemed capable of destroying all things. With thunderous force, it crashed toward Yang Kai’s head. Along with the lightning, an unparalleled torrent of Spiritual Qi descended, as if to drown Yang Kai.

Crack…

As Yang Kai’s body trembled violently, he couldn’t help but let out a muffled groan. His clothes were blasted to pieces, revealing his sturdy, muscular body. On that body, his skin split open, and blood flowed freely.

To reach the Emperor Realm is to defy the very will of Heaven itself.

Only by enduring the condemnation of the Heavenly Dao and withstanding the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy can one truly become an Emperor.

Since ancient times, countless proud sons of heaven and elite martial artists have fallen at this hurdle, their souls scattered. This is why, throughout the Star Realm, there are many in the Dao Origin Realm, but few in the Emperor Realm.

Those who can truly become Emperors are all unwavering in their Martial Dao, unshaken by external forces, able to go against the current and hold firm to their beliefs without the slightest wavering.

The Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy for the Emperor Realm was more terrifying than anything Yang Kai had ever experienced before.

With the first strike, Yang Kai was already injured!

However, his physical body was already extremely tough, and the Golden Blood within him possessed powerful regenerative abilities, so his cracked skin quickly began to heal itself.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy that poured into him was instantly devoured, causing his aura to rise instead of fall.

Before his injuries could recover, the second Baptism had already arrived.

Compared to the first, this second was even more terrifying. Under the falling thunder, the aura of annihilation spread, making Yang Kai sense a whiff of death. He focused his mind, not daring to be careless, forming hand seals and urging his power to resist.

Rumble…

Yang Kai’s injuries suddenly worsened, blood streaming down his entire body in a terrifying sight. The rampaging might of Heaven-and-Earth invaded him, raging through his flesh and meridians, wreaking havoc within and bringing him unbearable agony.

Gritting his teeth, he absorbed the Heaven-and-Earth Energy pouring into him while constantly comprehending the might of the Heavenly Dao, sweeping away the veil over his eyes and peering into his own Martial Dao.

Boom boom boom…

The third Baptism crashed down without pause.

In the distance, the two Great Emperors locked in a desperate struggle couldn’t help but be drawn by the commotion, turning to look.

After watching for a while, Wu Kuang’s eyes suddenly flashed with brilliance as he said in a low voice, “This boy… is not simple.”

He was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, the number one expert in the Star Realm since time immemorial. Though he wouldn’t claim there would never be another like him, there had certainly never been one before. Even among other Great Emperors, he didn’t think much of them.

For him to say someone was not simple was already the highest praise.

“He is indeed a bit strange!” Duan Hongchen’s eyes narrowed slightly, nodding in agreement.

If he were simple, how could he, with Dao Origin Realm cultivation, suppress those in the Emperor Realm? If he were simple, how could his cultivation have increased so rapidly in just a few years? Duan Hongchen had known Yang Kai for some time. Though they hadn’t interacted deeply, Duan Hongchen’s judgment was sharp. From the first time he saw Yang Kai in Fenglin City, he felt this youth would achieve great things.

Even though he had tried to estimate Yang Kai as highly as possible, he still found that, in the end, he had underestimated this boy.

“Hongchen, when you and I ascended to the Emperor Realm, did we have such a phenomenon?” Wu Kuang suddenly asked in a deep voice.

Duan Hongchen grinned and said, “If, back then, the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth had been this terrifying when I ascended, there would be no Mortal Great Emperor in this world.”

Wu Kuang nodded slightly, saying, “This boy has the bearing of a Great Emperor!”

Duan Hongchen laughed loudly, “I think this boy not only has the bearing of a Great Emperor, but will surpass you sooner or later!”

“Surpass this Lord?” Wu Kuang sneered at these words. “Foolish talk. No one can surpass this Lord’s abilities.”

Duan Hongchen chuckled, “Say what you like. In any case, you won’t have the chance to see it.”

Wu Kuang’s voice turned cold, “You’re so confident you can destroy this Lord?”

Duan Hongchen said solemnly, “I said before, since I came, I never intended to leave alive. Even if my Divine Soul is destroyed today, I will eradicate you completely!”

“Good, with those words, I won’t need to show you any mercy… Hm?” As he spoke, Wu Kuang’s expression suddenly changed, and he turned his attention back to Yang Kai.

Duan Hongchen also sensed something was wrong. Turning to look, he saw the phenomenon above Yang Kai’s head had changed again. The might of Heaven-and-Earth gathered above him now resembled an inverted funnel, connecting heaven and earth. The terrifying might made even the two Great Emperors’ faces grow grave.

As soon as the funnel appeared, it crazily crashed downward, directly connecting to Yang Kai’s body.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s body seemed to become a bottomless pit, devouring the surging might of Heaven-and-Earth. A clear aura of the Emperor Realm spread out, growing ever stronger.

“This…” Duan Hongchen’s eyes nearly popped out. “What’s going on? Is this boy trying to get himself killed?”

“Hahaha!” Wu Kuang laughed loudly. “Overestimating himself, daring to resist the might of Heavens. Hongchen, this boy has no chance of surpassing this Lord. He’s already doomed!”

Duan Hongchen didn’t refute, only sighed, “What a pity, what a pity!”

If it were any other time, seeing this, he might have tried to help Yang Kai out of admiration for talent. But now, locked in a life-and-death struggle with Wu Kuang, he had no energy to spare for Yang Kai’s affairs.

With this terrifying might crashing down, how could Yang Kai possibly survive?

As they spoke, the commotion grew even wilder. The entire land shook, and bottomless chasms appeared in this strange world, crisscrossing everywhere.

A furious roar suddenly rang out, and at the same time, accompanied by a high, clear dragon’s cry, a brilliant golden dragon shadow shot out from Yang Kai’s body, swinging its head and tail as it charged toward the might of Heaven-and-Earth.

“Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power!” Wu Kuang exclaimed in a trembling voice, his mind clearly shaken to the core.

“Impossible!” Duan Hongchen looked as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight. The moment the golden dragon appeared, it drew almost all the attention of the two Great Emperors, making their focus shift to Yang Kai, their faces changing dramatically.

“Who exactly is this boy, how could he possess the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power!” Wu Kuang shouted hoarsely, his emotions suddenly surging uncontrollably for some reason.

Duan Hongchen was dazed for a long while before saying, “How would I know such a thing! The Golden Sacred Dragon is the progenitor of the Dragon Clan. Legend has it that it gave birth to the entire Dragon Clan, but after that, it vanished. How could there still be Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power in this world!”

“Tsk tsk…” In Wu Kuang’s hollow eye sockets, his eyes flickered like ghostly flames, filled with greed. “If those old dragons on the Dragon Isle knew about this, they’d probably go mad!”

“What are you plotting?” Duan Hongchen suddenly grew wary, glaring at Wu Kuang.

Wu Kuang snorted, “Even if I have any plans, I’ll have to kill you first!”

As the two spoke, the Golden Sacred Dragon roared at the sky, facing the terrifying might of Heaven-and-Earth head-on. From its open maw came an unmatched devouring force, swallowing the might of Heaven-and-Earth in great gulps, then passing it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s pressure lessened considerably.

Earlier, he had felt he couldn’t hold on, so he was forced to activate the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power, never expecting such a miraculous effect.

To be able to resist the might of Heaven-and-Earth, this Golden Sacred Dragon Origin was truly extraordinary.

As the dragon’s maw devoured the Heavenly Might, the aura within Yang Kai’s body grew ever more powerful, his strength soaring at a breathtaking pace. An overwhelming sense of pride welled up inside him, and his entire spirit felt completely renewed, as if he had been reborn.

He didn’t know what it was like for others to become an Emperor, but he felt that if those Emperor Realm cultivators he’d met before had experienced this, they’d all have died long ago.

Perhaps only he could cause such a commotion when ascending.
