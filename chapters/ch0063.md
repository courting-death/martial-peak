## Chapter 63 — You Resemble One of My Senior Sisters

Already having decided to lend him a hand, Xia Ningshang naturally dared not show any flaw. Only by forcing Yang Kai to give his all could she help him break through.

Thus, with her first palm strike, Xia Ningshang struck decisively.

Yang Kai’s strength was at the ninth stage of the Body Tempering Realm, while Xia Ningshang only employed the power of the second or third stage of the Open Origin Realm.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai suddenly felt a chilling warning arise within him, an inexplicable coldness spreading all over, stirring a profound sense of life-or-death crisis.

Just as he was puzzled, the sound of a rushing palm wind came from the side.

Someone was launching a sneak attack! Yang Kai instantly awakened, not startled but rather pleased. He quickly leapt up from where he stood, spun around sharply, and countered with a backhanded punch.

The battle intent within him surged fiercely; he had been frustrated, not knowing how to vent it, yet now someone had delivered it right to his doorstep! Who the attacker was no longer mattered to Yang Kai—he only desired a fierce, satisfying fight!

With a sharp collision, the sound of impact echoed. Yuan Qi surged as Yang Kai staggered back several steps. Xia Ningshang used the momentum to perform a graceful backflip, landing steadily. A flicker of surprise flashed in her beautiful eyes.

Though she had only used about the third stage of the Open Origin Realm’s strength, she should not have been matched blow for blow. She should have easily suppressed him.

After exchanging a single move, Yang Kai, under the moonlight, discerned the attacker’s figure—it was a woman, though her face was concealed by a black veil.

“A woman?” Yang Kai frowned, muttering with some displeasure.

Hearing this, Xia Ningshang trembled with anger! Gritting her teeth, she swiftly darted forward, her palm energy surging, transforming into countless palm shadows that descended upon Yang Kai’s head.

That remark had truly enraged her!

Yang Kai growled low, unleashing his full strength. The scorching energy on his fists flowed rapidly as he clashed with Xia Ningshang. Though she was a woman, Yang Kai showed no mercy. Her strength clearly surpassed his, and every move was a deadly technique—he dared not be careless.

In a flash, their strikes intertwined in a fierce exchange, neither yielding. Yet the situation clearly favored Xia Ningshang. His moves were powerful and heavy, with fierce destructive force, but nowhere near as agile and versatile as hers. For every two moves he made, she countered with three. Light and nimble, she treated him like a monkey toying with a plaything.

Yang Kai suffered defeat after defeat, growing increasingly frustrated! He sensed her strength was slightly above his, yet he could not fathom that she was merely suppressing her true power while fighting him. Against such an opponent, landing a hit was a rarity.

Beneath the black veil, Xia Ningshang’s angry lips slowly curved into a smile. She thought, “You dared speak recklessly—deservedly, you are getting beaten!”

In just a short while, Yang Kai was battered until his entire body ached. As the familiar pain spread, the blood within him surged anew, flowing like a mighty river. If one listened closely, the sound of waves crashing could almost be heard. Warmth radiated throughout his body, and his strength steadily climbed.

A grave expression appeared in Xia Ningshang’s eyes. She realized the Yuan Qi surging within this junior brother was growing ever stronger. His strength was gradually breaking through the Body Tempering Realm, reaching the Open Origin Realm—and still, it showed no sign of stopping, growing slowly but resolutely.

Yang Kai’s fists, burning with scorching energy, struck faster and heavier. Xia Ningshang felt herself growing faintly overwhelmed. Though she wished to raise her strength further, unwilling to yield, she could only grit her teeth and endure.

“Who told you to come kill me?” Amid the fierce battle, Yang Kai suddenly asked in a low, dark voice.

Xia Ningshang said nothing, focusing all her effort on deflecting his strikes.

By now, Yang Kai’s strength had nearly matched hers. She found herself unable to gain any advantage. Whenever his fists brushed past, she had to divert some attention to dispel the pure Yang energy invading her body.

She was alarmed. She realized she had underestimated the purity of this True Yang energy. Such purity was far beyond what ordinary martial techniques could cultivate.

In another direct clash, their palms met without either retreating.

Squinting at the woman before him, Yang Kai’s gaze fell upon a faint mark on her forehead. His expression shifted slightly in surprise. “I think you... resemble one of my senior sisters.”

Xia Ningshang, still resisting the invasion of Yang energy, momentarily lost her composure upon hearing this. She wondered when she had been exposed. Little did she know it was precisely because of the faint mark on her forehead that Yang Kai had his suspicion.

Yang Kai recalled that senior sister’s forehead bore a sapphire pendant exactly where the mark was.

Xia Ningshang blinked nervously, her long lashes fluttering. Yang Kai laughed suddenly, then grabbed her wrist and fiercely pulled her into his embrace, reaching to tear off her veil.

Only then did Xia Ningshang come to her senses. She had refused to reveal her true face, partly to pressure Yang Kai, partly out of embarrassment—after all, what had happened last time was too awkward. How could she now allow him to tear off her veil?

In desperation, she unleashed her suppressed strength. A fierce burst of Yuan Qi exploded forth. Yang Kai howled and was sent flying far away, tumbling several times across the ground.

When he finally rose, the woman’s figure had vanished without a trace.

“Could it really be her?” Yang Kai pondered. He had spoken casually before, not expecting such a strong reaction. Moreover, the final burst of energy made him realize just how vast the gap in their strength was. If she truly wished to kill him, it would have been effortless—no need for such a prolonged battle.

But now, it no longer mattered. Yang Kai felt the shackles that had bound him were broken by this fight. He quickly sat cross-legged, carefully sensing the energies of heaven and earth.

In the next moment, the energies stirred violently, rushing fiercely into Yang Kai.

He took a deep breath, his pores opening wide like a whale inhaling water, accepting all the energies of heaven and earth. He guided this immense cosmic power to flow within, cleansing his marrow and tendons.

This was the opportunity every martial artist encountered when breaking through a major realm. How much benefit one gained depended entirely on one’s own effort.

A hundred zhang away, Xia Ningshang covered her chest in alarm. She had not expected Yang Kai to discern her identity, but at least she had helped him break through—it was not in vain.

Just as she was flustered, a figure flickered beside her. An elderly man dressed plainly appeared suddenly. His hair and beard were white, and his expression kind.

Seeing his face, Xia Ningshang quickly greeted respectfully, “Greetings, Senior Uncle Sect Leader.”

The old man smiled kindly, “You are not a disciple of our Lingxiao Pavilion, no need for formalities.”

Xia Ningshang replied softly, “But since the Sect Leader is a close friend of my master, naturally you are my Senior Uncle.”
