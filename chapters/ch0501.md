## Chapter 501 — Touched What Should Not Be Touched

The restless thought spun around several times in Shui Ling’s mind, yet she still failed to condense her True Yuan.

“What kind of constitution do you have?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her. From what she said, Yang Kai immediately realized that this woman before him also seemed to possess a rare constitution.

A special constitution—so far, the only one Yang Kai had encountered was Senior Sister’s. Such innate gifts were the heavens’ blessings, extraordinarily rare. Moreover, each special constitution manifested unique abilities, and it was exceedingly rare for two people to share the same type.

Senior Sister’s constitution was exceptionally suited for alchemy, and now another person with a special constitution appeared before Yang Kai. Naturally, his interest piqued, eager to learn more details.

Shui Ling, however, regarded Yang Kai with caution, reluctant to answer.

Just like Xia Ningshang’s Medicinal Spirit Saint Body was kept strictly secret, Shui Ling’s constitution was naturally something she tried hard to conceal. But now, being under this roof, she had no choice but to lower her guard.

After hesitating for quite a long time, Shui Ling muttered reluctantly, “The Water Spirit Constitution.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, understanding that she was telling the truth. From her repeated actions, her constitution must be related to water, and her name likely originated from this.

“Is there anything special about it?” Yang Kai asked kindly.

“I can transform my body into a flowing water-like existence.” Shui Ling said, then circulated her True Yuan to demonstrate. Yang Kai had no intention of guarding against her. Under the watchful eyes inside the room, this petite woman with long light blue hair truly became as clear and transparent as water, leaving only a humanoid outline. Gradually, she even transformed into a spherical water ball.

Even someone calm like Ying Jiu involuntarily gaped in disbelief.

“It’s not just this little ability, right?” Yang Kai smiled and reached out to touch the water ball.

With a “pop,” the water ball suddenly burst, mist scattering. Shui Ling’s figure bizarrely appeared not far to Yang Kai’s side, her face flushed with shame, arms crossed tightly over her chest, glaring at him through gritted teeth, trembling with anger.

Yang Kai was stunned. He twirled his fingers and raised an eyebrow, “Touched what shouldn’t be touched?”

“You think?” Shui Ling panted heavily, her silver teeth clenched tight.

“I didn’t mean to, and... I didn’t feel anything.” Yang Kai said calmly. Just now, he only felt a flow of water, no human flesh sensation. But for Shui Ling, that was surely not the case, or else she wouldn’t be so furious and embarrassed.

“I’ve got you marked!” Shui Ling said venomously, her gaze full of loathing.

“Many have marked me.” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, unconcerned. “But none have ended well. Go on, tell me more about your Water Spirit Constitution—I’m very curious.”

Seeing him so nonchalantly brush off the earlier embarrassing incident, Shui Ling was overwhelmed by a sense of powerlessness.

She had never met such a shameless man—he had surely cultivated his face skin as strongly as his martial skill.

“No mood to talk.” Shui Ling scoffed coldly. “Kill me if you want. Whatever happens is your choice.”

Yang Kai scratched his forehead, realizing his unintentional action had likely angered her. He did not press further. His caution toward this mysterious woman stemmed from not knowing her intentions or origins before.

Now knowing these, he cared little—so long as she was not one of the disciples recruited by his elder brothers, and did not intend harm against Xia Ningshang, he would leave her be.

“Anything else you want to ask? If not, I’ll be leaving now.”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Shui Ling’s expression flickered with surprise, not expecting him to be so easy to talk to. Then she decisively extended a hand. “Return my hair.”

“Impossible.” Yang Kai smiled lightly. “You can leave, I won’t stop you, but this thing must remain with me. Because I don’t know whether what you said earlier was true, nor whether you might stir trouble here later.”

“Why are you like this?” Shui Ling muttered in frustration. “When you have that, you control me for life, yet shamelessly say you’ll let me go. Where do you think I can go?”

“Up to you. Just don’t cause trouble at my residence. The world is big, go wherever you like.” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “Of course, if you’re willing to serve me, I’d welcome that.”

“Serve you?” Shui Ling sneered. “Do you even have that right?”

“If you don’t want to, we can cooperate. As long as you stay, everything is negotiable.” Yang Kai continued to persuade.

“Not a chance I’m staying!” Shui Ling snorted coldly, turning to leave, quietly raising her True Yuan to guard against any deceitful attack from Yang Kai.

But even after she left Yang Kai’s mansion, no sign of pursuit or disturbance followed. Obviously, she was not to be troubled.

Glancing back once, Shui Ling stomped her foot indignantly. This time she had truly lost out—not only did she fail to shake off his control, her pure body had been touched, and the person responsible claimed to have felt nothing!

Infuriating!

Also, who exactly created that little doll? How could it connect to her essence, Qi, and spirit?

That damn bastard—he’d pay for this sooner or later! Shui Ling cursed silently.

Inside the mansion, Yang Kai stood and finally put down the burden weighing on his mind for many days.

“Young Master, why didn’t you keep that woman? If her abilities were fully utilized, they would greatly benefit you.” Di Mo asked puzzledly.

“Forcing a melon won’t make it sweet.” Yang Kai shook his head, tossing the little doll in his hand. “Relying on this, I do have the ability to keep her forcibly, but what if she seeks revenge and causes trouble here later? Who could restrain her?”

“If it came to a real fight, she certainly wouldn’t be a match for you, and even the Blood Servants could handle her, but her constitution is truly troublesome,” Di Mo nodded. Shui Ling's water constitution was indeed very strange.

If it weren’t for the strand of hair Yang Kai had cut from her at Po Jing Lake, Di Mo would have been helpless against her.

“Besides, as long as I have this, she won’t wander far from me. Whenever I want to use her, she’ll have no choice but to obey.” Yang Kai smiled.

“A wise strategy, Young Master.” Di Mo shivered, feeling some concern for Shui Ling. The girl probably believed Yang Kai’s words, thinking from now on they would stay out of each other’s way. Yet Yang Kai merely regarded her as a tool to call upon or cast away at will.

“Nineteen years old, Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage...” Yang Kai murmured, taking a deep breath, his gaze filled with longing. What kind of force was this Water Divine Hall that could nurture such a genius? Shui Ling even claimed she only ranked third among the disciples there.

That meant inside the Water Divine Hall, at least two others of similar or greater strength than Shui Ling existed.

Such a force truly existed in the world! Yang Kai felt an irresistible urge to see it with his own eyes.

“Shopkeeper Meng!” After much contemplation, Yang Kai suddenly called out.

Meng Wuya’s voice came immediately: “Don’t ask questions now. I will tell you when the time is right. For now, focus on breaking through to the Divine Roaming Realm.”

“Alright then.” Yang Kai sighed.

That night’s confrontation with Shui Ling was known only to Meng Wuya, Di Mo, and Ying Jiu. No one else in the mansion knew the details. Perhaps the Blood Servants detected some disturbance, but without Yang Kai’s orders, they dared not investigate, so they remained unaware of the facts.

After a night passed, Yang Kai announced his seclusion to prepare for ascending the Divine Roaming Realm. Qiu Yimeng took full charge of the mansion’s affairs.

The struggle for succession was full of twists and uncertainty. Yang Kai only had two Blood Servants at his disposal. Though he held great material wealth and resources, Yang Zhao had a manpower advantage.

Reckless action would only give enemies openings. So for now, Yang Kai had no intention to settle the score decisively with Yang Zhao, merely instructing Qiu Yimeng to harass Yang Zhao’s forces occasionally.

Eldest Brother Yang Wei was strong but, compared to the others, undoubtedly the weakest among the three remaining brothers. The world had long ruled him out of the final succession battle.

All eyes were fixed on Yang Kai and Yang Zhao; the next head of the Yang Family would emerge from between them.

However, neither Yang Kai nor Yang Zhao dared attack Yang Wei, despite having the strength.

First, assaulting Yang Wei would cost them greatly and weaken their own side.

Second, after defeating Yang Wei, his Blood Servants could no longer assist, and his allies would likely desert to the other faction, strengthening the enemy.

Such shifts could change the outcome of the succession war.

Precisely because of these constraints, though Yang Wei was the weakest, he was also the safest.

It was even possible that if Yang Kai and Yang Zhao fought to mutual destruction, Yang Wei would be the beneficiary—a perspective only those with strong strategic awareness fully grasped.

Time flew, and two months passed!

Since the last great upheaval in the War City, everything had remained silent for two entire months.

Occasionally, minor skirmishes flared among the three remaining factions, but all exercised restraint, avoiding heavy casualties.

Most of the time, cultivators involved in the succession war focused on training and strengthening themselves.

After more than two months, although personnel at Yang Kai’s mansion remained unchanged, their overall strength had risen several levels.

They consumed profound pills daily, and even Baoqi Sect’s refiners came to temper their secret treasures. If their strength didn’t improve, it would be a disgrace.

Every day, many warriors broke through their bottlenecks and advanced to higher tiers. During this time, numerous young leaders had advanced to the Divine Roaming Realm!
