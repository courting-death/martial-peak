## Chapter 1594 — Not Very Fond of Killing Women

While Xue Sun was lost in idle thoughts, the two who had been chasing her suddenly descended to within a dozen zhang in front of them.

A man and a woman; the man had fair skin, a powdered face and oily hair, but the powerful aura about him could not be ignored.

The woman was dressed with seductive flair, heavy makeup and revealing clothing — her snow-white thighs and pale arms bared to the air, irresistibly drawing men's eyes; her peach-blossom eyes shimmered with springlike longing, making her overwhelmingly alluring.

Landing, the woman shot Yang Kai a glance; her eyes brightened with interest and she chuckled, saying to the man at her side, "Senior Brother, this fellow has a very nice figure."

"Junior Sister likes him?" The man showed no concern, instead regarding Yang Kai with interest and nodding, "The figure is indeed good — exactly the type you like."

As he spoke, and right before Yang Kai and Xue Sun, he reached out and grabbed the voluptuous woman's ample rear, sneering, "Junior Sister, have you taken a fancy to him?"

"Senior Brother…" the woman coyly demurred, her face flushed with maidenly spring, "My trysts with other men are merely play; it is you I truly love."

"Senior Brother knows."

Yang Kai and Xue Sun watched in astonishment, mouths agape.

Although Xue Sun was a yao and had inherited some of her kind's bold temperament, she truly could not stomach such a scene; the decadent aura leaking from that pair made her nauseous.

"Not a good sort!" Yang Kai shot Xue Sun a look and frowned, "Was this fellow chasing you for your beauty?"

At that Xue Sun glared ferociously at Yang Kai and ground out, "Cut the flippant remarks."

Yang Kai gave a light chuckle.

Seeing them so unconcerned and indifferent, the pursuing pair were a little taken aback; the man scrutinized Yang Kai seriously and sneered, "A Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm actually dares to come to the Blood Prison? This is interesting — Junior Sister, this fellow's got a bold streak."

"I like men with nerve." The seductive woman stuck out her tongue, licked her lips, and displayed clear interest in Yang Kai; her expression grew increasingly lascivious, and the sway of her waist carved out bewitching curves.

"Fine, then this man is yours." The man nodded, pointing at Xue Sun, "This yao woman belongs to me. I, Li, have lived many years and have never toyed with such a high-grade yao — I expect I'll be well pleased! Yao woman, you ran here expecting this fellow to save you? I advise you to surrender. I, Li, have always cherished beauty; if you cooperate I won't be too harsh — instead I'll give you pleasure, how about that?"

He acted as if he had them all figured out and asked boldly.

“Nothing but filth comes out of a dog’s mouth.” Xue Sun gave a cold snort and shouted sharply, “The woman’s yours to deal with—this man is mine.”

"Can we swap? I'm not very fond of killing women..." Yang Kai glanced at her, but before he finished the words Xue Sun had already surged forward, her yao essence roaring like a tempest and whipping up a gust that enveloped the man.

In an instant Xue Sun engaged the man, leaving Yang Kai and the other seductive woman staring at one another.

"Little Brother, did you just say you were going to kill me?" The seductive woman showed no concern for her Senior Brother, instead regarding Yang Kai with keen interest.

Yang Kai grinned, "A woman like you — how could I bear to kill you?"

The woman paused, then giggled, trembling with coquettish charm, and purred, "If you can't bear it, why don't we find somewhere to have a proper talk? You look so young; elder sister wouldn't want to trouble you."

She exhaled, and a sweet perfume suddenly spread around them, lingering at Yang Kai's nostrils.

That sweet scent was like an invisible hand teasing the deepest recesses of Yang Kai's heart, making his blood churn and his pulse race.

As she spoke she reached out a slender jade hand and stroked Yang Kai's cheek; her eyes were soft as water and her touch gentle, seeming capable of making any man let down his guard.

"All right." Yang Kai smiled brightly, and before her jade hand could touch him a cold light flashed in his eyes and he snatched at her wrist.

Caught off guard, her wrist was seized cleanly by Yang Kai.

The woman's face shifted and she gave a soft whimper, looking aggrieved at Yang Kai, tearful, "Little Brother, you hurt me."

Saying that, her pale arm twitched; it trembled like a spirit snake, as if boneless, attempting to wrench itself free from Yang Kai's grip.

Yang Kai sneered, gripping her wrist tightly and yanking her hard toward him.

Realizing she could not resist such brutal force, her expression changed; her other, uncontrolled hand flipped subtly and several thin, hair-like needles appeared between her fingers, which she sent hurtling toward Yang Kai's waist — the needle-shaped secret treasures.

With fragrance surrounding them and their bodies pressed together, the woman's breathing grew heavy and her eyes misted as she breathed on Yang Kai and giggled, "These Seven Emotions and Desires Needles are my exclusive secret treasure — Little Brother, be obedient and elder sister will satisfy you."

“This is what you call the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Needles?” Yang Kai grinned. “Doesn’t seem all that impressive—can’t stir up anything.”

Her smile froze; looking down, she discovered a patch of purple light had appeared on Yang Kai's waist, and her needles were halted outside it, unable to penetrate even a fraction.

She cried out and shifted her form; Saint Yuan erupted within her as she lightly slapped toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted; black Demonic Flame sprang up around his fist and he smashed a brutal punch into her palm.

Boom — their Saint Yuan collided; the woman's palm could not withstand Yang Kai's ferocity and was sent flying back, her hand crushing against her own heaving chest as bone-splintering sounds rang out.

A shriek rose and the woman's delicate form shot upward like a kite with its string cut.

The black Demonic Flame scorched the clothing over her chest, exposing enticing white flesh which quickly became charred.

Crimson blood streamed down from her chest, dripping along her body to her thighs. Against that fair, flawless skin, it formed a stark contrast—radiating a kind of bewitching, scarlet allure.

Staggering, she forced her Saint Yuan to stabilize her body and hovered in midair; peering down at her chest, her face contorted in hatred as she screamed, "I'll kill you!"

Yang Kai's expression grew cold; golden light flashed before him and two Golden Blood Threads manifested — at his thought they became arrow-like and shot forth mercilessly toward the woman.

The woman was shocked; she never expected a mere Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm man to be so formidable.

She had assumed she could handle him easily and that he would fall beneath her skirts and submit to her.

Only now did she realize how terribly mistaken she had been.

This Second Stage man was in no way inferior to any Third Stage, and might even surpass them.

As the two golden lights drew near, she dared not tarry; her body trembled and a pale-blue treasure armor instantly materialized to encase her, while her hand waved and a barrage of needle-shaped secret treasures, barely visible to the naked eye, shot forth.

Clinking sounds rang out as the two Golden Blood Threads were intercepted midair.

But before she could relax, the two Golden Blood Threads twisted and transformed into two massive, winged, gold-and-red demonic beasts.

"Thunderflame Flying Lizard!" The woman stood dumbfounded, utterly unable to comprehend the mystery of the secret art.

The two giant Thunderflame Flying Lizards lunged at her from left and right, opening gaping maws as if to swallow her whole.

Panic filled her gaze and terror flooded her eyes; her slender frame trembled uncontrollably.

Before she could unleash another secret art, a Thunderflame Flying Lizard's huge claw struck before her with a dull thud and flung her away, while the other lizard snapped its jaws and bit her in two.

The pale-blue treasure armor flashed and resisted the Thunderflame Flying Lizards' terrifying bite force.

Yang Kai leapt forward; in the woman's final despair a short, arrow-like secret treasure suddenly appeared in his hand.

The Feather Spirit Arrow — an eerie secret treasure that, when fully charged, can be used twice; its destructive power is such that even Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors cannot dismiss it.

With a flick of his wrist an energy arrow shot straight at the woman.

The stench of death washed over her and she cried, "Senior Brother, save me!"

The cry was cut short as the Feather Spirit Arrow shattered her defensive armor into pieces; unprotected, the Thunderflame Flying Lizard bit her cleanly in two.

Even though she did not possess a fragile body, she still had no means to stand against the Thunderflame Flying Lizard.

Her remains fell from the sky and the smell of blood filled the air.

The two Thunderflame Flying Lizards twisted again and transformed back into Golden Blood Threads, flying back into Yang Kai's body.

Standing where he was, Yang Kai pondered briefly and a satisfied look crept over his face.

The last time at Huiyue City, Yang Kai had slain Mi Tian's two cart-pulling demonic beasts and used Golden Blood Threads to fully absorb their Essence-Blood, refining them into a Blood Beast — this was the first time he had used them in combat.

Its power was indeed formidable! Most valuable of all was that once refined into a Blood Beast, there was no need for Yang Kai to micromanage it — the Blood Beast was able to fight by itself.

That pleased Yang Kai very much.

He turned his gaze to another section of the battlefield, watched for a moment, and then relaxed.

The previously arrogant man seemed utterly no match for Xue Sun; her yao qi surged and completely suppressed his aura, leaving Xue Sun with absolute advantage.
