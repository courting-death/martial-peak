## Chapter 2527 — Little Thing

Yang Kai's expression grew solemn as Emperor Yuan coiled around his hands. He carefully reached out toward the Life Origin Fruit.

After a moment, he gently plucked it, and the Life Origin Fruit immediately fell into his palm. Yang Kai quickly tossed it into the jade box he had prepared, laid down several seals, and only then stored it away in his own space.

"Whew..." Yang Kai let out a quiet breath. With this Life Origin Fruit, he now had a good chance of refining a Life Origin Pill. But before that, he needed to improve his pill-refining skills a bit more.

Although he was now an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he hadn't refined many Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs yet. If he rushed to refine the Life Origin Fruit, his chances of success were slim. There might only be this one Life Origin Fruit in the world, and if he failed and ruined the ingredient, Yang Kai would definitely be left with a shadow in his heart, which could affect his future pill-refining.

Fortunately, there were so many Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs here that he could pick some of the less valuable ones to practice with. He believed that, given time, his mastery of pill-refining would improve, and then he'd be confident in refining the Life Origin Pill.

After observing for a while longer, he found that every Spiritual Herb in this medicine garden was priceless, but none amazed Yang Kai as much as the Life Origin Fruit had.

He immediately began collecting them.

Two whole medicine gardens, hundreds of Spiritual Herbs—Yang Kai spent over an hour before he was nearly done gathering them all.

About twenty plants remained, including the tree that bore the Life Origin Fruit.

On the tree that bore the Life Origin Fruit, three pure white blossoms still remained. If given several hundred or even a thousand more years, perhaps new fruits would eventually grow. However, Yang Kai felt uneasy—he didn’t dare disturb these last twenty Spiritual Herbs.

After finishing, Yang Kai glanced at Gao Xueting and saw she was still meditating to heal, and it seemed she'd need quite a while before waking up.

Yang Kai wasn't in a hurry. He sent his Divine Sense into the Small Xuan Realm and retrieved the Spatial Rings belonging to Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing.

As expected, inside their Spatial Rings were large quantities of freshly gathered Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs, clearly products of this ancient medicine garden.

Aside from that, the two Spatial Rings also contained many other valuable treasures, making Yang Kai's harvest even richer.

Their Imperial Treasures—the Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade and the Myriad Beasts Seal—also ended up in Yang Kai's hands.

The Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade was fine; though its power was impressive, Yang Kai didn't like using blades, so he had no intention of refining it. Besides, even if he did, it wouldn't boost his strength much.

But the Myriad Beasts Seal interested Yang Kai. Unlike ordinary Imperial Treasures, it seemed able to seal the spirit essences of demonic beasts. In battle, he could simply release the spirit essences to defeat his enemies, and it wouldn't consume much of his own strength.

This one could be given to Zhang Ruoxi.

Although Zhang Ruoxi seemed to prefer swords, the Myriad Beasts Seal was powerful and would be a fine treasure for her. As long as she could refine it, her strength would surely increase.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai surged his Divine Sense and erased Zu Hong's Soul Brand from the Myriad Beasts Seal.

Soon after, a flash of light passed, and the Myriad Beasts Seal turned dull and lost its luster. He tossed it into his Spatial Ring, planning to give it to Zhang Ruoxi once they left.

After waiting a bit longer and seeing Gao Xueting still hadn't awakened, Yang Kai simply took out his pill furnace, found some Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs, and began refining pills on the spot.

A day later, as Yang Kai was focused on pill-refining, he suddenly sensed someone watching him. His expression shifted, but his hands didn't stop as he glanced to the side—and sure enough, he saw Gao Xueting's beautiful eyes gazing at him.

Realizing she'd disturbed Yang Kai's pill-refining, Gao Xueting's face showed a hint of guilt. She didn't dare speak, only signaling with her eyes for him to continue.

When an alchemist is refining pills, the worst thing is to be disturbed. Gao Xueting knew Yang Kai was an alchemist; otherwise, back in Four Seasons Land, he couldn't have refined the Supreme Mystic Pill.

So, when Yang Kai glanced at her, she immediately understood her gaze had distracted him, and she felt a bit uneasy.

But Yang Kai just looked unconcerned, grinning as he said, "Elder Gao, please wait a moment. I'll finish collecting the pills soon, and then I'll talk with you."

As he spoke, Yang Kai's expression grew serious, and he instantly immersed himself in pill-refining again, leaving Gao Xueting amazed.

She watched as Yang Kai performed mysterious pill-collecting techniques, each one profound and seemingly in harmony with the principles of the Dao.

Gao Xueting's heart trembled, and her beautiful eyes shone with a strange light. She stared intently at Yang Kai's movements, unwilling to miss a single detail.

To her astonishment, as she watched Yang Kai’s pill-refining techniques, she found herself gaining unexpected insights into the Martial Dao itself. His every movement seemed to resonate with the very principles of Heaven and Martial Path, allowing her to integrate all she had learned on her own cultivation journey. It was truly incredible—almost unbelievable—that simply observing his alchemy could inspire such profound understanding.

As one of the top sects in the Southern Territory, Qingyang Shrine naturally had its own Imperial-Grade Alchemist. Though there was only one, that was still an Imperial-Grade Alchemist.

Gao Xueting had once watched that Imperial-Grade Alchemist refine pills from afar, but compared to Yang Kai's methods, the shrine's alchemist was simply embarrassing—clumsy and crude.

If that alchemist was like a child waving a hoe in a field, then Yang Kai was like someone dancing with a longsword under the moonlight.

There was simply no comparison between the two.

Who had taught him pill-refining? How did he achieve such mastery at such a young age? And not only that, he'd even advanced to the Emperor Realm.

Gao Xueting's heart stirred. She suddenly realized that all those so-called genius disciples paled in comparison to Yang Kai's achievements. Even the children of the Great Emperors couldn't match him.

Time seemed to pass both quickly and slowly. As Gao Xueting was immersed in her strange insights, the feeling of resonance with the Heavenly and Martial Dao suddenly vanished.

Startled, she looked again and saw Yang Kai forming a hand seal and shouting, "Gather!"

Ding-ling-ling...

Suddenly, a clear and pleasant sound came from the little pill furnace. Yang Kai listened closely, his brows furrowing slightly, as if dissatisfied with the result.

Gao Xueting was surprised.

She wasn't an alchemist, but she knew this batch of Spiritual Pills had succeeded. The fragrance drifting from the furnace proved they were Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills, and of high quality.

Even so, he wasn't satisfied? What would it take for him to be content?

Yang Kai slapped the pill furnace, and with a shake, three round, fragrant Spiritual Pills flew out and were guided into a jade bottle.

He glanced at them, curled his lip, and casually tossed them into his Spatial Ring. Then he turned, smiling at Gao Xueting, and said, "Sorry to keep you waiting, Elder Gao. How's your recovery?"

"About seventy or eighty percent," Gao Xueting replied. "It wasn't a fatal injury anyway."

After a pause, she asked curiously, "How did you know I was here? And how did you find me so directly?"

Yang Kai said, "Junior Sister Lu Wen sent me a message..."

He briefly explained how he'd passed near Kunyuan City and received Lu Wen's message.

Gao Xueting smiled after hearing this. "Looks like it wasn't my time to die. You just happened to pass by Kunyuan City."

Her smile was like a thousand pear blossoms blooming, making the whole world dim in comparison. She was always a cold woman, rarely smiling. At least, in all the time Yang Kai had known her, he'd almost never seen her smile.

So Yang Kai couldn't help but stare in a daze.

Gao Xueting noticed his odd look and quickly hid her smile, her expression turning a bit awkward.

Yang Kai said, "Elder Gao, you should smile more. You're much prettier that way."

"Impudent smooth-talker!" Gao Xueting snorted coldly.

Yang Kai grinned, "I bet if you smiled at Hall Master Wen like that, he'd be so dazzled he'd lose his mind!"

Gao Xueting snorted, "Lose his mind? Hardly. He'd immediately ask if I'd suffered Qi Deviation from training, then shove a Heart-Guarding Pill in my mouth. After that, I'd spit the pill right in his face!"

Yang Kai's jaw dropped. "Hall Master Wen is really that clueless?"

Imagining the scene, Yang Kai was speechless. But judging by Gao Xueting's tone, it seemed this had actually happened before.

He broke out in a cold sweat and quickly changed the subject: "By the way, Elder Gao, I prepared a little something for you."

"A little something?" Gao Xueting asked, puzzled. "What is it?"

Yang Kai took out a jade bottle, handed it over, and said, "This."

Gao Xueting accepted it, opened the lid, and looked inside. She immediately saw a round, blood-red Spiritual Pill lying in the bottle, radiating a strong bloody scent.

"Blood Frenzy Pill!" Gao Xueting's eyes lit up.

She had a Blood Frenzy Pill herself. Earlier, when Yang Kai was besieged, she'd wanted to take one to boost her strength and help him, but Yang Kai had stopped her in time.

So she recognized it at a glance.

"This is an Upper-Level Blood Frenzy Pill. It's thirty percent more effective than your old one, and as long as you stop circulating your energy within one incense stick's time after taking it, there won't be any major side effects. With enough rest afterward, you'll recover fully and won't damage your foundation. For now, this is the best Blood Frenzy Pill I can make. Keep it for emergencies, and when I can refine something better, I'll swap it out for you."

"Something better..." Gao Xueting was speechless. This was already an Upper-Level Blood Frenzy Pill—what could be better? Beyond this, there were Supreme Blood Frenzy Pills, and then those with Pill Patterns and a Pill Cloud, which couldn't be made just by wishing for them.

Yang Kai had called her old Blood Frenzy Pill low-quality, asking which useless alchemist had made it. Clearly, he was worried she'd harm her foundation by taking it, so he'd specially refined a new one for her.

Thinking of this, Gao Xueting felt a gentle warmth bloom in her heart.
