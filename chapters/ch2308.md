## Chapter 2308 — I Insist on Seeing

"If I said I'm not from the Chiyue Sect, would you believe me?" Yang Kai smiled as he looked at Luo Jin.

Off to the side, Ye Qinghan and Du Xian both looked strained, constantly wiping the cold sweat from their foreheads, clearly nervous and uneasy.

Luo Jin took in the scene, his brows furrowing as he asked in a deep voice, "Then how should I address you?"

Although Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, one Stage lower than Luo Jin, he didn't look very old. For someone so young to have such cultivation, Luo Jin couldn't afford to underestimate him. To be safe, he decided to first probe Yang Kai's background.

Yang Kai replied without looking at Luo Jin, instead keeping his eyes fixed on the bride's reaction. He declared loudly, "I'm Yang Kai of Lingxiao Sect!"

"Lingxiao Sect? Which sect is that?"

"Is there such a sect in our Southern Territory? How come I've never heard of it?"

"Maybe it's a sect from another territory. The world is vast, and there are so many sects. It's not strange to have never heard of it."

The guests all began whispering among themselves. Even Ye Qinghan and the others frowned in thought, but none had ever heard of Lingxiao Sect, making them all the more curious.

The bride, upon hearing Yang Kai's introduction, suddenly trembled, as if her spirit had been struck by something.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's eyes lit up, feeling even more certain of his guess.

Earlier, when the bride attacked Chai Hu, Yang Kai had sensed a familiar fluctuation in her power, as if it belonged to someone he knew. Now, his suspicion grew even stronger.

Luo Jin clearly hadn't heard of Lingxiao Sect either. He frowned and said, "Young Brother Yang, what opinion do you have of this Lord's grand ceremony? Speak, and let this Lord hear it."

Yang Kai grinned and said, "Actually, I don't have any major opinions. I'm just rather curious about the bride's appearance... City Lord, if you don't mind, could you let the bride lift her veil so we can all witness her peerless beauty?"

As soon as he spoke, everyone looked at Yang Kai with strange expressions, thinking that no bride would lift her veil before entering the bridal chamber. On the wedding day, only after the ceremony and entering the chamber does the groom lift the veil—it's tradition. Breaking this custom would bring misfortune to the family.

If the bride could be openly shown on the wedding day, what would be the point of the red veil?

Though everyone knew this, truthfully, they were all extremely curious about the bride's looks. They wanted to see her, but no one dared to speak up. Now, hearing Yang Kai say it, they secretly looked forward to it.

Luo Jin's eyes were full of authority as he stared at Yang Kai. After a long silence, he suddenly laughed and said, "Young Brother Yang, you are quite amusing. You must be joking to lighten the tense atmosphere. I appreciate your sentiment!"

As he spoke, he cupped his fists in a gesture of respect, but his eyes were full of threat, clearly warning Yang Kai not to push further.

As soon as Luo Jin finished, Yang Kai laughed, "City Lord, you've misunderstood. I'm not joking—I truly want to see what the bride looks like!"

Luo Jin's smile vanished, his face turning cold.

Yang Kai acted as if he hadn't noticed, continuing, "Everyone knows the City Lord is blessed with beauty. Fourteen beautiful concubines at home, each with their own charm, enjoying the happiness of many. Yet no one knows what the City Lord's wives actually look like. Whenever they go out, their faces are covered with black veils, escorted by guards, making it impossible to see their true appearance. But I'm sure everyone knows that the City Lord's wives must be stunning beauties, only such looks could match the City Lord's prestige."

Luo Jin listened and laughed, "Young Brother, you flatter me!"

Secretly, he thought this kid wasn't here to cause trouble, but to flatter him. If that was the case, maybe he could cooperate a little.

"This is the City Lord's fifteenth wife. City Lord, you can't keep hiding her and teasing everyone. Why not, with all the guests gathered, let everyone feast their eyes? Fulfill our wish, and maybe we'll be lucky enough to share in your blessings. What do you all think?"

The guests didn't speak, just listened quietly, but many showed anticipation, clearly wanting to see what the bride looked like.

Luo Jin smiled, "Young Brother, I and my wives are joined by true affection, a match made in heaven. If you want such blessings, I strongly recommend you visit our city's Thousand Gold Drunken Pavilion. There you'll surely find what you seek—many beautiful ladies await!"

At this, the guests burst into laughter, impressed by Luo Jin's wit.

But some caught the hidden meaning in Luo Jin's words: his wives were not like the girls in the Drunken Pavilion, not for idle people to look at. If anyone kept pestering, it would be an insult, and he wouldn't tolerate it.

"Enough, the auspicious hour is passing. Let's continue the ceremony!" Luo Jin waved his hand, ready to end the annoying scene.

Yang Kai suddenly stepped forward and said in a deep voice, "What if I insist on seeing the bride?"

Luo Jin turned back, coldly staring at Yang Kai, "Young Brother, go back and sit down!"

"Young Master Yang... what are you doing?" Ye Qinghan was nearly frantic. She had no idea why Yang Kai kept provoking Luo Jin at such a critical moment. She could see Luo Jin's impatience and anger, knowing that if this continued, things would get out of hand.

"Young Master Yang, come back," Du Xian also urged.

Yang Kai turned to them and said calmly, "This is my personal matter. If you're afraid of being implicated, you can leave now, but don't tell me what to do."

Du Xian frowned, clearly displeased.

Ye Qinghan panicked, waving her hands, "That's not what I meant, it's just..."

Yang Kai didn't wait for her to finish, leaving his seat and walking toward the bride, his steps steady and his expression relaxed. He looked at Luo Jin and said, "City Lord, if I can't see the bride today, I won't sleep well tonight. Please grant me this wish!"

"Has this guy gone mad?" Over to the side, Qiu Yu stood there dumbfounded, still holding onto Luo Bing, his face a whirlwind of emotions. He simply couldn't figure out what Yang Kai was trying to do. From their only previous encounter, Yang Kai hadn't seemed like the type to stir up trouble for no reason.

Meanwhile, Chai Hu, who had been utterly hopeless under the City Lord’s mansion experts’ suppression, suddenly brightened, his eyes burning as he looked at Yang Kai, as if grasping a lifeline in despair. He struggled and shouted, "Young Brother, help me take her away! She's just confused for a moment, you must take her away!"

"Outrageous!" Luo Jin roared, glaring fiercely at Yang Kai. "Boy, you're clearly here to cause trouble!"

As Yang Kai walked toward the bride, he shook his head, "City Lord Luo, that's unfair. I just want to see the bride. If you won't allow it, I'll have to do it myself."

Luo Jin shouted angrily, "Seize him!"

At his command, more than a dozen martial artists suddenly rushed out from all directions, their momentum fierce as they charged at Yang Kai. Among them were two experts at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, attacking from both sides.

Seeing a battle about to erupt, the guests' expressions changed and they quickly retreated, afraid of getting caught up. Many looked at Yang Kai with pity, thinking he must be crazy to cause such trouble at the City Lord's wedding—wasn't this courting death?

In a flash, the dozen martial artists reached Yang Kai. The two Second Stage experts struck first, showing no mercy. Instantly, Origin Qi burst forth in the hall, energy surging everywhere.

But immediately, a series of loud crashes rang out, mixed with cries of pain. All the City Lord’s mansion martial artists who attacked Yang Kai were sent flying back, crashing into the walls and leaving holes all around the hall.

"What's going on?"

"What happened?"

"Did I see that right? Am I seeing things?"

Cries of shock echoed as the guests couldn't believe their eyes. Some rubbed their eyes over and over, but the scene didn't change.

The dozen martial artists, including the two Second Stage experts, had all been sent flying in a single exchange.

They couldn't have done such a ridiculous thing for no reason—the only explanation was that Yang Kai had knocked them away.

Yet ninety-nine percent of people hadn't even seen how Yang Kai attacked. They only vaguely saw his figure blur for a moment.

Only a handful of Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts narrowed their eyes, faces serious, realizing Yang Kai was extraordinary.

Luo Jin felt the same. He had thought Yang Kai was just an ignorant youth, reckless and overestimating himself. Yet now, seeing Yang Kai’s hidden depths revealed in an instant, Luo Jin realized—this was serious trouble.

After defeating the City Lord’s mansion martial artists, Yang Kai remained calm and composed, as if nothing had happened, continuing toward the bride.

"What are you all standing around for? Attack together!" Luo Jin shouted, seeing things go wrong.

In the next moment, even more City Lord’s mansion experts flew out, charging at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suddenly stopped, turned to look around, his eyes cold as he said, "If anyone else dares to come at me, don't blame me for being merciless."

Hearing this, many of the martial artists hesitated, afraid for their lives. But with Luo Jin watching, they could only grit their teeth, unleash their power, and summon their Secret Treasures and secret techniques, attacking Yang Kai together.

In an instant, Yang Kai was surrounded by multicolored light, surging energy colliding and roaring. The whole hall shook, as if it might collapse at any moment.
