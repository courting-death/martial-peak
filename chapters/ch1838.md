## Chapter 1838 — Ten Years of Wild Ambition

"Has the Sect Master come out of seclusion yet?" In the Hundred Flowers Residence, Ye Xijun leisurely sipped her tea and asked Wu Yi.

She had returned to Lingxiao Sect three months ago, and as Yang Kai had expected and as everyone had hoped, upon her return Ye Xijun was already a Void King Realm expert.

She had originally been the foremost of Dark Star; after stagnating at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm for many years she had glimpsed a sliver of Domain mysteries, and then had willingly stayed in Lingxiao Sect to guard Yang Yan. If not for that, she would have broken through alongside Qian Tong when Yang Kai first left Dark Star.

Wu Yi had also broken through to the Origin Returning Realm a month ago, and during that time had been taking instruction from Ye Xijun; upon hearing this she promptly replied, "Not yet. Since the Sect Master returned two months ago he has been in seclusion in Tianyi Palace. Even the two wives have not seen him."

"Hm..." Ye Xijun nodded lightly. Just as she intended to check Wu Yi's cultivation progress over the past few days, she suddenly looked up toward a direction, her face turning serious: "Is that... the direction of Tianyi Palace?"

"Has something happened to the Sect Master?" Wu Yi cried out in alarm.

"It doesn't look like disaster — Spiritual Qi is converging over there. Could the Sect Master be breaking through?" Even the steady Ye Xijun was startled by her own guess.

How soon had it been? It had only been a year or two since the Sect Master had broken into the Void King Realm — how could he be ready to break through again so quickly?

"I'll go take a look." With that she vanished.

Outside Tianyi Palace stood a figure wrapped in black mist, ghastly and eerie. Ye Xijun glanced at him in surprise and stepped forward, calling, "Senior Brother!"

The Ghost Ancestor turned, chuckling as he replied, "Junior Sister!"

Although they had only known each other a short time, both were Void King Realm experts and members of Lingxiao Sect, so they addressed one another as fellow disciples. After Ye Xijun reached the Void King Realm, the Great Elder's position had automatically been vacated, and she was honored as a Grand Elder on par with the Ghost Ancestor.

Thus their ranks were equal.

“Junior Sister Ye, did you also sense the disturbance here and come to take a look?”

"Yes. Judging from the flow of Spiritual Qi it seems like a breakthrough. But I remember you said the Sect Master only advanced to the Void King Realm less than a year ago — how can he be breaking through so soon?"

"Who can say." The Ghost Ancestor shrugged. "I don't understand it either. That boy... ahem, the Sect Master is not one to be measured by ordinary logic."

Ye Xijun's brows knitted tightly. "Although the Sect Master is a prodigy who reached the Void King Realm at a young age, if one breaks through too frequently in a short time the foundation might not be stable."

She couldn't help but worry for Yang Kai.

The Void King Realm was no ordinary level. Talents among martial artists often made successive breakthroughs at low ranks, but after the Void King Realm any further advancement required steady, careful progress, step by step, leaving no hidden troubles.

In the Star Domain many Void King Realm experts spent their lives stuck at a single layer, never able to glimpse higher Martial Dao.

Yang Kai's rate of breakthroughs had been so rapid it made Ye Xijun uneasy.

The Ghost Ancestor pondered: "The Sect Master is not reckless for fame; if he dares to break through now he must have his own reliance. There's no use for us to worry — wait until he comes out and we'll know."

"Senior Brother is right." Ye Xijun inhaled deeply and stared at the gates of Tianyi Palace.

Vast quantities of Spiritual Qi gathered into Tianyi Palace. Though the breakthrough was through a Stage and without a full Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism, the scene was still magnificent.

Almost all of Lingxiao Sect's disciples noticed the anomaly at Tianyi Palace, and before long Yang Kai's family and friends filled the area behind Ye Xijun and the Ghost Ancestor, their faces tense as they watched.

The dense Spiritual Qi poured into Tianyi Palace and quickly vanished, as if devoured.

This continued for half a day. At one moment Yang Kai's long roar suddenly issued from within Tianyi Palace, and a force seemingly even greater than the Ghost Ancestor's radiated out.

Everyone crouched low, nearly pinned to the ground by the pressure, though the force flashed past and did not persist.

The Ghost Ancestor's eyes brightened as he murmured, "Controlled release and containment! Haha, Junior Sister, it looks like we worried for nothing."

Ye Xijun finally relaxed but remained cautious. "Let's wait until the Sect Master emerges before making a judgment."

At that moment the gates of Tianyi Palace swung open and Yang Kai stepped out.

Ye Xijun and the Ghost Ancestor immediately sent out Divine Sense to observe Yang Kai.

After a moment they exchanged looks and smiled knowingly.

The energy fluctuations about Yang Kai were steady and even, showing no sign that rapid breakthroughs had left his foundation unstable, and the two finally put their minds at rest.

"So many people?" Yang Kai glanced at the familiar faces before him, smiling awkwardly as he cupped his fist, "Sorry, I accidentally broke through and disturbed everyone."

"Accidentally..."

Many glared at Yang Kai!

Although most present were Saint King Realm and Origin Returning Realm cultivators were rare, they understood how difficult the Void King Realm was to attain; Yang Kai's words sounded odd to them.

"Congratulations to the Sect Master." The Ghost Ancestor laughed heartily. "The Sect Master's aptitude is the best I've seen in my life."

"Sect Master, how did you suddenly break through?" Ye Xijun asked, baffled.

"Nothing special; I was at the peak of the Stage and then solved some things." Yang Kai replied with a smile.

Primarily Yang Yan and the formidable Wu Shengfeng had given Yang Kai a great shock. Although he had known the Void King Realm wasn't the peak of Martial Dao, he hadn't cared much, but Wu Shengfeng's appearance awakened a sense of crisis.

Sitting in meditation for a month and recalling the pressure Wu Shengfeng had placed on him, he finally broke through.

As he had told Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, on the martial path once the mind clears and one strives forward the realm naturally rises.

Once the problems circling his mind were resolved, the realm rose of its own accord.

"Everyone, you may return — it's nothing." Yang Kai bowed slightly, and the crowd dispersed.

"Two elders, please stay; I have matters to discuss with you." Yang Kai called out again.

The Ghost Ancestor and Ye Xijun halted and eyed Yang Kai suspiciously.

After everyone had left Ye Xijun asked, "What does the Sect Master wish to say?"

"I have something for you to look at." Yang Kai said as he stretched out both hands and pointed at Ye Xijun and the Ghost Ancestor.

The two did not dodge or resist, allowing Yang Kai to touch their heads. At once information flooded into their Sea of Consciousness, and they began to examine it.

A moment later the Ghost Ancestor shuddered and opened his eyes: "Star Realm? There's a Star Realm above the Star Domain? Is that senior truly the Starry Sky Emperor?"

It was only then that the Ghost Ancestor understood Yang Yan's identity — Yang Kai's information had made it clear.

Ye Xijun was not as shocked; she had already known Yang Yan's status. Instead she frowned and said, "Sect Master, according to the method left by the elder, to enter the Star Realm one must gather nine Star Emperor Tokens and have six Void King Third Stage experts infuse power to draw on the stars and open the Star Gate. You intend to go to the Star Realm?"

Yang Kai nodded: "Correct."

"Is it because of the matter the elder spoke of regarding a guardian?" Ye Xijun asked.

"Not entirely." Yang Kai shook his head and fell into thought. "As a martial artist on this path, don't you yearn for higher Martial Dao?"

Ye Xijun's eyes brightened and she nodded earnestly.

"That's right." Yang Kai grinned. "If one is content one will stagnate. If I stayed I'd eventually reach the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and stand at the top of this Star Domain, but so what? If another like Wu Shengfeng appears he could trample me."

If Yang Kai were easily satisfied, he would have remained in Zhongdu on Tongxuan Continent instead of returning to Lingxiao Sect.

"But opening the Star Gate requires such harsh conditions — how can they be met?" The Ghost Ancestor frowned. "Never mind the nine Star Emperor Tokens, you may be able to gather those, but where will you find six Void King Realm Third Stage experts? The entire Star Domain may not even have six; even if there are, they are hidden from the world and impossible to track."

"Where there's a will there's a way." Yang Kai smiled and patted the Ghost Ancestor's shoulder. "Elder, I'm counting you among them!"

"Me?" The Ghost Ancestor was shocked and quickly waved his hands. "If I could reach the Third Stage of the Void King Realm in this life it would not be without hope, but I don't know when that would be."

"Ten years! You must reach the Third Stage within ten years!" Yang Kai's expression turned grave. "I'll have Little Senior Sister fully support you, and spiritual pills for cultivation will be supplied without limit, but you must not rush recklessly."

The Ghost Ancestor pondered, then declared boldly, "Fine — I'll go into seclusion for ten years and will not fail the Sect Master's expectations!"

Yang Kai then smiled at Ye Xijun: "You as well — if you can reach the Third Stage in ten years, come with me to the Star Realm."

"I'll do my best." Ye Xijun forced a smile, but she knew it was virtually impossible; she had only just advanced to the First Stage of the Void King Realm, and could not hope to reach the Third Stage within ten years without Yang Kai's talent and opportunities.

"Even if the three of us meet the conditions, where will we find three more?" The Ghost Ancestor worried again.

"Finding people isn't urgent. I'll first gather the Star Emperor Tokens." Yang Kai grinned. "I'll leave Dark Star in a few days and entrust the sect to you two."

"Sect Master, rest assured — with Senior Brother and I here, I dare say no fool would act brazenly." Ye Xijun smiled slightly.
