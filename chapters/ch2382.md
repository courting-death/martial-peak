## Chapter 2382 — Ice Heart Pavilion

Sangde let out a sly laugh and said, “My master passed away five years ago. What opinion could he possibly have?” As he spoke, his expression suddenly twisted. “That old bastard, even in death, refused to hand that tool over to me. I have no choice but to retrieve it myself.”

Yang Kai was taken aback by these words. Judging by Sangde’s expression, it seemed his relationship with his master had not been pleasant. Who knew what grudges or entanglements lay between them?

“I’ve been preparing for this for five years, always searching for someone like you. Today, I’ve finally found the right person. As long as you nod and place your trust in me, I guarantee I can get you out of this Jixu Secret Realm!” Sangde looked at Yang Kai with excitement.

“I don’t really have a choice, do I?” Yang Kai chuckled.

Sangde replied calmly, “Though I rarely leave my abode, I’ve spent the past nine hundred years refining artifacts on Tongtian Island and have made many friends. Many people owe me favors. Young Brother, you’d best think this through carefully.”

Though the words sounded vague, Yang Kai was no fool. He could hear the threat in Sangde’s tone. He claimed to have many friends and many who owed him favors—in other words, he could call on many to act for him. If Yang Kai refused, he’d likely find it hard to take a single step in Tongtian City in the future, with many people making things difficult for him, even seeking his life.

“First, help me repair this Purification Array. I need some time to consider.” Yang Kai pointed at the Refining Furnace.

“Of course, of course.” Sangde smiled slightly. This time, he didn’t nag further. Instead, his expression grew serious as he formed a series of hand seals, ignited the furnace fire, and began repairing the Purification Array.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, brows tightly furrowed. He appeared to be weighing Sangde’s proposal, but in truth, he was closely watching the old man’s artifact refining, lest he tamper with the Purification Array.

Sangde truly lived up to his reputation as a master artificer. He tossed various materials into the Refining Furnace, his hand seals changing constantly as he inscribed arrays inside. The massive furnace would occasionally emit a deep humming sound.

Yang Kai was an alchemist himself. Though he’d never dabbled in artifact refining, the two arts shared many similarities—material selection, fire control, array inscription, and so on. So, even if he didn’t fully understand, he could tell Sangde wasn’t being perfunctory. He was genuinely helping to repair the Purification Array.

After a full hour, Sangde suddenly stopped his hand seals, and the furnace fire gradually weakened. When it reached a certain point, Sangde struck the furnace with several seals before abruptly withdrawing his hands.

He reached out and lifted the lid. The cover of the Refining Furnace flew off, and a set of Formation Flags and a Formation Foundation shot out, landing in his hands. Yang Kai glanced over and saw that the Purification Array had indeed been restored, and it seemed even more vibrant than when Ling Yinqin had first lent it to him. In other words, this set was now even better than before.

Sangde smiled and said, “The Purification Array you brought was something I refined fifty years ago. In the past fifty years, I’ve gained new insights and improved my skills, so I took the liberty of making a few modifications. Don’t worry, it’s definitely better than before.”

As he spoke, he didn’t hesitate and directly handed the Formation Flags and Formation Foundation of the Purification Array to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai accepted them without worry that Sangde had tampered with the array. After a brief inspection, he tossed them into his Spatial Ring and cupped his fists. “Thank you, Master.”

Sangde asked, “So, Young Brother, have you made up your mind?”

“I’ve decided.” Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Count me in.”

Sangde burst out laughing. “I knew you were a reasonable man, Young Brother. I didn’t misjudge you.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “I just want to leave this place. Even if it wasn’t you, I’d cooperate with anyone who could help.”

“No matter, no matter. In that case, let’s meet at the city gate in three days!” Sangde smiled. “I need to prepare a few things and gather the others. Please be sure to arrive on time, Young Brother!”

“I’ll take my leave.” Yang Kai stood up and cupped his fists to Sangde.

“By the way, may I ask your name, Young Brother?” Sangde suddenly inquired.

“Yang Kai!”

There was no need to hide his name in this place, so Yang Kai simply gave his real name.

After leaving Sangde’s residence, Yang Kai took out the communication bead Jiao Yi had given him earlier and contacted him. He learned that they had indeed moved to a cave residence in the inner city, not far from where he and Liu Qianyun were staying. They agreed to meet soon so he could return the repaired Purification Array to Ling Yinqin.

After walking a few streets, Yang Kai suddenly stopped and looked up at a building not far away.

The building looked like a pavilion, six stories tall—not too big, not too small. But to occupy such a spot in this bustling area, its owner was surely no ordinary person.

In fact, the owner of this pavilion was anything but ordinary.

Because this was the Ice Heart Pavilion!

Yang Kai knew the master of Ice Heart Pavilion was an extremely powerful Emperor Realm expert, on par with the master of Tongtian Island. However, unlike the latter, the Ice Heart Pavilion master seemed to control only this pavilion, while the Tongtian Island master ruled the entire island.

When he first arrived at Tongtian Island, Ling Yinqin had sold her goods to a beautiful woman named Fan Xin, who was from Ice Heart Pavilion.

The three characters “Ice Heart Pavilion” brought back many memories for Yang Kai. Sangde had also mentioned that, besides himself, only the masters of Ice Heart Pavilion and Tongtian Island knew the location of the exit.

Seeking information about the exit from those two was obviously unrealistic. They were Third Stage Emperor Realm experts—he might not even get to meet them, and even if he did, he couldn’t just ask outright.

This would have to be approached gradually. Yang Kai felt Sangde was somewhat unreliable and might be plotting something in secret. One shouldn’t put all their eggs in one basket. If he wanted to leave the Jixu Secret Realm, he’d have to deal with the Ice Heart Pavilion master sooner or later—so he might as well start now.

Outside Ice Heart Pavilion stood a wooden sign with two lines of characters carved into it. Yang Kai moved closer and saw it was a recruitment notice for alchemists.

“Hiring high-grade Spiritual Pill alchemists. Generous compensation!”

There were only these two lines, but they made Yang Kai’s eyes light up.

The calligraphy was elegant and forceful, with a faint, indescribable aura of Dao hidden within. It was clearly written by a formidable expert.

Just as Yang Kai was standing in front of the sign, a beautiful woman walked out of Ice Heart Pavilion and asked with a smile, "Are you an alchemist, young man?"

Standing motionless before the sign, Yang Kai made it easy for others to make certain assumptions.

Yang Kai looked up at her. When their eyes met, the beautiful woman was surprised. “It’s you.”

“So it’s Senior Sister Fan!” Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists.

The beautiful woman was none other than Fan Xin, who had previously bought Ling Yinqin’s goods at the dock.

“Why call me Senior Sister?” Fan Xin pouted at Yang Kai, displeased. “That makes me sound so much older. Your cultivation is higher than mine—just call me Junior Sister.”

“Junior Sister Fan!” Yang Kai immediately corrected himself.

“How should I address you, Senior Brother?” Fan Xin asked.

Yang Kai quickly gave his name. Fan Xin smiled and said, “So you’re Senior Brother Yang. Are you also an alchemist?”

“Yes, I know a little,” Yang Kai replied modestly.

Fan Xin’s beautiful eyes lit up and she asked eagerly, “What grade of alchemist are you, Senior Brother Yang?”

“Dao Origin-Grade,” Yang Kai understated his abilities. After all, Imperial-Grade alchemists were extremely rare. Even Sangde was only an Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade artificer, yet he was highly respected on Tongtian Island. If he ever advanced to Imperial-Grade, even the island master would have to show him respect.

“What’s the highest grade of pill you can refine?” Fan Xin became even more enthusiastic upon hearing Yang Kai was a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist, moving closer so that a fragrant breeze wafted over him, making his heart flutter.

“Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level, I suppose. Occasionally, I can manage Upper-Level, but not often.”

“Would you be willing to come inside for a test? If you can really refine Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pills, Ice Heart Pavilion will definitely hire you for a high salary.”

“Sure.” Yang Kai smiled. He had come here partly to find a backer—since he was new to the city, he might run into trouble, and having a backer would make life easier in Tongtian City. The other reason was to meet the master of Ice Heart Pavilion and get acquainted with this expert.

Seeing Yang Kai agree so readily, Fan Xin was overjoyed and quickly led him inside.

Yang Kai glanced around and found that Ice Heart Pavilion seemed to be a place that sold materials. The shelves were filled with all kinds of ingredients for alchemy, artifact refining, and cultivation, but there were no finished pills or Secret Treasures on display.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, business at Ice Heart Pavilion didn’t seem very good. There were only three or five customers inside, browsing the goods.

However, several similarly dressed women were accompanying the customers, introducing the merchandise.

“Does Ice Heart Pavilion only accept women?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Fan Xin smiled and said, “Yes, that’s the rule set by the Pavilion Master.”

“So I’m breaking the rules?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, thinking that the elusive master of Ice Heart Pavilion was either a lecher or a woman, to have set such a rule.

Fan Xin replied, “It’s different for us. We’re all Personal Disciples of the master. If you join Ice Heart Pavilion, it would only be as a hired hand.”

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, not minding. They only accepted female disciples, so it was impossible for him to become one of them, nor would he want to.
