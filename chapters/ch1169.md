## Chapter 1169 — I Didn't Leave Anything Unsaid, Did I?

Because Crystal Stone is so precious, many of the cultivators from the major forces entering Flowing Flame Sandland this time came specifically to hunt Fire Spirit Beasts; some cultivators from small families and minor forces had the same idea — if they could get Crystal Stone and sell it outside, it would be a huge windfall. These things never appear outside; only Flowing Flame Sandland produces them, and they are especially prized by alchemists and artificers.

“Brother Yang, if you run into a corporeal Fire Spirit Beast, do not engage it,” Wei Guchang warned gravely. “A corporeal Fire Spirit Beast is almost equivalent to a Ninth-Tier demonic beast — extremely troublesome.”

A Ninth-Tier demonic beast is comparable to an Origin Returning Realm expert; if a Saint King Realm cultivator confronts one, there’s little to be gained — one slip and you get annihilated.

After saying that he sneered and added, “But such things are rare; it’s basically impossible to encounter one.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and asked, “I understand the situation with Fire Spirit Beasts. What, then, is Flowing Flame Fireblaze?”

Wei Guchang's expression immediately turned serious. In a low voice he said, “Flowing Flame Fireblaze is even more dangerous to those entering the place than Fire Spirit Beasts. Fortunately, unlike the vast numbers of Fire Spirit Beasts, Flowing Flame Fireblaze is extremely scarce — some people may never encounter it; even if they do, at most they’ll meet one or two. But Brother Yang must not underestimate it. It moves with incredible speed, even faster than the spread of Divine Sense, making it extremely hard to detect; it might fly past you and you wouldn't even know.”

Yang Kai couldn't help but be moved — if it can exceed the speed of Divine Sense, one can imagine how uncanny it is.

“Its danger is not only speed, but immense lethality! If you are unprepared or not strong enough, once it strikes you, your soul will be utterly incinerated. In the blink of an eye you'll be reduced to ash. Elder Qian told me that whenever Flowing Flame Sandland opens, there are always a few unlucky fellows slain by Flowing Flame Fireblazes.”

“Isn't that an unfortunate, senseless death?” Yang Kai exclaimed.

Wei Guchang smiled. “Brother Yang is right — it's a senseless disaster. But if you dare enter Flowing Flame Sandland, you must be mentally prepared to accept certain risks. If you get struck and die from Flowing Flame Fireblaze, you can't blame others.”

At this, Xuan'er at Yang Kai's side pursed her lips and smiled. “Senior Brother, you only talk about Flowing Flame Fireblaze's dangers, but you haven't told Brother Yang what good it can bring.”

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, thinking to himself: Flowing Flame Fireblaze is also something good?

Wei Guchang laughed. “That's exactly what I was about to say. Flowing Flame Fireblaze is indeed terrifying, but it's also exceedingly valuable. Brother Yang should know that some people's Divine Sense is unusual, right?”

“Mutated Divine Sense?” Yang Kai's expression changed.

“Exactly. Mutated Divine Sense — some people's Divine Sense carries strange attributes, like Divine Sense Fire, Divine Sense Poison, or Divine Sense Ice! These mutated Divine Sense forms differ from ordinary Divine Sense, but without exception they possess extraordinary powers. Divine Sense Fire needs no explanation — it's what alchemists and artificers most covet. Divine Sense Poison and Divine Sense Ice are also unpredictably potent in battle. These mutated Divine Sense forms are extremely rare; some are innate, some are acquired by cultivating certain techniques or martial skills — of course, those techniques and martial skills are themselves rare and ordinary people never see them. Even Yingyue Hall doesn't have them, and some only come from extraordinary encounters — obtained by chance.”

Yang Kai agreed; his own Divine Sense Fire had been gained by accident — back in Zhongdu when he tried to devour a piece of a fire-type jade and a True Spirit born from it increased his strength, by a twist of fate causing his Divine Sense to mutate.

He was in the best position of anyone to speak to all the wonders of Divine Sense Fire.

“And Flowing Flame Fireblaze is something that has a chance to mutate someone's Divine Sense; it can grant Divine Sense Fire,” Wei Guchang's eyes shone. “Imagine, Brother Yang, how many alchemists and artificers would kill to possess Divine Sense Fire. If someone obtained Flowing Flame Fireblaze, it would certainly have artificers and alchemists fighting over it till they broke each other's heads.” He glanced at Yang Kai deliberately as he spoke.

Influenced by Qian Tong, Wei Guchang assumed Yang Kai had an Origin-Grade artificer master behind him; being an artificer, such a master would naturally covet Flowing Flame Fireblaze, and as Yang Kai's disciple he would expect his pupil to help procure it.

To his disappointment, Yang Kai showed no change in expression, appearing utterly unconcerned.

Wei Guchang hurriedly added, “Of course, attempting to mutate Divine Sense carries risks — it's very possible the Divine Sense won't mutate and the Flowing Flame Fireblaze will incinerate your soul entirely. Just be careful, Brother Yang; practically no one manages to obtain Flowing Flame Fireblaze. If you meet it, it's best to avoid it early.”

Yang Kai nodded subtly, outwardly calm while inwardly mulling over whether he should give chase if he actually encountered it.

Flowing Flame Fireblaze can mutate someone's Divine Sense and potentially grant Divine Sense Fire, but he already had Divine Sense Fire, so he shouldn't fear being burned by it.

“That's the general situation in the Heat-Flame Zone: besides enduring the heat, you only need to watch out for Fire Spirit Beasts and Flowing Flame Fireblaze. The heat inside the outermost Heat-Flame Zone isn't uniform — the deeper you go, the fiercer it gets and the harder it is to withstand. However, if you can pass through the outermost Heat-Flame Zone into the Second Layer, that is paradise.”

“Why do you say that?” Yang Kai's interest was piqued.

“Because the Second Layer is the heaven-and-earth treasure area. There is no heat there; only heaven-and-earth treasures and a few demonic beasts. Once you enter the Second Layer, aside from watching out for others' sneak attacks, as long as you don't draw the attention of high-level demonic beasts, your gains will definitely be substantial!”

Yang Kai's eyes lit up. “There's such an area?”

“Of course — otherwise Flowing Flame Sandland wouldn't be so attractive. Although some good things grow in high temperatures, that's rare; without the heaven-and-earth treasure area, Flowing Flame Sandland's value would at least be halved.” Wei Guchang smiled, satisfied to see Brother Yang's interest.

“My junior sister and I are mainly heading for the heaven-and-earth treasure area this time; hunting Fire Spirit Beasts will be left to others.”

He and Xuan'er held high status in Yingyue Hall, so such grunt work naturally fell to junior brothers and junior sisters; their job was simply to try to scoop up benefits from the heaven-and-earth treasure area.

Other major forces operate the same way: a large portion of disciples entering the place stay in the Heat-Flame Zone hunting Fire Spirit Beasts to harvest Crystal Stone, while a few elite few venture into the heaven-and-earth treasure area searching for good things and the opportunities that belong to them.

“Flowing Flame Sandland is divided into two areas?” Yang Kai clicked his tongue in wonder — this exceeded his expectations.

“More than two,” Wei Guchang shook his head. “If you go deeper from the heaven-and-earth treasure area you'll encounter a second Heat-Flame Zone. The second Heat-Flame Zone is far more dangerous than the outermost; Elder Qian forbade us from going deeper.”

“If there's a second Heat-Flame Zone, is there a second heaven-and-earth treasure area?” Yang Kai's expression shifted.

“That I don't know. Yingyue Hall has never had anyone breach the second Heat-Flame Zone; many elite disciples have died miserably there. I doubt even forces like Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, or Star Emperor Sect know what lies further in.”

“So everyone concentrates their activities in the outermost two areas?”

“You could say that. But Brother Yang, rest assured — that damned place is huge. Apart from special means of communication, you might spend half a year inside and not meet a single living person.”

“Half a year?”

“Oh, I forgot to tell Brother Yang: Flowing Flame Sandland only stays open for half a year each time. When the six-month limit is reached, everyone is sent out; no one may remain. Also, Star Shuttles cannot be used there — some force suppresses them and even prevents us from flight. For travel you can only rely on your own movement and speed-enhancing martial skills; that's the most complained-about thing.” Wei Guchang shook his head, displeased.

If not for that mysterious power suppressing all flying secret treasures and abilities, those inside would harvest several times more.

Hearing this, Yang Kai was secretly pleased.

He didn't know what tricks others had to increase speed, but he had Wind-and-Thunder Wings — although mainly used for flight, they could certainly boost speed.

He just didn't know whether Wind-and-Thunder Wings could be used inside; after all, they weren't a flying secret treasure, so they should be unrestricted. He resolved to test them as soon as he entered.

“Also, Brother Yang should note that although we'll enter Flowing Flame Sandland from the same entrance, we may appear in very different places inside, so each of us must carry a special compass for communication — that will make finding each other easier.”

As Wei Guchang spoke, Xuan'er immediately took a communication compass from her Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai.

Communication compasses are usually forged in sets; the number per set varies. Typically a set contains three or five or seven, though there's no strict upper limit — an artificer can forge as many as desired.

Each communication compass only transmits within the same set, so you needn't worry your messages being intercepted by unrelated people.

Qian Tong once gave Yang Kai a communication compass for their two-way messages; that one was different from this new one. He also has compasses for communicating with Wu Yi and Yang Flame — Yang Kai's ring already contains several such secret treasures.

Although Yang Kai had no intention of acting alongside Wei Guchang and the others, he still accepted the compass and tossed it back into his Spatial Ring.

“Junior Sister, I didn't leave anything out, did I?” Wei Guchang asked Xuan'er, fearing he might have omitted something that would put Yang Kai in danger inside.

“I don't think so,” Xuan'er shook her head lightly.

“Then that'll do for now. If Brother Yang remembers something to ask, don't hesitate.” Wei Guchang grinned.

“Alright.”
