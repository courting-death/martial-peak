## Chapter 1689 — Sea of Consciousness

Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao each, as they had hoped, received ten Domain Stones.

With so many Domain Stones available for them to comprehend the mysteries of Domain power, and combined with the experience gained from trials in the Blood Prison, by the time they next left Dark Star they would be highly likely to break through the shackles of the Void King Realm and reach the supreme pinnacle.

The others were also granted differing numbers of Domain Stones according to their cultivation.

Yang Kai gave five to those at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and three to those at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

As long as they could properly make use of the mild energy within these Domain Stones, refining their Shi to the completion would certainly not be a problem.

It was not that Yang Kai was stingy or unwilling to give more; it was simply that giving more would be pointless. Although Domain Stones are consumables, they are not like Saint Crystals — each Domain Stone can be used for a very, very long time.

The Domain Stones Yang Kai gave out would absolutely be enough for their own needs.

After bestowing the Domain Stones, Yang Kai took out from his Spatial Ring a large batch of secret treasures of mixed appearance but of respectable quality.

These artifacts were the spoils Yang Kai brought back from his recent killings, mostly taken from several powerful yao experts on Di Chen Star. Every one of them was at least of Origin-Grade, with quite a few being Upper-Level Origin-Grade treasures.

With these treasures at hand, the strength of those present would be significantly increased, greatly raising their survival rates in future clashes with the Corpse Spirit Sect; as for how they would be distributed, that was not Yang Kai's concern — Ye Xijun would handle it properly.

There were also various spiritual pills and wondrous medicines for cultivation.

Yang Kai's Spatial Ring was like a veritable treasure vault; everything he produced from it left others amazed.

After dealing with these matters, Yang Kai escorted Xia Ningshang and Su Yan back to Tianyi Palace.

Since taking residence in this restricted area, Yang Kai had been living in Tianyi Palace. Though the palace itself wasn’t particularly vast, it was by no means small either, with countless side chambers within. In the past, Yang Kai had lived there alone, but now Su Yan and Xia Ningshang naturally shared the place, staying by his side.

Although the Lingxiao Sect was safe and there was no need to worry about dangers, Yang Kai still hoped to raise the strength of those closest to him.

Su Yan had no need to worry. She already possessed the Essence Power of the Ice Phoenix and wielded the Profound Frost Divine Sword; her cultivation had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. On Dark Star, unless Qian Tong intervened, no one was a match for her.

And Qian Tong would not strike at Su Yan.

Xia Ningshang was now about to advance to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. After becoming the Star Lord of Tongxuan Continent her cultivation progressed faster than before; in recent years she had been absorbed in pill refinement, and combined with her special constitution, even without deliberate cultivation her strength rose steadily. He believed she would break through and advance before long.

However, being at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm still left her somewhat weak.

Yang Kai produced a jade-green suit of armor and a wheel-shaped secret treasure and handed them to Xia Ningshang. "Little Senior Sister, when you have time, refine these two items; I believe they will help you," he said.

"This armor is so beautiful," Xia Ningshang said, glancing at it; she paid little mind to the wheel-like treasure and was instead greatly interested in the jade-green armor.

Yang Kai chuckled. "Although I don't know the exact grade of this armor, it is undoubtedly Void King-Grade. With it, few in the world will be able to break through your defenses."

Xia Ningshang was not very skilled in combat. As a defensive secret treasure, the armor was undoubtedly very suitable for her.

"Junior Brother, where did you get it? Is it very valuable?" Xia Ningshang asked, looking it over and reluctant to put it down.

"Whether it's valuable isn't important; what matters is whether it can protect you on my behalf."

Xia Ningshang looked up at Yang Kai, pursed her lips in a smile, and wore a face of complete satisfaction.

The armor had been brought out of the Blood Prison; when Yang Kai obtained that Yao King's Void Mind Crystal he also took the bones of the Yao King Feng E, and naturally did not spare his Spatial Ring either.

The Yao King Feng E had been a top expert at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm in life; how could his Spatial Ring contain inferior items?

One could even say that most of the secret treasures and pills Yang Kai had distributed earlier in the council hall had come from the Spatial Ring of the Yao King Feng E.

Compared with this Void King-Grade armor, the other wealth in the Spatial Ring was negligible, yet still not to be ignored; at the very least, the vast riches in the Spatial Ring were sufficient to support the Lingxiao Sect's operations for a good while.

"Take this as well," Yang Kai said, handing over the wheel-like secret treasure.

That wheel-like secret treasure was also Void King-Grade — originally an Ancestral Treasure of the Battle Sky Alliance: the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel!

In years past, Yang Kai fought the Battle Sky Alliance's Alliance Master Qu Zheng and killed him; the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel was taken as spoils and had been hidden away until now.

With the two Void King-Grade secret treasures in hand, so long as she refined them properly, Little Senior Sister would have no need to fear any enemy below the Void King Realm.

Xia Ningshang said nothing further; obediently following Yang Kai's request, she put away the jade-green armor and the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel, stole a glance at Su Yan who sat quietly beside them, then quickly planted a kiss on Yang Kai's cheek and darted out like a startled rabbit.

Her steps were hurried and flustered, as if she had done something shameful.

Su Yan looked at Yang Kai with a faint, knowing smile and said meaningfully, “Ningshang’s gotten bolder under your… guidance.”

Yang Kai let out an awkward chuckle.

He had little to give Su Yan; back in Ice Heart Valley he had already passed the main Ice Phoenix inheritance to her, and had even given her the Ten‑Thousand‑Year Ice Jade Pedestal.

With the Ten‑Thousand‑Year Ice Jade Pedestal assisting, Su Yan's cultivation speed greatly increased, and with the Profound Frost Divine Sword in hand, she would no longer need to rely on other external items.

Yang Kai also thought of Shan Qingluo; when they parted in the Blood Prison he had given her two hundred Domain Stones and the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure — Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip.

He wondered how that enchantress was doing now, and whether her cultivation was going smoothly.

He also remembered Yang Yan...

"Senior Sister, you continue your cultivation, I'll go out for a while," Yang Kai suddenly stood up and said.

Su Yan nodded lightly, took out the Ten‑Thousand‑Year Ice Jade Pedestal, sat cross-legged upon it, held a Domain Stone in her palm, and closed her eyes to contemplate.

Yang Kai left Tianyi Palace and went straight to the very center of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Although he had learned from Ye Xijun that Yang Yan had been sleeping these years with little change, Yang Kai still wanted to see her with his own eyes.

On Dark Star, Yang Yan had been his closest friend; barring accident, that friendship would endure.

But the origins tied to Yang Yan were now too great; no one knew what she would become once she truly awoke, and Yang Kai was naturally uneasy.

The Sixth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland did not cover a wide area — roughly only a few li across.

Holding the Star Emperor Token in his hand, Yang Kai easily passed through the Fifth Layer of Flowing Flame Barrier and arrived before the bamboo grove.

A pavilion loomed faintly behind the bamboo grove; Yang Kai stepped forward.

The Sixth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland had always been a forbidden area of the Lingxiao Sect; formerly only Great Elder Ye Xijun could set foot there — others were forbidden and lacked the ability to enter, until the last time when Ye Xijun had to lead people into the Sixth Layer, which revealed the place's existence to the Lingxiao Sect.

However, the area where that pavilion stood still remained a place no one was permitted to tread.

Yang Kai, of course, was not among those forbidden!

He passed through the bamboo grove with ease, arrived at the pavilion, swept his Divine Sense, and went straight up to the second floor.

The second floor was sparsely furnished, with only a wooden bed and nothing else.

On the wooden bed lay a woman in a black robe, with a delicate, curved figure — none other than the long-unseen Yang Yan; her appearance matched the Yang Yan in Yang Kai's memory exactly, but her aura was somewhat different.

As Yang Kai approached to look, he faintly felt a sense of oppression emanating from Yang Yan; even in sleep, her entire body exuded an aura that made one's heart tremble.

It was as if merely glancing at her would be a desecration — a sacrilege against something godlike.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then his expression suddenly changed.

In his sight Yang Yan's features began to blur; he could no longer make out the scene before him. In that instant she became ethereal and evasive, as if ceasing to exist yet simultaneously being everywhere.

His Divine Sense was also tugged by an invisible force into an abyss, falling endlessly downward.

Yang Kai bit his tongue sharply and uttered a low cry; the pain came, and the sensation of his soul falling abruptly vanished as his vision refocused.

Cold sweat broke out over his body, soaking his clothes.

"Imperial Might... truly terrifying!" Yang Kai said, still trembling inwardly.

Even in sleep, the Imperial Might Yang Yan radiated could overthrow Yang Kai's Divine Sense; it was hard to imagine what she would be like after awakening.

However, he had come here only to take a look at Yang Yan; after so many years apart, back when he had been weak she had constantly helped him. Without Yang Yan there would have been no Dragon Lair Mountain, and no present-day Lingxiao Sect.

Yang Kai was very grateful to her.

Having sensed that Yang Yan was fine and merely still sleeping, Yang Kai secretly nodded and, with no intention of lingering further, prepared to turn and leave.

But just as he was about to turn, he suddenly noticed Yang Yan's finger move slightly; the discovery made his body shudder and he immediately stopped, holding his breath as he looked intently toward the wooden bed.

An invisible force spread from Yang Yan's body, wrapping Yang Kai like the open mouth of a beast, offering him no time to react and not even allowing him to resist.

Immediately, Yang Kai's vision blurred and he found himself in a place that looked somewhat familiar.

Below, a sea of fire churned, containing a horrifying energy aura that seemed capable of destroying heaven and earth, wild and terrifying. In the sky floated various light orbs of differing hues; within those orbs, different scenes flashed by in such rapid succession that Yang Kai could not discern what they were.

"This is..." Yang Kai frowned, scanned the surroundings, and quickly realized where he was.

"Sea of Consciousness?" Yang Kai exclaimed.
