## Chapter 601 — Your Inclination Is a Bit Problematic

If Yang Kai had not inadvertently planted a love seed in Shan Qingluo's heart, Her Majesty the Queen would not have endured such torment; now that the love seed has fully matured, whenever Shan Qingluo is in Yang Kai's presence she must suppress it with all her being, for if it erupts the consequences would be unimaginable.

When that time comes, either Shan Qingluo will die or Yang Kai will.

Because of this, Bilo naturally hated Yang Kai with a fierce intensity.

As the two spoke, a figure strangely materialized in midair, looking at them with a face full of helplessness.

"You..." Shan Qingluo stared at Yang Kai in shock. "How have you returned?"

"I knew it — you are not in the right state." Yang Kai sighed softly; Shan Qingluo's abnormality was so evident he could not have failed to notice. His feigned departure earlier had merely been to listen to what this enchantress truly harbored in her heart.

Her dogged restraint and thought for his own sake moved Yang Kai somewhat.

"Perfect timing. My Lady, you need not suppress any longer — take his life now." Bilo purred, glaring at Yang Kai with hatred.

"You seem to bear quite a grudge against me," Yang Kai said darkly as he watched Bilo.

"Indeed," Bilo huffed. "I wish I could flay you alive, drink your blood, and eat your flesh! Were it not for you, my lady would not have suffered this!"

"Even without me, some other man would have taken up residence in her heart. This is the ultimate fate of the Poison Widow Lineage!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Bilo fell silent, at a loss for how to reply.

"You must leave now." Shan Qingluo's breathing grew heavier. Half a year ago the love seed in her heart was already near maturity; during the months without Yang Kai matters had improved slightly, but being forced to seek him out and live with him for three days caused the long-suppressed urges to rebound manyfold and erupt. "If you don't go now it will be too late."

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, his expression resolute. "The problem between you and me must be resolved; running away is not the solution."

"You brought this on yourself." Bilo laughed coquettishly, turning as a radiant light shimmered forth; from the void a lascivious sound echoed through heaven and earth. She cooed softly, "My Lady, the time has come — you need no longer suppress it."

Those words carried thick seduction. The present Bilo, no longer proudly overbearing, now bore a trace of Shan Qingluo's own enticing charm.

Bilo cultivated the bewitching arts as well.

When the bewitching arts were unleashed, their target was not Yang Kai; all their force was instead concentrated upon Shan Qingluo.

"Bilo, you..." Shan Qingluo, who had fought so hard to resist the desires within, was stirred by Bilo's provocation; the yearning in her heart burst forth like a breached dam and instantly drowned her reason.

The love seed in her heart flourished; instinctive desire shattered her restraint and her defense of Yang Kai, leaving only a single thought.

That thought was to possess Yang Kai! If she were an ancient, unmelting block of ice, Yang Kai now was a blazing fire — Shan Qingluo could not help but want to draw near him, to freeze him, or to let herself be melted.

A murmuring moan burst from her throat. The Enchantress Queen's face flushed crimson; her long, creamy neck gleamed like porcelain, seductive expressions blossomed, her gaze grew languid as she peered at Yang Kai, desire in her beautiful eyes utterly unabashed.

The very air shifted. Before Yang Kai's eyes countless young maidens appeared, singing and dancing lightly; each struck wanton poses, lithe and graceful, garments half undone, a delightful verdant scene shrouded under gauze and barely visible. They indulged their most licentious instincts, surrounding Yang Kai with beseeching looks.

A chill seized Yang Kai's heart.

Shan Qingluo's bewitching arts had improved; she had not deliberately unleashed them — merely a touch of feeling already created illusions.

"Break!" Yang Kai barked. The Dual Cultivation Technique began to operate, and those singing, dancing maidens who seemed endlessly desirous were all torn to pieces, dissolving into sparks of light and vanishing.

"Heh heh..." Bilo giggled. "You bastard, just give up resisting. No man can withstand my lady's bewitching arts, cough cough..."

As she spoke, her two slender thighs involuntarily tightened together; a hot current swept across her lower belly, her lower parts grew wet, and the cold wind only heightened the sensation, making it harder to suppress the surging impulses.

She, too, was heavily affected by Shan Qingluo's bewitching arts.

"I'll deal with you later!" Yang Kai glared at her coldly, his expression hostile.

"We'll see if you live to say that!" Bilo panted, her delicate body twisting; she bit her crimson lower lip and looked at Yang Kai with eyes like burning coals.

She seemed on the verge of rushing forward, throwing caution to the wind to abandon herself to carnal union with Yang Kai, but she forcefully restrained herself.

A delicate little fan appeared in the Enchantress Queen's hand. On its face were embroidered scenes of numerous handsome men and beautiful women; their garments disheveled, pairs upon pairs engaged in base acts in various poses, each wearing joyful expressions, hearts full of delight, vivid as life.

"Qingluo Fan." Yang Kai snapped.

This Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure was the heirloom passed down through Shan Qingluo's line for generations; combined with the Enchantress Queen's bewitching arts its power was beyond imagination.

Shan Qingluo, graceful in posture, waved the fan. The men and women on its surface moved with increasing vigor, as if alive, bursting from the fan and surging into Yang Kai's mind.

Pa-pa-pa...

The illusions that flooded into his mind lasted less than a breath before all were shattered into powder.

The Dual Cultivation Technique breaks all bewitching arts in the world; Shan Qingluo's Qingluo Fan had no effect on Yang Kai.

She did not realize this. After unleashing the fan's power, Shan Qingluo giggled, shrouded in a fragrant breeze as she lunged at Yang Kai; her crimson tongue pressed lightly against her teeth, her breath heaved violently. She reached out a delicate jade hand, grabbed Yang Kai's collar and pulled him toward her; her towering bosom pressed against his chest, her two slender thighs entwined around him, and she parted her lips to press them to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's index finger twitched; he longed to cast off all restraint and engage her in battle for hundreds of rounds right there.

But once the Enchantress Queen was moved, everything about her was laced with deadly poison — a poison no one could withstand.

"You demoness..." Yang Kai smiled wryly, placing his hand at the back of Shan Qingluo's head as True Yuan burst forth fiercely.

Shan Qingluo's eyes rapidly lost their luster; the depraved sounds that had echoed through heaven and earth quieted, and she sank limp into Yang Kai's embrace.

Bilo, heart brimming with anticipation to witness that thrilling scene, had involuntarily covered her breasts with her small hands, gently kneading the two protrusions with a face full of blissful enjoyment — but at a sudden sight of this scene her expression instantly drained.

"Come over here!" Yang Kai hoisted Shan Qingluo onto his shoulder and beckoned to Bilo with a feral grin.

"What are you going to do?" Bilo was on full alert and took a few hurried steps back. "What have you done to my lady?"

"I've already taken care of her. Now it's your turn." Yang Kai chuckled coldly, utterly ruthless in his expression.

Tears flooded Bilo's eyes and she suddenly screamed like a lunatic: "I'll fight you to the death!"

She lunged at Yang Kai like an enraged beast, rampant and heedless of death.

Yang Kai merely extended one hand and, with a casual maneuver, subdued her.

With Shan Qingluo slung over his shoulder and Bilo draped in his arm, Yang Kai brought his other hand down and struck that high, rounded buttock a vicious blow.

Smack...

Bilo stiffened all over. Inexplicably a mingling of embarrassed anger and sharp stimulation surged through her; that one slap seemed to have unleashed a long-brewing desire, and she could not help but feel a perverse pleasure in being ravished.

Smack...

Bilo finally cried out, struggling and writhing while cursing, punching and kicking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai paid it no mind; he sealed her True Yuan and rhythmically delivered slap after slap, each strike heavy.

Gradually Bilo ceased shouting. Instead, with every slap she let out suggestive moans, submitting as if at the mercy of her captor, ears flushed crimson and body burning.

Yang Kai stared in astonishment. "Your inclination... is a bit problematic."

"Mind your own business, put me down!" Bilo suddenly came to her senses and continued to shout.

Smack...

Wanton moans rose once more.

One day later — Cangyun Evil Land, Piaoxiang City.

In Shan Qingluo's palace, Yang Kai suddenly appeared with the Enchantress Queen and Bilo in tow.

The former attendants who had served Yang Kai — the beauty Yunli and the two maidens Ruoyu and Ruoqing — hurried over at the news and could not help but be pleased when they saw Yang Kai.

But seeing the state Shan Qingluo and Bilo were in now, they were astonished.

The Enchantress Queen lay unconscious; Bilo's beautiful eyes were bloodshot and swollen like a honey peach, as if she had been crying for a long time, yet a tide of spring affection stirred secretly on her lovely face, as if watered by dew and glowing with a peculiar sheen.

Yang Kai set her down. Bilo's body went limp and she fell to the ground, then gave a coquettish cry and sprang up, both small hands touching her buttocks, teeth clenched, hissing for breath.

"Bilo, what's wrong with you?" the beauty Yunli asked anxiously.

"N...nothing." Bilo answered meekly, her face flushed as she stole a glance at Yang Kai; fear and dread filled her eyes, and the previous brazenness was gone.

After taking that string of slaps, shadows filled her heart.

"And my lady? What happened to her?"

"My lady... had an accident." Bilo's expression darkened again.

"Let them rest for now," Yang Kai said.

"Mm." Yunli, Ruoyu and Ruoqing hastened to support Shan Qingluo and Bilo and sent them back to their rooms.

It was still the old Fenghuan Tower where Yang Kai resided.

In a second-floor chamber Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression sullen.

Shan Qingluo's relationship with him had never been so deep; it was only because of the love seed that matters grew so tangled. Now Yang Kai wished to resolve the love seed for Shan Qingluo, but he had no clue where to begin and could not help but feel anxious.
