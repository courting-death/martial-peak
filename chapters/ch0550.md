## Chapter 550 — Methods Beyond Heaven

For now, leaving aside Meng Wuya—whose mysterious nature made him impossible to fathom—Ling Taixu was at a realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, and once experts of that level clashed, it was by no means something to take lightly.

“I’m not qualified, haha,” Meng Wuya laughed calmly. “Even not counting me, that fellow below, fighting alone, none of you would be his match.”

As he spoke, he pointed distantly toward the Earth Demon below.

The Earth Demon grinned wickedly, his expression terrifyingly ferocious.

“He?” The square-jawed strong man felt a chill in his heart but wore a surprised look on his face, shaking his head slowly. “What the hell is he?”

His expression was full of disdain and scorn.

Not just him—several beyond the Divine Roaming Realm from the Eight Great Families wore similar expressions, secretly thinking that Meng Wuya must be somewhat senile to speak such nonsense.

Among the three—Earth Demon, Meng Wuya, and Ling Taixu—the one the eight feared most was Ling Taixu. He was beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, with cultivation a full tier above them, and on top of that, he had the ability to cultivate Evil Lords!

Next was Meng Wuya. Although Shopkeeper Meng was at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, the eight still couldn’t fully read him. The unknown naturally bred suspicion and apprehension.

As for Earth Demon… though also at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm like Meng Wuya, he was hardly taken seriously.

Such cultivators could be killed casually. Last time, when Yang Liting struck down an Blood Demon puppet created by Earth Demon with one palm, the Earth Demon did not dare resist, showing that this demonic bastard was really nothing special.

Hearing the square-jawed strong man’s ridicule, Meng Wuya couldn’t help but laugh heartily, “Old Demonic Master, you’re being looked down upon. What will you do?”

“Looking down on me is your right. What’s there to say?” Earth Demon chuckled eerily, not angry or ashamed one bit, his expression light, as if utterly unconcerned.

“Can you really endure that?” Meng Wuya looked at Earth Demon with a smiling face. “With your brutal nature, shouldn’t you teach this short-sighted bunch a fierce lesson instead?”

“You’ve already called them short-sighted; why should I stoop to their level?” Earth Demon smiled darkly, joking boldly as he and Meng Wuya chatted casually, treating the eight beyond the Divine Roaming Realm like nothing.

Everyone’s moods shifted strangely.

From his words, it seemed this old Demonic Master truly had formidable methods—he did not even regard those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm as worth his attention.

Did he really have the ability? The qualification?

Just as everyone was pondering, Earth Demon’s expression suddenly turned solemn, his tone calm, “Although I do not want to stoop to their level, should I keep letting them insult me, they will surely look down on me. Alas, this technique is very strenuous to use, I won’t unleash it unless absolutely necessary.”

With that, the True Yuan inside him suddenly calmed, as still as a stagnant pond, without a ripple.

“Demonic Shadow Sacred Art!” Earth Demon’s voice boomed through the world, and with his shout, the atmosphere around abruptly grew chaotic.

At the same time, all felt their blood surging wildly, as if an irresistible force was pulling, trying to drain the blood from within their bodies.

Weaker cultivators instantly grimaced in pain; under this pulling force their faces flushed red and blood leaked from the seven orifices, a horrifying sight.

Even those at the Divine Roaming Realm had to silently deploy their martial methods, struggling hard to resist.

Everyone’s expressions shifted. No one understood what technique Earth Demon had just unleashed that caused such an effect.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Brilliant red blood lights suddenly shot from all directions, flying straight into Earth Demon’s body.

These blood lights were condensed from fresh blood, sourced from the corpses of those cultivators—whether from the allied Seven Great Families or the Yang Kai household, all that blood was completely drained in an instant.

Even blood seeping into the earth was drawn out by this overwhelming suction.

Earth Demon’s body absorbed every drop of blood, turning entirely crimson, like a roasted crab.

From him surged an intimidating power of Qi and blood, far exceeding that display by the Yang Family’s Blood Servants after using their forbidden Blood Fury Technique—by several times!

Only after all the blood in a hundred zhang radius was drained did this pulling force suddenly dissipate.

Cultivators below the eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm all bled profusely from their orifices, including those from Yang Kai’s household.

However, none faced mortal danger—Earth Demon was still cautious and would not kill without cause.

At this moment, a world-shaking aura burst forth from Earth Demon, spreading invisibly with him as the center.

His momentum rapidly climbed, breaking beyond the Divine Roaming Realm at an incredible speed, still rising, still rising…

The eight elites from the Eight Great Families’ realm trembled violently, gazing at the scene with deep horror.

After a moment, the tremendous uproar finally subsided. Earth Demon drew a deep breath, a ferocious grin still on his face as he stretched his limbs, showing satisfaction.

The eight beyond the Divine Roaming Realm blinked, hurriedly sending Divine Sense to scan Earth Demon, dumbfounded.

Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

At this moment, Earth Demon was truly beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Regaining their senses, the eight noticed something extraordinary. What kind of secret technique was the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art? What tier was it? Why could it allow an Earth Demon, peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivator, to briefly reach the level beyond Divine Roaming Realm?

Even the Yang Family Blood Servants’ taboo Blood Fury Technique could not achieve this.

Tu Feng and others currently using Blood Fury Technique might trade a few blows with those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, but were still worlds apart.

Earth Demon had truly stepped into that realm!

In an instant, heavy breaths came faster, their eyes reddened.

If such a forbidden technique were obtained, the strength of their families would skyrocket.

Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, the Eight Great Families each had only a few individuals at that level, but quite a few at the peak of Divine Roaming Realm. Even temporary boosts to beyond Divine Roaming Realm were immensely invaluable.

“I am qualified to spar with you all now, aren’t I?” Earth Demon looked at them with a sinister smile. The eight looked strange—none answered.

Previously, the square-jawed strong man who insulted Earth Demon now looked grim.

Also beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, how could he now scold Earth Demon?

“The Demonic Shadow Sacred Art is quite a move,” Meng Wuya suddenly nodded lightly. “It complements that Blood Demon puppet you created, doesn’t it?”

Earth Demon chuckled, “Don’t expose me.”

Meng Wuya’s insight was extraordinary, immediately perceiving the subtle connection between the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art and the Blood Demon puppet.

The Demonic Shadow Sacred Art required a large amount of fresh blood to perform. The stronger the blood source cultivators, the greater Earth Demon’s own power boost.

However, this condition was problematic—fresh blood was not always readily available.

The Blood Demon puppet solved that by gathering the blood of the dead. Its combat ability was secondary; its main use was to absorb fresh blood.

When needed, Earth Demon could sacrifice the Blood Demon puppet, using its blood combined with his own to perform the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art.

“You have such abilities?” Yang Kai looked at Earth Demon with surprise. Though he knew Earth Demon and Meng Wuya were extraordinary and had suspected their depth, he now realized he had underestimated them.

“Young Master, forgive me, this technique is rarely used, so I haven’t displayed it before,” Earth Demon smiled.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, uninterested in prying, and then shifted his gaze jointly toward Meng Wuya with Earth Demon.

“Old man, don’t just stand there. Even with me and Sect Leader Ling, we might still be insufficient,” Earth Demon said loudly.

After all, eight opponents boasted overwhelming numbers.

Although Earth Demon and Ling Taixu were intimidating, they could not drive them all back.

Meng Wuya nodded lightly and voiced a single word from his mouth: “Release!”

Crack—

Within Meng Wuya’s body, an energy pattern resembling a chain appeared. This chain coiled around him, writhing like a spiritual serpent. With his shout, the chain shattered, releasing a halo of light that spread outward.

An unparalleled oppressive aura suddenly descended, causing heaven and earth to tremble.

Meng Wuya’s expression was calm, but compared to before, he was like another person.

Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

With just one word, one moment, Meng Wuya had ascended to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Moreover, his method differed entirely from Earth Demon’s.

Earth Demon unleashed a secret art, draining blood within a hundred zhang to boost his power.

Meng Wuya seemed to have broken a seal within, restoring his true strength.

This meant Meng Wuya’s original realm was beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, but for some unknown reason, he had sealed his own power.

This revelation shocked the Eight Great Families’ elites.

Looking at Meng Wuya again, their expressions darkened.

They found him ever more mysterious, a man utterly inscrutable.

Now, Meng Wuya posed the greatest pressure, followed by Earth Demon, while the once strongest, Ling Taixu, had become the weakest link.

Such an alignment, such depth…

Things were escalating! The eight were peculiarly alarmed, thinking that eight of them facing the issue could resolve it, yet now realizing it was not as they had imagined.

It also explained why more than ten days ago, Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya opposed them so boldly when they tried to sabotage Yang Kai’s ascension.

Had a true battle broken out then—setting aside whether they could stop Yang Kai—this War City might have been destroyed.

This fierce battle, full of twists and turns, left all watching dumbfounded, hearts both elated and tense.

Earth Demon and Meng Wuya took turns showcasing their transcendent methods, both reaching beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Such a spectacle was rare, evoking a feeling that dying here would still be worthwhile, yet they secretly hoped to see how events would unfold.
