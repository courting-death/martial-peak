## Chapter 1900 — I'll Be Waiting

The Seven-Colored Stag, an ancient aberrant species, had long since vanished from the world.

Its Inner Core was one of the principal ingredients for forging the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, and its musk gland was one of the main materials used to make Ten-Thousand-Year Incense.

Ten-Thousand-Year Incense could calm the qi and settle the mind; a single stick could burn for ten thousand years without dying out. If a martial artist could light one while training, they would be protected from heart-demons, their thoughts would run clear, and it would greatly aid their cultivation.

In the Lingxiao Sect's Ascension Dragon Hall there now hung the lingering scent of a single surviving stick of Ten-Thousand-Year Incense; it was the one Yang Kai had brought out years before from the Sixth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

If disciples of the Lingxiao Sect needed to seclude themselves to breakthrough, they could go to the Ascension Dragon Hall to train in secret; there not only was Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, but also a Martial Dao treasure called the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree to aid disciples in grasping the true way of the Martial Dao.

It could be said the Lingxiao Sect's disciples had advanced rapidly these past years; the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree were indispensable. Without those two things, the sect's overall strength today would have dropped by an entire grade.

The Seven-Colored Stag was a walking treasure trove; both its Inner Core and its musk gland were exceedingly rare and hard to find.

Yet, unexpectedly, the Hengluo Commerce Guild had managed to obtain a Seven-Colored Stag's Inner Core, and even someone like Yang Kai could not help but be shocked.

As Ai Ou spoke, he had already taken from his spatial ring a plump, round Inner Core that shimmered with seven-colored light.

"So it really is a Seven-Colored Stag's Inner Core!" Zong Ao whispered, a trace of frenzy in his eyes as he stared fixedly ahead.

For any alchemist, such material was enough to pique their interest. Every alchemist wanted to use rare materials to refine Pills, watching the various components condense and fuse under their hands. To finally form a Pill was a source of deep satisfaction and joy for every alchemist.

"Unfortunately, this Inner Core must have been stored too long; much of its medicinal potency has dissipated." Zong Ao sighed again, and many alchemists nodded in agreement.

Although the Inner Core indeed bore seven-colored radiance, the glow was not bright; rather it felt dim, like a candle flickering in the wind that might extinguish at any moment.

"Yes. Moreover… only an Inner Core was found. The Seven-Colored Stag's musk gland was not recovered. If a musk gland had been added to the medicine, the effect would have been even better." Ai Ou sighed repeatedly.

Still, in any case, the materials were now assembled; they only had to wait for the Void King-Grade master Zuo De to arrive before opening the furnace to refine the Pill and treat Gu Bihu.

"Senior, did Master Zuo De say when he would arrive?" Yang Kai asked Ai Ou.

Ai Ou gave a bitter smile. "The news said he would arrive in Shuitian City within the next few days. Exactly when… I cannot be sure, but since so much time has already passed, it's not something to rush."

Though he said that, anyone could see the impatience in his eyes.

Consider that he was a proud Second Stage of the Void King Realm and the chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild—always the one others waited upon, never the one made to wait. Only a Void King-grade pillmaster could force Ai Ou to lower his head; no matter how anxious or chafed his heart, he could do nothing but hold himself in check and wait in silence.

“This grandmaster certainly knows how to put on airs,” Yang Kai said with a light chuckle.

At those words, Ai Ou couldn't help but cast Yang Kai a sidelong glance, wearing an expression that said, 'You read my mind.'

An inopportune voice suddenly piped up: "What do you mean by that, sir? Are you accusing Master Zuo De?"

"Hm? I don't." Yang Kai turned innocently toward the source of the voice.

There stood a hooked-nosed middle-aged man, dressed in the garb of an Origin-Grade alchemist attendant, looking at Yang Kai with displeasure. He snorted coldly: "Master Zuo De is a Void King-Grade alchemist; naturally his affairs are numerous and delays are to be expected. By speaking so, are you not being overly disrespectful to the master?"

Yang Kai frowned, knowing this alchemist must hold Zuo De in high regard and could not stand a single bad word about him.

After scrutinizing the insignia on his attendant's robe and confirming he was an Origin-Grade, Middle-Level alchemist, Yang Kai couldn't be bothered to argue; he simply chuckled and said, "Ah, I misspoke."

Just as martial artists revered mightier experts, the situation was even more pronounced among alchemists: Origin-Grade alchemists already enjoyed lofty status, and Void King-Grade alchemists were in a class of their own—scattered across the Star Domain, there were very few.

Master Zuo De counted countless devotees, the hooked-nosed middle-aged man among them; he refused to tolerate any slight. "Though you are a Void King Realm expert, slandering Master Zuo De is a grave offense. This matter cannot be let go, for if it spreads it will harm the master's reputation—if so, can you bear the consequences?"

Caught under that heavy accusation, Yang Kai's face darkened at once. "And what do you want, then?"

"An apology! When Master Zuo De arrives here, personally go and offer him a formal apology!"

"Heh!" Yang Kai sneered. "What? Master Zuo De's reputation is a reputation—does that mean this master's isn't?"

Yang Kai prided himself on being a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, with status, standing, and strength; to be forced to apologize to an alchemist he'd never met over an offhand remark was something he would never do.

He suddenly found the hooked-nosed man rather ridiculous.

"You, a mere martial artist, how dare you compare yourself to the master!" The hooked-nosed man showed no fear of Yang Kai's Void King Realm status, looking at him with contempt.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. "This mere martial artist can effortlessly take your life!"

The hooked-nosed man's face changed; he quickly looked to Ai Ou and exclaimed in horror: "Chairman, this man is so arrogant and overbearing. Not only has he shown no respect for Master Zuo De, he even dared to threaten me—please, Chairman, uphold justice!"

Yang Kai said, "Chairman Ai Ou… is also but a mere martial artist!"

The hooked-nosed man's mouth fell open.

Ai Ou grinned broadly and looked up at the sky.

The hooked-nosed man's words displeased him; already vexed by Gu Bihu's injuries, he had no mind to entertain the request of this Origin-Grade, Middle-Level alchemist.

Moreover, Yang Kai's words resonated with him: that old Zuo De had always been full of airs, and over the years whenever they asked him to refine Pills the Commerce Guild had always bled massive amounts.

Sensing Ai Ou's thoughts, the hooked‑nosed man’s face went dark. He realized he had spoken carelessly—he had not only insulted Yang Kai but offended Ai Ou as well—and regret churned in his gut. Still he kept up a bluster and snapped, “So what if you could take my life? I bear you no grudges past or present; if you dare act, the whole world will hold you in contempt! Don’t forget, I am an alchemist—if you kill me, who will refine Pills for you from now on?”

“Sorry, I’m an alchemist too!” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"You?" the hooked-nosed man scoffed. "I don't deny your exceptional Martial Dao talent—you at your age even matched Chairman Ai Ou for a blow, falling only slightly short—but so what? You devote all your time and energy to the Martial Dao; how much attainment do you have in the Pill Dao? With my skill alone I could leave you eight streets behind!"

Though harsh, it was what many present were thinking.

Although everyone knew Yang Kai was an alchemist, no one believed his attainments in the Pill Dao were especially high. Even Zong Ao did not regard Yang Kai as a top-rank alchemist; after all, a person's energy was finite—having achieved so much in the Martial Dao was achievement enough to be proud of.

Yang Kai shook his head with an amused smile. "Fine, fine. I won't waste words with you—let it be so!"

He truly had no mood to bicker with such a person.

"Hmph, overestimating yourself!" Seeing Yang Kai back down, the hooked-nosed man only grew more arrogant, believing Yang Kai feared him because of his alchemist status, and said even more confidently: "We'll drop this matter between us, but your slander of Master Zuo De must be accounted for!"

Yang Kai's expression instantly chilled. "You're not finished yet? What explanation do you want—Is Zuo De your father or your grandfather? I only said he had airs, and you keep babbling on! Am I wrong? As far as I know, Chairman Ai Ou sent for him more than half a year ago, and he still hasn't shown up to this day—if that's not putting on airs, what is?"

Those words struck a chord in Ai Ou's heart.

Although he had privately been angry at Zuo De's delay, since they had need of him he could only seethe inwardly and dared not speak. Over so many days Ai Ou had cursed Zuo De's ancestors for eighteen generations in his heart.

Hearing Yang Kai voice it aloud, much of the pent-up resentment in his chest dissipated, and he found himself looking on Yang Kai with approbation.

"You dare to address the master by his given name!" the hooked-nosed man cried.

Yang Kai snorted with scorn, showing none of the deference due a Void King-Grade alchemist, and sneered, "He's just a Void King-Grade alchemist—what's wrong with calling him by name?"

"You— you— you…" The hooked-nosed man, seized with rage and trembling, pointed at Yang Kai and turned to Ai Ou: "Chairman, he is so flagrantly disrespectful to the master—will you not intervene? If Master Zuo De learns of this, he will surely be enraged!"

Ai Ou's expression stiffened; he looked at Yang Kai and, with some pleading, said, "Friend, let's not make this a big deal."

Xue Yue also stood nearby, looking at Yang Kai with supplication.

They all feared that if the matter reached Zuo De's ears, given that old man's temper he would certainly make an example of them. He might not storm off, but he would undoubtedly punish the Hengluo Commerce Guild severely.

Yang Kai nodded. "Since the elder has spoken, I will show respect. But if anyone else dares to carp, don't blame me for giving them a lesson."

"Of course," Ai Ou said lightly, nodding and giving Yang Kai a grateful look.

The hooked-nosed man's face turned as black as water, staring at Yang Kai with hatred, as if he wanted to say more. But seeing the ferocity in Yang Kai's eyes, he dared not be so brazen and could only say, "Just wait—when Master Zuo De arrives, you'll have your comeuppance!"

"Hm, I'll be waiting!" Yang Kai nodded.

The once harmonious atmosphere had grown tense and awkward after the hooked-nosed man's outburst.
