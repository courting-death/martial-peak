## Chapter 48 — Displaying Power

Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao each spoke in turn, revealing their purpose for coming here. Yang Kai was slightly taken aback—he had not expected these two to be so ruthless, that a mere dispute would escalate to the point of seeking to kill.

Just as he remained on guard, Hu Mei’er quietly whispered in Yang Kai’s ear, “Yang Kai, if you don’t want to die, you’d better listen to me. Nu Tao reached the fifth stage of the Open Origin Realm half a month ago. His strength is far beyond Cheng Shaofeng’s, and now there are two of them. You are absolutely no match.”

“Do you have a way to deal with him?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“I can’t handle him, but they definitely won’t dare kill me. As long as you meet my demands, I guarantee your safety.”

Hu Mei’er’s position here was clear. If she truly wanted to protect Yang Kai, Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao would have to show her some respect. At worst, they might just beat Yang Kai up a little to vent their anger.

“No need,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

“You’d rather die than comply?” Hu Mei’er looked at him as if he were a fool, her beautiful eyes full of disbelief.

“Sorry, I have a bit of a cleanliness obsession. Besides, who lives and who dies, you only find out after the fight,” Yang Kai said calmly, staring at the two men opposite him.

Receiving this answer, Hu Mei’er’s expression flickered uncertainly. After a long moment, she sneered coldly, baring her silver teeth and said with hatred, “If that’s the case, then watch yourself!”

With that, she stepped back several zhang, adopting an attitude of detached observation.

Cheng Shaofeng laughed loudly, “Sister Mei’er, you’re so obedient. I knew you wouldn’t make things difficult for me.”

Hu Mei’er forced a grim smile, her thoughts unknown.

Nu Tao chuckled strangely, eyeing Yang Kai up and down. Calmly folding his arms behind his back, he slowly shook his head, “You’re Yang Kai, right? When you reach the underworld, don’t blame me. Blame only yourself for meddling. Will you end it yourself, or shall I?”

His arrogance was boundless. Yang Kai smiled faintly, “If you want my life, come and take it by your own skill.”

As he spoke, he secretly activated the True Yang Technique.

But no sooner had the True Yang Technique begun than Yang Kai clearly felt a fierce heat surge through his chest, penetrating along his acupoints. This heat was mixed with immense Yang energy. His meridians burned with agony, and from his chest a thin wisp of blue smoke rose, his flesh scorched.

Yang Kai was shocked. Before he could react, the agonizing meridian pain began to subside as his body adapted. The massive Yang energy continued to flow into his meridians.

In the blink of an eye, his meridians were filled to bursting with True Yang Primordial Qi.

Tick… tick… as if from the depths of his soul, a drop of Yang liquid formed in his dantian.

Moments later, another faint tick echoed.

Within barely three breaths, two drops of Yang liquid had formed. Yet one of the drops mysteriously vanished immediately after forming.

Only then did the fierce Yang energy cease its movement.

Yang Flame Stone! Yang Kai suddenly realized. He pulled out the Yang Flame Stone from his chest—a stone he had purchased with a bottle of Minor Recovery Pills. But the stone, once brimming with Yang energy, was now completely drained, its energy utterly absorbed by him in such a short time.

The result was the formation of two drops of Yang liquid—though one had disappeared. Counting the drop originally in his dantian, two still remained.

This absorption speed… was astonishingly fast, almost force-fed. He barely had time to react.

Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao watched these changes in Yang Kai closely. The strange phenomenon at Yang Kai’s chest left them puzzled, but Nu Tao’s combat experience was rich. He waved his hand, “Junior Brother Cheng, attack with me. We must act quickly before things change.”

“Agreed.” Cheng Shaofeng, eager for Yang Kai’s death, no longer hesitated. Gripping his long sword, he charged forward with a fierce expression.

The two flanked Yang Kai, swift as a gale, and in the blink of an eye, they were before him.

Nu Tao’s strength was higher, so his movements were quicker. His fist surged with Primordial Qi as he struck fiercely at Yang Kai’s face.

At the fifth stage of the Open Origin Realm, a cultivator’s Primordial Qi was considerable, making their combat power formidable.

Nu Tao’s punch carried a howling wind, clearly using some martial technique.

Yang Kai did not dodge but met the punch with one of his own.

With a sharp clash, a sound of bones cracking came from Yang Kai’s wrist. His clenched fist felt as if cut by countless blades, instantly covered with dense wounds. His body involuntarily staggered back several steps.

Nu Tao howled in surprise, feeling as if his fist had struck a red-hot iron. His flesh burned painfully. “Such scorching Primordial Qi!”

At his Open Origin Realm fifth stage, he should have been able to withstand such an invasion of energy. This was truly strange.

After the exchange, both stepped back.

Cheng Shaofeng, sword in hand, surged forward with vengeful fury, aiming to slay Yang Kai on the spot.

Having taken Nu Tao’s punch, Yang Kai’s blood boiled anew. A warm sensation spread through his bones, as if endless strength surged forth. His eyes gradually reddened, his once gentle face turning fierce and mad.

As Cheng Shaofeng thrust his sword, Yang Kai reached out to grab.

Cheng Shaofeng sneered, “I learned my lesson last time from you. Do you think I’ll fall for the same trick again?”

As he spoke, his sword changed from a thrust to a sweeping slash, aiming to sever Yang Kai’s fingers. Yang Kai reacted swiftly, sensing the change, and shifted his fingers from grabbing to seizing.

With a “pfft,” the long sword still sliced into Yang Kai’s finger. At that moment, joy bloomed on Cheng Shaofeng’s face. Hu Mei’er covered her mouth, showing pity, but recalling Yang Kai’s treatment of her, she thought he deserved a thousand cuts.

“How is this possible?” Cheng Shaofeng shouted in shock. His sword was sharp, and a mere Body Tempering Realm warrior’s flesh was no match. Even an Open Origin Realm cultivator struck by this blow would hardly remain intact.

Yang Kai grinned fiercely, baring a mouthful of white teeth. Seeing his bloodshot eyes, Cheng Shaofeng panicked, retreating hastily while shouting, “Brother Nu, save me!”

Before the cry finished, Yang Kai lunged forward. A drop of Yang liquid in his dantian moved at his will, condensing at his fingertip.

With a single finger, he struck Cheng Shaofeng’s forehead.

Cheng Shaofeng’s mouth gaped open, his breath abruptly ceased. He fell backward. On his forehead was a hole the size of a chopstick, piercing through his entire skull. The hole was smooth and clean, without a drop of blood. His eyes were wide open, a look of unwilling death frozen on his face.

“Ah!” Two cries rang out simultaneously—those of Nu Tao and Hu Mei’er.
