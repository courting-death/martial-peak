## Chapter 1032 — The First Stop

Four streaks of azure light halted outside the Chaos Abyss. Gazing upon the familiar sight of the Star Domain, everyone except Yang Kai trembled with excitement. Shen Tu even threw back his head and let out a long roar, venting the exhilaration pent up deep within his heart.

After a long while, everyone's emotions slowly calmed.

“Where is this?” Bi Ya turned her head to look around. Though she knew they were on the outskirts of the Chaos Abyss, she couldn't pinpoint their precise location.

“I recognize this place. I was captured not far from here; this world is close to our Commerce Guild's main continent, Shuiyue Star. Hmm, by Star Shuttle it takes roughly a month to arrive,” Shen Tu explained.

“Shuiyue Star?” Yue Xi pondered. “If you say that, I can orient myself. The Sword Alliance's main continent, Sword Star, should be roughly in that direction.” She pointed to a spot in the starry sky.

“Shall we go to Shuiyue Star and stay there for a few days?” Shen Tu looked at the group and extended the invitation. After such an escape, everyone felt nearer to one another and had put aside prior grievances.

Yue Xi glanced at Yang Kai, as if inclined to accept, but her expression quickly turned bitter. She shook her head. “No. I lost a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level warship and hundreds of elite troops on this trip. I must return to the Sword Alliance and report this matter.”

Shen Tu looked at her with some sympathy. “If one day you can no longer stay in the Sword Alliance, you are welcome to join the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Though I lack the standing of my brothers within the guild, I can still recommend someone.”

Yang Kai's eyes flicked, and he immediately understood Yue Xi would likely be punished by the Sword Alliance for such a loss; after all, her losses were enormous and she had even lost a Star Emperor Token she had obtained.

“We will cross that bridge when we come to it…” Yue Xi forced a bitter smile.

She looked at Yang Kai again, her expression complicated; after a long moment her lips trembled. “Yang Kai, thank you. Thank you for getting the three of us out of that prison and for saving our lives in the spatial rift.”

She hesitated, then spoke softly: “Also… I am sorry.”

Saying this, she bowed deeply and offered a sincere apology for the past grievances between her and Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded calmly, accepting her apology.

“Gentlemen, the three of us will take our leave now.” Yue Xi said, turning and heading toward the direction of Sword Star.

“Take care, Yang Kai. I hope we meet again!” He Miao kept waving farewell to Yang Kai, reluctant to part.

“Take care.” He Zao nodded in acknowledgment.

“You too!” Yang Kai smiled and waved, watching their figures recede until they vanished into the vast Star Domain.

“If they aren't going, Brother Yang, surely you won't refuse?” Shen Tu looked at Yang Kai and asked.

“I don't mind. We've only just arrived in the Star Domain; I haven't decided where to go yet, and I have no place to settle. I'm fine escorting you back to Shuiyue Star.” Yang Kai grinned.

“I would be deeply grateful, Brother Yang. If I had to fly back to Shuiyue Star alone, I might perish en route,” Shen Tu rejoiced. “Then let's go.”

“Wait.” Yang Kai said, turning to Bi Ya. “You should go too.”

“Where would I go?” Bi Ya asked, astonished.

“I don't know. Go wherever you want, just don't stick by my side.”

Bi Ya's bright eyes widened with surprise and delight as she looked at Yang Kai. “You mean… I'm free?”

“I told you on that continent: once we leave, we part ways. I never intended to bind you.”

“Then why…” Bi Ya looked at Yang Kai in confusion. If he had always planned this, why had he taken the imprint on her soul and controlled her life and death?

“That was your punishment. You are different from others; we had many entanglements before. I could discard Lü Guichen and let him fend for himself, but if I brought you out, you had to pay a price—your soul's mark was that price,” Yang Kai said in a low voice. “I'll keep that mark to ensure you won't reveal my secrets or harbor hatred and oppose me. After decades or centuries, perhaps I'll return it to you.”

Bi Ya's heart ached; she looked at Yang Kai faintly and bit her red lips. “What if you accidentally die?”

“Pray then—pray I live forever and share the heavens' longevity!” Yang Kai said earnestly.

Bi Ya couldn't help but chuckle. “Your appetite is enormous… Fine, I'm just grateful to have gotten out alive, so keep the mark if you wish. But I have nowhere to go now; I dare not return to Purple Star—so many are missing, and if I return alone I'd surely be suspected. Shen Tu, Young Master, will you recommend me to your commerce guild? I'm not weak; I've reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and have lived on that continent long enough to be nurtured—I feel I'm on the verge of ascending to the Saint King Realm. With such cultivation I could at least help deliver supplies for you.”

Shen Tu thought for a moment and nodded. “If you truly reach the Saint King Realm… our guild would be happy to accept you.”

“That's wonderful. I'll go to Shuiyue Star with you; within a month I will surely ascend.” Bi Ya cheered, batting her eyelashes at Yang Kai. “You never appreciated your servant—don't regret it later.”

“Your guild would accept a woman like that?” Yang Kai stared at Shen Tu in disbelief.

“What's the problem?” Shen Tu asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai shook his head and said nothing more. Bi Ya's cultivation method clearly cultivated yang to complement yin—utterly corrupt. If she were on the Tongxuan Continent, she would be universally despised; she might be killed before she had a chance to mature.

The Tongxuan Continent had far too many self-styled righteous people and path-guardians.

They could not stand people like Bi Ya.

But seeing Shen Tu, he seemed completely indifferent to that and had the heart to recommend her into the guild.

The Star Domain truly differed from the Tongxuan Continent; they seemed unconcerned with whether someone was morally good or evil—strength alone mattered.

“Hey, what kind of woman am I?” Bi Ya immediately took offense. Once she confirmed Yang Kai would no longer command or restrain her, she relaxed completely and stopped holding back.

“Aren't you clear on what kind of woman you are?” Yang Kai shot her a sidelong glance.

“I'm simply promiscuous and free-spirited; aren't men the same? Why is it allowed for men but not for women?” Bi Ya complained indignantly.

“Enough, enough, let's go. I can't wait to rest when we reach Shuiyue Star.” Shen Tu interrupted their bickering, pointed Yang Kai in a direction, and Yang Kai immediately steered the Star Shuttle that way.

The journey was silent save for Bi Ya's uninhibited giggling—like a warbler released from its cage, she laughed coquettishly the whole way.

Yang Kai soon noticed that the Star Shuttle beneath her feet seemed to fly faster than his own.

This was not merely because Shen Tu accompanied her, but because her shuttle was of a higher grade.

Yang Kai quietly resolved that when they reached Shuiyue Star he would buy a higher-grade Star Shuttle; in the future he might spend a great deal of time traversing the starry sky, and a good shuttle would save him much time.

Shen Tu was well acquainted with the terrain around Shuiyue Star and guided the three of them to avoid many dangers along the way.

One day, a gigantic, colorful star suddenly appeared before them, radiating vigorous life and overflowing heaven-and-earth energy.

Standing on the shuttle, Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he realized this must be the commerce guild's main continent—Shuiyue Star, the place Shen Tu had mentioned.

The entire star was covered in a layer of clouds; from the Star Domain one could vaguely make out the continent plates and oceans, and dense clusters of buildings stood in different places, within which countless tiny dots moved.

Those were living beings!

Yang Kai's spirit soared; he knew that only now had he truly set foot in a genuine Star Domain.

He had left the Tongxuan Continent and wandered, searching deeply, yet had never truly seen the many wonders of the Star Domain or arrived at a planet teeming with cultivators.

Shuiyue Star was his first stop!

His heart swelled with excitement.

“Over there!” Shen Tu pointed to the left. “Let's go there—my manor is in that direction.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai altered course according to his guidance.

Before long, the three passed through the thick clouds and descended toward Shuiyue Star.

The star emitted an attraction that tugged the Star Shuttle downward, though it was not too fierce; Yang Kai could easily resist it with his own power.

Once they pierced the clouds, the world opened up and everything on Shuiyue Star flashed into view.

Yang Kai felt like a rustic newly arrived in a city—looking here and there, utterly fresh and fascinated.

Seeing his wonder, Bi Ya and Shen Tu exchanged glances and couldn't help but steal a laugh.

They all knew Yang Kai came from a low-tier continent and probably had never experienced such things before.

In the sky, streaks of azure light streamed by—cultivators riding Star Shuttles on their journeys.

Unlike the Tongxuan Continent, where only Yang Kai owned such a secret treasure, on Shuiyue Star this spectacle was commonplace.

Shen Tu continued to point the way; he had no intention of letting Yang Kai fall behind.

Along the route they passed many majestic cities where diverse living beings coexisted peacefully.

Yang Kai saw the Demon Race, saw yao who had taken on human form, saw the Horn Race from the Great Demon God’s memories, and saw countless other races whose names he did not even know…

They lived together in one place without much concept of racial divides.
