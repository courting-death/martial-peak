## Chapter 1027 — I Will Control Your Life and Death

At the flat area midway up the mountain, Yue Xi, He Zao, He Miao, Shen Tu and the others—already tense from the Ghost Ancestor's mad laughter—suddenly froze, their faces turning as pale as paper.

The Ghost Ancestor's voice rang in their ears.

"What is it?" Lü Guichen asked anxiously.

"The Ghost Ancestor is summoning…" Yue Xi swallowed hard.

Lü Guichen stilled, his gaze toward Yue Xi changing; there was a trace of schadenfreude, a touch of bittersweet relief, and some hidden gladness. He fell silent.

"I've been summoned too!" Shen Tu's face went ashen, a deep sense of powerlessness welling up within him.

"Me… too!" Bi Ya twisted her hands together, her delicate body trembling.

"Master, what should we do?" He Zao looked at Yue Xi anxiously.

Yue Xi's heart was thrown into turmoil; she didn't know what to do for a moment. From past lessons—those who had once been summoned by the Ghost Ancestor had mostly died—only a little over a hundred survived because of him. Today the Ghost Ancestor had summoned so many all at once; heaven only knew what he intended.

"This may be a blessing rather than a curse…" Yue Xi forced a bitter smile and gave up thoughts of escape; before Void King Realm experts she had no way out. "Come with me. If… if today truly becomes your end, then stay by your master's side."

She looked at He Zao and He Miao with tenderness and silently resolved to protect her two disciples with her life.

Even if it meant futile resistance.

The three of them led the way into the mountain's depths. Shen Tu and Bi Ya exchanged a glance and could only follow helplessly.

Watching their departing backs, a Purple Star warrior approached Lü Guichen and said, "My Lord, them…"

"They will likely not return…" Lü Guichen sighed softly and forced a bitter smile. "I don't know whether to feel relieved or to mourn them, but at least we escaped this time. Next time, next time might…"

The three or four subordinates gathered around him all wore depressed expressions.

They all assumed those summoned this time were doomed.

Yang Kai waited in the mountain's passageway, and soon saw Shen Tu and the others arrive together. He gave a slight nod in greeting, then his face flickered with suspicion. "What's wrong with you? Why do you all look so glum?"

Shen Tu's mouth twitched; unwillingly he said, "We were summoned by the Ghost Ancestor."

Saying that, he patted Yang Kai's shoulder. In a low voice he said, "Brother, I'm likely doomed this time. If one day you manage to escape, tell the people of the Hengluo Commerce Guild that I let my father down. Had I known, I wouldn't have been so rebellious."

He looked as if delivering his dying words, solemn.

"Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Yue Xi looked him over thoughtfully, a flicker of puzzlement in her eyes.

"Remember to deliver the message. Of course, if you can't leave either, forget it." Shen Tu patted Yang Kai's shoulder; his tone was heavy, full of sighs.

Yang Kai's expression turned odd.

After thinking for a moment, he immediately understood why these people were all downcast and acting as if disaster loomed. He couldn't help but laugh in astonishment. "You think the Ghost Ancestor called you here to do what?"

"Don't know—whatever it is, it's not good." Shen Tu paused, then looked at Yang Kai in surprise. "Do you know something? Tell me, what is he going to do to us?"

Everyone turned their gaze to him.

"I was the one who asked the Ghost Ancestor to summon you here." Yang Kai said plainly.

Confusion spread across their faces.

"I'm taking you all away from here." Yang Kai continued.

Shen Tu was shaken to his core. Yue Xi, He Zao, He Miao, and Bi Ya all had strange lights bloom in their eyes as they looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

"I found a way out. I told the Ghost Ancestor, and he agreed to let you follow."

"No way… I didn't hear wrong? We can leave this place?" Shen Tu was stunned, babbling in astonishment.

He Zao and He Miao's faces brightened with excitement, gratitude filling their eyes. He Miao anxiously asked, "Yang Kai, is this true? You're not lying to us, are you?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

She suddenly leaped with joy, covering her mouth; a layer of tears glittered in her eyes. "That's wonderful, wonderful…"

She was so moved she wept uncontrollably. On one hand she had believed that being summoned by the Ghost Ancestor meant certain death; now things were not as she feared. On the other, learning she could escape this cage overwhelmed her.

He Zao threw an arm around her shoulder; the sisters exchanged a glance and burst into laughter.

Bi Ya seemed stunned by the news, standing dumbly and unable to react, staring at Yang Kai as if she could not fathom why he had suddenly changed his mind.

Just a short while ago Bi Ya had cornered Yang Kai and tried to pry things from him; then he had seemed perfunctory. Now he intended to take her along too—Bi Ya could not accept how real this felt; it was as if she were in a dream.

Among them, Yue Xi was the most puzzled.

She looked at Yang Kai, her expression complex and shifting; no one could tell what she was thinking.

She wanted to speak her thanks, but the words wouldn't come; her heart was in turmoil.

"Wait a moment. Bi Ya, you come with me." Yang Kai did not look at Yue Xi; he beckoned Bi Ya to follow and stepped aside.

"Oh." Bi Ya hurried to comply and trailed after Yang Kai.

When they stopped a short distance away, Yang Kai looked at her, frowning slightly and pondering for a moment before saying, "To be honest, I don't want to take you, nor do I care for you. Whether you live or die is none of my business."

Bi Ya gave a bitter smile. "I understand; after all, I have done many bad things to you before."

"There's a saying: it’s easier to change rivers and mountains than to change a person’s nature. You're a loose, treacherous woman; men are toys to you, the source of your strength. Now you beg me and act submissive; who knows if you'll revert once free and hold a grudge and come after me?"

"I won't. I won't do that." Bi Ya hastily waved her hand.

"I don't trust you!" Yang Kai shook his head.

Bi Ya's face drained of color; it seemed as if her hope of leaving was slipping away.

"But you've served well recently. Whether feigned or sincere, you've tended to me for so many days. Leaving you behind would make me seem too cold-blooded."

"What must I do to earn your trust?" Bi Ya caught his meaning; her eyes brightened and she pleaded, "Say it—I'll do whatever you say. I won't disappoint you!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Lower the defenses of your Sea of Consciousness. I want your soul imprint; I want to be able to control your life and death."

Bi Ya was stunned, a flicker of terror in her eyes, but after a moment's hesitation she nodded hard and willingly let down the defenses of her Sea of Consciousness.

In the next instant Yang Kai's Divine Sense pierced into Bi Ya's Sea of Consciousness, searching through it.

Before long Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense, having taken her spirit imprint.

Bi Ya's face went a little pale and her red lips trembled. "Is that enough?" she murmured.

Yang Kai looked at her with an odd expression and nodded. "Yes."

After a pause he asked, "How many men did you ruin?"

Bi Ya pursed her lips and gave a light laugh. "Are you peeking through people's memories?"

Yang Kai shrugged. "Inevitably."

In Bi Ya's Sea of Consciousness one lurid memory after another flashed by—Yang Kai, experienced though he was, felt a chill. This woman was a siren; any man she set her sights on could not escape—drained of Essence-Blood until death.

Yet those men died with expressions of bliss, utterly unaware of their fate.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a chill of fear. If things hadn’t taken such twists and turns back on the Purple Star warship, he might very well have met the same end—spending a night with her, only to die on her belly afterward.

“From now on, I’m yours,” Bi Ya murmured, lightly biting her soft red lips, every inch of her body exuding seductive ripples that stirred Yang Kai’s mind. “I’ll serve you with all my heart.”

"Spare me. I don't want to be entangled with you. Once we leave, we go our separate ways." Yang Kai snorted.

"You wouldn't really…" Bi Ya covered her mouth and appraised him up and down.

"Really what?"

"That area has problems, right?" Bi Ya voiced a thought she'd kept—her gaze flicked to Yang Kai's legs, pity in her eyes.

Yang Kai's face darkened. "If you keep spouting nonsense I'll leave you here!"

Saying that, he turned away and stopped paying attention to the madwoman; Bi Ya laughed loudly behind him, seeming not to heed his threat at all.

No sooner had Yang Kai returned to where everyone gathered than the Ghost Ancestor appeared leisurely.

Those whispering fell silent at once, daring not to speak.

"Everything taken care of?" the Ghost Ancestor asked Yang Kai.

"Yes."

"Then let's go!" the Ghost Ancestor laughed heartily.

"Wait a moment, I have something to say." Yang Kai's expression grew solemn as he looked at everyone. "You should know—I am taking you away by tearing space."

"Tearing space?" Yue Xi blurted, staring at Yang Kai in bewilderment. "You understand the mysteries of space too?"

Yang Kai nodded. "Somewhat."

Yue Xi's eyes brightened like a revelation as she looked at the Ghost Ancestor. "No wonder; no wonder the Ghost Ancestor came to an agreement with you—so that's why."

They had long wondered what the Ghost Ancestor saw in Yang Kai that made him shelter him, provide a favorable environment for cultivation, and treat him differently than others. Only now did it make sense.
