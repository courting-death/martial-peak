## Chapter 617 — I Can Help

Shui Ling had earlier revealed a fair amount of information to Yang Kai, and candidly admitted that, judged by Great Han standards of power ranking, the Water Divine Hall could only just be considered a First-rate force here, since it had a Saint Realm master stationed.

Her modesty led Yang Kai to mistakenly think the Water Divine Hall was nothing special.

But seeing the change in expression on the faces of these Duao Alliance people, Yang Kai suddenly felt that the force Shui Ling came from might actually be fairly impressive.

At the very least, those led by this woman grew solemn upon hearing the words Water Divine Hall; their hostility abated considerably, and a trace of apprehension surfaced in their eyes.

Hesitatingly glancing at Shui Ling, the woman and the others stepped back a few paces and began to whisper.

Yang Kai had no intention of prying into their whispers; he simply waited quietly, not caring what they were saying.

Shui Ling looked relaxed. Earlier she had not understood exactly what this place was and dared not reveal her identity, but upon hearing they were people of Duao Alliance she no longer had any scruples.

After all, the Water Divine Hall was not too far from Duao Alliance — a round trip took only half a month — and the two occasionally engaged in trade, so there was some acquaintance between them.

The Duao Alliance men whispered and, intentionally or not, sized up Yang Kai and Shui Ling, as if testing the truth of Shui Ling’s words.

After some time, the woman finally exhaled softly, then called out to Shui Ling, “Miss, you claim to be from the Water Divine Hall — do you have any proof?”

“Yes.” Shui Ling smiled, took out a deep-blue jade token and casually tossed it to her.

The woman caught it and examined it with intent; her face grew even more grave as she nodded, “This jade token indeed contains water power; it seems carved by someone proficient in water techniques. However, I’m sorry — we have never seen such a token before, so we cannot be certain you are a disciple of the Water Divine Hall.”

Saying this, she tossed the token back; though the hostility on her face had abated considerably, she remained somewhat on guard.

After a moment’s thought she said, “Here’s what we’ll do: if convenient, could you two stay at my Duao Alliance for a few days? If we can verify that you truly are disciples of the Water Divine Hall, today’s matter will be as if it never happened. If not… well, you know.”

Her words struck a balance of soft and hard, spoken neither humbly nor arrogantly, revealing her meticulous thinking and ability to adapt.

“Fine.” Shui Ling chuckled lightly and did not refuse.

Her identity was not false; once Duao Alliance investigated, they would inevitably discover the truth.

"Yang Kai, what do you think?" Shui Ling asked again, consulting him — Yang Kai was the sort to yield to softness rather than respond to force; if they were clearly planning to quietly detain the two of them and that set off Yang Kai's wicked streak, it could easily end in a fight.

Yang Kai shrugged. “Doesn’t matter — I don’t really have anywhere else to go.”

Shui Ling could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.

The woman nodded affably, “Please, you two go ahead!”

Saying that, she led the way with Yang Kai and Shui Ling following, and six or seven others of Divine Roaming Stage brought up the rear, forming a front-and-back encirclement.

Such conduct showed just how cautious they were.

As they walked through the marsh, the woman probed Shui Ling for information, sometimes deliberately and sometimes not; confident, Shui Ling naturally did not hide anything.

The more they talked, the more the woman felt Shui Ling did not seem to be lying.

“By the way, what is this Scarlet Blood True Orchid you mentioned?” Shui Ling asked offhand.

The woman gave a bitter smile and did not hold back, then recounted what had just happened.

After hearing it, Shui Ling turned to Yang Kai and stuck out her tongue.

Yang Kai bore an innocent expression; he had no idea others were in such a critical predicament.

“Once it fled, it won’t appear again for at least half a year; it may even leave this marsh entirely, so finding it again will be difficult,” the woman sighed.

“The Scarlet Blood True Orchid is important to you?”

“Not so much to us, but it is indispensable to the Young Master of Langya Fudi. We promised to hand the Scarlet Blood True Orchid over to Langya Fudi’s people in half a month. Now that the Spiritual Object is lost, we don’t know how to explain it.”

“The Young Master of Langya Fudi — Mu Hui? Is he injured?” Shui Ling cried in alarm.

“You know Young Master Mu?” the woman asked.

“Yes, I know him,” Shui Ling nodded.

The woman’s eyes flickered, then she suddenly smiled and her manner became much friendlier. “It seems you really are from the Water Divine Hall.”

“Of course. Our Water Divine Hall and Langya Fudi have some ties. If Mu Hui needs it, I can lend you assistance.”

“Hm?” the woman halted her steps, looking at her in puzzlement.

“The Scarlet Blood True Orchid slipped into the mire, didn’t it?”

“Correct.”

“Take me to the place it vanished; I’ll see if I can find it.”

The Duao Alliance group stared at Shui Ling in astonishment. After a while, the woman gave a wry laugh and shook her head, “Miss, we appreciate the offer, but beneath this marsh lies mud and water several thousand zhang deep; even those adept in water power cannot locate it. I know your Water Divine Hall cultivators mainly practice water methods and Martial Skill, but…”

“I am not merely skilled in water power.” Shui Ling smiled confidently.

She was, by nature, a Water Spirit Constitution — a special physique. Where water existed, she could unleash one hundred and twenty percent of her strength.

The woman hesitated for a moment, then suddenly nodded and turned to walk in another direction. “Then come with me.”

Given the situation, she decided to let Shui Ling try; failure would be acceptable, and if successful Duao Alliance could give Langya Fudi an answer in half a month.

Before long the group arrived at the spot where the Scarlet Blood True Orchid had fled. On that patch of marsh Yang Kai sensed the traces of formations and traps and realized they had not lied — they had indeed been capturing the orchid, but failed at the last moment.

“It’s right here.” the woman pointed to the marsh before them.

Yang Kai slightly relaxed his Divine Sense and probed the nearby underground, but found little.

“I’ll go down and take a look.” Shui Ling said, then in a flash dove into the mire and vanished from sight.

The woman and the Duao Alliance people glanced at Yang Kai but paid him no further attention, anxiously waiting.

After about the time it takes an incense stick to burn, bubbles suddenly rose in the marsh; everyone’s spirits were stirred and they watched in silent expectation.

Splash…

Shui Ling shot out of the marsh; her garments were not wet, yet her face was pale, her lips dark with cyan, and she trembled uncontrollably, looking severely chilled.

The Duao Alliance group hurriedly looked toward her.

Shui Ling shook her head.

Disappointment immediately showed on their faces.

“What did you do?” Yang Kai clicked his tongue in amazement; Shui Ling seemed as if she had just stepped out of an ancient everlasting glacier, the cold nearly overwhelming her — faint, visible wisps of chill rose from her delicate frame.

“I’ll explain later.” Shui Ling hastily circulated her cultivation to dispel the cold within her.

After some time Shui Ling recovered enough to take a gentle breath, rising to her feet. “Although I couldn’t bring it back, I found it.”

“You found it?” the woman’s lovely eyes brightened, surprise clear on her face.

“Yes, but by myself I cannot retrieve it.”

“Why?” the woman asked anxiously.

“Because beneath it lies a layer of Ice-Flame Star Sand.”

“Ice-Flame Star Sand?” the Duao Alliance group exclaimed, greed flashing across each of their faces.

“What is that?” Yang Kai watched their reactions and immediately understood the Ice-Flame Star Sand must be a highly valuable treasure.

“A Spirit-Grade Upper-Level refining material, of extreme cold — a treasure many Transcendent Realm experts covet; even Saint Realm masters will need it when forging certain Secret Treasures,” Shui Ling explained calmly.

The expressions of the Duao Alliance members grew animated.

“So it’s Ice-Flame Star Sand.” the woman nodded repeatedly, “I knew places where Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects are born would contain treasures, but I did not expect this.”

“The Ice-Flame Star Sand likely aided in the birth of the Scarlet Blood True Orchid,” Shui Ling smiled at the remark. “But the ice layer below is thick; I cannot break it.”

“I’ll help you!” A rotund man from Duao Alliance immediately stepped forward, approaching Shui Ling. He spread his hand and a blazing flame appeared, proudly declaring, “I cultivate fire power — it’s the natural counter to ice.”

Shui Ling shook her head. “You won’t do; your strength is too low.”

“I’m Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage!” the man bristled, not willing to accept the insult.

Shui Ling still shook her head. “I have an assistant; I don’t need you. Yang Kai, come down with me — that ice layer might only be breakable by you!”

The man shot a crooked look at Yang Kai, suddenly ashamed and furious, “So I’m no good, but he — a Divine Roaming Stage, Seventh Stage — is enough?”

“If I say he can, then he can. Do you still want the Scarlet Blood True Orchid? I’m helping you for free.”

The man was instantly silenced.

The woman hurriedly forced a smile and said, “Miss, don’t be angry. We will do as you wish.”

Although Ice-Flame Star Sand was valuable, Duao Alliance most needed the Scarlet Blood True Orchid now, and the woman naturally had no desire to offend Shui Ling.

Shui Ling nodded, took Yang Kai’s hand and dove back into the marsh.

After they disappeared, the bearded big man Ji Hong suddenly came to his senses, slapped his thigh and cried, “Damn — miss, could those two be seizing the chance to escape?”

At his words, the woman’s face went pale; she suddenly felt it was indeed possible.

There was no reason for them to help for nothing — faced with the temptation of a Spiritual Object and a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level material, those two might take both and never return.

“That can’t be.” the woman was dumbfounded as well.

“Then why did she insist only that man help her? This is clearly an opportunity to rendezvous, making it easier to take the treasures and leave,” someone said.

That argument made sense, and the Duao Alliance members were immediately roused to righteous anger, railing and cursing.

The woman’s expression grew darker and darker. She wanted to give chase to see what had really happened, but without a cultivator versed in water power to operate at the marsh’s bottom, pursuing would be exceedingly dangerous.

They spread their Divine Sense but could not detect any trace.

The woman’s heart chilled all at once.
