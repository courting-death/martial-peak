## Chapter 1607 — Not Quite Enough

In that collapsing, chaotic space a flash of cold light suddenly appeared, as if it had originally been a sneak strike aimed at Yang Kai's back, but the disorder of the space distorted its precision, and before it could take effect the spatial rift swallowed almost all of its potency.

With a soft exclamation, a third figure emerged like a ghost, frowning as he leaped back, his face grave as he shook his head and sighed, "As I thought, he's hard to deal with!"

Yang Kai stood unmoving, like a boulder planted on the ground; he turned back with a cold gaze and some surprise, "Lie Feng! You're here too!"

He had not expected that the third person attempting to ambush him would be Lie Feng from the Mad Lion Domain.

The top new talents of the three yao domains had now gathered in one place!

Yang Kai could understand that Mi Tian and Xue Lian would ambush him — after all, he had had friction with both of them and they wouldn't give up easily — but Lie Feng's participation surprised him. When they had first entered the Blood Prison, that fellow Lie Feng had even invited him to act together; within only a few days, that same man had become one of the enemies attempting to stab him in the back.

On the Yao Hill, yao qi billowed; these three yao prodigies used the mountain's yao qi to perfectly conceal themselves. If Yang Kai hadn't been so keenly perceptive, Lie Feng might truly have succeeded in ambushing him.

"Lie Feng, we have no grudge against each other, do we?" Yang Kai asked coldly, watching him.

Lie Feng forced a laugh and answered in a low voice, "Of course not."

"Then why do this?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

"Brother Yang, forgive me." Lie Feng looked a little embarrassed; he cupped his hands slightly and said frankly, "To be honest, if it were up to me, I wouldn't want to be enemies with you, Brother Yang, but this concerns the Void Mind Crystal — I can't simply ignore it."

Yang Kai nodded. "Understood."

"Since Brother Yang understands, Lie Feng has nothing more to say. Every domain lord wants the Void Mind Crystal. It's only that no one could extract it — now that Brother Yang has achieved that, I cannot let you leave. But if you hand over the Void Mind Crystal, I think Xue Lian and Mi Tian would let you go in peace."

"Do you think I'll hand it over?" Yang Kai sneered lightly.

Lie Feng thought seriously for a moment, then said in a serious tone, "I doubt it. If the roles were reversed, I wouldn't either."

“Why waste words? Let’s join forces and kill him! No matter how strong he is, he’s still just one man. With the three of us together, what’s there to fear?” Xue Lian, ever the hothead, roared impatiently when he saw Yang Kai and Lie Feng still bickering. With a powerful stomp, he shot toward Yang Kai like a cannonball.

A terrifying aura burst forth from him, and suddenly the phantom of a huge Blood Jiao loomed behind his back.

Xue Lian clearly knew Yang Kai was powerful; he came at him ready to fight to the death!

Mi Tian made no idle moves either. The instant Xue Lian struck, he roared, and the strange flower above his head began spinning. Petal after petal shot out and vanished into the void.

Lie Feng's figure once more thinned like a wraith and then disappeared without a trace — no one knew where he had gone.

The three yao prodigies unleashed a ferocious, synchronized assault.

"Good! Since you three want to die, I'll oblige!" Yang Kai faced the three of them alone, unafraid. His expression twisted viciously and exultantly; suddenly five-colored radiance covered his whole body, and a hissing sound ran over him as tiny, nearly invisible Five Elements sword qi rose from every pore, razor sharp — providing him excellent defense and powerful lethality.

The Undying Five Elements Sword qi — it was both offense and defense!

His muscles bulged with explosive power. Yang Kai swung three heavy punches forward and met Xue Lian's mad onslaught.

The brutal energies the two released collided between them, spraying into the void with an enormous crash.

Yang Kai remained unmoved; Xue Lian's fierce body trembled three times and his arm suddenly weakened and drooped for an instant.

In a direct clash, he clearly was no match for Yang Kai!

Allowing no chance for Xue Lian to react, Yang Kai rubbed his hands together; amid flashing golden light a dozen golden blood threads rose up, twisting together into a gleaming spear that quivered and shot toward Xue Lian at tremendous speed.

Xue Lian's face changed drastically; horror flashed across his eyes.

In the instant they touched, he realized Yang Kai was stronger than when they had fought in the palace before.

Back then he could at least put up some fight — now he was completely suppressed, incapable of forming any thought of resistance; Yang Kai's assault had utterly shattered his confidence.

There were only two possible explanations: either Yang Kai hadn't used his full strength before, or Yang Kai had grown a great deal while in the Blood Prison.

Xue Lian's liver and gall split within him — he was furious and desperate.

Sensing the terrifying killing power within the golden spear, he did not dare delay; hurriedly he produced a defensive secret treasure in front of him, crossed his arms over his chest and, gritting his teeth, prepared to hard-clash with the attack.

Clang...

The sound of metal meeting metal exploded, echoing across the entire Yao Hill.

The defensive secret treasure Xue Lian had hurriedly produced did not hold; the golden spear pierced straight through it and continued on toward him.

The blood-colored scale armor over Xue Lian's arms was torn open, leaving a great hole down to the bone; blood instantly gushed, and under the tremendous force his body was flung outward, flying straight into a nearby cave.

A ruckus rang out from deep in the cave for a long time; no one knew where Xue Lian had been thrown or how badly he was hurt.

Yang Kai did not pause; he suddenly spun and slashed his hand through the void behind him, forming a huge crescent-shaped spatial rift that voraciously surged in that direction.

Lie Feng emitted a strange cry as his figure staggered and retreated, watching the crescent rift with an extremely grave expression; he dared not attack it head-on and could only evade.

He was forced out before he could even launch an attack.

Petal after petal appeared around Yang Kai, spinning like razor blades and closing in from all sides; a sweet scent wafted from them that seemed to affect the mind.

It was precisely when Yang Kai had just driven back Lie Feng and paused that Mi Tian's timing proved excellent.

In an instant the countless petals wrapped around where Yang Kai stood, abruptly coalescing into a bizarre flower, re-forming before everyone's eyes.

And Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen! It seemed the flower had swallowed him.

Mi Tian frowned tightly and scanned the surroundings nervously.

He could detect that his attack had had no effect — Yang Kai had escaped at the crucial moment.

“You three think you can kill me? You’re not quite enough.” A mocking voice came from the side. Mi Tian's eyes narrowed as he looked over and found Yang Kai standing in the air, not a hair out of place.

His expression darkened at once.

Lie Feng silently appeared beside Mi Tian, his face cold and saying nothing.

The three yao prodigies fighting together, whether or not they could match a Void King Realm expert, were at the very least invincible at the Origin Returning Realm level.

They were not ordinary Origin Returning Realm fighters — they were peak masters from Di Chen Star!

Yet the outcome of the battle sent a chill through them.

Yang Kai effortlessly dispersed their assaults one by one; Xue Lian had been driven into that cave and there was no movement, whether dead or alive no one knew, and the remaining two were thoroughly suppressed.

"Is this fellow even human?" Lie Feng's eye twitched; he regretted wading into this mess.

He knew Yang Kai was formidable — otherwise the palace fight wouldn't have taught Xue Lian such a lesson — which was why, when they first entered the Blood Prison, he had invited Yang Kai to act together.

But after learning about the Void Mind Crystal from Mi Tian and Xue Lian, he could not sit idly by.

The Void Mind Crystal was too precious; precious enough that he was willing to risk it all for a chance.

He had assumed that with Xue Lian and Mi Tian teaming up, Yang Kai would be outnumbered, but judging from these few moments of combat, the situation was bleak!

This man was absurdly defiant of heaven! To be able to do this at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — such a feat was unprecedented in history!

“Lie Feng, don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts. You should know there’s no such thing as a regret pill in this world. Today, either he dies—or we do!” Mi Tian shot him a dark, venomous glare, clearly dead set on killing Yang Kai.

Lie Feng slowly shook his head. "Once an arrow is loosed there is no turning back — I know that. Yes, wait for Xue Lian to come out; only with the three of us together will we have any chance."

Mi Tian did not argue; he had already set aside his pride when facing Yang Kai.

The two stood shoulder to shoulder, their gazes flitting between Yang Kai and the cave, anxious and desperate.

Xue Lian still showed no sign of movement; it seemed Yang Kai had truly struck him down with one blow.

But that was impossible — no matter how strong Yang Kai was, Xue Lian had manifested the Jiao Transformation and his defenses were as solid as metal; there was no way such an attack could have killed him.

Mi Tian and Lie Feng could not understand what Xue Lian was up to; in their hearts they cursed him out for dropping the ball at such a critical moment.

At that moment a brutally fierce roar suddenly thundered from the cave, rolling and roaring like thunder, deafening to the ears.

"It's Xue Lian!" Mi Tian's brow knit as his expression shifted; he did not know what mad scheme Xue Lian had launched — if he felt resentful, he could have burst out and fought Yang Kai to the death; why this frantic bellow?

"Something's wrong!" Lie Feng suddenly felt a chill of unease; an inexplicable sense of danger spread from his heart, as if if he did not retreat immediately he would soon face mortal peril.

The sensation made him thoroughly uncomfortable.

Like Mi Tian and Lie Feng, Yang Kai also glanced toward the cave with a grave expression, faintly sensing something amiss.

But more than that, he felt curiosity; he did not know what Xue Lian was playing at — or whether he was about to unleash some earth-shattering secret technique.
