## Chapter 1984 — Sending You a Great Providence

When Luanfeng appeared, Yang Kai was in Yuqing Mountain.

It could be said that among the martial artists who had observed Luanfeng up close, only Yang Kai had survived; the others had all perished.

He had no interest in Kang Siran's proposal.

So he courteously declined Kang Siran's invitation. Kang the shopkeeper felt a little regret but said nothing more — after all, not everyone wishes to put on a show before a Star Envoy hoping for patronage; each has their own path, and you can't force it.

Kang Siran rather admired Yang Kai's free-spirited nature, so after advising him to rest for a few days, he departed.

Yang Kai packed up briefly, left the Spiritual Pill shop, and returned to the cave dwelling he rented in Fenglin City.

The next day, a magnificent, enormous, lavishly decorated tower-ship rose from the city lord's mansion and flew straight for Yuqing Mountain; on the deck there gleamed an emblem of entwined stars and moon.

It was the emblem of the Star God Palace, the Southern Territory's hegemon.

The entire Fenglin City was stirred.

At that moment Yang Kai had hired a White Jade Dragon Horse carriage and instructed the coachman to go to a street in the west of the city.

Even though Fenglin City was not famous in the Southern Territory, its grounds were vast. Flight was prohibited within the city, and the use of flying secret treasures was forbidden, so martial artists who wanted to save time had to rent these White Jade Dragon Horse carriages. The White Jade Dragon Horse was said to possess the bloodline of an ancient Sacred Dragon, though that bloodline was exceedingly thin; it was gentle, easy to tame, and looked impressive—ideal for pulling a cart.

In less than half an hour they arrived.

Yang Kai paid the fare, climbed down from the carriage and slipped into a secluded corner. From his Spatial Ring he took out a set of clothes he'd prepared in advance, changed, pulled his hood up to hide his face, and then strode straight toward the bustling street ahead.

This was Fenglin City's black market.

Although he had not been in Fenglin City long, he had already scoped out the existence of the black market.

The so‑called black market was a place that could not exist openly by law but was tacitly permitted by the city lord's mansion as a single street. Here one found countless spoils taken after fights and raids—many items that could not be sold openly had a good outlet here.

There were also many items of unclear provenance that could be put up for sale.

Martial artists entering and leaving the black market all observed a rule: do not ask about an item's origin, do not ask the seller's name or background. When the silver and goods had exchanged hands, the matter was closed.

Places like this were precisely where one could pick up fine things, so the black market was hunted after and welcomed by Fenglin City's martial artists and was crowded every day.

But because of that special rule, there were also speculators who sold fakes and inferior goods as fine merchandise; that tested a buyer's eye and discernment. If one was cheated out of greed, that was one's own fault and no one else's to blame.

Yang Kai had worried his disguise might draw attention—after all, his outfit looked guilty and hardly like that of an honest man.

Yet once he entered the black market street, he found his worry unnecessary.

There were plenty of warriors dressed similarly; they were everywhere, which put him immediately at ease.

No sooner had he stepped onto the street than a shifty, rat‑eyed old man sidled up to him, looking secretive. He tugged Yang Kai's sleeve and, eyes darting, motioned for him to step aside.

"Say it straight," Yang Kai said coldly.

"Brother, I have good news to tell you, but it's not the sort of thing to say openly here—careful, there may be ears on the wall," the old man murmured, glancing left and right like a mouse stealing oil.

"Then don't say it," Yang Kai replied; he knew all kinds of people gathered in such places and had no patience to waste on a stranger.

With that he stepped forward.

"Hey, Young Brother, don't go!" the old man hurried after him, blocking his path and gritting his teeth. "All right, Young Brother looks busy, so I won't waste your time—just look at this!"

Saying that, he took from his chest a crumpled, timeworn strip of beast-hide paper. It was unclear what demonic beast's hide had been used, but the hide paper still gave off a not‑insignificant energy fluctuation. Across it ran complex lines, crisscrossing in a way that looked profoundly arcane.

The old man only flashed the beast-hide paper briefly before tucking it away again, then he heaved a dramatic sigh. "I won't hide it from you, Young Brother. This treasure map is an heirloom passed down from my ancestor, who once followed the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. This map points to the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor's treasure trove. I am weak and unable to seek it out; when I saw you I felt a kinship. I'll sell this treasure map to you for a bargain—what do you say?"

"The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Exactly!"

"The one who possessed the Heaven Devouring Battle Art?"

"Who else could it be?" the old man cried, eyes bright with excitement. "So you know about the Heaven Devouring Battle Art—that's a forbidden top‑tier technique that heaven and earth do not tolerate. Don't be fooled; that art very well could be hidden at that treasure site. If you obtain that art, becoming one of the Ten Great Emperors would be but a matter of time."

"Heh, I already know the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, so I'm not interested in your map—go find someone else," Yang Kai said.

"Five thousand Source Crystals and it's yours—top‑tier luck! Young Brother, won't you consider it?" the old man called after him.

Yang Kai paid him no heed.

The old man instantly grew indignant. "Brat—if you don't buy it, don't buy it—but to shamelessly claim you know the Heaven Devouring Battle Art—do you take me for a fool?"

Then he muttered to himself, worrying that his trick had become too easy to see through and considering whether to change tactics.

He had been fretting for months with no one taking the bait and his pockets empty, when a martial artist walked by—a girl who appeared about seventeen or eighteen. She was pleasant to look at and had an excellent figure; only a large crescent‑shaped birthmark on half her face marred her beauty, which was a pity.

The girl skipped along like a joyful little sprite, all innocence.

Seeing her, the old man immediately greeted her, wearing a profoundly amiable smile.

"You... what are you doing?" The girl cried out in alarm, stepping back several paces and watching the old man with a wary, guarded gaze.

"Fear not, miss! I bear no ill will!" the old man smiled all the more ingratiatingly.

The girl scanned him up and down, her clear eyes carrying a trace of instinctive caution.

The old man chuckled and feigned profundity: "Fate has brought us together here; I wish to give you a grand providence!"

At that, the girl's eyes brightened and she asked excitedly, "A grand providence? What grand providence? Tell me, tell me!"

Her heart leapt. Secretly she thought that the tales Aunt Feng had told her in childhood were not lies—there really were such opportunities in the world. In those stories, ordinary martial artists had, through mysterious elders' instruction and gifts, soared to the heavens and achieved unparalleled success, adored by millions.

She had delighted in those stories as a child, but after traveling for more than half a year she had seen no sign of them and had thought Aunt Feng had only been teasing her. Now a mysterious elder was offering her a grand providence—how could she contain her excitement?

In an instant, the scheming old man became an extraordinary recluse in her eyes, the sort of mighty master who came into the world only to choose a worthy successor.

She was certain she must be that one in a million genius chosen by such a master.

As for his casual, even somewhat slovenly dress—was that not the proper attire for a secluded master?

The old man bared a mouth of yellowed teeth and smiled inscrutably, then reached into his bosom and produced the crumpled beast‑hide paper...

...

"Granny, is there a shop here that buys Spiritual Pills?" Yang Kai asked, standing at the stall and looking at the silver‑haired, tremulous old woman before him.

"Five hundred Source Crystals each, hand‑refined by me," the old woman replied with a broad smile, pointing to a heap of things whose purpose he could not tell.

Yang Kai frowned. "I'm asking if there is a shop that buys Spiritual Pills!"

"Oh—you're buying two? I'll give you a discount: two for nine hundred Source Crystals, non‑negotiable," the old woman waved her hand as if he were getting a great bargain.

"Don't play deaf and dumb with me—believe it or not, I'll overturn your stall!" Yang Kai glared viciously at the old crone, and at the right moment let a powerful fluctuation from his Third Stage of the Void King Realm ripple out.

The old woman's face changed; in an instant she dropped the act of infirmity and her eyes turned cold. "You little thing, you don't know to respect the old and cherish the young—truly impolite."

"A First Stage Void King pretending to be deaf here—are you kidding me?" Yang Kai sneered.

"Go on—don't block my trade," she said, pointing off in one direction; in the blink of an eye she reverted to the frail, wind‑blown appearance.

Following her gesture, Yang Kai soon arrived at the entrance of a shop.

The shop's attendant was a normal sort, unlike the old woman and the old man. After hearing Yang Kai's purpose, he courteously ushered him inside, arranged a private room, brewed tea, and asked him to wait a moment before retiring with respectful politeness.

Yang Kai did not hurry; he sipped the fragrant tea and waited quietly.
