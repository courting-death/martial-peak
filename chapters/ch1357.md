## Chapter 1357 — Jade Hand Reappears

Upon learning that Yang Kai and the other two had been sent by Fei Zhi Tu to help rescue him, Qian Tong’s face showed gratitude, and he voiced his thanks. The three Saint King Realm juniors, of course, hastily replied that they did not dare accept it. But when he later heard that, after passing through the black-and-white Spatial Array Gate, everyone had been scattered—and that the old woman had been slain beneath the puppet’s massive hand—Qian Tong’s expression turned somber, faint guilt flickering across his face.

In no time at all, Yang Kai explained the whole sequence of events. Qian Tong frowned and asked, “So then, you don’t know where Old Fei and the others are now?”

Yang Kai and the other two slowly shook their heads.

Qian Tong forced a smile. “It seems I’ve involved you all this time. There’s no way out of this place now; even if you try to retrace your steps, you’ll probably never find your way back.”

“Then what should we do?” Du Sisi asked anxiously.

“There are only two choices!” Qian Tong sighed leisurely.

“What choices?”

“Do you see the spatial formation over there?” Qian Tong pointed, and following his finger Yang Kai and the others saw that at the far end of the palace there was, unexpectedly, a complete Space Array.

“It should lead outside. If you’re confident you can shake off those puppets, you can try it, though I don’t recommend it. The other puppets are one thing, but that wolf-shaped puppet is incredibly fast; even I can’t promise I’d outpace it.”

The three had just fought a puppet not long before; who had the heart to tangle with such things again? Even if the puppets here were not as strong as that previous one, sheer numbers were a problem. Even Yang Kai felt his scalp prickle.

Besides, although the Space Array over there was intact, it would still take some time to activate. That delay alone would be enough for the puppets to launch an attack.

Under such circumstances, who would dare rash action?

“Other than that, we can only wait for Old Fei and the others to arrive and then figure something out together.” Qian Tong noticed the helplessness and despair on Cai He and Du Sisi’s faces and couldn’t help but comfort them. “Don’t worry. If it really comes to it, I’ll move to stall these brutes and buy you time to escape.”

“Absolutely not.” Cai He was horrified and hurried to say, “Elder Qian, you cannot do that. Yingyue Hall is torn by internal strife and needs your leadership. If you fall here because of us, we would be eternal sinners. We cannot shoulder such responsibility.”

Du Sisi nodded vigorously beside him.

Qian Tong chuckled and waved it off. “There’s no perfect solution. Don’t worry — I won’t do something so foolish unless there’s no other choice. I’d like to live a few more years myself.”

Hearing him say that, Cai He relaxed.

With no return route and their exit blocked, the three Saint King Realm cultivators could only sit cross-legged and meditate, occasionally chatting with Qian Tong to pass the time.

In idle conversation Yang Kai learned that the inscription on the stele contained a supremely subtle smithing technique; although none present could read the ancient script, an artificer standing nearby could comprehend it and greatly improve his forging skills.

The middle-aged man had already achieved some insight and was only a step away from personally forging an Origin-Grade secret treasure; once he could craft such an item he would become Yingyue Hall’s new generation Origin-Grade master artificer.

With such a man assisting them, and coupled with Qian Tong’s methods and prestige, calming the internal strife of Yingyue Hall and restoring peace would be easy.

Time passed quickly, but the anxious waiting ate at everyone’s hearts; not a trace of Fei Zhi Tu and the others had been seen for the following half month, and no one knew what had befallen them.

After half a month of recuperation, the hidden injuries Yang Kai and the others suffered in their battle with the puppets had all healed.

One day while Yang Kai was meditating he suddenly sensed a strange fluctuation of energy around him and opened his eyes, startled and alert.

At the same time Qian Tong also sensed it, and leisurely released his Divine Sense.

Cai He, Du Sisi, and the others showed no reaction.

A moment later they all wore expressions of terror — the palace they occupied shook violently, and dust and debris rained from the heavens as if the entire ancient ruin had become unstable.

“What is—” Qian Tong’s eyes went wide, as if he had realized something.

Yang Kai’s face also showed astonishment; he didn’t know what Qian Tong had discovered, but he could sense a heart‑seizing spatial power surging within the relic.

He had cultivated that power before and thus knew this kind of strange fluctuation intimately.

A thunderous roar echoed from all directions like mountains collapsing and earth splitting; Cai He, Du Sisi, Qian Tong, and the middle-aged artificer looked around in alarm.

At that moment the dozen or so puppets gathered around Qian Tong stirred. Red light ignited in each puppet’s eyes, and, as if fearful, they slowly retreated.

The anomaly came too fast. Before Yang Kai could probe further, a crushing repulsive force from the surrounding space wrapped their bodies, making breathing difficult.

Yang Kai felt not fear but elation, for he had encountered this very sensation once before.

The present situation was exactly the same as when Flowing Flame Sandland closed years ago!

Could it be——

Yang Kai’s thoughts raced. In that instant, the surrounding Spiritual Qi surged toward one point and, plainly visible, gathered into a mass. From that mass brilliant beams shot forth and rushed to the heads of the group, twisting and warping until they formed a gigantic palm.

Yang Kai’s brow rose and his face broke into wild joy.

The palm formed of Spiritual Qi was painfully familiar — it was the same delicate, feminine Jade Palm he had seen once within Flowing Flame Sandland.

Only this Delicate Jade Palm had been magnified countless times. Back then the palm had tried to hurl Yang Kai out of Flowing Flame Sandland but was stopped by a Star Emperor Token he had accidentally obtained, which caused him to remain in the Sandland for another half year after its closure.

With that prior experience, he remained calm.

The jade palm descended and gripped Yang Kai in its center, squeezing him fiercely.

Throughout the ordeal Yang Kai offered no resistance. Seeing Cai He and Du Sisi’s faces turn ashen as they raised their Saint Yuan to resist, he hurriedly warned them, “Don’t panic — we can leave.”

No sooner had he spoken than the palm shattered. Yang Kai felt a violent repulsive force of space, and in a flash his figure vanished from where he stood.

After Yang Kai’s warning, Cai He and Du Sisi hesitated for a split second; the two palms seized them as well, and when the palms shattered the pair disappeared.

The same scene happened to Qian Tong and the middle-aged artificer, and likewise to Fei Zhi Tu and the others in a different part of the ancient ruin — one by one they were swept away.

In the blink of an eye the entire ancient ruin held not a single living soul.

Ten thousand li or so from the Fallen Emperor Mountains, a lone figure materialized oddly; after a brief sway he steadied himself — Yang Kai, expelled by the relic’s spatial rule.

Almost simultaneously other figures appeared one after another.

After glancing around, Cai He cried out joyfully, “Senior Fei! Senior Ning!”

Fei Zhi Tu’s eyelids lifted and he showed delight. “You came out too?”

“Yes — we don’t know what happened; we were suddenly ejected from that ancient ruin and arrived here. Hey, where’s Senior Wen?” Cai He suddenly realized the Wen‑surnamed warrior was nowhere to be seen.

Fei Zhi Tu and Ning Xiangchen’s faces darkened and they both sighed heavily.

Seeing this, the others immediately understood that the warrior surnamed Wen had likely perished within the ancient ruin.

“My old friend…” Ning Xiangchen also found no trace of the old woman and was startled.

Cai He gave a bitter laugh. “That senior has also fallen.”

Ning Xiangchen was stunned, and after a long while could only laugh bitterly, “Such is fate, such is fate.”

In this expedition to the ancient relic two of the Origin‑Returning cultivators had died, while the four Saint King Realm disciples all escaped, including Lian Guang, who was unharmed though his spirit seemed wan.

“Old Qian, your life is really hard to snuff out—even after all that, you’re still not dead,” Fei Zhi Tu snorted as he looked at Qian Tong.

Qian Tong gave no reply, but his self‑reproach was plain to see; Fei Zhi Tu, noting this, ceased to chide him.

This escape had been inexplicably abrupt; Yang Kai and the others had remained within that palace without any action, so it must have been triggered by Fei Zhi Tu and the others disturbing some interdiction that caused the entire relic to eject them.

Although only Yang Kai had actually entered Flowing Flame Sandland, everyone had heard of its circumstances, including the Delicate Jade Palm that had arisen when the Sandland closed.

The recent scene matched the Flowing Flame Sandland’s closure exactly. Could there be some connection? Yang Kai frowned and pondered while the Origin‑Returning cultivators did likewise. Only Cai He and Du Sisi seemed ignorant of the particulars.

Just as Qian Tong opened his mouth to ask, a tremendous rumbling came from very far away.

Instantly everyone staggered and their faces changed; they stared in horror toward the source of the sound.

“Is that the Fallen Emperor Mountains?” Du Sisi cried.

It was indeed the Fallen Emperor Mountains; even from ten thousand li away their outline was faintly visible, and the roar was coming from within the range, as if a great calamity had just occurred there.

If something could make that kind of noise, then the upheaval there must be tremendous.

Could the calamity there be related to what just happened?
