## Chapter 315 — Cultivating Divine Sense

In the second floor of Fenghuan Tower.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the fragrant bed, his expression solemn, breathing evenly.

The True Yang Technique operated within him, refining and absorbing the Yang attribute spirit herbs and pills he had consumed.

These items taken from Shan Qingluo's treasury were of good quality; at the very least, they were upper-level Earth-Grade items, with most being Heaven-Grade.

Naturally, items stored by the Enchantress Queen were not subpar.

A faint whimpering sound emerged as the True Yang Technique operated, creating a series of rumbling sounds. The effects of the pills and herbs quickly transformed into pure True Yang Primordial Qi, filling his meridians.

On Hidden Cloud Peak in Yao Wang Valley, Xiao Fusheng had prepared a medicinal soup for Yang Kai, which, when used with a special cultivation method, allowed the effects of the medicine to be fully absorbed, developing the potential of his meridians.

Only at this moment did that medicinal soup truly realize its value, indeed demonstrating better capabilities in refining True Essence compared to before, making it more effective and convenient.

Furthermore, this effect would accompany him throughout his life; the more he cultivated, the more he would appreciate its benefits.

Yet, after circulating for more than a dozen cycles, the first drop of Yang Liquid had yet to form. Internally, the energy surged suddenly, sending a silent ripple expanding around him before soon dissipating unobtrusively.

He distinctly felt a surge in strength, his body and mind both feeling very pleasant.

Fifth Stage of the True Essence Realm!

Since stepping into the True Essence Realm, each breakthrough at each stage had become more challenging than before.

However, in recent days, Yang Kai had consistently taken a small cup of Wan Yao Ling Ye daily to improve his physique, cleansing his meridians and nourishing his marrow.

Having adhered to this regimen for such a long time, both his flesh and meridians had significantly improved, allowing him to break through in the True Essence Realm just as easily as before.

It had been over a month since he was stuck at the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm; thus, this breakthrough was indeed expected.

The hot True Yang Primordial Qi erupted from his body like tongues of flame, raising the temperature of the entire room.

Holding his breath and focusing, he gathered his True Essence, and those fiery tongues of Primordial Qi disappeared back into Yang Kai's body, vanishing from sight.

He felt a warm and comfortable sensation wash over him.

The True Yang Technique's extreme yang nature filled Yang Kai, who was cultivating it, with a magnificent aura of masculinity.

His meridians were swollen, unable to accept more pure, explosive True Essence.

With a tick, a new drop of Yang Liquid formed, settling deep inside his Dantian.

The swollen meridians suddenly felt uncomfortable, empty.

Yet, the effects of the consumed herbs and pills quickly produced new True Essence, filling the emptiness in his meridians.

The soothing sound of dripping water was exceedingly pleasing, resonating directly within his heart.

After all the medicinal effects had been absorbed, several new drops of Yang Liquid accumulated in his Dantian.

Releasing a light breath and feeling the fullness within his Dantian, Yang Kai smiled with satisfaction.

Although the amount of Yang Liquid he possessed was not large, the quality could not be compared to before, so even if it was a bit less in quantity, it could sustain consumption for a long time.

Without slackening, Yang Kai continued to focus with closed eyes.

With the Yang Liquid replenished, it was now time to nourish his Divine Sense.

The Soul Pursuit Seal implanted within Yang Kai by Shan Qingluo was likely a type of soul technique.

Thus, as long as his Divine Sense was strong enough, he could shatter it.

To strengthen his Divine Sense, he could either consume some heaven-and-earth treasures or cultivate a soul technique.

Currently, Yang Kai had only cultivated a single soul technique, the Soul Palace! However, this soul technique was not only defensive but also had strict requirements for the cultivation environment.

No need to consider that for the time being.

How could he rapidly enhance his Divine Sense enough to break the Enchantress Queen's Soul Pursuit Seal?

Yang Kai furrowed his brows, deep in thought.

As he pondered, a sudden inspiration struck him.

He recalled that on two previous occasions, his Divine Sense had rapidly strengthened, both times occurring after venturing into perilous places; his Divine Sense had grown powerful through the cycles of depletion and replenishment.

Once was in the misty and treacherous Baiwu Forest, known for being the source of the Soul Cleansing Dew.

The second time was in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, where the malevolent aura below assaulted the soul, dealing damage to the Divine Sense.

In the cycles of depletion and replenishment, his Divine Sense experienced a rapid enhancement that no soul technique cultivating or heaven-and-earth treasures could compare to.

Any other person would not dare to cultivate Divine Sense in such a manner.

The depletion of Divine Sense power was too severe; a few times might not cause issues, but too many could lead to permanent injuries that one could never recover from.

Yet Yang Kai was different. He possessed the Warm Spirit Lotus, a supreme treasure for nurturing Divine Sense, so he need not worry about lasting damage.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai contemplated for a long moment before deciding to take the plunge.

Replenishing his Divine Sense power would be easy; the herbs and pills he retrieved from Shan Qingluo's treasury, along with Wan Yao Ling Milk, could both replenish his Divine Sense.

Depleting his Divine Sense power was also simple; he still had a True Alchemy Formula in his mind.

Last time he had probed for a long time and had only managed to discover a spirit formation used as an aid in alchemy, exhausting himself greatly in the process.

As long as he used his Divine Sense to explore the True Alchemy Formula, he could quickly consume its power.

With that thought, Yang Kai hesitated no longer and immersed himself, probing the alchemical formula in his mind.

This True Alchemy Formula was profound and intricate; to thoroughly comprehend it, one must persevere, spending endless time and Divine Sense power to achieve this.

Yang Kai's intent was not particularly focused on the True Alchemy Formula, so he didn’t pay it much mind.

After a moment, a sharp pain surged in his mind, leaving him inexplicably exhausted, his complexion suddenly paling dramatically.

His Divine Sense power had been entirely depleted!

A cool sensation spread through his mind; that was the Warm Spirit Lotus repairing his damaged Divine Sense.

Before long, the pain dissipated, and the damaged areas had been completely mended. However, the consumed Divine Sense power had not been restored.

Having had the experience in Wan Yao Pool, Yang Kai knew that the recovery of Divine Sense was extremely slow; even with the help of the Warm Spirit Lotus, it would take at least four to five hours to recover fully.

Because the recovery of Divine Sense power was not as effortless as that of a martial artist's True Essence, cultivating Divine Sense was exceptionally challenging.

Weak and powerless, he took out a bottle of spirit-nourishing pills and poured one out to consume, pairing it with a little Wan Yao Ling Milk to absorb its effects.

After a while, Yang Kai's Divine Sense power surged once again, and he felt revitalized.

He once again delved deeper into the True Alchemy Formula, probing its mysteries.

Time flowed by; he did not know how long had passed.

Yang Kai continued this cycle of damage and replenishment involving his Divine Sense.

With each cycle, his Divine Sense power did indeed enhance a bit; although the increase was minor, it accumulated over time, creating remarkably fulfilling effects.

Moreover, the secrets he gleaned from the True Alchemy Formula piqued Yang Kai's interest.

Last time he had labored extensively and had only managed to uncover a spirit formation used as an aid in alchemy. That formation had the potential to enhance the quality of alchemical products.

For instance, with a furnace of upper-level Heaven-Grade materials, using this formation could potentially yield a Mystery-Grade pill.

Of course, that was merely a possibility; the effectiveness wasn’t guaranteed, and the higher the grade of the pills being refined, the less effective this formation would be.

As he delved deeper into the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai discovered a wealth of various spirit formations.

At the very least, he had grasped several, which included enhancing the quality of the pills, increasing the chances of producing Pill Patterns, and improving the success rate of alchemy, comprehensively offering various benefits.

And these were merely the entry-level concepts of the True Alchemy Formula.

It was hard to imagine what secrets the later chapters might hold.

In addition to the formations, there were also several exceptional alchemical techniques and the subtleties of selecting materials, among others.

All this information Yang Kai had engraved in his mind, planning to pass it on to Xia Ningshang and Xiao Fusheng if he had the opportunity in the future.

In just two days, the herbs and pills Yang Kai had looted from Shan Qingluo's treasury had been completely consumed. Things nourishing the soul were already scarce, so they could hardly withstand Yang Kai’s wanton consumption.

Other Divine Roaming Realm experts might carry one or two bottles of such pills as precautions, but who would continuously consume them?

Without these pills and herbs, relying solely on Wan Yao Ling Milk would not replenish his Divine Sense power rapidly.

Although Wan Yao Ling Milk was somewhat effective, its effects were too broad and not specifically aimed at the Divine Sense. While one or two doses were strikingly effective, the results would lessen with repeated use. Its main effect was catalyzing, rapidly releasing the medicinal effects of pills and enhancing their efficacy.

Without pills that nourished the soul, cultivating would yield half the result with double the effort, making it difficult to muster enthusiasm.

"Come here." Yang Kai thought for a moment before frowning and calling out.

He could sense that during these few days of cultivating, there were still three life auras in Fenghuan Tower—specifically, the beautiful woman Yunli and the two maids Ruoyu and Ruoqing.

Yang Kai resided in a guest room inside while there was also a side room outside, where the three of them lived. Someone was always there waiting for his summons.

As soon as he called out, hurried footsteps echoed, and soon the lovely woman Yunli along with Ruoyu and Ruoqing came over.

"Young Master, do you have any commands?" the lovely woman Yunli asked with a soft smile at Yang Kai.

"Where is Bilo?"

"Miss Bilo should be cultivating in her own quarters at this time," Yunli responded.

"Go and summon her over."

"Understood!" Yunli replied sweetly, turning to say to Ruoyu and Ruoqing, “You two go bring Miss Bilo over.”

The two maids nodded and turned to leave.

Yunli, on the other hand, for some unknown reason, lingered. With her watery peach blossom eyes, she glanced at Yang Kai and softly said, "Young Master, you look quite exhausted; have you not rested well these past few days?"

"Not quite," Yang Kai gently shook his head, "I was simply cultivating."

The lovely woman smiled playfully, unexpectedly twisting her curvy hips as she gracefully approached, exuding a mature and elegant charm. Without any hesitation, she ascended the fragrant bed and knelt behind Yang Kai.

She extended her delicate hands, gently massaging Yang Kai’s head.

"While pursuing power, you must also take good care of your body. If you appear this exhausted while the adults see you, they would surely think I have not adequately served you, and I would be punished," the lovely woman murmured sweetly, her hands rhythmically kneading, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes heavy, and sometimes light.
