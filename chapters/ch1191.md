## Chapter 1191 — Joining Hands to Break the Seal

“Indeed, Young Master Qu, more and more people are arriving here; if we wait any longer, who knows what troubles will arise. The Literature Hall—” someone immediately agreed, and the leaders of the seven or eight teams gathered here quickly voiced their support, asking Qu Changfeng to present a plan.

Qu Changfeng himself seemed to relish being lauded; upon hearing this his sinister expression finally softened, and after frowning in thought for a moment he said, “Of course something must be done. If everyone works together to break this sealing, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water will naturally fall into our hands.”

“That is exactly our intention. Just now one of my Junior Brothers tested the sealing’s might and found that although it has existed for many years it is exceptionally firm; it’s not something two or three people can crack. Only if everyone acts together will there be a chance!” a beaming beauty nodded.

“Then what are we waiting for? Young Master Qu commands—everyone strike together. I refuse to believe that with so many present no one can break this dead seal,” a burly man with a full beard shouted, and without further ado he produced a hammer Secret Treasure, gripping it with both hands as if poised to be the first to leap forward when Qu Changfeng gave the order.

Qu Changfeng smiled faintly, giving off a spring-breeze charm; he had finally resumed his former gallant bearing and spoke coolly, “Breaking this sealing is no problem, and acquiring the Soul Cleansing Divine Water is only a matter of time, but before that, I think we should discuss how to divide the spoils.”

At this suggestion many secretly frowned.

The sealing hadn’t even been broken yet and Qu Changfeng was already talking about dividing the gains—there could be no good intent in that.

Yet they could not stop him; should they anger Qu Changfeng and incur his wrath, the consequences would be unbearable. The Battle Sky Alliance’s habit of settling scores afterward was not unheard of. Many who had offended them before had suffered terrible ends.

“Then… Young Master Qu, how do you propose dividing the Soul Cleansing Divine Water?” the beauty who had spoken earlier asked with a coy smile, her eyes glancing about in a manner that stirred the crowd.

She didn’t intend to seduce Qu Changfeng—she knew her own talent could not charm the genius of the Battle Sky Alliance—but she hoped that by flattering him he would award her faction a slightly larger share.

Qu Changfeng paid her charms no heed; his mind was already calculating. He swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “There are eight forces present. I propose we divide this pool of Divine Water into four portions.”

“Four portions?” the beauty’s brow knit slightly; forcing a smile she asked, “If divided into four, how will they be allocated?”

Qu Changfeng replied arrogantly, “My Battle Sky Alliance will not take much—just one of those portions!”

At this all exhaled inwardly, surprised at Qu Changfeng’s apparent generosity. In their minds he might have demanded half, yet he only asked for a quarter.

That was impossible to refuse! Who would be foolish enough to decline?

Heads nodded vigorously; no one objected, all wearing expressions as if they had just secured a tremendous bargain.

Seeing everyone accept his proposal, Qu Changfeng was quite pleased, smiling the more affably.

“Then, Young Master Qu, how will the remaining three portions be distributed? Please state it now so that once the sealing is broken there will be no disorder. We all make our living on Dark Star; we see each other day after day—there’s no need to become bloodied over this,” another man spoke up; his force had the fewest people present—only three—so he knew better than most that letting Qu Changfeng decide was the wisest course, lest their meager share be further reduced amid a scramble.

As soon as he finished, many glared at him angrily.

Qu Changfeng nodded without ceremony. “A fair point. If no one objects, I will handle the allocation of the remaining three portions.”

Though some were displeased, who would be stupid enough to openly challenge Qu Changfeng’s authority at that moment?

They could only grit their teeth and accept, hoping Qu Changfeng would not show excessive favoritism, since certain forces present still maintained decent relations with the Battle Sky Alliance.

Regardless of their expressions, Qu Changfeng laughed heartily. “Very well, then I shall not be modest. Of the remaining three portions, this friend here will take one—any objections?”

To everyone’s astonishment, Qu Changfeng’s first allocation went to a lone man standing to the side, his face like it had been carved from a blade, his expression resolute.

“Ah…” an outcry erupted. The crowd stared at Qu Changfeng and then at the man in disbelief, puzzled by what Qu Changfeng intended to do.

In their minds, the Battle Sky Alliance’s quarter was indisputable, but this man and Yang Kai stood alone; neither had the strength or the standing to warrant a share of the treasure.

They had long since mentally excluded the two solitary figures!

Yet Qu Changfeng had instantly awarded one of them a full quarter—the exact same amount as the Battle Sky Alliance.

Was there some trick afoot?

Many suspected Qu Changfeng intended to let this man seize a quarter and then steal it from him, but if that were the case the other Saint King Realm cultivator at the First Stage would have been the easier target—why bother giving it to a Third Stage Saint King?

That would be courting trouble.

Yet the man showed no surprise, as if he had long expected this outcome; he merely nodded and said coolly, “Very well.”

He accepted the matter as if it were the most natural thing, with no trace of embarrassment or being flattered.

This made the leaders of the various forces change expression; they frowned as if recalling something, and no one openly opposed Qu Changfeng’s allocation—they all tacitly assented.

In that instant they all regarded the resolute-faced man with wary eyes.

Yang Kai frowned; he vaguely guessed the man’s background, but dared not be certain—his time on Dark Star had been limited, and he was not familiar with local customs and acquaintances.

Next, Qu Changfeng further assumed responsibility and distributed the remaining half of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water among several of the present forces, according to the number of people they had sent—more people meant a larger share, fewer people meant less. It was a rough fairness, not an obvious favoritism. Even the charming woman who had fluttered her eyes at him did not receive any extra benefit, leaving her sulking, her pretty face chilled as if frost had formed upon it.

Among all those present, the only one who was not allocated any share was Yang Kai.

No one was surprised; they had already dismissed the solitary Yang Kai long ago. If Qu Changfeng had truly granted Yang Kai a share that would have been odd.

With the division complete, many warriors turned to Yang Kai—some jeering, some mocking, some pitying. Faces varied, but no one offered to defend him.

Yang Kai stood unconcerned and did not reply.

He found it amusing; he had been uncertain whether the golden pool indeed contained Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and placing his hopes on others had been as foolish as hoping pigs would climb trees.

These people knew nothing about the Soul Cleansing Divine Water! The sealing hadn’t even been broken and they had already agreed on the division.

Yang Kai wanted to see how they planned to transport the Soul Cleansing Divine Water away.

Once that thing left the pool which gave birth to it, its soul-cleansing efficacy would vanish; if they merely removed the fluid they would only obtain a pile of spirit liquid, not true Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

So no matter how ostentatious Qu Changfeng’s division was, or how they sought to exclude him, Yang Kai felt no hurry.

If the stuff couldn’t be taken out of the pool, what use was an elaborate division? In the end they’d still need to bathe in it on the spot; if their scheme failed and chaos erupted, Yang Kai could fish in murky waters and profit.

Once the distribution was finished, everyone immediately followed Qu Changfeng’s call and began to attack the golden sealing that shrouded the pool.

For a time, the light from various Secret Treasures and Martial Skills burst forth; ripples spread one after another across the golden semicircular membrane hovering above the pool. To avoid giving matters time to fester, each person gave their full strength.

With the assault begun, individual strengths quickly revealed themselves. Those Saint King cultivators at the Second or Third Stage were fairly evenly matched, but Qu Changfeng stood out, wielding an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure that took the form of a long halberd with a bronze hue. Although at his Third Stage of the Saint King Realm he could not unleash its full power, each stroke carried tremendous force, making the semicircular sealing tremble fiercely.

Qu Changfeng’s capability surprised no one—after all, he was the Battle Sky Alliance’s prodigy, famed across Dark Star, so it was not strange he possessed such a powerful Secret Treasure.

What took people aback was the resolute-faced man; he did not reveal any mighty Secret Treasure but only wore a pair of black gloves on his fists and pummeled the sealing with blow after blow.

His calm, unassuming attacks were no less forceful than Qu Changfeng’s ostentatious display.

The others then confirmed their earlier suspicions and understood why Qu Changfeng had willingly awarded this man a quarter of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

Having understood, they silently unleashed their Secret Treasures’ power and Martial Skills, no longer paying special attention to the man.

Qu Changfeng, however, seemed to have developed a competitive mindset. He couldn’t just casually challenge that person to a spar, so he focused on surpassing him in breaking the restriction instead. The Saint Yuan within him surged more and more violently, and the commotion he stirred up naturally grew louder and louder.

But no matter how Qu Changfeng urged his Saint Yuan, the man’s strikes remained steady and unhurried; he showed no sign of intensifying his effort, as if Qu Changfeng were beneath his notice. This frustrated the Battle Sky Alliance prodigy to near nausea.

Blow after blow landed like hitting cotton; that pent-up, stifling feeling was unbearable.
