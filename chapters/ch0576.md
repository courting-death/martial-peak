## Chapter 576 — Absorb Them All

The situation shifted too quickly. It seemed as though Yang Kai’s mansion, which had appeared utterly defenseless, suddenly released such a number of powerful fighters of this caliber. The Huang Family and Guangming Mansion were completely thrown off guard.

Even if they had reacted, they would not have been able to withstand the ferocious assault from the nine Blood Servants.

Since rising to the Transcendent Realm, this was the first battle for the nine Blood Servants. They fought with exceptional zeal and showed no mercy in their strikes.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe realized something was wrong the moment they encountered the Blood Servants’ first attack.

When the two finally stabilized and took a steady look, they were dumbfounded.

The elite forces of their two families were being felled like wheat cut down by a sickle under the nine Blood Servants' fierce onslaught, utterly powerless to resist.

From the moment Huang Xiao gave the order to attack until the fight ended, barely ten breaths had passed.

Sixty or seventy elites from the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion were entirely wiped out, leaving only the two Transcendent Realm warriors, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, staring blankly at this turn of events.

The elite forces of the Lü Family trembled as well.

Originally, Lü Si had declined Huang Xiao’s invitation and missed out on the chance to gain merit. They were somewhat disappointed, but after witnessing this scene, they silently gave thanks, convinced that Elder Si’s sharp insight and foresight had saved them.

Had the Lü Family’s elites also joined in, their fate would surely have been no different from that of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion — collapsing without resistance in a pool of blood.

A chill arose from the heart; everyone felt as if they had fallen into an ice pit.

The so-called elites of these first-rate forces were nothing against the nine Transcendent Realm warriors.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe were slightly lost in thought; they seemed almost unable to believe what they were seeing, let alone accept that the elites their families and sects had painstakingly cultivated had been lost so easily.

Nine figures suddenly flew over — the nine Blood Servants of the Yang Family, all with indifferent expressions.

Sensing the danger, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe cried out in alarm, no longer daring to stay, hastily retreating.

“Young Master Yang, please show mercy,” Lü Si shouted urgently. “After all, they are still part of the resistance against the Cangyun Evil Land!”

“Yang Kai…” Qiu Yimeng also called out.

Upon hearing Qiu Yimeng’s voice, the nine Blood Servants momentarily slowed their movements, awaiting new orders from Yang Kai. In that brief hesitation, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe had already disappeared without a trace.

Seeing Yang Kai said nothing to stop them, Lü Si finally exhaled in relief.

Although the loss of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion’s elites was heavy, there was still a chance for resurgence. If Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe had died too, however, these two mighty first-rate forces would truly be destroyed.

“Thank you, Young Master Yang!” Lü Si quickly cupped his hands in thanks.

Yang Kai’s expression was strange, his brows tightly furrowed, face showing displeasure, yet he remained silent.

Lü Si was uneasy, heavy with pressure, and could only wait quietly.

Yang Kai’s focus had already shifted elsewhere.

When the nine Blood Servants rushed out to kill the first Divine Roaming Realm expert, he suddenly noticed a huge suction forming within his Sea of Consciousness, drawing in an inexplicable energy.

As the elites of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion fell, successive waves of strange energy were sucked into his Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai quickly immersed himself in spirit and sent his Divine Sense into his Sea of Consciousness to investigate.

After a long while, he realized that the mysterious energy being absorbed was actually the residual Divine Sense power left behind by the fallen Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Each Divine Roaming Realm expert had their own Sea of Consciousness, storing Divine Sense power cultivated through their training.

When a Divine Roaming Realm expert died, their Sea of Consciousness would collapse at the moment of death, and the Divine Sense power within would quickly dissipate into the void, vanishing without a trace.

Like water spilling from a broken cup, the water inside would just stream out and evaporate.

Unless there were some special heaven-and-earth treasures capable of preserving the Divine Sense power left behind by a Divine Roaming Realm expert’s death.

For example, the Warm Spirit Lotus.

When Yang Kai first acquired the Warm Spirit Lotus, it was enveloped in a massive Divine Sense power—the remnant of its previous owner.

At that time, Yang Kai was too weak to make use of that Divine Sense power, and it ended up in the hands of Earth Demons.

But now, the Divine Sense power that escaped from the collapsing Seas of Consciousness of those Divine Roaming Realm experts was being entirely drawn into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

The source of the attraction was none other than the tightly closed Golden Pupil Eye.

Yang Kai’s expression grew strange.

He had personally witnessed the overwhelming strength of the Golden Pupil Eye and had even contemplated its use, going so far as to enter seclusion for a month in an attempt to refine it.

Unfortunately, it had not succeeded, only allowing a subtle connection between his Divine Sense and the eye.

He had long since stopped paying much attention to the Golden Pupil Eye, but now, unexpectedly, it was activating.

Clusters of Divine Sense power surged together—some sixty or seventy groups. These Divine Sense energies contained all the thoughts of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion warriors, wildly chaotic and confusing, like a huge mishmash that caused one to frown.

Immersed in this, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was unresponsive to the world outside.

However, to onlookers, Yang Kai appeared to be deep in thought, seemingly pondering something crucial, his facial expressions constantly shifting.

After a while, Yang Kai suddenly came back to his senses and turned to look around, noticing no bodies for Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, confirming they had escaped.

He did not probe further and only said, "Clear away the bodies."

Having given the order, Yang Kai turned and prepared to enter the mansion.

"Young Master Yang, please wait!" Lü Si hurriedly called out.

Yang Kai turned his head, a trace of impatience showing on his face as he replied coldly, "Elder Lü, what else do you wish to say?"

Sweat beaded on Lü Si’s forehead; he quickly waved it off. "I dare not..."

In the past, Lü Si might have shown some stance before Yang Kai, trying to assert his seniority, but seeing such a grand and imposing force at Yang Kai’s command, along with his ruthless decisiveness, Lü Si dared not utter a word of criticism.

One wrong move, and the Lü Family’s people would likely have to explain themselves here.

He lowered his posture extremely and cautiously inquired, "Young Master Yang... what are your plans for handling this matter?"

"Handling what?" Yang Kai frowned.

"You have killed so many people..."

"Killed, then killed. If anyone wishes to seek revenge, they can come find me directly," Yang Kai sneered. "What, Elder Lü wants to avenge them?"

"You joke, Young Master Yang," Lü Si replied awkwardly. "I merely mean that the Lü Family has acted together with the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion this time, intending to rush to Zhongdu to aid the Eight Great Families. We were so close to Zhongdu when this mishap occurred. If the Eight Great Families start asking questions, I really will have a hard time explaining."

Yang Kai then turned around leisurely, looking at Lü Si calmly. "Elder Lü, tell me—was this matter my fault?"

"No," Lü Si thought for a moment and solemnly shook his head.

Indeed, this was not Yang Kai’s fault. Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe had insisted on entangling matters and sought harm against Yang Kai's mansion. Their strength was inferior, and they were killed. They were simply shortsighted and had offended someone they shouldn’t have.

If one were to assign blame, it would be that Yang Kai was too extreme in his handling. He did not have to kill so many; the nine Blood Servants only had to show some strength, and the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion would definitely have retreated disgracefully.

But as the young lord of the Yang Family, Yang Kai’s character was known to Lü Si. He dared to kill the future inheritor of a first-rate family; what need to mention those so-called elites?

"Then since it's not my fault, if the Eight Great Families ask, Elder Lü can report the truth," Yang Kai said coldly.

"I can't explain it away," Lü Si said slowly. "Our three families acted together; the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion suffered severe losses, but my Lü Family was completely preserved. When we reach Zhongdu, the Lü Family will likely be suspected."

"What exactly are you trying to say? Speak plainly, I have no time to waste with you here!"

Lü Si’s expression turned serious as he spoke loudly, "Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe’s personalities are known to me. Their poor decisions have dealt a severe blow to their sects and families’ Yuan Qi. To distance themselves from blame, they will likely slander my Lü Family and even Young Master Yang's mansion."

"Accuse you of colluding with me to frame them?"

"Not impossible," Lü Si nodded.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. "If that’s the case, your Lü Family is finished. This time even the Qiu Family might not be able to save you."

Faced with Yang Kai’s schadenfreude, Lü Si did not lose his temper but sincerely said, "Therefore, I wish to ask Young Master Yang to accompany me to Zhongdu."

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, a cold and dark light flickering deep within.

"Your mansion has many experts. If you join with the Lü Family to rush aid to Zhongdu, we might be able to resolve the current crisis there. Then the Eight Great Families would have no more cause to blame you, and the Lü Family would remain safe. It would benefit both you and me. In truth... I have never believed that Young Master Yang colludes with the demons."

"Thank you for your trust, Elder Lü..." Yang Kai said indifferently. "But the lives of the Eight Great Families and the fate of Zhongdu have nothing to do with me. I am here only seeking refuge. Elder Lü, safe travels."

With that said, he turned and walked inside, no longer giving Lü Si a chance to speak.

In that short while, the bodies outside had already been cleared by the nine Blood Servants. Everyone in the mansion followed Yang Kai inside, leaving the Lü Family awkwardly standing outside.

Lü Si smiled bitterly.

Inside the mansion, the wounded Bilo was receiving treatment. Shan Qingluo came in as well; after a brief examination, she visibly relaxed.

"Thank you," Shan Qingluo said softly, her absolutely enchanting face flushing with a delicate blush. Her breathing was slightly heavy.

Noticing her unusual state, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman looked at her in surprise.

They couldn’t understand how this Enchantress Queen would openly show desire for Yang Kai in front of everyone.

“You’re all right?” Yang Kai appraised her up and down.

“I’m fine,” Shan Qingluo smiled demurely, wearing an infatuated expression. “I just want to eat you.”

“Hey… There are people here,” Qiu Yimeng couldn’t bear it anymore. Such blatant seduction was shameless to the extreme. Her favor and impression of the Enchantress Queen immediately collapsed.
