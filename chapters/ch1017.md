## Chapter 1017 — Even If You Scream Your Throat Out, No One Will Care

In that instant, the two from Purple Star bowed their heads and became meek and servile; they understood the pressure of the situation, understood how the tide had turned, and understood that Yang Kai was no longer the youth they could afford to ignore.

If the Ghost Ancestor truly sought his favor, he should be capable of controlling each of their lives and deaths.

Nearby, Shen Tu's massive body trembled as he looked at Yang Kai, his eyes bright with excitement; he hadn't expected the situation to become so dramatic and let out a tinkling laugh, enjoying the spectacle like a bystander relishing a play.

Secretly, he hoped Yang Kai would give some answer.

Yue Xi's lovely face shifted several times as she stared at Yang Kai; deep in her beautiful eyes rose a thick tide of dread and vigilance.

Lü Guichen's relationship with Yang Kai was poor, and her relationship with Yang Kai wasn't any better!

After Wei Wu was killed, she had sought out Yang Kai and declared that one day he would pay the price; Yang Kai had not held back then and retorted sharply. Those old words still echoed, and Yue Xi's heart tasted bitter; for a moment she did not know what to do.

The experts on both sides were all heavy with mood, feeling as if they had just left a tiger's den only to enter a wolf's lair; facing Yang Kai made them even more uneasy than facing the Ghost Ancestor.

At the very least, they knew the Ghost Ancestor's objective and methods.

But they did not know what Yang Kai truly had in his heart.

Yang Kai coldly regarded Lü Guichen and Bi Ya, watching their pathetic, forced smiles that looked worse than crying, and suddenly felt disgust.

Fortunes rise and fall with time.

More than a year ago, when he fell into misfortune and was subdued by Lü Guichen with a single move, he had no strength to resist. And now, the very expert who once could kill him in one strike was groveling and flattering him, fawning and full of sycophancy.

All because behind him stood a figure like the Ghost Ancestor!

Yang Kai had originally intended to use the Ghost Ancestor's hand to kill Lü Guichen and avenge the day his cultivation had been shackled, but now he had no such inclination.

Even if the Ghost Ancestor killed Lü Guichen, Yang Kai could not summon any feeling of pleasure.

After pondering, Yang Kai suddenly said, “I heard your Purple Star collected quite a lot of medicinal ingredients recently?”

Lü Guichen was taken aback and hurriedly replied, “We did collect a good number. But because we lacked a storage Secret Treasure to preserve them, some efficacy has dissipated, though it's not fatal. Hmm. I heard the young brother is a pill refiner? It seems those herbs would be of great use in your hands. You should refine them into pills soon, or the treasures of heaven will spoil!”

Yang Kai grinned, pleased. He then asked, “What about your Saint Crystals?”

“They're all stored in a concealed location. The spiritual qi here is excessively concentrated, so we haven't been able to use them; we'll just present them to the young brother—leave them be or give them away, it's all the same.”

“Excellent, excellent, very sensible!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly and lightly patted Lü Guichen's shoulder, visibly pleased. He signaled to Shen Tu: “Later, go with him to retrieve the items.”

“Understood!” Shen Tu's body trembled and he straightened like a spear.

“No time to delay; we might as well go now!” Lü Guichen smiled awkwardly, eager to escape and avoid further trouble from Yang Kai.

Saying that, he offered a perfunctory apology to Yang Kai, led Shen Tu, and hastily withdrew.

Seeing his feigned flattery, Yue Xi couldn't help but show a look of scorn and disdain.

She had dealt with Lü Guichen for many years and knew well that in both cultivation and methods, he was in no way inferior to her — they were equals. Yet now Lü Guichen was bowing and scraping, lowering himself so much that Yue Xi felt even her own dignity had been diminished.

Her already poor mood only worsened.

“As for you…” Yang Kai suddenly looked at her, a strange smile curling his lips. His eyes burned like fire as they swept up and down, lingering over Yue Xi's full, tender bosom, her slender, graceful waist, and her long legs, an odd light flashing in his gaze.

Although Yue Xi was the master of He Zao and He Miao and certainly not young, her profound cultivation had prevented the years from leaving many marks; instead they had given her a mature charm.

She looked like a newly married young wife, sweet and desirable.

Yang Kai inwardly praised, thinking this beauty's looks surpassed those of her two disciples.

His gaze was wanton and aggressive, wholly unabashed.

Under such a stare, Yue Xi could not help but feel as if her clothes had been stripped away, as if she stood naked before the youth; an uncontrollable blend of shame and fury rose within her, her delicate body trembling as she snapped, “What do you want? You can take our medicinal herbs and Saint Crystals, but don't expect me to grovel before you like Lü Guichen!”

“Plenty of backbone, I like that!” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “Don't think being the master of He Zao and He Miao exempts you from my actions. You're no different from the people of Purple Star. Were it not for the protection of the Ghost Ancestor on this continent, I'd have been killed long ago by one of you!”

“You’re the kind of man who deserves to die!” Yue Xi sneered icily.

“What kind of man am I? Do you know me? What gives you the right to judge me? I saved your two disciples, and you not only show no gratitude but constantly suspect and trouble me—reclaiming the ring you gave me was one thing, I didn't care about that. Wei Wu wanted to kill me and I killed him in self-defense because of his own weakness; you demand vengeance without asking why? Ask your two disciples how I truly am, and what kind of person Wei Wu was!” Yang Kai shouted.

“What do you mean?” Yue Xi frowned, looking suspiciously at Yang Kai, feeling there was something secret in his words.

“Bi Ya!” Yang Kai called.

“Young brother, what do you need?” Bi Ya forced a smile, her expression awkward.

“You're from Purple Star—tell me how you found He Zao and He Miao, how you forced them into the Chaos Abyss!” Yang Kai looked coldly at Yue Xi but spoke to Bi Ya.

Yue Xi turned her gaze to Bi Ya, waiting for her answer.

Bi Ya dared not hide it. Her lips trembled as she said, “Someone from your Sword Alliance sent word that the person with the Star Gate Token was at the edge of the Chaos Abyss; without that in the vast Star Domain, where could we have found the sisters?”

Yue Xi's body shuddered and disbelief flared in her beautiful eyes.

“Master, the reason we stopped there was because Senior Brother Wei Wu sent a message; he said you would come to find us and told us not to run off!” He Zao said beside Yue Xi.

“I never gave such an instruction!” Yue Xi shook her head, her face pale, seemingly unable to accept what she was hearing.

“Who sent you the message?” He Zao asked Bi Ya.

Bi Ya slowly shook her head. “I don't know. Only Lord Lü knows; when he returns you should ask him.”

Yue Xi was distraught, muttering, “Impossible—Wei Wu couldn't be that sort of man… he grew up by my side, how could he do such a thing?”

Muttering to herself, she suddenly glared fiercely at Yang Kai: “Surely you colluded with that wretched wench to slander Wei Wu, didn't you?”

“You're beyond saving!” Yang Kai shook his head and his face hardened. “Remember what I told you that day?”

Yue Xi showed a panicked expression, her pretty face paling.

How could she forget Yang Kai's words—those were the most humiliating things she had heard, and the memory made her deeply uncomfortable.

“A hag like you isn’t even worth my glance!” Yang Kai curled his lip and spat venomously, “Best you stay a lonely old virgin for the rest of your life—unwanted and untouched.”

At these words, He Zao and He Miao both frowned and glared fiercely at Yang Kai, while Bi Ya pursed her lips in a knowing smile, as if to say she understood such matters well.

“You angered me; I won't take it out on you—I'll make your two disciples pay. Ah, their tender flesh suits my taste perfectly!”

“What do you intend to do?” Yue Xi flew into a rage, instantly shielding He Zao and He Miao behind her and watching Yang Kai warily.

“Don't you know what I intend?” Yang Kai grinned and, as he spoke, his divine sense transmitted a message to the Ghost Ancestor.

In the next moment, a pitch-black energy suddenly materialized beside Yue Xi; like a phantom it roared and surged into her delicate body, freezing her at once and leaving her unable to move.

Two more strands of pitch-black energy appeared and coiled like ropes, binding He Zao and He Miao.

He Miao let out a terrified scream.

Yang Kai ignored the strange looks from onlookers and strode forward, hoisting He Zao and He Miao onto his shoulders, one on each side, and with a triumphant look he raised an eyebrow at Yue Xi before striding toward the mid-slope of the mountain.

“You demon, release He Zao and He Miao this instant! If you so much as touch a finger on them, I'll make you pay!” Yue Xi raved like a madwoman, watching Yang Kai carry her two disciples farther and farther away as she howled and trembled violently.

But before the power of the Ghost Ancestor, she was utterly powerless.

“Scream all you want—scream yourself hoarse; no one will come to your aid!” Yang Kai snickered coldly and treated her threats with contempt.

“You brat, how can you do this to me?” Yue Xi cried in indignation, hatred burning deep within her. She thought that even if Yang Kai dragged her into the mountain and violated her, that could not justify punishing her two disciples for her sins.

In that case, at least she would not feel guilty toward her two disciples.

“This is what you get for provoking me!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, and his figure finally disappeared into the mountain's belly.

Yue Xi's roars and curses continued. The remaining members of Purple Star and the Sword Alliance watched Yang Kai's retreating back with dread; all felt his actions were monstrous and inhuman.

Even Bi Ya could not help but shiver; after witnessing Yang Kai's viciousness, she suddenly realized she had seriously underestimated the youth.

He was a cold and merciless fellow, naturally callous; perhaps he lacked any capacity for feeling.

Compared to his actions, she felt she was nothing but a great, decent person.
