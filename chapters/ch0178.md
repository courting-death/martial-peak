## Chapter 178 — Resolutely Marching to Death

Listening to Yang Kai's inquiry, the lady gave a sorrowful smile, "Did I not wish to know why Miao Huacheng treats me, a widow with an orphan, in such a manner? After much questioning, I learned that the root of it all lies in an item obtained by my late husband and Miao Huacheng many years ago."

"What item?" 

"A turtle shell!" the lady replied. "When my husband and Miao Huacheng were traveling near Haicheng, they came across a peculiar turtle shell. On that shell was a map of an island. It has been many years since then, and when they explored the nearby islands, none matched the map on the turtle shell. They thought the map was not genuine, but out of caution, they split it in half, each taking one part."

The lady took a gentle breath and continued, "Later, my husband went to Tongzhou and built a career, while Miao Huacheng settled in Haicheng. Over the years, he must have been studying that half of the turtle shell, and recently, he finally found some clues. However, he was unwilling to share them with my husband, which is why he hired someone to kill him and sent word for me to bring my family to Haicheng. I had seen my husband's half of the turtle shell and knew its value, so I brought it with me on this trip."

"Do you still remember the night when the guard Zhang Ding rebelled?" 

"Was it also instigated by Miao Huacheng?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

"Yes!" The lady nodded slightly. "Miao Huacheng and my husband were close friends, and he probably did not want to act against us personally, which is why he instigated Zhang Ding. If it weren't for you that night, I, along with Huan'er and Cui'er, would have likely followed my husband to the afterlife."

"What a good friend!" Yang Kai mocked with a smile, then questioned, "You three are merely ordinary people. Once you entered the Miao family, if Miao Huacheng wanted to obtain something from you, it would have been easy. Why did he treat you well at first?"

The lady smiled bitterly, "I didn't understand at first, but later I felt it was all thanks to you."

"Me?" 

"Yes." The lady nodded. "When Miao Huacheng came to greet us that day, I mentioned, as you suggested, that we had a powerful ally who killed Zhang Ding, which is why we were safe. Miao Huacheng is a cautious person; he treated us well at first because he feared that this nonexistent powerful ally might still be lurking nearby, so he did not dare to act. It was only when I decided to leave that he revealed his true colors."

Yang Kai nodded secretly; this made sense.

"What happened next?"

"Then... the nightmare began." The lady began to cry again, tears streaming down her face as she continued, "To save my life, I handed over that half of the turtle shell, but Miao Huacheng had no intention of letting us go."

As she spoke, her body trembled, fists clenched tightly, knuckles turning white.

"One night, Miao Huacheng took Huan'er away, saying he wanted her to marry his son. Huan'er refused vehemently, and Cui'er came to help her. But Miao Huacheng, devoid of humanity, resorted to cruel methods and had Cui'er beaten to death..."

Yang Kai's body shuddered.

The lady cried as she continued, "The next day, Miao Huacheng came to tell me that Huan'er, unwilling to suffer humiliation, had bitten her tongue and committed suicide!"

Yang Kai felt a chill run through him, a surge of rage almost uncontrollable.

That playful and charming little maid was killed, and that shy young lady had also taken her own life.

Just two months ago, he had traveled with them, but now, two months later, they had already crossed into the realm of the dead, forever separated.

"Miao Huacheng still wants to humiliate me!" the lady choked, speaking intermittently, "But having seen what happened to Huan'er and Cui'er, he did not dare to go too far. After imprisoning me for a few days and still unable to achieve his goal, he finally lost his temper and sold me into a brothel."

There was no need to ask further; Yang Kai understood that it was a place of ill repute.

"They beat me, forced me to submit. I refused, so I used scissors to cut my own face. Heh... With this appearance, no man would be interested, right?" The lady laughed bitterly, "Later, I was sold to the Yunxia Sect."

"I should have died. My husband is gone, Huan'er and Cui'er are no longer here. What use is this life? But I cannot die. If I die, no one will know of their grievances. So I must live. I am just a weak woman, but I must help them seek justice and avenge them!"

Yang Kai's heart bled, and he sighed deeply, comforting her, "Madam, you are the most beautiful lady in the world, and also the strongest mother!"

Sometimes, death is easy, but living is incredibly difficult.

"Young hero, can I ask you to help me one more time?" The lady raised her tear-filled eyes, looking at Yang Kai with hope.

On the mountaintop, the wind howled, and Yang Kai's expression was stern.

"My strength is too low!" Yang Kai sighed.

The lady's expression dimmed.

"But... I will grow stronger. It may take a few years, or even longer, but I will visit the Miao family in Haicheng."

Not for the lady's request, but for the little snacks Cui'er occasionally gave him!

The lady was momentarily stunned, then her face lit up with joy, and she knelt down, her forehead touching the ground, "Thank you, young hero!"

After a long while, she slowly straightened up and said, "Let the young hero know that although this matter was primarily instigated by Miao Huacheng, there are higher-ups in the Yunxia Sect behind it."

"En?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Miao Huacheng's son, Miao Lin, is a disciple of the Yunxia Sect, but his status is not very high. Miao Huacheng has been trying every means to obtain the complete turtle shell, intending to offer it to the Yunxia Sect so that his son can gain power within the sect. Moreover, Miao Huacheng's betrayal and mistreatment of my Jiang family is also due to his son's instigation; he wants to rise in the Yunxia Sect but has no connections, and the turtle shell is his hope."

"Yunxia Sect! I understand." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Young hero!" The lady bit her lip, her head lowered, her voice trembling, "Although I know you are kind-hearted and willing to seek justice for my Jiang family out of gratitude for Cui'er's kindness, my Jiang family... has nothing to repay you with."

"There's no need to worry about that."

"Please let me finish." The lady insisted.

Yang Kai nodded.

"Actually, after my husband obtained that half of the turtle shell, he has been researching it all these years. Miao Huacheng has some insights, and my husband has done the same. From his half of the turtle shell, he obtained another map. According to my husband’s deduction, when the two halves are combined, they form a route map to find that island, while the map he obtained is the internal route of the island."

"Oh?" Yang Kai was surprised, "Where is that map?"

"It... is on me..." The lady replied, her tone somewhat unnatural.

Yang Kai was immediately puzzled; how could a weak woman like her guard such an important map? Wouldn't Miao Huacheng search her?

After a long silence, the lady seemed to have made up her mind and said, "Young hero, your righteous act, my Jiang family cannot repay. I will offer this map as a reward!"

Saying this, she reached down and tore her pants, revealing a plump, snow-white thigh.

"The map... is embroidered on my body..." The lady lowered her head, her body trembling, clearly having mustered great courage to make such a decision.

Yang Kai's face turned slightly red, and he dared not look directly, swallowing hard. In recent days, with his cultivation and strength increasing, the influence of the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique on him had deepened, and Su Yan's face often flashed in his mind. If not for his strong will, he would have been unable to hold on.

Now, with the lady presenting such a situation, Yang Kai found it hard to cope.

"Madam..." Yang Kai frowned.

"Young hero..." The lady's face was also flushed, "This is my husband's lifelong effort. I do not want it to be buried, nor do I want it to fall into the hands of enemies. Let it be a reward, please accept it."

Yang Kai sighed, knowing that if he refused again, she would surely feel uneasy. He sighed and said, "I am sorry."

He squatted down and focused his gaze on the lady's thigh. It was a vast landscape, resembling the shape of an island, with many places marked specially and a winding route extending across it.

This map must have been embroidered with a needle dipped in dye, occupying the entire thigh of the lady. From the knee to the root of the thigh, although it could not completely display the original map, it was certainly not far off.

Yang Kai found it hard to imagine how an ordinary woman could possess such strong willpower to tattoo a grand map like this on her body. How much pain must she have endured, and how much time did it take?

Yang Kai's expression remained calm, his eyes carefully examining the map, without revealing any unusual emotions.

The lady trembled lightly, her eyes closed, tears flowing continuously.

After about a cup of tea's time, Yang Kai finally memorized everything and reached out to tidy up the lady's torn clothes.

"Young hero, thank you for your trouble." The lady sat on the ground, her voice flat.

After saying this, it was as if she had put down all her burdens. Yang Kai sensed a determination to march resolutely to death in her tone.

Her heart was already dead; she lived only to seek justice for others. Now that her wish was fulfilled, she naturally had no more attachments.

Staring blankly at her, Yang Kai remained silent for a long time.

A day later, Yang Kai descended the mountain, carrying the medicine basket brought by the lady, filled with the harvested Black Mysterious Fruits, step by step toward the seaside, his expression indifferent.

On the mountaintop, the lady sat there, her tears dried, gazing at the sea, unmoving.

Yang Kai did not take her away because living was more painful for her than dying.

She only needed liberation.

Several hours later, Yang Kai arrived at the seaside and waited for a long time before the Yunxia Sect's large ship finally arrived.

Many people waited with Yang Kai, and when the large ship appeared, cheers erupted.

At the ship's side, the Yunxia Sect's warriors blocked the boarding path, inspecting everyone's harvest. Those who completed the three-jin task were allowed to board, while those who did not were directly stripped of their medicine baskets and thrown into the sea to be devoured by the demon beasts beneath the waves.

Among dozens of people, only three or four had not completed the task, and amidst their screams and pleas, they were thrown into the sea, becoming food for the demon beasts.

Yang Kai mingled in the crowd, and no one noticed anything unusual. After all, those picking Black Mysterious Fruits were all ordinary people; which Yunxia Sect disciple would remember ordinary people?

Half an hour later, the large ship set sail again, rounding to the left peninsula, dropping off these ordinary people and sending them into a courtyard.
