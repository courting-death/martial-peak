## Chapter 535 — Black Book Page Seven

Inside the side hall, facing Ye Xinrou’s blatant seduction, Yang Kai rose and walked straight towards her.

Ye Xinrou lifted her eyelids and glanced at him shyly, her heartbeat pounding violently in her chest, a faint trace of expectation flickering across her delicate face.

She was indeed somewhat interested in Yang Kai. To share such intimate pleasures with a young overlord-like figure must surely be a joy.

As Yang Kai drew nearer, Ye Xinrou’s breathing grew shallow and rapid.

Moments later, Yang Kai brushed past her, and a low, scornful sneer whispered into her ear.

“Sorry, I have no interest in worn-out whores.”

The expectation on Ye Xinrou’s face immediately vanished, her exquisite visage turning grim and terrifying as her delicate body trembled violently. Abruptly, she spun around and shouted, “Yang Kai, stop right there!”

Yang Kai ignored her and continued striding outward.

Seized by fury, Ye Xinrou stepped forward to chase him, but before she could get close, an invisible wave of energy hurled her away. When she hit the ground, Yang Kai had already disappeared without a trace.

“Yang Kai, how dare you treat me like this? I’ll make sure you suffer a miserable death!” Ye Xinrou screamed hysterically, like a madwoman.

Outside the side hall, Qiu Yimeng looked at the departing Yang Kai with a strange expression. Her face flushed as she said, “You’re too much. To treat a woman like that.”

“What’s too much?” Yang Kai snorted coldly. “Not summoning Huo Xingchen to deal with her is already me showing mercy. I’ve always been kind to women. By the way, she’s yours now.”

“Hehe…” Qiu Yimeng chuckled, a look of anticipation creeping across her features.

Though Ye Xinrou’s status prevented Qiu Yimeng from taking direct action against her, making her suffer a bit was possible—two women were always at odds. Now that Ye Xinrou had openly come to seduce Yang Kai, it ignited a raging fire of blind jealousy in Qiu Yimeng’s heart.

After Yang Kai left, Qiu Yimeng softly clapped her hands.

Immediately, several warrior guards hurried over and respectfully asked, “Miss Qiu, what are your orders?”

Qiu Yimeng’s lips curled into a demonish smile as she loudly commanded, “Guard outside the side hall! No one is to enter without my permission!”

“Yes!”

Inside the side hall, Ye Xinrou’s face drained of color, and she let out a coquettish plea, “Sister Qiu, Sister Qiu, please spare me this time, I was wrong, Sister Qiu…”

Qiu Yimeng muttered to herself, “Ah, getting old makes the ears a bit dull. Did any of you hear something?”

The guards outside solemnly shook their heads.

“Then maybe I heard wrong,” Qiu Yimeng giggled, then turned and left.

The guards suddenly felt a chill run through their bodies.

They realized that Qiu Yimeng too had a dark, ruthless side. Looking back towards the side hall, they couldn’t help but show some sympathy.

Inside, Ye Xinrou was completely stripped bare...

Within his room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, an uncharacteristic stirring rising in his heart.

It was not because of Ye Xinrou, but because of what was to come next.

Seven days ago, when he had just ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm, Yang Kai had been unaware. By the time he noticed, many other matters had occupied him, leaving no chance to deal with it until now.

The Wordless Black Book was reacting again!

With a thought, the Wordless Black Book, made from the Soul-Calming Stone, appeared in his hand.

Since obtaining this Wordless Black Book, Yang Kai had surged ahead on the martial path with unstoppable momentum.

This was aided by each unlocking of the Black Book’s pages—but more so by Yang Kai’s own effort.

He still remembered clearly.

Unlocking the first page had granted him the Proud Bone Golden Body.

The second page gave the Proud Bone Golden Body Technique.

The third page produced that mysterious incense burner.

The fourth bestowed the True Yang Technique, the foundation of his True Yuan.

The fifth had led him to Yao Wang Valley, where he acquired the peerless treasure beneath the Wan Yao Pool.

At the same time, the sixth page’s unlocking opened the Black Book Space.

The Wordless Black Book had been quiet ever since, until after he ascended to Divine Roaming Realm, when he sensed the seventh page’s sealing.

To sense it meant that with his current power and cultivation, he could break the seal, unlock it, and excavate the secrets buried within.

Every page unlocked brought great gains.

Now that the moment had come again, how could Yang Kai not be excited?

He took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, grasped the Wordless Black Book, opened it, and began to pour in his True Yuan.

But soon he detected an anomaly.

Previously, the Black Book would completely absorb the True Yuan, and upon reaching a certain threshold, the seal would break.

This time, however, it rejected all incoming True Yuan, reflecting it entirely back.

Yang Kai frowned in thought.

Had he performed the infusion incorrectly? Was his True Yuan insufficiently strong? Or perhaps…

This simply wasn’t the right method.

The seventh page’s seal was sensed only after opening his Sea of Consciousness upon ascending Divine Roaming Realm.

Therefore, the key lay in the Sea of Consciousness and Divine Sense.

Realizing this, Yang Kai ceased wasting True Yuan, and instead condensed his Divine Sense energy to strike at the seventh page.

The black page flickered faintly with light under the impact of his Divine Sense, which was immediately absorbed.

Seeing this, Yang Kai confirmed his deduction—the seventh page’s seal demanded Divine Sense to break.

With no hesitation, he madly condensed Divine Sense, repeatedly battering the Black Book.

Each Divine Sense attack was swallowed whole, but he could clearly feel the seal loosening, weakening like an ancient glacier melting under a fierce sun.

Slowly, but perceptibly.

Time passed, and unsure how long had elapsed, Yang Kai had consumed several pills to replenish his Divine Sense. After three full expenditures of all his Divine Sense, he finally shattered the Black Book’s seal.

The seventh page shimmered with intricate, overlapping patterns forming a complex and profound formation.

Once every line of the formation was illuminated, a small whirlpool appeared at the page’s center. It rotated slowly, seeming capable of devouring all.

As it spun, something emerged from the page.

Yang Kai’s heart suddenly gripped with dread. His soul in the Sea of Consciousness felt an invisible force pulling at it, eager to break free.

Startled, Yang Kai held his breath, steadying himself to resist.

If his soul were drawn out, he would become a senseless idiot!

At that moment, everyone in the residence—even Meng Wuya and Ling Taixu—felt a brief unease.

The sensation came suddenly and passed quickly, but it deeply alarmed these two powerful men.

Both concentrated their Divine Sense toward Yang Kai’s location, only to encounter an impenetrable void, as if something blocked their probing.

This filled them with suspicion; they could not fathom why.

Inside, Yang Kai stared oddly at the object emerging from the Black Book’s seventh page.

It was roughly egg-sized, pointed on both ends, round in the middle, flattened on the edges, covered with myriad wrinkles—like a person’s aged skin, or the fissured back of a millennia-old tortoise...

At first glance, it resembled some kind of fruit.

Yet the more Yang Kai looked, the more it seemed a tightly closed eye.

A chill ran through him, goosebumps prickling his skin.

He had no clue what it was. Previously, unlocking the Black Book’s seal always conveyed a message revealing his reward—but not this time.

This unlocking had been harder than he expected.

Vaguely, he felt it was something extraordinary, but despite his meditation he could not grasp its purpose, only sensing some tenuous link to his soul.

With a thought, the object—part fruit, part closed eye—vanished from his hand. Simultaneously, Yang Kai sensed new traces within his Sea of Consciousness.

Delving deeper, he discovered that the object had settled inside his Sea of Consciousness, quietly hovering above the island shaped from the Warm Spirit Lotus illusion, fitting perfectly—as if he had already refined it.

Besides the object and the Warm Spirit Lotus, there was also a small sword inside.

It was the Divine Soul Secret Treasure that had slain Nan Sheng.

Refining that sword had cost Yang Kai great effort, yet this unknown object had integrated into his Divine Sense effortlessly.

He shook his head, baffled by its significance.

At that moment, a sound echoed by his ear, stirring his mind. He withdrew from the Sea of Consciousness.

The door opened. Outside, Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya entered with grave expressions, staring blankly at Yang Kai. Scanning his Divine Sense thoroughly, they found nothing. Exchanging a puzzled glance, they asked no questions and silently exited.

“Young Master, are you all right?” Di Mo peeked in and asked cautiously.

“I’m fine,” Yang Kai shook his head, warmed by their concern.

“Good to hear,” Di Mo relaxed and withdrew.

“Wait,” Yang Kai suddenly called out.

“Yes, Young Master, what are your orders?”

“Go summon Leng Shan.”

“Yes.”

Shortly after, Leng Shan of Ghost King Valley was led into the room by Di Mo.

She looked at Yang Kai curiously and asked, “What’s the matter?”

“Sit,” Yang Kai motioned without rising.

Leng Shan froze for a moment, puzzled by Yang Kai’s intention.
