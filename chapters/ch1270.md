## Chapter 1270 — Glazed Mountain

Ahead sat a strange little mountain over sixty zhang high, its whole body a dull gray with not a blade of grass or a single tree, as if it were formed entirely of ashen rock.

This little mountain lay within a valley, surrounded by several taller peaks. At first glance it seemed ordinary, but when Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over it he was shocked to find it vanish like a mud ox diving into the sea—gone without a trace; the little mountain seemed not to exist at all, and his Divine Sense could detect nothing.

Moreover, from within the little mountain there emanated an extremely eerie force, as if it sought to tug at his spirit, giving him the chilling sensation of being devoured.

Therefore, after only briefly releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately reined it back in.

Now the three stood several thousand zhang from that little mountain, staring at Liuli Gate’s treasured mountain.

“Is this your sect’s Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain?” Yang Kai asked, his eyes showing astonishment.

“Yes, this is the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain. Heh heh, Brother Yang, forgive my poor hospitality—though the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain’s reputation is indeed grand, most of the time it appears like this: unassuming and not matching the rumors, so many visitors leave feeling the reality does not live up to the name,” Daiyuan said with a slight smile, explaining softly.

“Most of the time?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“The Thousand Illusions Glaze itself possesses an unfathomable, ever-changing marvel; what we see now is likely only one of its forms,” Yang Yan, who had been silent until then, suddenly interjected.

Daiyuan glanced at her in surprise, then nodded. “It seems Miss Yang Yan knows quite a bit about our Glazed Mountain. Indeed, this unremarkable state is only one of its forms. Sometimes it will emit ten thousand rays of glowing light, rendering the mountain utterly unlike anything of the mortal world—exquisitely beautiful; sometimes it will alter its size. Very strange.”

“There’s such a thing!” Yang Kai instantly grew interested.

Yang Yan’s mouth lifted in a carefree twitch; she gave no further explanation, merely said casually, “The formation you set here is rather surprising—it has a suppressive effect, does it not?”

Daiyuan heard this and nodded gently. “Yes, it does suppress; although the Glazed Mountain sits within our Liuli Gate, we have no means to truly control it, so we can only bind it here. Otherwise, with its strange transformations, who knows what it might become, and we might lose it.”

Speaking of which, Daiyuan smiled and said, “All right. We can’t stay here any longer. A few of the Senior Uncles guarding the Glazed Mountain have already noticed us—if we linger, they may come up to question us. Let us go.”

Yang Kai had felt it too: since the three of them arrived, several Divine Senses belonging to Origin Returning Realm experts had swept over from different directions, but they only made brief probes and took no further action.

So he was not surprised.

Daiyuan turned and flew off in one direction; Yang Kai and Yang Yan followed closely. The two exchanged a glance; Yang Yan gave a barely perceptible nod, and Yang Kai returned an understanding look.

It looked as if the formations here could not prevent Stone Puppets’ intrusion—once at Daiyuan’s Qianhuan Peak, they could find an opportunity to send out a Stone Puppet and then wait to reap the rewards.

Although Yang Kai did not understand exactly what Yang Yan planned to refine with the Thousand Illusions Glaze or what powers the glaze held, seeing Liuli Gate treat that strange little mountain with such gravity, how could he not realize it must be of great value?

Along the way they met many Liuli Gate disciples, but Yang Kai noticed one odd thing: when these disciples saw Daiyuan their expressions were complicated.

Some showed caution, some terror, some sympathy—and a range of other emotions.

Moreover, in almost every wave of Liuli Gate disciples there was someone who recognized Daiyuan.

This intrigued Yang Kai. Given Daiyuan’s character she seldom mingled with others, yet her name was so well known within Liuli Gate; from those people’s expressions Yang Kai quietly suspected that this woman must have some history within Liuli Gate.

Following Daiyuan they flew through the Taiqing Mountain Range for roughly half an hour before arriving at a distant peak.

From afar, seeing the hundred-odd zhang high peak, Daiyuan’s taut expression finally loosened; she looked relaxed as if returning home and enthusiastically pointed out the peak to Yang Kai: “That is my dwelling, Qianhuan Peak. It’s humble—please, Junior Brother Yang Kai and Miss Yang Yan, do not take offense.”

“Miss Daiyuan, you’re too polite,” Yang Kai chuckled, and together they flew toward the peak.

Before they reached the peak, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept ahead and discovered the interior of the peak was empty; it seemed Qianhuan Peak was inhabited only by Daiyuan herself, not even a single maid.

Before long the three landed on a narrow plank path halfway up Qianhuan Peak. The path was extremely narrow, only wide enough for one, clinging to the cliff face and appearing fragile. Walking on it made it sway as if it might collapse at any moment.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan paid it no mind; they walked and took in the scenery.

Indeed, though Qianhuan Peak was remote, its scenery was excellent—birds sang and flowers perfumed the air, verdant and lush, with a comfortable temperature; moreover the Spiritual Qi here was not sparse, even slightly superior to Dragon Lair Mountain.

A place like this within Liuli Gate would only be considered above average—what, then, of the very best peaks?

Yang Kai recalled the ruins of an ancient sect on the Fourth Stage of Flowing Flame Sandland and thought the Spiritual Qi there must be yet richer.

The plank path was short and wound upward; in a moment the three reached its end, which faced a smooth cliff wall with not a single indentation, as if cleaved open by some sharp instrument.

Daiyuan halted there.

Yang Kai looked about, puzzled.

Yang Yan, however, seemed to have spotted the trick and murmured, “There’s a formation here—open the stone wall and you can enter. It’s arranged very cleverly; it seems the work of a formation master.”

Yang Yan did not lower her voice deliberately, and Daiyuan turned back with a smile: “Miss Yang Yan truly seems well versed in formations. If you don’t mind, feel free to study it—no one normally comes to my Qianhuan Peak, so you won’t be disturbed.”

She had noticed that Yang Yan’s two attempts at conversation on the trip were both about formations, and so she naturally guessed Yang Yan favored that path; she showed goodwill toward her, also doing a favor for Yang Kai.

Yang Yan neither accepted nor declined, saying nothing. Daiyuan showed no embarrassment; a jade pendant suddenly appeared in her hand. After pouring Saint Yuan into it she tossed the pendant forward.

A strange scene unfolded: the pendant transformed into a streak of green light that shot into the smooth stone wall and vanished. Immediately, with a faint hum, a stone platform appeared before the wall, and behind it a passage led straight into the mountain’s interior, where faint glimmers of light flickered—so it did not seem dark.

“Junior Brother Yang Kai, Miss Yang Yan, please enter,” Daiyuan smiled slightly and leapt onto the stone platform.

Yang Kai saw this, jumped up as well, and peered into the passage. For a moment he thought he should have Yang Yan set up a formation like this, but then considered it unnecessary and shook his head.

Just as Daiyuan prepared to lead Yang Kai and Yang Yan into the mountain’s interior, her body suddenly stilled. She turned and looked toward the distant sky, and her face soon chilled, filled with gloom and displeasure.

Yang Kai followed her gaze and saw a cyan arc rapidly approaching—clearly someone was piloting a Star Shuttle toward them.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was sharp; with a brief probe he already knew who the Star Shuttle’s owner was, and a strange expression crossed his face.

“Junior Brother Yang Kai, Miss Yang Yan, wait here a moment—someone has come to see me,” Daiyuan forced a smile and stood her ground, waiting quietly.

Moments later the cyan arc arrived before the stone platform. The person standing on the Star Shuttle laughed before speaking, a sound like pleasant silver bells. The woman was of peerless beauty, graceful, her pair of eyes intoxicating as if they could draw a person’s soul in; she exuded endless charm, and with that sweet laugh was truly a sight to behold that made one blink in surprise.

Yin Sudie! The one who had appeared was Liuli Gate’s most famed disciple, Yin Sudie.

Yang Kai had met this woman several times and recognized her at once. From their excursion to Flowing Flame Sandland it seemed she and Daiyuan were somewhat at odds; he wondered what had brought her here.

Moreover, her timing was too convenient: Daiyuan had just returned to Qianhuan Peak and Yin Sudie had arrived right after—clearly she had received some news.

Yin Sudie’s eyes flickered with meaning, as if containing a thousand words she wished to say but held back—enough to drive any man mad. Her gaze swept over Yang Kai and Yang Yan, then fixed on Daiyuan: “Senior Sister, you’re back?”

Daiyuan gave her no pleasant look and, still expressionless, asked, “Why have you come?”

“Why shouldn’t I come?” Yin Sudie covered her mouth and laughed coquettishly. “Although this is Qianhuan Peak, it is also sect property. As the sect’s most outstanding core disciple of this generation, apart from the few forbidden areas, of course I may go anywhere. And when this Little Sister heard Senior Sister had returned, I immediately came to greet you, lest a moment’s delay cause Senior Sister displeasure. Will Senior Sister truly blame Little Sister?”

As she spoke, an expression of extreme grievance crossed her face, truly invoking pity and sympathy, as if even if she had committed a grave offense one could not bear to pursue her further.
