## Chapter 816 — Don't They Look Alike

Moreover, over the past two years, Saintess Nan has killed indiscriminately, asking neither reasons nor identity—she kills on sight, as if only murder remains in her heart. Yet before that, all had heard that the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s old Saintess was kind-hearted.

By comparison, she’s like a different person entirely—the change is too drastic.

And the incident of Saintess Nan attacking the Nine Heavens Sacred Land days ago is also true.

At once their expressions wavered; truth be told, they were reluctant to make enemies of the Sacred Land.

“Boy, you spout nonsense!” Zhang Ao glared at Yang Kai and barked, “You say Saintess Nan is dead? How can a corpse kill? What a joke! Do you take us for fools to be led by the nose?”

“Right—if she’s dead, how could she do those things?”

“Then why would the Sacred Land make things hard for you all? What good would it do the Sacred Land for Saintess Nan to create such slaughter outside?” Yang Kai countered.

Zhang Ao opened his mouth but could not come up with a reason on the spot.

Most of the forces here had been swayed to come because of Saintess Nan, seeking an explanation from the Sacred Land and justice for the dead. The ones who truly wanted to eradicate the Sacred Land were still those three forces led by Zhang Ao—they were merely seizing an excellent opportunity.

“I’ve no time to waste on you. What are you to speak with me?” Zhang Ao sniffed disdainfully. “Only Xu Hui is qualified to talk to me. Xu Hui, are you senile, relying on a brat to stick his head up for you? Laughable.”

“I’m not qualified?” Yang Kai grinned. “Sorry—I actually am.”

Zhang Ao frowned, not understanding his meaning.

“I am the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—tell me, am I qualified?” Yang Kai looked down at Zhang Ao and said lightly.

With that, everyone fell silent, staring dumbly at Yang Kai.

Xu Hui and the others jolted in spirit, as if they’d gained a great general. Their eyes lit up as they fixed blazing gazes on Yang Kai’s back, cheering in their hearts.

He admitted it—out loud!

He acknowledged himself as the Sacred Land’s new master before several thousand people.

Xu Hui even felt an urge to laugh to the heavens. He had been working all this time to make Yang Kai feel a sense of belonging to the Sacred Land, but Yang Kai had never loosened his tongue. Though Xu Hui had sensed a shift after he returned from the Yao Realm, only now did his heart settle.

To admit it in front of so many had nailed down the identity of the new Saint Lord; there would be no going back.

In that moment, a great weight lifted from every Sacred Land expert’s heart, Xu Hui included—they were overjoyed, and even the current crisis felt less daunting.

The two beautiful matrons Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong instantly brightened, their eyes sparkling.

Vaguely, they seemed to see the fallen pillar of the Sacred Land rising again to prop up the Nine Peaks’ foundation.

“New Saint Lord?” Zhang Ao’s complexion turned pale. He stared at Yang Kai in disbelief; even War Soul Hall’s Cao Guan knit his brows, his gaze growing colder.

The Netherworld Sect’s Wu Jie gave a soft, eerie chuckle and murmured to himself in a voice no one else could hear, “Interesting—then all our scheming was for nothing… there’s already a new Saint Lord.”

The three forces had gathered and incited experts from all quarters not merely to annihilate the Sacred Land and seize its foundations; what they prized most was the Sacred Land’s legacy.

That legacy could ensure one’s smooth breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—who wouldn’t covet it?

If they captured the Sacred Land and seized An Ling’er, then paired their elite disciple with her, in several decades they could forge a peak expert. By then, their forces could fully rise to stand on par with the Sacred Land.

Thus, when they heard Yang Kai’s claim, both Zhang Ao and Cao Guan couldn’t help the frustration and anger of a prize snatched from under their noses.

“Xu Hui, is this… true?” Zhang Ao demanded, his face twisting.

Xu Hui stepped forward solemnly. “Yes. For over half a year now, our Sacred Land has had a new Saint Lord. We’ve been beset within and without and hadn’t announced it publicly. But with things as they are, we’ll hide it no more.”

At his words, Zhang Ao felt a wave of discouragement.

His chief goal had just collapsed—even if he toppled the Sacred Land, the mysterious legacy would be beyond reach.

Seeing Zhang Ao deflate, Cao Guan hastily sent him a Divine Sense message. Zhang Ao’s eyes lit with sudden heat; he stared at Yang Kai, grinning wickedly.

He had clearly found a new target—if he could seize Yang Kai and An Ling’er, the legacy could still fall into their hands.

The crowd buzzed; many young people envied Yang Kai’s luck. Becoming master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land meant soaring to the heavens in one step. Whatever he had been before—whatever his realm or aptitude—he would now stand above the clouds, looking down on the world as a hegemon.

Envy turned to jealousy; hostile gazes gathered on Yang Kai as if this stroke of luck should have fallen on them—not on some unknown upstart.

Several li away, within one faction’s camp, two women stared unblinking at Yang Kai. One wore a face full of curiosity and doubt; the other’s cheeks were flushed, her breathing quickening—faintly excited.

“Hey, Yun Xuan, why do I feel like this new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land looks like a certain someone?” Ruan Xinyu of the Duao Alliance shouted in Yun Xuan’s ear as if she’d discovered a new continent. “Look—doesn’t he look really similar?”

“It looks alike, but it shouldn’t be him, right?” Yun Xuan bit her red lip. “He should be dead…”

“Who saw him die?” Ruan Xinyu frowned. “We only saw him get taken away.”

“But if he didn’t die, why hasn’t he contacted me all this time?” Yun Xuan said, a little forlorn. A figure she had long missed surfaced in her mind—and that figure gradually overlapped with the new Saint Lord before her, almost identical.

Her maiden heart trembled—could it really be him?

At several li away, Yun Xuan couldn’t see clearly; for the moment she didn’t dare be sure.

Ruan Xinyu snorted. “He must be the sort to flirt everywhere. After toying with you, he threw you aside—why would he come back?”

“Don’t be so loud!” Yun Xuan jumped, sneaking a glance at the two middle-aged men beside her. Lowering her voice, she said, “Don’t let my father hear. He still doesn’t know…”

Ruan Xinyu pouted. “I say it’s definitely him. How could there be two people so alike unless they’re twins? He’s ignored you for so long and you still defend him?”

“I’m not defending him…” Yun Xuan said awkwardly, but her gaze drifted back to Yang Kai; the more she looked, the harder it was to look away.

His figure, his voice, his bearing—every bit matched her memory, and her heart turned faintly sore.

“Dare you go up with me and confirm it?” Ruan Xinyu demanded on her friend’s behalf. “Closer up you should be able to tell, right?”

“Now?”

“Of course now!” With that, Ruan Xinyu seized Yun Xuan and darted toward the other side.

“Xuan’er…” the Duao Alliance’s leader, Yun Cheng, called out. “Where are you going?”

“Alliance Leader, we’re going to watch the fun—we’ll be right back,” Ruan Xinyu called over her shoulder, and in moments they were gone.

Yun Cheng shook his head helplessly, then glanced at the middle-aged man at his side. “Ji Yan, you’ve been watching that new Saint Lord, looking thoughtful. Did you notice something?”

At that, Ji Yan said quickly, “Alliance Leader, do you remember what I reported to you a few years ago?”

“A few years ago?”

“The year my Blazing Fire City was destroyed—the same year you reconciled with the young lady,” Ji Yan said.

“That? Of course I remember.” Yun Cheng nodded slightly. That year, a city under the Duao Alliance had been destroyed with heavy losses. But he felt some joy then too, for his daughter, who hadn’t spoken to him for long, finally returned to his side.

Ji Yan was the City Lord of Blazing Fire City and had been the one to escort Yun Xuan back to Duao City.

“What is it?” Yun Cheng asked, puzzled.

Ji Yan fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, drew a slow breath, and said in a low voice, “Alliance Leader, if I’m not mistaken, this new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is the very young man seized by the Coffin-Bearer back then.”

“What?” Yun Cheng’s face changed. “Can you be sure?”

Ji Yan nodded. “It’s definitely him. Back then he came to Blazing Fire City with the young lady and the others—I remember him well. I think the young lady and her friend must have noticed too; that’s why they want to get closer for a look.”

“Wasn’t he said to be dead?” Yun Cheng realized the gravity of it. Anything touching that mysterious expert, the Coffin-Bearer—if the news spread, the world would be in an uproar.

The Coffin-Bearer has existed for countless years. Everyone wishes to unravel his secrets, but no one has found any leads or even knows where he hides.

If this new Saint Lord really is the one captured back then, he must know more secrets than anyone—perhaps even the Coffin-Bearer’s hiding place.

“We all thought he was dead. But now it seems not only is he alive and well, he’s had great fortune—he’s become master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.”

Yun Cheng’s face twitched; for no reason a pang of regret struck him.

Because this new Saint Lord may once have been a disciple of his Duao Alliance.

“But hasn’t his cultivation progressed a bit too fast?” Ji Yan muttered in awe. “When I saw him back then he was only around the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. It’s been just four or five years, and he’s already at Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm—on par with me. How does one cultivate like that? No wonder the young lady took a liking to him.”
