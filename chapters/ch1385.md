## Chapter 1385 — Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu

The situation tilted heavily in their favor; among the three groups no one even bothered to regard Lu Ye as worth considering. After all, Divine Sense scans showed he possessed only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and yet they were openly discussing how to divide the spoils in front of him.

Anyone able to spend forty million Saint Crystal at an auction would still have some Saint Crystal left on them, and on top of that, the items he’d won were all exceptional treasures — more than enough to divide up.

The three groups all came from humble origins; their forces were at best on par with the Liu Yun Valley that Lu Ye belonged to — small powers. If they’d belonged to a great sect they wouldn’t be doing this sort of murderous looting; cultivators from large factions, constrained by strict sect rules, tend to be more disciplined.

Facing such a fat sheep, everyone salivated; each side fancied themselves stronger and wanted the larger share. In an instant, the three Origin Returning Realm figures began arguing, spit flying as none would yield.

Lu Ye stood there with a cold indifference, entirely calm, as if the people they were talking about were not him at all; instead, impatience slowly crept across his face.

Watching the three grow ever more violent in their bickering, Lu Ye finally lost his patience and snorted coldly, "Worthless trash who accomplish nothing and only cause trouble!"

At those words the three Origin Returning Realm men all turned to him in shock. The Cheng surnamed warrior theatrically scratched his ear and exclaimed, “Kid, what did you just say? Say it again if you’ve the guts.”

"I said you lot are nothing but trash—murdering and looting, and before the man is even cold you’re already debating how to split the profits. Truly laughable. Do you really think you’ve already got Lu cowed?" Lu Ye's mouth curved with a sneer of scorn and contempt.

The Cheng warrior’s face darkened, a feral expression forming. He chuckled low and said, “Two of you, this brat’s asking for death. Since he’s so eager to die, let’s indulge him first, then we can sit down and discuss properly.”

The other two were likewise provoked by Lu Ye’s arrogance; naturally they had no reason to object.

The Cheng warrior sneered, waved his hand and barked, “Cut him into mince! I’ll make him regret being born!”

At his command, many Saint King Realm and Saint Realm cultivators simultaneously unleashed their secret treasures, prepared to strike — when Lu Ye’s expression suddenly shifted into something ghastly. He laughed loudly and coldly: “You lot, thinking you can scheme for my life? In ten-odd thousand years, you are the boldest fools I’ve ever seen!”

“What?” The three Origin Returning Realm men were stunned, an inexplicable unease rising in their chests, as if something ill were about to occur.

After Lu Ye’s mad laughter, he swept his hands and suddenly a series of blood-red beams shot forth, racing toward the cultivators present.

The blood-red lights gave off a strange, living sound, like some creature; everyone’s faces changed and they struck out to defend, but despair followed — whether attacking or defending, none could stop the advance of those crimson rays. Not only the Saint King Realm and Saint Realm cultivators, but even the three Origin Returning Realm men, including the Cheng warrior, were all struck.

The blood-red lights flickered slightly and treated their protective Saint Yuan as nothing, writhing as they plunged directly into their bodies and vanished.

“What is that thing!” the Cheng warrior cried in horror, instinctively stumbling back several paces and hastily releasing his Divine Sense to probe himself.

To his astonishment there was nothing amiss. His Saint Yuan flowed smoothly, his meridians were clear, and his Divine Sense suffered no interference. What had those blood-red lights done?

In all his years of cultivation the Cheng warrior had never encountered anything so strange. Suspicious, he glanced at the other two Origin Returning Realm men and found them just as unsettled; they’d found no useful information either.

After releasing those blood-red rays, Lu Ye stood motionless, watching them with contempt. He snorted in displeasure: “I’d thought I’d draw out some useful folk, but who knew only you three wastes would show. Fine — you’ll still be of some use. From now on you will obey me.”

“Draw out?” The Cheng warrior frowned at his words, pondered a moment, then his face changed: “You were so lavish at the auction to purposely attract people to rob you?”

The other two Origin Returning Realm men heard that and suddenly understood, looking at Lu Ye with some trepidation.

Whatever his true intent, that alone was cause for suspicion, and what those blood-red rays were remained a mystery.

“You have no right to ask questions. Obey my orders, and I’ll spare you. If not…”

“Then what?” The Cheng warrior clearly would not sit idly by — or perhaps he simply did not believe the crimson rays had any uncanny effect; after all, he felt nothing amiss within himself.

Maybe the other party was bluffing, he reassured himself.

“Then your end will be a grim one!” Lu Ye grinned wickedly. No sooner had he finished than the Cheng warrior clutched his head and screamed, a wail like being sliced by a thousand blades, making everyone present recoil in shock.

In barely three breaths the Cheng warrior’s clothes were soaked with sweat; he curled like a shrimp, emitting deep, bestial groans from his throat as pain wracked him. His skin flushed red, as if about to burst apart.

“What did you do to Brother Cheng? What was that thing?” another Origin Returning Realm man’s eyes trembled as he asked in alarm.

It wasn’t only the Cheng warrior who’d been struck — everyone present had been hit. Seeing Brother Cheng’s torment, he felt a sorrow akin to a rabbit’s death making a fox mourn.

“I merely bestowed upon him a Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu; no need for such fuss,” Lu Ye sneered.

“Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu?” They exchanged glances; none had heard of it, but from Brother Cheng’s suffering it was plainly no good.

The middle-aged elder’s expression flickered. Suddenly he pointed and a pitch-black long sword appeared, black qi coiling around it, a faintly bloody aura. The black qi twisted and turned, abruptly forming a one zhang-long black serpent that gaped and lunged at Lu Ye.

He intended to kill Lu Ye outright!

The thought made sense — whatever the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was, it could make Brother Cheng writhe in agony, and clearly it was being manipulated by Lu Ye. The middle-aged elder must also be afflicted by it; to free himself he resolved to kill Lu Ye by surprise.

In his estimation Lu Ye was only a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator. For him to stand there so unperturbed suggested he relied on the strangeness of that Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu.

But even if the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was powerful, once its wielder died wouldn’t it be useless?

The middle-aged elder was decisive; the thought lodged, he struck without warning and with vicious force, unleashing his most powerful secret treasure.

The black serpent lunged at Lu Ye in an instant; a cruel smile curled the elder’s lips as he silently rejoiced.

But the next moment his eyes widened in shock.

To everyone's surprise, Lu Ye reached out and snatched the black serpent as it lunged—seemingly slow but actually swift—and caught it in his palm. The serpent writhed and twisted, struggling desperately to break free of Lu Ye's control, but no matter what it did it could not.

“Impossible!” the elder’s face drained. His treasure was thoroughly sinister; merely touching its black qi would render a Saint King Realm cultivator unconscious, much less being grasped. Yet the other party appeared unperturbed.

The elder was startled, but as an Origin Returning Realm veteran he was experienced in combat. A thought raced through his mind and the black serpent in Lu Ye’s hand suddenly opened its maw, spraying a jet of black venom that struck Lu Ye’s face.

“Let’s see if you die now!” the elder snarled, his face grotesque. Once he finished speaking his mouth could not close again.

He was aghast to find that even after being sprayed the venom caused Lu Ye no harm; only a sizzling sound came from his face. Lu Ye’s expression turned savage, his eyes ice-cold.

Meeting those two eyes, the elder trembled; a chill ran from head to toe.

He sensed the summons of death.

Lu Ye wiped the venom from his face with the other hand and said in a low voice, “I planned to spare you, but you sought your own death. Don’t blame me.”

He stared coldly at the middle-aged elder.

The next instant the elder’s qi and blood surged and his skin reddened as if seared by a hot iron; his body began to bloat.

“No… spare me…” the elder screamed, but before he could finish he exploded — a spray of blood filled the air; no bones remained.

The stench of blood filled the heavens!

The remaining Origin Returning Realm man froze, stupefied, as if plunged into an ice cellar.

What sort of monster had they provoked? A mere Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator who not only shrugged off the elder’s attacks but could with a thought end a life like that — was that something a Saint King Realm could do?

After killing the elder, Lu Ye casually tossed the black serpent to the ground. Without a master it reverted into a black long sword. Leisurely, he took out a silk handkerchief, wiped his face, and then looked at the last Origin Returning Realm man.

That cultivator had the sense to know his fate was sealed. Seeing Lu Ye look his way, he half-kneelted, bowed his head and respectfully said, “I pledge myself to you as my lord. From now on I’ll follow you into fire and water without hesitation!”

When even the Origin Returning Realm bowed thus, the Saint King Realm and Saint Realm cultivators exchanged looks and likewise knelt, swearing fealty.

The Cheng warrior, having endured torment, was both fearful and full of awe toward Lu Ye and had no reason to resist; he too hastily rose and pledged to follow Lu Ye’s side.
