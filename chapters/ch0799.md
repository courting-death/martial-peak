## Chapter 799 — Divine Power

Yang Kai did not open his eyes nor actively probe with his mind, yet the scene of that great battle was transmitted into his consciousness in full.

Soon the battle held his attention completely; he gradually forgot his own pain and focused intently.

Both sides were top-tier experts, and the energy fluctuations unleashed by their every move were unimaginably fierce, truly possessing the power to destroy heaven and earth.

One combatant radiated wild arrogance and brimmed with demonic qi, while the other was a handsome middle-aged man who moved with effortless calm.

The first man's appearance stirred a sense of familiarity in Yang Kai; after a moment his eyes lit up and he understood who that demonic figure was.

The Great Demon God!

The legendary Great Demon God, the mightiest of them all!

Yang Kai had once seen a statue of the Great Demon God in the Small Xuan Realm where the Ancient Demon Clan lived; it was almost identical to the figure before him.

The Great Demon God was a legendary existence—no one could surpass him in his age; he was universally recognized as the world's number one. Under his rule the demon race was mighty, and even the most numerous humans dared not challenge him.

After him, no demon ruler dared call themselves Demon God; they all styled themselves Demon Lord to show reverence to the Great Demon God.

It was said one generation of Demon Lord foolishly declared himself Demon God and was quickly besieged and slain by his followers, showing how influential the Great Demon God remained.

From this it was plain how deep the Great Demon God's impact on the demon race had been.

Judging from the scene, the Great Demon God here was still in his growth stage and not yet at his peak; even so, those who could face him were exceedingly rare.

The middle-aged man must be one qualified to stand against him.

He was the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land at that time—the true body whose bones were later shattered.

Yang Kai felt stirred; he did not know why he could see a battle from so many years ago, but he suspected it was tied to the drop of Demon God's Blood—perhaps it carried the Great Demon God's memory and allowed him to witness these events.

Both the Great Demon God and that Saint Lord were Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivators; this war must have been a peak-level duel.

The war had already been underway when Yang Kai saw it; in their fierce clashes both fought with all their strength.

They fought from ground to sky, from sky into the starry firmament and back down to earth—the scenes changed rapidly. The two were evenly matched, and for a time no victor could be determined.

Yang Kai watched with rapt attention, not the slightest impatience.

Witnessing such a titanic battle was of great benefit to his growth. Young disciples of great powers were often taken to observe high-level fights to glean combat experience and perceive subtleties unattainable in ordinary practice.

What lay before Yang Kai was a rare opportunity.

The combat adaptation and energy deployment of the two fighters made him ponder; he compared them carefully to his own fighting and confirmed lessons for himself.

Time passed and the balance between the two began to shift.

Whether from eagerness to win or some other reason, the Saint Lord's move failed to take effect and he soon fell into the weaker position.

The Great Demon God, wild and seemingly mad, seized the chance to strike viciously.

Yang Kai watched with engrossment; the image then blurred and shifted—likely because the memory carried by that drop of Demon God's Blood was not entirely coherent after so long.

When Yang Kai looked again the battle had been decided: the Saint Lord vomited blood, face pale, and fled like a long rainbow, escaping rapidly from the Great Demon God's presence.

Before departing, he took with him a drop of the Great Demon God's golden blood.

The Great Demon God merely watched his fleeing form coldly and arrogantly without pursuit; after a moment his figure flickered and vanished.

The images in Yang Kai's mind broke off there.

He exhaled and slowly calmed his racing heart.

He had never expected to see the Great Demon God in this way. Since arriving on the Tongxuan Continent he had heard many tales of the man and felt many ties to him.

The Indomitable Golden Body was his bone body, the World-Ending Demon Eye his eye, and even the Wordless Black Book had been crafted by him—unfortunately he had long since passed, and Yang Kai had no chance to meet him in life.

Now Yang Kai could count himself fortunate.

The wealth left by the Great Demon God had aided Yang Kai's growth greatly, but Yang Kai resolved he would not be bound to that path; instead he believed he could reach places the Great Demon God never reached and surpass his accomplishments.

Only by doing so could he prove that all he possessed was not merely arranged by the Great Demon God.

After watching the battle Yang Kai finally understood the truth about that coffin.

The extensive damage to that generation's Saint Lord's bones was likely inflicted by the Great Demon God; after that battle the Saint Lord returned to the Sacred Land and died soon after, leaving behind the Demon God Golden Blood out of lingering resentment.

Unexpectedly, that drop would pique Yang Kai's curiosity today, allowing him to obtain the Demon God Golden Blood and witness the fierce clash.

In the Sacred Tomb Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes; the darkness that had filled the place had passed, returning to a gloomy atmosphere.

He felt his body and was surprised.

Though his body bore many injuries, his strong regenerative power made them trivial. What concerned him was that after fusing with that drop of Demon God Golden Blood his blood had noticeably changed.

Golden blood flowed more abundantly, and the murderous demonic qi stored in his Indomitable Golden Body had become purer.

Vaguely, he even comprehended a Divine Art belonging to the Great Demon God!

Incarnation Technique!

By using a soul imprint and infusing it with immense soul energy via a special method, one could nourish and form another soul, which could then enter another vessel and become an Incarnation apart from the true body.

Depending on the refinement of the Incarnation, it could possess various true-body abilities; the strongest could wield eighty percent of the original's power or more.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he recalled the Incarnation of Demon General Meng Ge he had encountered in his world.

In that Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, not knowing the full story, Yang Kai used the Locking Demon Chain to kill Meng Ge’s Incarnation, which had even threatened him at the time.

Only after coming to the Tongxuan Continent did Yang Kai understand Meng Ge's true nature and his strength.

Thus Meng Ge had likely used a crude form of the Incarnation Technique to appear in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, but compared to the Great Demon God's method it was lacking.

Meng Ge's Incarnation was simply too weak.

Yang Kai guessed Meng Ge might have come by some texts left by the Great Demon God and gleaned a few clues, but he wasn't very proficient, and what he practiced wasn't the genuine method.

Creating a Soul Incarnation brought further benefits: once a second soul existed in the Sea of Consciousness, both souls would train simultaneously and Divine Sense growth could effectively double.

Of course the initial cost was enormous; constructing a Soul Incarnation required vast Divine Sense energy.

For Yang Kai this was no issue—his Warm Spirit Lotus constantly nourished his soul, and his Divine Sense could be replenished at any time.

Looking around, the Sacred Tomb lay in ruin; it seemed that by entering here he had destroyed this Small Xuan Realm entirely.

From now on, any future Saint Lord entering here would gain no benefit and could no longer be brainwashed by their predecessors.

Yang Kai felt a pang of embarrassment. Though Xu Hui and the others had forced him here, the Sacred Tomb was a foundational site of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; if they learned he had destroyed it, they would not easily let him go.

At minimum they would insist he accept the Saint Lord position before letting matters rest.

Besides, the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring now bore his soul imprint.

Yang Kai's head ached; he knew he was likely trapped unless he turned against the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Sighing, he did not hurry to leave the tomb. Instead he stayed to practice the Great Demon God's Incarnation Technique.

In his Sea of Consciousness he condensed his soul imprint and, using that special method, poured Divine Sense energy into it to nourish and build his Soul Incarnation.

The Divine Sense consumption was enormous; even with Warm Spirit Lotus replenishment it was insufficient. Fortunately his Black Book Space stocked many pills to restore Divine Sense.

There were also the Wan Yao Ling Ye series of elixirs, so he need not worry about supplements.

Time passed quickly.

The Sacred Tomb was sunless, and Yang Kai preferred to remain within, hoping time would cause Xu Hui and the others to forget him, so he stayаed and cultivated.

Only when the Incarnation Technique reached a modest fruition and another soul appeared in his Sea did Yang Kai stop his practice.

The rest no longer required his close attention; over time the Soul Incarnation would strengthen, though it would lack consciousness and emotion; when it matured he would find a suitable vessel to place it in and thus create an Incarnation.

Such an Incarnation would have no independent will, but Yang Kai could command it to go where he could not, which might prove unexpectedly useful.

Standing slowly, Yang Kai cast his mind about in search of the Sacred Tomb's exit.
