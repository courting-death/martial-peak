## Chapter 710 — Persuasion

Zhai Yao once again brought up that mysterious teacher of his, which left Yang Kai very curious; he had no clear idea what sort of expert this could be, and he also knew that asking directly would most likely get him nowhere.

“I have three senior uncles and an aunt at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm who can escort me to Wangtian Cliff. What about you, Brother Zhai?” Yang Kai continued to ask.

“Ao Gu will probably lend me a few Transcendent Realm experts; I don’t know exactly how many. But if we cooperate, our chances are very good. The initial fighting will be between Transcendent Realm experts, but once we reach Wangtian Cliff it will be a battle of alchemists. Heh heh — alchemists aren’t particularly powerful. At that point the two of us can easily seize the Thousand-Year Demon Flower.” Zhai Yao jeered.

“Then it’s settled. When the flower blooms, we move together.” Yang Kai nodded heavily, set down the condensed medicinal liquid in his hand and slowly raised one hand.

Zhai Yao stared in disbelief. “That fast?”

By the time those words were spoken, Yang Kai had already finished condensing all the medicinal materials.

The old men on the high dais who had been watching were plainly stunned as well; they seemed unable to believe it.

Before they could recover, in the next moment Zhai Yao hurriedly raised his hand too, only a fraction of an instant after Yang Kai.

Immediately a Saint-Grade alchemist descended from the high dais, flew down to stand before Yang Kai and Zhai Yao, inspected the medicinal liquids, and with a strange expression loudly announced their results.

Du Wan sat on the high dais chuckling, stroking his beard as if he had long expected this scene, his face the picture of calm. His old heart was gratified.

His old friends suddenly could not sit still. One yellow-faced elder said, “Brother Du, where did you find these two little monsters? Their speed at condensing medicinal liquids rivals our own.”

“Heh heh, that’s a secret.” Du Wan smiled and shook his head. “You all should brace yourselves to be slaughtered.”

The faces of several elders darkened instantly as they realized Du Wan had clearly been confident of victory from the start, while they had blindly fallen into his trap.

But they had been old friends for years, and at this moment none of them would renege on a bet. The contents of a Spatial Pouch would not be transferred either.

On the contrary, the appearance of two outstanding young alchemists was precisely what they had hoped to see; it showed that this generation still held much promise.

In the first contest, hundreds were eliminated — more than half — those unable to condense all their medicinal materials into liquids within the allotted time, or those who failed too many times during the condensation.

Mi Na successfully advanced to the second round and was ecstatic.

After the first event concluded, they moved directly into the second contest — inscribing spirit formations.

Using the Mystery-Grade Middle-Level furnace inside the Spatial Pouch, the contestants were to inscribe the spirit formations they themselves mastered into the furnace. There was no time limit for this event; the more and the more complex the formations inscribed into the furnace, the better the score.

Yang Kai and Zhai Yao easily took first place.

The third event tested the control of the fireplay.

The fourth tested the configuration of medicinal materials.

The fifth, the sixth...

Only at the very end did they finally compete in pill refinement.

With no time to rest, the entire Alchemical Competition was completed in a single day, and by the end only Yang Kai and Zhai Yao remained.

Mi Na was eliminated during the fourth event and was inevitably a little downcast, but at her age reaching that far was already remarkable; after receiving a few words of praise from Elder Du, her spirits were immediately lifted.

In full view of everyone, during the final contest Zhai Yao willingly conceded and did not compete directly with Yang Kai.

He knew that if they fought in earnest, he was not Yang Kai’s match. Though their alchemical attainments were close, there was still a little gap.

Zhai Yao did not want to expose his and Yang Kai’s true alchemical levels before so many people. The earlier contests were scattered events that did not reveal much; once they actually refined pills, their differences would be exposed.

Their speed and methods of refining were far too unusual.

The people from the Alchemists' Association were also stunned; they had not expected Zhai Yao to forgo such an excellent opportunity. Once they perceived his indifferent attitude, they relaxed.

“Brother Yang, see you another day. I’ve been out gallivanting all day; I’ll head back first, or my teacher will scold me.” Zhai Yao said this and then, under the protection of two black-armored Transcendent Realm bodyguards, walked toward the City Lord’s Mansion.

Liu Fu ascended the high dais, announced Yang Kai as the final winner of the competition, and on the spot distributed the rewards promised by the Alchemists' Council.

A Spatial Pouch filled with rare medicinal ingredients, and a Saint-Grade-level alchemical furnace.

Countless people looked on enviously.

Yang Kai casually flung that Saint-Grade furnace to Mi Na; the young girl was so excited she seemed ready to kiss him twice.

“Young friend Yang, come over here.” Du Wan called with a smile from a corner of the dais.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and walked over.

“Little one, who is your teacher?”

“Do you want to come to my Sanchuan City’s Alchemists' Association? It is far richer than Giant Stone City, with many beauties as well.”

“Following Du Wan is no future — that old fellow is half-buried and about to die. Come to our place instead.”

As soon as they reached that spot, the elders beside Du Wan began chattering and clamoring, their eyes full of desire as they looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was startled; the enthusiasm of those old men and women was so intense they nearly surrounded him completely.

“You old things, have you no shame?” Du Wan shouted. “Do you really think I’m dead? You dare to poach in front of me? Whoever dares say another word, I’ll fight them to the death!”

“Du Wan, spare us the theatrics; you’re just a bunch of old bones. Don’t pull a muscle in your back.” Someone laughed loudly.

“You’re not exactly young yourself.” Du Wan snorted.

“I am grateful for the seniors’ kindness,” Yang Kai considered for a moment and performed a polite bow, “but I have no intention of devoting my life to alchemy. I intend to plumb the extremes of martial Dao; studying alchemy is merely to better research martial arts. Therefore I must decline your generous offers.”

The elders were dumbstruck, mouths agape as they stared at Yang Kai; even Du Wan was taken aback.

“You want to pursue martial Dao? With such alchemical talent you want to chase martial Dao? Young man, do you not realize what advantages you possess?”

“Yes, this is simply squandering heaven’s gifts. If you want to protect someone, you should advance in alchemy even more. Once your alchemist rank rises, there is nothing in the world you cannot obtain — wealth, power, fame, status, beauties; name your desire and it will be yours. And you won’t need to lift a finger; just spread a word and someone will handle it for you.”

“Becoming an alchemical master brings innumerable benefits. Wherever you go you will be treated with courtesy. Even if you venture into the Demon Domain or the Yao Realm, those demons and yao won’t harm you — they’ll treat you as an honored guest.”

The group of elders took turns imploring Yang Kai, painting for him the many bright prospects of becoming an alchemist, hoping to change his mind.

“I only wish to ascend to the peak of martial Dao!” Yang Kai said sternly, his face resolute and his gaze steady.

The crowd fell silent.

The peak of martial Dao — this was indeed something alchemy could not achieve.

Feeling Yang Kai’s conviction and determination, the elders all sighed, thinking that he was wasting his talent.

“Du Wan, take some time to speak with this young man properly. He’s headstrong now and may not see his future clearly,” the elder who had earlier invited Yang Kai to Sanchuan City murmured into Du Wan’s ear.

Du Wan nodded lightly. “I’ll talk with him if there’s an opportunity.”

Du Wan apparently also felt that, given Yang Kai’s potential, pursuing the endless, indistinct path of martial Dao was less promising than specializing further in alchemy.

Clearing his throat, Du Wan said, “Let’s not discuss that matter for now. Young Friend Yang having his own goals is a good thing; young men must have pursuits.”

Worried the elders’ preaching might have the opposite effect, he quickly changed the subject: “A bet’s a bet — are you all ready?”

The old men’s faces darkened and they ground their teeth at Du Wan. “You old fox!”

Though they said this, each of them took out their Spatial Pouches and tossed them to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai reached out to catch them, and in an instant his hands were holding four or five Spatial Pouches.

“Heh heh, who told you all to be so confident?” Du Wan laughed madly and gestured to Yang Kai. “Young friend, don’t be polite. Take whatever you like. After all, the contents of their Spatial Pouches weren’t earned by them through hard work.”

“Then… I won’t be polite.” Yang Kai grinned. Under the nervous scrutiny of those elders, he opened his Divine Sense and carefully examined the Spatial Pouches in his hand.

The expression on Yang Kai’s face changed after he inspected the first Spatial Pouch.

As expected of a Saint-Grade alchemist’s Spatial Pouch, everything inside was top-quality — at minimum Spirit-Grade Lower-Level: pills, herbs, cultivation methods, secret treasures — nothing missing, with even some Saint-Grade items among them.

There were also some strange, exotic materials whose purposes he could not discern.

Whatever they were, each emitted powerful energy fluctuations.

Yang Kai’s eyes swam at the sight; having confirmed that this Spatial Pouch contained nothing he urgently needed, he found himself momentarily unable to choose.

“Hurry up and choose, youngster. I’m getting nervous; you’re taking so long I can’t hold on,” the owner of that Spatial Pouch urged with a wry face.

“Elder Du, I can only take one item, right?” Yang Kai asked Du Wan reluctantly.

“Yes, that’s the terms of my wager with my old friends.” Du Wan nodded lightly, then suddenly smiled slyly. “But my friends are generous and favor promising juniors, so I don’t think it matters if you take more than one. Isn’t that right, Brother Chang?”

Saying this, he beamed his smile at the owner of the Spatial Pouch.
