## Chapter 1887 — Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye

At those words, the Lord of the Blood Jiao nodded, ready to descend and finish Yang Kai, but from the pit below Yang Kai somehow crawled up, brushed the dust from his body with both hands, leapt lightly out of the ground, drew a shallow breath, and said, "Lord of the Blood Jiao, your reputation is well-deserved; in this world, judged by body and strength alone, there are probably few who could best you."

Qian Yan's silver eyes abruptly contracted as he stared at Yang Kai; his Divine Sense swept over him again and immediately discovered a piece of information that made him shudder with terror: although Yang Kai looked battered and was covered in dust, there were absolutely no traces of injury.

How could that be? Qian Yan almost wished he could take his own eyeballs out and set them on Yang Kai to examine him closely.

An assault as fierce as Xue Jiao's just now — even if he had taken it, he would not have come out whole; at the very least he would have lost half his life. The other party was also a Second Stage of the Void King Realm — how could he be unharmed?

His Divine Sense had found no sign that Yang Kai was wearing any armor, and when he had traded blows with Xue Jiao earlier, Yang Kai had not used any protective secret treasure...

This human had withstood Xue Jiao's full onslaught with his bare body and yet remained unscathed? Could his flesh be even stronger than Xue Jiao's when he used the Jiao Transformation Technique?

The thought roiled up and Qian Yan could no longer remain calm; a terrifying notion surfaced, causing his silver eyes to tremble.

On the other side, Xue Jiao gaped and stared at Yang Kai like a fool, entirely losing the ability to think — gone was the arrogant complacency from moments before.

"But if that's all there is, it's still not enough!" Yang Kai said, looking up and casually gazing at the sky.

Xue Jiao opened his maw as if to speak, but found whatever words he could utter felt pale and powerless.

In his proudest Domain, to be so scorned by a human sent Xue Jiao into turmoil; only blood, he felt, could wash away this shame!

"Lord of Blood Jiao, you haven't used your full strength yet, have you? It's rare to encounter a body with such tremendous physical power — I hope you'll... play with me properly!" Yang Kai said.

As those last words left his mouth, Yang Kai's body shot into the sky like a cannonball.

Before reaching Xue Jiao, a faint golden halo shimmered around him. This pale gold was not the color of his Golden Blood but the golden sword-qi of the Undying Five Elements Sword.

The golden sword-qi clung to him, making Yang Kai look like an unparalleled ferocious sword drawn from its scabbard, tearing through the sky as he thrust toward Xue Jiao.

Before the attack landed, Xue Jiao felt his pores involuntarily contract; chill ran through his body. Alarmed, he roared and unleashed his qi-and-blood power, his whole body flushing crimson as he smashed a fist at Yang Kai.

A clang rang out.

The golden light that Yang Kai had become faltered slightly and he stepped back several paces, yet this exchange forced Xue Jiao to stagger back as well; the expression on his face no longer carried the earlier easy confidence, and he could not fully suppress Yang Kai.

Drip, drip...

A few rhythmic, subtle sounds issued forth — the sound of blood dropping from Xue Jiao's fist.

From that clash, Xue Jiao had been wounded!

The golden sword-qi was razor-sharp and cut all; though Yang Kai had not refined the Undying Five Elements Sword to its supreme level, he had achieved a small mastery — once the golden sword-qi unleashed, it instantly turned the tide.

"Is that all!" Xue Jiao, though shaken by Yang Kai's method, could not lose face; he flicked the blood from his hand and sneered.

"Is that so?" Yang Kai grinned. "Then please, Lord of Blood Jiao, watch closely."

As the words fell, another halo appeared around him, different from the earlier gold — it was earth-yellow.

Earth sword-qi!

Earth is weighty; earth sword-qi could form a sword-qi shield-wall and serve as powerful protection. Among the Five Elements, Earth generates Metal — when the earth sword-qi emerged it resonated with the golden sword-qi, not dulling the metal's edge but instead enhancing it.

Two colors of light wrapped Yang Kai; in a flash he was before Xue Jiao, coldly watching him. He raised his hand in a palm-saber strike and slashed down.

Xue Jiao's eyelids narrowed and he lifted his arms to block across his chest.

The palm-saber cut through, blood spattered; Xue Jiao low-roared and retreated continuously. Two one-chi-long wounds suddenly appeared on his arms, blood gushing like fountains and instantly dyeing his garments red.

The wounds were deep enough to expose bone; flesh curled outward in a grisly sight.

Pain drove Xue Jiao into near madness; fury consumed him and he roared, "Kid, don't get too arrogant!"

Yao had this flaw — once enraged they slowly lost reasoning and acted on instinct. Even though Xue Jiao was a lord-level powerhouse, this trait buried in his bones had not changed; only that compared to ordinary yao he could better restrain his emotions.

And now, after using the Jiao Transformation Technique and yet being struck twice by Yang Kai, he was ashamed and furious.

In a blur he transformed into a blood-red jiao, scales covering his body, over ten zhang long; his copper-bell-like blood-red eyes widened as he glared at Yang Kai, and when his maw opened a blood-colored pillar of light burst forth and charged straight at Yang Kai.

"Blood Jiao body!" Up in the clouds, Ba He’s eyes narrowed sharply. He had never expected that even after Yang Kai overextended himself and was completely forced into a disadvantage, he could still drive Xue Jiao to such a degree.

The Jiao Transformation Technique was a means for Xue Jiao to boost his strength, but it merely stimulated some ancestral-blood power; Blood Jiao body, however, had truly been fully triggered, reverting to Xue Jiao race's form from tens of thousands of years ago.

Forcing Xue Jiao to reveal this form meant only one thing — the fight had already reached a life-and-death pitch.

The blood-colored pillar smashed forward like a thing that destroyed the old and opened the new, aimed at Yang Kai's face, thick and immense; if it struck him he would likely be swallowed entirely.

Inside that blood pillar there was not only a nauseating stench but also unparalleled corrosive power; even a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert struck by it would fare poorly.

Yang Kai still did not dodge, but softly shouted, "Water, come!"

As the words fell, a layer of azure light appeared and wrapped his whole body.

That azure color was like the sea; the force surrounding Yang Kai was not vast but it felt utterly reliable, as if he stood within an ocean and no matter how the outside raged he remained immovably steady.

The blood-colored pillar came as expected, tearing through the sky and submerging Yang Kai.

Xue Jiao's eyes blazed with ferocity as he stared fixedly ahead, sensing Yang Kai's life fluctuations.

Suddenly he seemed to notice something unbelievable; his eyes widened and he shouted, "Bad!"

With Xue Jiao in that transformed body, the shout sounded like thunder and swept across heaven and earth.

No sooner had he spoken than a figure burst out of the blood pillar in the opposite direction, treating the mighty pillar as nothing and with a ferocious punch smashing toward Xue Jiao's enormous head!

Who else could that figure be if not Yang Kai?

Only now Yang Kai's exterior was not wrapped in three colors but four.

In addition to the original gold, earth-yellow and azure, there glowed a layer of fiery red, like burning flame leaping and rolling.

His momentum rose by more than tenfold compared to before!

It seemed that as the colors around him multiplied, his strength unsealed step by step, as if without end.

Boom...

The fist struck Xue Jiao's head; a miserable cry echoed through the clouds and Xue Jiao's huge body was driven backward by that force, his agonized wails continuous.

He retreated more than ten li before barely steadying his frame, but on his giant head a charred fist-print appeared; around that print small flames burned, and no matter how Xue Jiao summoned his qi-and-blood power he could not extinguish those flames.

"What fire is this!" Xue Jiao cried in panic.

"Sun's True Fire!" Yang Kai grinned.

At the words, Xue Jiao's countenance changed drastically.

Sun's True Fire — that flame born in the core of a burning sun in the Starry Sky, together with the Nirvana Fire possessed by the Ancient Divine Spirit True Phoenix, ranked as the world's two divine flames; they could burn all things. Once tainted by such a divine flame, unless it was extinguished by a correspondingly ranked water-attribute treasure or refined into the body, it could not be removed.

Despair showed in Xue Jiao's eyes as the Sun's True Fire that clung to his head suddenly flared and enveloped his enormous body.

Screams rose in succession; Xue Jiao seemed to undergo torments beyond imagination.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he felt no triumph at defeating an equal expert, instead staring oddly at Xue Jiao being consumed by Sun's True Fire. After a long moment he smiled in surprise, "So that's how it is!"

"Looks like you've realized it," Qian Yan's voice suddenly sounded at his ear. The instant it rang, Xue Jiao being burned by Sun's True Fire turned into a silver light and dispersed into the air.

Yang Kai turned toward the sound and saw not far off Xue Jiao hovering unharmed in midair, though both his eyes were full of fear; beside him, the Thousand-Eyed Lord also looked at Yang Kai with a grave expression.

"When did you strike me? I didn't perceive it," Yang Kai asked Qian Yan with interest.

Not long before he had thought Xue Jiao had been hit, but the instant the Sun's True Fire had burned he had suddenly seen the truth.

What had been burned was not Xue Jiao's true body but his own hallucination.

Only one person present could silently cast an illusion on him without his noticing — the Thousand-Eyed Lord!

"Do you think I'll tell you?" Qian Yan said in a low voice.

Yang Kai snorted, "When I was wrapped by the blood pillar, I suppose. The Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye truly lives up to its name. I’ll remember this lesson well."
