## Chapter 2324 — Illusory Array Valley

After receiving Yang Kai's definite answer, Chai Hu no longer hesitated. He immediately swallowed an antidote pill, while Chi Yue and the others stood by to help him dissolve the medicinal effects, each of them extremely tense.

On another mountain peak about three hundred li from Thousand Leaves Sect's main peak stood a grand hall.

In a side room of the hall, Shi Cangying stood with his hands behind his back, his expression gloomy as he listened to a disciple's report.

After a moment, he finally spoke: "You say those outsiders have moved into the main hall?"

The disciple replied respectfully, "Vice Sect Master, it is indeed so."

"Have there been any signs of them going out in the past two days?"

"I haven't seen any, but the Sect Master did go out once."

"Were you able to find out why they came here?" Shi Cangying asked again.

The disciple said, "This disciple is incompetent and hasn't found any clues yet, but..."

"But what?"

"But I heard that the one called Yang Kai is highly skilled in alchemy. He was the one who refined the Supreme Mystic Pill in the Four Seasons Land back then, and is a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemy Master. I suspect their visit is related to alchemy."

"Alchemy!" A sharp light flashed in Shi Cangying's eyes as he nodded slightly. "That is possible. Ye Hen is already quite old, and his cultivation has stalled. Perhaps he wants to try something with pills. But if it's just alchemy, why does Ye Hen value that boy so much, even at the cost of my face?"

The disciple said, "Is it possible... that the boy surnamed Yang still has the Supreme Mystic Pill?"

He was just making a casual guess, but when Shi Cangying heard this, his whole body trembled and a sharp light burst from his eyes.

Come to think of it, Ye Hen is now at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, exactly the time when he needs the Supreme Mystic Pill. If Yang Kai really has such a heaven-defying pill, then everything makes sense.

Every Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator would covet such a Spiritual Pill. It's a peerless pill that can help a martial artist ascend to the Emperor Realm. Ye Hen must know something, which is why he's so polite to that boy, even disregarding himself.

Thinking of this, Shi Cangying's heart burned with desire.

He too was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, with no hope of ascending in sight. If he could obtain the Supreme Mystic Pill, perhaps he could glimpse the Great Dao in a short time, rise in a single leap, and become a leader among men!

"Vice Sect Master, there is one more thing..." The disciple saw Shi Cangying had been silent for a long time and spoke again.

"What is it?" Shi Cangying asked.

"I heard that Tianzhao Palace and Heavenly Extreme Hall are making some moves, seemingly to the detriment of our Thousand Leaves Sect!"

Shi Cangying's body trembled. He turned to the disciple and said, "Is this information reliable?"

The disciple said, "It's just some rumors. I don't know the details."

"Go investigate! Find out the truth of this news at all costs. If there is any sign of trouble, report immediately!" Shi Cangying said in a flustered tone.

If Heavenly Extreme Hall and Tianzhao Palace really intended to turn against Thousand Leaves Sect, with Thousand Leaves Sect's current strength there would be no way to resist. Either of those sects was no weaker than Thousand Leaves Sect, especially Tianzhao Palace. It's said that the Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, Qiu Ze, has been trying to break through to the Emperor Realm for years, but has never succeeded. If he managed to ascend, the power structure within a million li would be reshuffled. All sects would have to live or die at Tianzhao Palace's whim.

As soon as he heard these two sects might act against Thousand Leaves Sect, Shi Cangying panicked. After the disciple left, he continued to pace anxiously in the side room.

After a long while, he suddenly stopped, a cold light flashing in his eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, "Ye Hen, oh Ye Hen, you really are muddle-headed. Since you insist on inviting wolves into the house and won't listen to my advice, don't blame me for disregarding our years of friendship. I must also plan for Thousand Leaves Sect's future. The ancestral foundation cannot be ruined in your hands, or how could I face the ancestors in the underworld!"

As he spoke, it seemed he had made up his mind, his gaze becoming resolute.

Shortly after, he moved his Divine Sense and summoned several trusted disciples, secretly instructing them. The disciples quickly left after receiving their orders.

……

On the third day after Yang Kai and the others moved into Thousand Leaves Sect, Chai Hu's condition had improved considerably.

After taking the antidote pill, the poison in his body was not completely removed, but it no longer constantly eroded his dantian and meridians as before. As long as he continued to take pills as Yang Kai instructed, the toxins would be completely eliminated in half a month.

Chai Hu was naturally extremely grateful to Yang Kai.

As for Chi Yue and the others, they didn't say much. They all came from the same Star Domain, and were already closely bound to each other. Chai Hu was their sworn brother, so he was also Yang Kai's elder. Lending a hand was only natural.

Yang Kai was also very glad that Chi Yue and the others had managed to befriend Chai Hu in the Star Realm. According to what they told him, if Chai Hu hadn't helped them over the past two years, their lives in the Star Realm would not have gone so smoothly.

And in order to rescue Chi Yue, Chai Hu had even risked his life. Even knowing the chances of success were slim, he still resolutely snuck into the City Lord’s mansion, without any regard for the dangers he might face.

Facts proved that if Yang Kai hadn't happened to be there, Chai Hu would have surely died without a burial place.

He was clearly a man of deep feeling and loyalty.

Friends and brothers like this—one in a lifetime is enough! Yang Kai was truly happy for Chi Yue and the others.

On the third day, while Yang Kai was meditating, he heard light footsteps outside the door that soon stopped at the threshold.

Before the visitor could knock, Yang Kai waved his hand to open the door and saw Ye Qinghan standing outside.

Their eyes met, and Ye Qinghan softly called, "Young Master Yang."

"Come in and talk," Yang Kai invited.

Ye Qinghan nodded and stepped inside.

Once inside, Ye Qinghan found a chair and sat down, then asked, "Has Young Master Yang been comfortable these past few days?"

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "Miss Ye, you didn't come here just to ask that, did you?"

Seeing that Yang Kai seemed to have guessed her purpose, Ye Qinghan blushed and didn't know how to respond.

Yang Kai said, "Miss Ye, please lead the way."

Ye Qinghan was delighted to hear this and asked, "Young Master Yang, is there anything else you need to take care of?"

Yang Kai said, "What else is there? I came here for that secret realm. Hasn't Thousand Leaves Sect prepared yet?"

"No, no!" Ye Qinghan quickly waved her hand. "Thousand Leaves Sect is ready at any time. Father has been waiting for you. Please follow me."

As she spoke, she immediately led the way ahead.

Following Ye Qinghan as she flew through the Chiyue Mountains, they soon arrived at the entrance of a valley. The scenery was beautiful, with birds singing and flowers blooming everywhere.

Upon arriving, Yang Kai couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, staring intently at the scenery within the valley, a strange light flashing in his eyes.

He instinctively felt something was off about this valley, but couldn't quite put his finger on it.

Ye Qinghan explained, "There is an illusory array here, set up by one of Thousand Leaves Sect's ancestors. Please wait a moment, Young Master Yang. I'll send a message to my father to have the restriction lifted."

So it was an illusory array! Only then did Yang Kai understand why he had felt something was off.

His strength was considerable now, and his Divine Sense was extremely powerful, but even with his cultivation, he couldn't see through the mysteries of this array at a glance. Clearly, the one who set up this array was an Emperor Realm expert. Only an Emperor Realm expert could have such means.

Realizing this, Yang Kai became interested, sending his Divine Sense back and forth through the valley, trying to glimpse its secrets.

But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't see through it at all.

The illusory array covering the entire valley seemed completely seamless, without the slightest flaw.

This truly amazed Yang Kai.

Thousand Leaves Sect had been in decline for many years, so this array must have existed for countless years. Yet even after so long, it still stood firm, proving that the one who set it up not only had extraordinary cultivation, but also a profound understanding of arrays far beyond ordinary people.

Meanwhile, Ye Qinghan carefully released her Divine Sense to check the surroundings. After confirming no one was nearby, she took out a Transmission Compass and poured her Divine Sense into it, clearly sending a message to Ye Hen.

Shortly after, the air in front of her suddenly rippled, like a stone dropped into a calm lake.

Seeing this, Ye Qinghan solemnly said, "Young Master Yang, please follow me closely. Do not take a single wrong step, or you will trigger the killing array in this valley."

"I understand," Yang Kai nodded.

Ye Qinghan took a step forward, her whole body seeming to merge into the air wall, and soon disappeared.

Yang Kai followed in her direction, stepping forward, and in the next moment, the scenery before his eyes changed dramatically.

It was still a valley, but unlike the beautiful scenery before, it was now utterly desolate, not a blade of grass growing—a complete wasteland.

Ye Qinghan was standing ahead, waiting quietly. When she saw Yang Kai enter the array, she nodded slightly to him and led the way forward with light steps.

She had clearly entered many times before and was thoroughly familiar with the safe route through the array, stepping forward with precision and confidence.

She had worried Yang Kai might have trouble keeping up, so she slowed her pace, but after a while realized he was following easily, and immediately picked up speed.

Yang Kai continued to follow Ye Qinghan closely, not falling behind in the slightest, like a shadow.

They walked through the illusory array for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, before the path suddenly opened up, revealing a huge platform. The platform was clearly man-made, with signs of carving, but it exuded an ancient aura, obviously passed down for generations.

At this moment, Thousand Leaves Sect's Sect Master, Ye Hen, was standing beside the platform, his face full of loneliness and shame.

Hearing the sound, Ye Hen turned and saw his daughter bringing Yang Kai over. He quickly cupped his fists and said, "Young Master Yang."
