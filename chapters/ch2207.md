## Chapter 2207 — Divine Roaming Mirror

At the same time, in a side room of the palace atop Ten Thousand Saints Peak, Yang Kai appeared mysteriously.

Regaining control of himself, Yang Kai immediately assumed a guarded stance and looked around.

Not far ahead, Wen Zishan lounged lazily in a chair, smiling as he gazed at him.

"Uh... Greetings, Hall Master Wen!" Yang Kai straightened his expression and cupped his fists in salute.

Wen Zishan nodded and said, "No need for formalities."

As he spoke, he stood up, strolled to the table, picked up a wine cup, then lifted a jar of wine and filled it to the brim.

In an instant, the room was filled with a fragrant aroma.

He took a light sip, savoring it with a look of endless enjoyment.

Watching this, Yang Kai's mouth twitched slightly, but he didn't disturb him and simply waited quietly.

After a long while, Wen Zishan finally seemed to return from his pleasant reverie, his face full of satisfaction as he spoke, "You should know why I called you here, right?"

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before saying, "I heard some guesses from Brother Xia."

"Heh." Wen Zishan chuckled. "You’re quite cautious, boy! Mm... I did call you here to reward you. Although you made a request of this Lord a few days ago, that alone isn’t enough to offset your contributions to the Shrine. But since you’re not a disciple of my Shrine, just an outsider, this matter of rewards puts this Lord in a bit of a bind. I’ve thought it over for a long time..."

"I don’t ask for much," Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

Wen Zishan said, "What kind of reward do you want? Feel free to say it—if it’s possible, this Lord can grant it!"

He handed the initiative to Yang Kai.

This approach seemed generous and open, but Yang Kai knew exactly what was going on.

After all, he was only a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator, while Wen Zishan was a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm—he was even the head of a Sect!

So, things that were extremely precious and rare to Yang Kai might be utterly ordinary in Wen Zishan’s eyes. If Yang Kai named his own reward, Wen Zishan might easily fulfill it.

Yang Kai wasn’t that foolish. With such a rare opportunity, he naturally wouldn’t let it slip by.

He simply said, "What kind of reward can Hall Master Wen give me?"

Hearing this, Wen Zishan showed an approving look. As their eyes met, everything was understood without words.

After a moment of silence, Wen Zishan said, "Based on the number of Star Seals you handed over, this Lord can make the decision to open the Treasure Vault of the Shrine and let you choose any three items to take out!"

Yang Kai’s eyes immediately lit up.

Wen Zishan was referring to the Treasure Vault of Qingyang Shrine, not his personal collection. As one of the top Sects in the Southern Territory, Qingyang Shrine’s Treasure Vault naturally contained countless rare treasures. If Yang Kai could enter and take three items, it might allow his strength to soar by leaps and bounds.

Just as Yang Kai was moved by this, Wen Zishan added in an enticing tone, "Within the Treasure Vault, there are countless Secret Treasures, and even two Imperial Treasures. But as for what those Imperial Treasures are and where they are hidden, you’ll have to find out for yourself—I won’t tell you. Besides that, there are all sorts of rare Spiritual Pills and miraculous medicines, secret manuals never shared with outsiders. With your cultivation, you can choose any of them. Each is a tremendous opportunity. Furthermore, there are also many insights and experiences from Emperor Realm experts..."

Yang Kai’s breathing gradually quickened.

He truly hadn’t expected Wen Zishan to be so generous with him.

No matter what, he was still an outsider, yet Wen Zishan was willing to open the Treasure Vault to him. This alone was enough to make Yang Kai deeply grateful.

However... as precious as these things were, they still couldn’t make Yang Kai decide immediately. He didn’t care for Imperial Treasures, he could refine Spiritual Pills himself, and he didn’t particularly need secret manuals—he wouldn’t have time to cultivate them anyway. Instead, it was the insights and experiences of Emperor Realm experts that tempted him a little.

These things could help him save a lot of time and avoid many detours.

Seeing his changing expression, Wen Zishan was a bit surprised and asked, "What’s wrong? None of these things interest you?"

Yang Kai took a deep breath and said, "Please forgive me, Hall Master Wen. I just... don’t know how to decide."

Wen Zishan smiled and said, "This Lord understands. Mm, if none of these things catch your eye, how about this Lord personally teaching you a divine secret art?"

Yang Kai looked up at him and asked in a deep voice, "Hall Master Wen, may I ask what kind of reward Brother Xia and the others will receive this time? Is it also entering the Treasure Vault and choosing any three items?"

As soon as he said this, Wen Zishan’s smile became meaningful. He pointed at Yang Kai and said, "You’ve hit the nail on the head, boy."

"So... Brother Xia and the others are getting a different reward from me, aren’t they?" Yang Kai realized.

"That’s right, it is different. After all, they are Shrine disciples and you are not," Wen Zishan admitted bluntly. He wasn’t worried Yang Kai would be upset—after all, people do make distinctions between close and distant relations.

"However..." He changed the subject and said, "You also have a chance to get the same reward as them. The only question is whether you’re willing."

"I’d like to hear the details!" Yang Kai said solemnly.

Although he didn’t know exactly what kind of reward Xia Sheng and the others would get, since Wen Zishan admitted the rewards were different, it meant theirs was better.

Since he had the chance, Yang Kai naturally wanted to fight for it.

Still, he was very curious—what kind of reward could be even better than choosing any three items from the Treasure Vault?

This time, Wen Zishan didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he asked, "Do you know why this Lord established Qingyang Shrine here?"

Yang Kai thought to himself, "That was hundreds or even a thousand years ago—how would I know?" Though he was muttering inwardly, on the surface he put on a respectful look and said, "I do not know."

"Of course, it’s because there’s something very special here!" Wen Zishan said. As he spoke, a look of reminiscence flashed in his eyes, and he continued, "Eight hundred years ago, this Lord happened to pass by the Qingyang Mountain Range and discovered an object. Its effects were wondrous and mysterious. At the time, I was already at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, so I wanted to take it, but unfortunately, I failed. I could only settle here for the time being. As time passed, this place gradually developed into a Sect, so I simply established Qingyang Shrine."

"Compared to other top Sects in the Southern Territory, our Shrine’s history is relatively short. But why can we stand on equal footing with those other top Sects?"

Yang Kai’s heart stirred and he exclaimed, "Could it be because of that object?"

Wen Zishan immediately showed a look of approval and said, "Exactly. Although this Lord is a Third Stage Emperor Realm cultivator and not weaker than other Sect Masters or Hall Masters, the strength of a Sect isn’t just about one person. It requires many pillars to support it. The development of Qingyang Shrine to its current scale owes much to that object."

"May I ask... what exactly is that object?" Yang Kai was extremely curious, unable to imagine what could allow a Sect to flourish to such an extent.

Wen Zishan stared solemnly at Yang Kai and uttered three words: "Divine Roaming Mirror! This is a strange object that has existed since the dawn of heaven and earth. Inside, it contains a world of its own, and that world is very different from the one we live in now. As for how it’s different, this Lord won’t explain. If you have the chance to enter, you’ll naturally understand. After training inside, a cultivator can gain tremendous strength. Back then, this Lord explored it but couldn’t unravel its secrets. Over the centuries, most of the Shrine’s elite disciples have entered it. Those who survived all became much stronger."

"Star God Palace has the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, Wuhua Hall has the Starry Gale Beyond the Heavens, Tianwu Sacred Land has the Martial Intent Hall—these are the foundations of their Sects and the reason they have stood strong for so long," Wen Zishan said proudly. "And my Qingyang Shrine has the Divine Roaming Mirror! As long as the Divine Roaming Mirror remains unbroken, my Shrine will endure for generations!"

"Can I enter?" Yang Kai asked eagerly.

Wen Zishan grinned and said, "Originally, as an outsider, there’s no way this Lord would let you enter. The secret of the Divine Roaming Mirror is known only to those who have entered it—even other disciples have never heard of it, let alone other Sects. But... you’ve made great contributions this time. If this Lord doesn’t let you enter, it wouldn’t be right. Yet letting you in is also against the rules..."

At this point, Yang Kai suddenly spoke up, "Hall Master Wen, do you remember when I fought Xue Yi? You said that if I won, you'd grant me a reasonable request."

Wen Zishan was taken aback and looked at Yang Kai. "What, you want to use that request here?"

"That’s right!" Yang Kai nodded. "Plus, with the credit of offering six Star Seals to the Shrine, there shouldn’t be a problem, right?"

"There’s no problem..." Wen Zishan mused. "Since you’ve said this much, are you sure you want to do this? You don’t even know what the Divine Roaming Mirror can bring you..."

Yang Kai smiled and said, "Since Brother Xia and the others are getting this reward, it must be the best one. If it’s the best, why would I hesitate?"

"Good!" Wen Zishan shouted. "In that case, this Lord agrees. But you must swear an oath: for the rest of your life, you must never reveal the secret of the Divine Roaming Mirror to anyone. Otherwise..."

"Understood!" Yang Kai nodded and immediately swore a solemn oath before Wen Zishan.
