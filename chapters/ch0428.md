## Chapter 428 — He Is Not Home

Unable to catch Yang Kai, nor trace his whereabouts, and fearful of the mysterious Divine Roaming Realm peak expert, Yang Kang and Yang Ying both wore gloomy expressions.

After a moment of silence, Kang Zhan from the Kang Family suddenly brightened and said, "Brothers, why don’t we go take a stroll at the residence of your ninth brother now?"

Yang Kang and Yang Ying glanced at him suspiciously, then their eyes lit up.

Indeed, since Yang Kai had gone out himself, his residence would be left undefended. Moreover, that mysterious expert was also taken away with him, leaving the defenses there vulnerable.

Besides, Yang Zhao and Yang Shen were there, and with the combined strength of the four of them, they were strong enough to crush Yang Kai’s residence.

They exchanged indifferent glances, both brothers sensing an opportunity.

Before they could fully weigh the pros and cons, Gao Rangfeng from the Gao Family shook his head and said, "That’s unwise. I think you two should hurry back to your own residences. If there truly is a Divine Roaming Realm peak expert allied with Yang Kai, your mansions might be in danger now."

At these words, Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s faces changed drastically!

They only saw the chance to defeat others but completely overlooked their own situation. This time, both had brought many allies; each had only left one Blood Servant guarding their command flag at their respective residences. There were not many powerhouse defenders remaining.

If Yang Kai took this chance to infiltrate, it would be a shameful defeat for them.

Realizing this, the two no longer planned to scheme against Yang Kai and quickly led their forces back.

...

Ten li outside War City, Yang Kai set down Yang Tie. He did not try to restrain his meridians or True Essence but lifted his hat and greeted, "Third Brother!"

"You, Ninth Brother, have great skills," Yang Tie said with admiration.

Yang Kai shook his head, "Just exploited their weakness."

Tonight, no one would have guessed that he dared to run out and cause trouble. While Yang Kang and Yang Ying were fighting each other, they had left their defenses down outside as well. Otherwise, Yang Kai would never have easily captured someone to steal the command flag.

If they had been even a bit alert, Yang Kai’s attempt would have failed.

"Regardless, Third Brother is now in your hands; that’s your credit," Yang Tie said indifferently. "Rather than being captured alive by those two, I’d rather be used by you. At least, you haven’t actively harmed me."

"You’re taking this too seriously," Yang Kai noticed his coldness and understood his disappointment at being the first out. He didn’t mind. "Return to Zhongdu now. There’s nothing more for you here."

Yang Tie was stunned, frowning, "What do you mean?"

"Nothing more. Having the command flag is enough," Yang Kai said before leaping back toward War City without waiting for a reply.

Yang Tie stood there bewildered for a while before his face relaxed. He frowned, staring in the direction Yang Kai disappeared, and a faint gratitude surfaced.

Yang Kai had not taken him to exchange for supplies, sparing him some dignity.

Though Yang Tie had spent years outside, he had not achieved great feats or done anything astonishing. His performance was average, but as a member of the Yang Family, his pride ran deep. If not for this, he would have surrendered long ago instead of fighting to the death tonight.

If Yang Kai had taken him captive to the family for supplies, he would be disgraced in the Yang Family forever.

He took a deep breath of Primordial Qi and looked up at the starry sky clustered like jewels. With a bitter smile, Yang Tie turned and headed toward Zhongdu.

There was truly nothing left for him in this battle.

Defeated Yang Family disciples were forbidden from further involvement in the succession war. Others from different backgrounds still had options.

Yang Kai’s figure streaked like a meteor as he used his powerful and mysterious Divine Sense to conceal his Primordial Qi aura, hastening toward the residence.

He freed Yang Tie not out of brotherly affection—his relationship with his cousins was cold—but because Yang Tie’s determined refusal to yield tonight had moved him.

Such a person should not be humiliated.

In the northwest corner of War City stood Yang Kai’s residence.

Half an hour ago.

Almost at the same time as turmoil erupted at Yang Tie’s residence, Yang Kai’s mansion was bustling with activity.

Yang Kang’s intelligence was accurate. Tonight among the eight young lords, only the eldest, Yang Wei, trusted in his status and made no move, and the eighth, Yang Quan, remained inactive.

Yang Zhao and his ally Ye Xinrou from the Ye Family, leading many experts, had arrived at Yang Kai’s residence.

Before they acted, Yang Shen and Qiu Ziru arrived as well. Both sides took their positions, exchanged polite greetings, and everything was understood without saying a word.

Tonight, they only aimed to attack Yang Kai; there was no need to become enemies. All parties knew this well.

Before the main hall, Huo Xingchen sat upright on a Grand Tutor’s chair, swirling a folded fan in his hand. Beside him were two graceful maidservants serving wine and feeding him, his face relaxed and content.

The arrival of Yang Zhao and Yang Shen did not seem to spoil his mood.

Beside Yang Zhao stood the poised Ye Xinrou. Her charming smile revealed confident allure, her curves enchanting, her white skin jade-like and her bearing outstanding. Although her fame did not match Qiu Yimeng’s, she was also a prominent figure among the younger generation.

Behind Yang Zhao, Xiang Chu from the Xiang Family and Nan Sheng from the Nan Family stared coldly downward, their faces stirring with joy.

Especially Nan Sheng, his expression was ruthless and venomous as he stroked two severed fingers.

Those two fingers had been forced to self-amputate by Yang Kai—a grudge so deep it was blood feud. For months, he had dwelled constantly on avenging this humiliation.

Yang Zhao’s allies were strong and numerous, and Yang Shen was likewise powerful.

With Qiu Ziru’s aid from the Qiu Family gathering more support, for a time Yang Shen could contend with Yang Zhao.

In contrast, Yang Kai’s residence had only a lone Zhongdu wolf drinking, plus Qiu Yimeng and Xiang Tianxiao standing by his side, with Qu Gaoyi alone as a stalwart pillar in the main hall, unmoving like an iron tower.

Ying Jiu’s whereabouts were unknown.

Everyone present knew that this Blood Servant, like a shadow, was surely lurking in the darkness, prepared to unleash a thunderous strike at any moment.

From a distance, Qiu Yimeng and Qiu Ziru exchanged gazes. The former smiled slightly, full of confidence, while the latter’s eyes flickered nervously before hardening, unwilling to show fear before his elder sister.

At the same time, Xiang Chu and Xiang Tianxiao exchanged looks—one impassive, the other cold. Suddenly, the atmosphere tightened.

"Sixth Brother, what’s your plan for Younger Brother Kai here?" Yang Zhao asked with a playful smile.

Yang Shen laughed, "Second Brother enjoys the meat; I’ll have the broth. Second Brother wouldn’t eat alone, right?"

"Of course," Yang Zhao nodded slowly after some thought. "Then the command flag of Younger Brother Kai’s men shall go to you. Together we share the gains."

"As long as Second Brother agrees," Yang Shen chuckled, clearly pleased, glancing disparagingly at Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

The feud between Yang Kai and them had already become known.

This explained why Yang Zhao chose men over the flag. With the Xiang and Nan families joining Yang Zhao’s side, his strength increased greatly. He had to acknowledge allies properly.

Capturing Yang Kai meant humiliating him, which would satisfy Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng and ensure their loyalty in the future.

"Hey, you two, tired of standing and talking? How about coming down?" Huo Xingchen suddenly called out in a lazy tone.

Yang Zhao shook his head smiling, "No need, Brother Huo. Let Younger Brother Kai come out and speak. I don’t want to be too harsh on him."

"Yang Kai?" Huo Xingchen chuckled oddly. "Seems he’s not home."

"Not home?" Yang Zhao frowned, clearly thinking Huo Xingchen was teasing him. "Where else would he be at this hour?"

"Who knows? Might be out enjoying the night," Huo Xingchen smirked lewdly, standing and flipping his fan, acting the carefree dandy. "Anyway, he’s definitely not here. Don’t believe me? Ask Qiu Yimeng—she should know where Yang Kai is."

Yang Zhao’s gaze involuntarily shifted to Qiu Yimeng. She smiled faintly, tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, and softly said, "If I say he’s not here, Second Young Master will believe me?"

Her answer was ambiguous, leaving doubt. Yang Zhao frowned, sensing Yang Kai was playing some scheme.

But soon his expression hardened, and he declared loudly, "I don’t believe it."

At such a sensitive time tonight, how could Yang Kai possibly not be at his residence? Surely he was hiding somewhere, unwilling to show himself.

"Then search here thoroughly to find him," Qiu Yimeng smiled sweetly but inwardly cursed.

Before Yang Kai left, he had informed her, but before she replied, he had already vanished. Where he went and what he intended were mysteries to her.

"No need." Yang Zhao showed impatience and shouted, "Younger Brother Kai, come out now! I guarantee you won’t be harmed!"

After calling twice, no reply came.

Nan Sheng sneered coldly, "Second Young Master, it looks like your brother doesn’t care about your face. If that’s so, no need to waste words. Attack him directly. Surely he can’t hold out."

He seemed eager to see Yang Kai’s downfall, hoping to soothe his physical and emotional wounds from these past months.

"My family matters need no external interference!" Yang Zhao coldly said.

Nan Sheng’s face fell; he clenched his teeth and said no more.

Seeing Nan Sheng put in his place, Xiang Chu only smiled wider and said, "Second Young Master, I also think an all-out assault is best. The defenses here are weak. You and Sixth Brother join forces, what’s there to fear? Courtesy comes before force, but when courtesy is unappreciated, hehe..."
