## Chapter 2557 — This Lord’s Soul Finger

Yang Kai wore a fierce expression; he truly intended to do it, not just bluffing for fun.

“Despicable!” Lin’er’s face turned pale with anger. This bastard really wanted to kill her—his heart was truly wicked. Boy, you’d better not fall into this Young Lady’s hands, or you’ll regret it.

“If you don’t believe me, you can try!” Yang Kai shook the Myriad Sword, ready to perish together with his enemy.

Elder Fu’s expression remained calm as he said softly, “I once fought side by side with the Mortal Great Emperor. Kid, you’re bragging a bit too much. Aren’t you afraid of being exposed?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’m just stating facts and reasoning, never boasting.”

“Is that so…” Elder Fu smiled meaningfully, paused, and said, “Just you wait!”

“Wait for what?” Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, frowning, unsure what this man was up to. But he knew he was no match for him, so he didn’t dare let his guard down.

This man was not someone like Feng Xuan; even though he was only here by Soul Descent, Yang Kai had little confidence in facing him. But when it came to escaping, he was still somewhat confident. If not, he wouldn’t be able to stand here and talk so calmly.

Elder Fu’s gaze grew deep as he stood motionless. Yang Kai grew suspicious, not daring to make any move, afraid of offending him.

Majestic mountains, pure white snow; within the snowy peaks, clusters of buildings stretched endlessly. Martial artists occasionally flew overhead, and below, the pavilions and towers bustled with people.

Senior Brothers sparred, beautiful women played chess in pavilions, and groups of maids hurried by, expressionless and swift.

Countless plum blossoms bloomed, their fragrance wafting. Many tamed rare beasts dashed through the forests, trailing streaks of rosy light.

It was a scene of a mortal paradise, with Spiritual Qi thick to the extreme.

This was the Soul Palace, the dominant Sect of the Eastern Territory.

Those who had never visited the Soul Palace could never imagine such scenery inside the Sect. Just hearing the name, one might think it was eerie, but the reality was vastly different.

Atop the highest peak, beneath the snow, stood a vast palace. Inside, it was cold and deserted, as if no one had lived there for ages.

Within a hundred li of the peak, not a single person could be seen. Even the birds and beasts roaming the mountains dared not approach.

The reason was simple: this was the forbidden ground of the Soul Palace, the place where Great Emperor Youhun secluded himself for cultivation.

Youhun was one of the ten Great Emperors, standing at the very peak of the Star Realm. It was common for him to seclude himself for decades or centuries. Without a summons, no one dared disturb him. Even his children had to request permission before entering.

Yet even Yao Si, the Young Palace Master of the Soul Palace, hadn’t seen his father for three years. He only knew his father was comprehending some secret technique and couldn’t be disturbed.

At this moment, inside the palace, two figures sat cross-legged facing each other in the flickering lamplight.

One had black hair and no beard, wore black robes, and looked indifferent, yet possessed a natural authority that inspired awe. He was the Palace Master of the Soul Palace, one of the ten Great Emperors—Great Emperor Youhun.

Opposite him sat a middle-aged old man, slouched and bored, his eyes darting around, clearly searching for anything valuable to steal while Great Emperor Youhun wasn’t looking.

His demeanor matched his actions—"sneaky" didn’t even begin to describe him.

If Yao Si saw this scene, he would be shocked.

This palace was only ever entered by his father and a few trusted aides; no outsiders had ever set foot here. Yet now, a mysterious old man sat face-to-face with his father, and his father wasn’t even on guard…

If Yang Kai saw this, he’d be shocked too.

Because that old man was none other than Duan Hongchen, whom he’d parted ways with not long ago in the Ziyue Desert.

Who knew how Duan Hongchen ended up here, and even went straight to Great Emperor Youhun.

In the silence, only the crackling of the lamp could be heard. Suddenly, Great Emperor Youhun opened his eyes. Duan Hongchen straightened up, eager: “Is it done?”

“Not yet.” Great Emperor Youhun slowly shook his head.

Duan Hongchen was stunned. “If it’s not done, why open your eyes? Hurry up and finish—I still need your help with something.”

He was extremely blunt, as if very familiar with the Great Emperor Youhun.

Great Emperor Youhun smiled slightly. “Your matter can wait. I have something to ask you first.”

Duan Hongchen asked curiously, “Ask me? What do you need to ask?”

Great Emperor Youhun laughed, “There’s a reckless fellow who claims to have fought alongside you. Is that true?”

Yang Kai had just finished bragging, and now Great Emperor Youhun was here to verify it with Duan Hongchen. Who knows what Yang Kai would think if he knew.

Duan Hongchen snorted, “You believe whatever people say? Ridiculous. When have I ever fought alongside anyone? He’s just using my reputation to scare you. Hurry and deal with him—I have urgent matters.”

Youhun nodded, “I thought so too…”

He also thought Yang Kai was boasting. Who was Duan Hongchen? Even after cutting his own cultivation and losing strength, he wouldn’t need to join forces with others. But since Duan Hongchen happened to be in Soul Palace, it didn’t hurt to ask.

“Wait a moment!” Duan Hongchen suddenly called out, his face showing a strange expression. “What does this person look like?”

He suddenly remembered that there really was someone who had fought alongside him, and it was quite recent.

Youhun didn’t answer. He simply waved his hand, and the space between them rippled. A clear image appeared before Duan Hongchen’s eyes: Yang Kai, holding the Myriad Sword, standing at the exit of the ancient passage, surrounded by corpses.

Duan Hongchen glanced at it, and his mouth twitched. “Why is it that kid…”

Great Emperor Youhun was surprised. “You know him?”

Duan Hongchen’s face suddenly twisted with rage. He gritted his teeth, “I’d recognize him even if he turned to ash! Youhun, hurry up and kill him for me—help me vent my anger, and I’ll remember this favor!”

Great Emperor Youhun let out a sigh and said, “Heaven Devouring, if you keep coming out and rambling, don’t blame this Lord for being harsh. This Lord’s Soul Finger is not something to be taken lightly.”

He could tell at a glance that the speaker wasn’t Duan Hongchen, but Wu Kuang, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, who shared a body with Duan Hongchen.

Duan Hongchen let out a strange laugh, “Youhun, you’ve got guts, daring to speak to this Lord like that. Back then, you didn’t have such courage.”

Great Emperor Youhun smiled faintly and said, “This Lord’s Soul Finger is not something to be taken lightly…”

He avoided talking about the past, clearly having suffered at Heaven Devouring’s hands before.

Duan Hongchen’s face darkened, “Can’t you change your line? Always threatening this Lord with that—does it amuse you?”

Great Emperor Youhun remained calm and kept smiling, “This Lord’s Soul Finger…”

“Screw you!”

Even Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, with his well-trained temperament, couldn’t help but curse at this moment.

Just then, Duan Hongchen suddenly shivered, his twisted expression vanished, replaced by anger.

Anyone would be upset if, while speaking normally, another soul suddenly took control of their body. But neither he nor Heaven Devouring could do anything about it.

“You really know that kid?” Seeing Heaven Devouring suppressed, Youhun finally asked.

Duan Hongchen smacked his lips and said, “That kid I mentioned to you earlier—it’s him.”

Youhun raised an eyebrow and asked, “So he’s the one who joined forces with you to attack Heaven Devouring and ruined his plans?”

“That’s right, but the situation was complicated. Hard to explain quickly. Anyway, you saw the result.” Duan Hongchen said helplessly.

Great Emperor Youhun nodded slightly, “So he wasn’t bragging after all.”

“How do you plan to deal with him?” Duan Hongchen glanced worriedly at Yang Kai in the light screen.

He knew the Great Emperor Youhun had descended by Soul Descent somewhere, likely because his troublesome daughter was in danger. When a Great Emperor descends by Soul Descent, it’s no joke—something must be accomplished. Like a treasured sword, if drawn, it must taste blood.

For a Great Emperor to descend by Soul Descent and not kill anyone before returning would be shameful.

If it were anyone else, it wouldn’t matter. But Yang Kai… Duan Hongchen truly didn’t want him to die at Youhun’s hands. After all, in the Shattered Star Sea, he’d been a great help.

Youhun glanced at him, “You want me to spare him?”

They were both old monsters who’d cultivated for countless years; there was no need to spell things out. Youhun knew what Duan Hongchen was thinking, and it was a chance to make him owe another favor.

Youhun secretly calculated in his heart.

“I have no ties to him. Whether he lives or dies is none of my business. Do as you please—why ask me?” Duan Hongchen waved his sleeve, acting indifferent.

Youhun could guess his thoughts, and Duan Hongchen could guess Youhun’s. He already owed him a favor; if he owed another, he’d be bound to Youhun for life. That kind of deal, he wouldn’t accept!

“Fine, then this Lord will kill him!” Youhun nodded. “My daughter may be unruly, but she’s not someone to be bullied.”

“Heh.” Duan Hongchen grinned slyly, “If you want your daughter to die with him, go ahead.”

Youhun’s face darkened, “Duan Hongchen, you underestimate this Lord. Even if I’m just a Soul Descent, taking down a First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivator is no trouble.”

Duan Hongchen shook his head, “An ordinary First Stage Emperor wouldn’t be your match, but that kid… tsk tsk, he’s not ordinary. If you want to take him down, you’ll have to work for it.”
