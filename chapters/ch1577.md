## Chapter 1577 — Matters of Bygone Years

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang settled into the palace in peace.

After the farce in the main hall, everyone knew of the intimate relationship between Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo; the yao experts gossiped with envy and jealousy, while cursing that Yang Kai's amorous fortune was truly boundless.

In the guest room, Shan Qingluo arrived with Biluo to pay a visit to Yang Kai and his Senior Sister.

Earlier there had been too many eyes watching, so she had not said much; now that the opportunity presented itself, she naturally wished to pour out her heart.

Although Yang Kai had already learned many things from Biluo while in the Imperial Garden, he did not know the finer details; it was only after speaking with Shan Qingluo that he understood the enchantress had indeed endured much hardship after drifting to Di Chen Star.

She had been breathtakingly beautiful and naturally beguiling, but when she first came to Di Chen Star her strength was relatively low, and so many men with ill intent set their sights on her.

Had she not encountered Lady Chi Yue, who recognized her and took her as a foster daughter, Shan Qingluo could not imagine what fate might have befallen her.

To some degree, she felt deep gratitude toward Lady Chi Yue. Since being accepted as a foster daughter, Lady Chi Yue had shown her great favor; from the position she held within Chi Yue's domain, an onlooker ignorant of the truth might easily assume she was a pure yao.

That a human could occupy such a high station in Red Moon Domain could not be separated from Lady Chi Yue’s patronage.

After hearing Shan Qingluo’s account, Yang Kai felt a measure of respect for the Lady Chi Yue he had never met.

"In short, my foster mother has treated me very well. And because I refined the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, I am no longer entirely human, yet I cannot be called a yao," Shan Qingluo said with a light laugh.

"What would that make you?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Hm — a half-yao, I suppose. There are such peculiar existences on Di Chen Star, but their status is truly low, only a hair above humans," she replied.

"Half-yao..." Yang Kai repeated in astonishment.

"Indeed. These half-yao are born from unions between humans and yao; they are accepted by neither side and so their standing is awkward," Shan Qingluo explained offhandedly.

"Unions between humans and yao? Is such a thing permitted on Di Chen Star?" he asked.

"Of course it is not permitted. Di Chen Star differs from other Cultivation Stars — yao predominate here, and the yao regard themselves as supreme; how could they tolerate their bloodlines being sullied by humans? Yet sometimes two people in love care nothing for the world’s gaze or the shackles of convention, and so half-yao are born," Shan Qingluo said slowly. "To be honest, I admire those people. Take the senior Ba He who came with you, for example... he experienced such things."

"You know about Ba He's affairs?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Hm, I originally did not know. It was only after hearing some things from Yu Xiong that I learned about it."

"Tell me — I'm curious about that old fellow," Yang Kai urged; when he had been in Huiyue City he had heard many rumors about Ba He, and the old man's strength was indeed extraordinary.

Shan Qingluo didn’t know many details, but the reason Ba He had concealed his name and identity in Huiyue City for the past two hundred years—even going so far as to alter his appearance and suppress his cultivation—was all because of a human woman.

Centuries ago the old man had been Lady Chi Yue’s chief general, a peerless talent who had long since reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and in terms of force and presence no other Origin Returning Realm could rival him.

For a time he was hailed as the unrivaled strong one beneath the Void King Realm on Di Chen Star.

He was the yao star’s most promising candidate to ascend to the Void King Realm; were he to achieve that, he could stand shoulder to shoulder with Chi Yue and become a lord-level power.

Yet at the height of his glory he fell for a human woman at first sight, and the more he saw her the deeper his devotion grew.

The yao opposed human-yao unions, and for a rising star like Ba He the resistance he faced was all the greater, especially the pressure from Lady Chi Yue, which left him utterly tormented.

Had matters continued down that path, with Ba He’s proud temperament it was highly likely he would have rebelled against the yao altogether; he would have become a hunted man across Di Chen Star.

Lady Chi Yue herself was in anguish — she naturally did not want her most capable general to be driven to such an extreme.

Out of a love for talent, she even prepared to accept the situation and allow Ba He to be with the human woman.

After all, although human-yao unions could not be made public, many yao experts took pleasure in toying with human beauties; which yao lord's residence lacked a few human women as playthings? It was simply understood, never spoken of openly.

If Ba He could advance to the Void King Realm, what did it matter if he took a human as his companion?

But before she could speak plainly to Ba He, a melodramatic turn of events occurred.

The human woman, at a critical moment of cultivation, suffered Qi Deviation and suddenly died.

On hearing the news, Ba He was despondent and filled with rage.

He instinctively believed that his beloved’s Qi Deviation must have been connected to Lady Chi Yue — perhaps the Lady had secretly intervened.

So he caused an uproar on Half Moon Mountain and stormed into Chi Yue’s bedchamber to confront her face to face.

What transpired in that bedchamber no one truly knew; but when Lady Chi Yue emerged she announced that Ba He had been ungrateful and insolent, and that she had personally struck him down.

From that time on Ba He vanished without a trace for two hundred years.

Until now, when he voluntarily appeared in Huiyue City.

"So... does that mean Lady Chi Yue did not kill Ba He after all, but let him go?" Yang Kai mused.

"That would appear to be the case," Shan Qingluo nodded lightly. "My foster mother is a Void King at the Second Stage; if she truly intended to slay Ba He, he would surely have died — there would be no way he could still be alive."

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Yang Kai..." Shan Qingluo suddenly called softly.

"Hm?"

"Do you think... the human woman's Qi Deviation and sudden death were related to my foster mother?"

"How should I know? Events from over two hundred years ago are known only to those involved," Yang Kai replied with a faint smile. Seeing concern flash across Shan Qingluo's face, he was moved and asked in a low voice, "What are you worried about?"

Shan Qingluo slowly shook her head and forced a faint smile. "Nothing. By the way, be careful of Mi Tian. I heard you had a run-in with him in Huiyue City — Mi Tian is arrogant; if you've offended him, he will not let it go."

"Rest assured, he can't do anything to me," Yang Kai said with a proud chuckle.

The two spoke a while longer before Shan Qingluo rose to leave.

"Junior Brother, what should we do next?" Xia Ningshang asked softly after Shan Qingluo departed.

"I haven't decided yet," Yang Kai grinned. He had contrived to enter the palace chiefly to see how Shan Qingluo was faring; now that he saw her well and honored, he felt relieved.

"So you'll take Sister Qingluo with you?" Xia Ningshang asked.

"I hadn't thought so, but it's up to her. Actually, I think it's better for her to remain here — after all, this is a yao star, which is extremely favorable for her cultivation and future development."

Xia Ningshang inclined her head slightly.

Upon hearing Ba He's tale she immediately understood that if Yang Kai were set on taking Shan Qingluo away, it would be fraught with difficulty. Whether Lady Chi Yue had any hand in the human woman's death was unknown, but if she had acted in secret...

Xia Ningshang understood why Shan Qingluo had appeared so worried earlier; she clearly feared Yang Kai might suffer the same fate as that human woman.

For the sake of her foster daughter's future, Lady Chi Yue would likely not hesitate at the death of a single human man.

"But since we're here, we should first lay hands on some of the resources unique to this place," Yang Kai said with a smile, looking at Xia Ningshang. "Little Senior Sister, I'll need to borrow your strength for this."

......

Shan Qingluo left the guest room and, taking Biluo with her, headed straight for Lady Chi Yue's bedchamber.

Because she was valued by Lady Chi Yue as if she were a future successor, no one in the palace dared block her way; every yao cultivator who saw her bowed in respect.

Outside the bedchamber she happened upon a broad-shouldered, iron-towered man standing there, brow furrowed, his body tilted as though he were straining to listen.

"Yu Xiong!" Shan Qingluo called as she approached.

Hearing the summons, Yu Xiong turned and pressed a finger to his lips to hush her.

"What are you skulking about in front of my foster mother's bedchamber? Be careful or she will give you a lesson," Shan Qingluo scolded, her brows knitting.

"Senior Ba He is being punished inside — listen!" Yu Xiong pointed and wore an expression of eager gossip.

Shan Qingluo was startled and, listening carefully, indeed heard the heart-rending cries coming from within the bedchamber.

Her face went pale as she cried out in alarm, "Would foster mother not forgive Senior Ba He?"

Though she had never met Ba He, his situation was comparable to hers; if Lady Chi Yue would not relent in Ba He's case, then her own future with Yang Kai would likewise be grim.

Ba He's fate was, to some extent, an example she must learn from, so upon hearing his agonized screams Shan Qingluo grew anxious.

She could imagine Yang Kai enduring similar torments before her foster mother...

"I don't know. Foster mother has always been gentle and seldom angry; she guides more than she scolds, and she has never punished us. For Ba He to be tormented so miserably, she must indeed be furious," Yu Xiong said, smacking his lips and perking his ears like windmills as he listened all the more eagerly.

Shan Qingluo's expression shifted; she worried even more and silently considered what to say when she saw her foster mother.
