## Chapter 1908 — Could He Really Refine Pills?

Zuo De's remarks won the favor of those alchemists who did not know the whole story, and someone shouted, "If someone thinks himself above everyone else, Master need not blame himself—teach him a lesson!"

"Indeed, Master is lofty and revered; for anyone to dare to challenge your alchemical skill is simply outrageous."

"Master, why not rest and let me compete for you? I will not let you down!" someone even volunteered.

Those alchemists who had come to watch the spectacle did not know what had happened before and did not even know which Spiritual Pill was to be contested; they had come merely because of Zuo De's name and naturally had little good impression of Yang Kai.

In their eyes, to challenge Zuo De in alchemy itself was an intolerable affront.

Of the more than five hundred alchemists, a large portion glared at Yang Kai as if they wanted to swallow him whole.

Yang Kai smiled and let the matter pass.

Zuo De smiled and said, "Gentlemen, your goodwill is appreciated. However, today's matter truly requires me to act personally, because this youngster intends to compete with me in refining the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!"

"What? The Taichu Soul-Returning Pill?"

"Isn't that a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill?"

"Master is going to refine such a pill? We're in for a treat."

"Could this man also be a Void King-Grade alchemist? He doesn't look like it."

A babel of voices rose among the alchemists and the hall instantly grew extremely noisy.

"Enough, don't make noise!" Ai Ou's face darkened as he shouted, "Master Zuo De and Yang Kai are about to light their furnaces; you are all alchemists—do you not know better than to disturb? I ask you all to remain silent, or else do not blame me for showing no mercy!"

At Ai Ou's words, the once-rambunctious hall immediately fell silent.

Zuo De smiled and said, "Just be quiet; if you wish to observe a bit, that is no problem."

At this, many alchemists showed visible delight and cast grateful looks toward Zuo De.

"Chairman Ai Ou, please hand over the materials for refining the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill to me, and prepare an identical set for that youngster as well," Zuo De called loudly.

"Naturally." Ai Ou nodded, then took out numerous materials from his Spatial Ring, divided them into two sets, and handed them to Yang Kai and Zuo De respectively.

The two sets of materials were essentially identical; the only difference was that the portion given to Zuo De contained an inner core from a Seven-Colored Stag.

After the materials were selected, Ai Ou said, "This is the ninth floor of the Medicine Master Hall. The earth-fire power is most concentrated here. Refining here saves a great deal of time and energy—please each choose a suitable position."

On this ninth floor, dragon-head devices could be seen everywhere. The dragon heads were not large, their mouths open; nearby arrays could be controlled so that, when activated, the dragon heads would spout earth-fire drawn from beneath the ground and the fire intensity could be adjusted—extremely convenient.

Zuo De was clearly very familiar with this place; at Ai Ou's words he went directly to a dragon head and made his preparations.

The more than five hundred alchemists surged forward and stood at a position twenty zhang from Zuo De, surrounding his spot in a ring and staring intently.

Ai Ou came up beside Yang Kai and quietly asked, "Brother Yang, do you want to go to a side room? Although this spot is open, the crowd may cause some interference."

"No need," Yang Kai shook his head and smiled. "If I go into a side room, those people won't see how I refine the pill and will only grow suspicious."

"Hmm, you have a point," Ai Ou frowned, "but can you really refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill?"

He had not believed it from the start; seeing Yang Kai's composed demeanor made him even more suspicious.

Could he not only be greatly accomplished in the Martial Dao but also be a Void King-Grade alchemist? The thought surfaced and Ai Ou quickly dismissed it as far too unrealistic.

"Chairman Ai Ou, just watch and see," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Ai Ou said nothing further.

From the other side, Zhan Yuan's voice suddenly rang out, edged with schadenfreude: "Friend, my master asks whether you need to borrow a Void King-Grade alchemy furnace? You should know a good furnace increases success rates. Although with your skill you may be unable to activate a Void King-Grade furnace, my master is merciful and lending it to you won't hurt."

"I appreciate the Master's kindness. As for a Void King-Grade furnace... haha, I have one!" Yang Kai joked as he produced his Purple Void Cauldron from his Spatial Ring.

That thing had been taken from the Imperial Garden; it was an artifact from tens of thousands of years ago, and at one time the Purple Void Cauldron had contained a Spiritual Pill that bore a Pill Cloud.

At the appearance of the Purple Void Cauldron, the assembled alchemists could not help but emit a string of exclamations.

The exclamations were quickly stifled, and every pair of eyes greedily and covetously stared at Yang Kai's Purple Void Cauldron, refusing to look away.

They were all alchemists, and immediately recognized the cauldron's extraordinariness; purple clouds bloomed around it, and when the furnace appeared the ninth floor of the Medicine Master Hall filled with the fragrance of pills—anyone could see that many superb Spiritual Pills had been born in that cauldron.

"Could he really refine pills?" Zhan Yuan was dumbfounded.

If he were not an alchemist, why would he carry a Void King-Grade furnace? Yet he soon assumed it was spoils Yang Kai had obtained in the course of his adventures; after all, Yang Kai was no weakling, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, and his Spatial Ring likely contained all sorts of oddities.

Damn it! A mere martial artist actually has a Void King–Grade alchemy furnace, while I, an up-and-coming alchemist with limitless prospects, am stuck using an Origin–Grade, Middle-Level furnace. Zhan Yuan's teeth itched with hatred; the Purple Void Cauldron looked plainly wasted in Yang Kai's hands, and he longed to rush forward and snatch it away.

Thinking this, Zhan Yuan began to consider how to take Yang Kai's Purple Void Cauldron... though adding another bet now might be going too far.

His mind ran wild and he could not suppress it.

"That's a good cauldron," Zong Ao raised an eyebrow, "its aura is ancient—it's got some age, doesn't it?"

Among the hundreds of alchemists, only Zong Ao stood on Yang Kai's side and did not go to observe Zuo De.

"Indeed it's ancient; I obtained it by chance. But... Master Zong Ao, do not set your sights on my furnace—I only have one," Yang Kai chuckled.

Zong Ao snorted at this.

Ai Ou laughed heartily, "No matter. I recall the Treasure Vault in Shuitian City still has an unclaimed Void King-Grade furnace; I'll have someone send it to Master Zong another day."

Because of this matter, Ai Ou's attitude toward Zong Ao became very amiable, for from the start Zong Ao had firmly stood by Yang Kai's side.

Hearing this, Zong Ao smiled slightly and clasped his fist, "Many thanks, Chairman Ai Ou."

"A sword given to a hero, nothing more."

Zhan Yuan shouted again, "Friend, my master says the gap between you two is too great, so this contest will not be limited by time—if you can refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, my master will concede."

"Thanks for the Master's kindness; I'll do my utmost!" Yang Kai clasped his fist and called out.

Zhan Yuan responded with a sneer.

Ai Ou's expression turned solemn as he intoned, "Since both are prepared, then... begin!"

At his words, a dry heat suddenly emanated from Zuo De's side—he had already activated the array to draw in the earth-fire.

"Yang Kai, don't be nervous—losing is no great matter," Xue Yue said, concern in her voice.

There was one thing she did not say: if Yang Kai truly lost she would risk everything to take him out of Shuitian City; she would never allow him to be enslaved for two thousand years, and she believed her father would not stand idly by and watch such a thing happen.

"I'm not nervous," Yang Kai nodded. "But... could you all stand back a little? With you all so close I can't perform properly."

"Ah, sorry, forgot," Ai Ou and the others replied, faces suddenly awkward as they hurriedly stepped back.

In an instant, the ninth floor of the Medicine Master Hall split into two distinct areas: one centered on Zuo De, where more than five hundred Saint King-Grade and above alchemists formed a great circle, each with eyes wide as they watched Zuo De, fearful of missing any detail.

The other area was where Yang Kai stood; compared with Zuo De's side it felt cold and sparse—only Ai Ou, Xue Yue, and Zong Ao remained, the three wearing anxious, conflicted expressions.

Ai Ou and Xue Yue, father and daughter, exchanged glances from time to time as if communicating something unspeakable.

Suddenly, from Zuo De's side came uncontrollable murmurs; Zuo De's furnace mouth opened and one by one he expertly tossed in the prepared medicinal ingredients, controlling the fire with movements like flowing clouds and water—utterly decisive and supremely elegant—so captivating that the five hundred alchemists watched entranced, for a time forgetting Ai Ou's earlier warning.

"No wonder he's a master—he even threw Water Orchid Immortal and Jade Heart Fruit in together; I wouldn't even have dared think of that."

"Strange — the Sea-Reversing Ganoderma and the Chi Huo Tendril have clashing natures. Tossing them into the cauldron one after the other like that won't ruin their medicinal properties? Shouldn't one be refined to completion first, then the other added?"

"What do you know? When the master put in the Sea-Reversing Ganoderma he used Saint Yuan to activate the spirit array inside the furnace; those two ingredients have likely already perfectly integrated."

"I see—looks like the master's speed outpaced my eyesight, shame on me!"

"Ha ha, there's nothing to be ashamed of before a master—watch closely; what we gain today will be a blessing for our lifetimes."

"Quite so."

Zuo De was, after all, an old and established Void King-Grade alchemist; though he felt affronted by Yang Kai's challenge, once he entered the state of refining his expression became as calm as still water—the surrounding chatter never reached his ears; in his sight there was only fire, timing, the furnace, and the materials—everything else he had cast to the heavens.
