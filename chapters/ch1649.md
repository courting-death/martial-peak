## Chapter 1649 — Apology

Zhou Yunxuan rose from the snow, one hand pressed to her cheek, her face dazed as she stared blankly at Yang Kai.

She had never expected that, in front of the Valley Lord and so many elders, Yang Kai would actually dare to strike her.

"Apologize!" Yang Kai said coldly, his gaze icy.

Zhou Yunxuan's delicate body trembled—being humiliated like this before so many Senior Sisters and Junior Sisters, and as an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, how could she bear it? Her face twisted suddenly and she screamed in a shrill, disbelieving voice, "How dare you hit me?"

Smack...

With another light sound, Zhou Yunxuan was sent flying once more.

The other cheek went numb as well.

"Apologize!" Yang Kai's voice was cold and mechanical, utterly devoid of feeling, sending a chill through everyone present.

Zhou Yunxuan stood up from the ground for the second time, terror etched across her face. She turned toward Ran Yunting as if begging her to do her justice, but when she saw her expression, a coldness shot from her soles to the crown of her head—she was struck dumb with shock.

The Great Elder's face was as dark as still water; he stared hard at Yang Kai but dared not utter a word.

The other elders wore the same expression; even the Valley Lord frowned deeply.

No one would stand up to vindicate her!

Zhou Yunxuan's heart was aghast. She knew she had been at fault—she shouldn't have insulted Su Yan so recklessly—but there must be reasons she did not know.

This youth had somehow made everyone wary of him!

"Apologize, or... die!" Yang Kai issued his final ultimatum; murderous intent bloomed about him and locked onto Zhou Yunxuan. Failing to kill Ran Yunting had enraged him; Zhou Yunxuan simply happened to stand in his line of fire.

Finally Bing Long spoke, frowning, "Yang Kai, that's enough. This disciple spoke insolently, but you've already punished her—stand down."

Zhou Yunxuan was after all a disciple of Ice Heart Valley; Yang Kai had struck her two slaps in front of her peers, and that had tested Bing Long's patience to its limit. If Yang Kai continued to press the matter, Bing Long could not idly look on.

To do otherwise would chill the hearts of the disciples.

"Junior Brother, let it go." Su Yan also pleaded for Zhou Yunxuan.

For her, Zhou Yunxuan's insult had not harmed her, and Yang Kai had already given Zhou Yunxuan two slaps—let her taste the consequences.

Still, Su Yan felt a sweet warmth in her heart that Yang Kai had stood up for her.

"Since Senior Sister says so... then I have no wish to finish her off." Yang Kai's expression softened and he looked at Bing Long. "Have her apologize and I'll spare her!"

Bing Long was speechless; she thought he still would not yield, and felt a prick of annoyance.

Just then, all the senior figures of Ice Heart Valley stiffened and listened intently, as if they had heard something; their expressions grew focused and full of unreadable changes.

Yang Kai narrowed his brows and sensed a faint, obscure Divine Sense fluctuation in the void.

He understood immediately—one of Ice Heart Valley's Grand Elders was likely speaking to Bing Long and the others by Divine Sense.

He did not interrupt rashly and waited in silence.

Bing Long and the others' faces shifted; after a long moment they exchanged glances, each expression growing grave, as if a storm were about to break.

It seemed as though something major had occurred in Ice Heart Valley.

"Apologize to Su Yan and this matter will end here!" Bing Long suddenly looked at Zhou Yunxuan, her tone a little impatient.

Zhou Yunxuan's face went blank—she had not expected the Valley Lord to side with Yang Kai and Su Yan. Her final refuge was gone; she could only, unwilling and begrudging, say, "Junior Sister Su, Senior Sister was in the wrong just now; please don't take it to heart."

She gritted her teeth; her eyes flickered with resentment and a hint of madness—like a dormant venomous snake.

She knew she would become the laughingstock of Ice Heart Valley, the subject of gossip among the disciples. Her face was utterly ruined.

"You may leave." Bing Long waved to Zhou Yunxuan and gave a faint command.

Zhou Yunxuan bowed and stepped away, casting a hateful glare at Yang Kai and Su Yan before she left, as if trying to imprint their faces into her memory and bones.

"Everyone else, disperse!" Bing Long called sharply.

The multitude of Ice Heart Valley disciples melted away.

Soon only the senior members of Ice Heart Valley and Yang Kai and Su Yan remained in the arena. Qing Ya stood some distance off, watching with worry.

"Yang Kai, come with me." Bing Long looked at him with a complicated expression.

"Who wants to see me?" Yang Kai asked, sensing something.

Bing Long sighed, "The Grand Elder wishes to see you... Moreover, the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, Lord Luo Hai, and Elder Chi Huo of the Fire Radiance Sect also wish to see you."

"Luo Hai is here?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

"Yes."

"What if I don't go?" Yang Kai grinned.

"I don't think that's for you to decide—you know the consequences." Bing Long sighed. "Although your strength is great, before Lord Luo Hai, what you possess is not much."

Yang Kai rubbed his chin and nodded, "It seems I must go. Very well—I will accompany the Elder. It's time to settle that matter."

Bing Long was stunned but asked no more. She glanced at Su Yan leaning against him and sighed, "I'll wait ahead of you."

The other elders followed closely. Ran Yunting glared at Yang Kai with venom in her eyes, her face full of cruelty.

Though she did not know why Lord Luo Hai insisted on seeing Yang Kai, even bringing Chi Huo of the Fire Radiance Sect to track him down, it was clear there were deep grudges between Luo Hai and this youngster.

This brat doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, daring to provoke Lord Luo Hai! Let’s see how you die now. Ran Yunting cursed viciously in her heart.

In the next moment she saw Su Yan and Yang Kai holding hands and whispering; anger flared in her, and she wanted nothing more than to rush forward and tear them apart.

Thinking of Yang Kai's methods, Ran Yunting restrained herself with a cold snort and followed after Bing Long and the others.

"Senior Sister, wait here for me—I won't be long."

"No, I'll go with you!" Su Yan shook her head, her eyes resolute. Worried that something might happen to Yang Kai, she would stand by him.

"Then... all right." Yang Kai did not argue further and glanced toward Qing Ya.

Qing Ya immediately said, "I'll wait here for you!"

She knew she had no right to be involved and wisely stayed behind.

The Stone Puppet stood quietly at her side.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and he and Su Yan left together.

Bing Long waited a short distance ahead. Seeing the two as an inseparable, fated pair, she furrowed her brow but did not pry further; instead she looked at Yang Kai with meaning and asked, "At this point, shouldn't you be honest with me and tell me exactly what kind of grudge you have with Lord Luo Hai?"

"You wish to know?" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Bing Long nodded.

"Ask Luo Hai. If he is willing to tell you, then you will know."

"You..." Bing Long was dumbstruck, then choked on her words. "Don't you realize the situation? Lord Luo Hai and Elder Chi Huo came to Icebound Island and specifically requested you. They must be here for you. Only our Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley could fully protect you. At a time like this you still hide things—do you want to die?"

"Your Ice Heart Valley elder is only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, isn't she? If Luo Hai truly wanted to harm me, could she stop him?" Yang Kai scoffed.

Bing Long was left speechless.

Above the Void King Realm, with each advancement of a Stage, one’s strength undergoes earth-shaking changes! Precisely because of this, no one could hold Luo Hai and Chi Huo accountable for trespassing onto Icebound Island. Since they had specifically named Yang Kai, Luo Li had no choice but to comply.

If not for that, how could Luo Li allow them to trespass on Icebound Island? If it had been only Chi Huo, Luo Li would have driven him away long ago.

"Moreover, I have no ties with Ice Heart Valley—if your Grand Elder has the ability, why would she protect me?" Yang Kai sneered. "You want to know what Luo Hai seeks from me, or perhaps you want a share from him."

Bing Long was stunned, then gave a wry smile and said, “You see things quite clearly. Since you understand so well, why are you still willing to meet him? If I were you, I would have left long ago!”

"Where would I go?" Yang Kai snorted. "He chased me across the Star Domain until I barely escaped to Chi Lan Star; now that he has found me again, I likely can't run. I said it's time to settle this grudge; otherwise he'll always have me in his sights. If he wants to bully the weak with his strength, then let’s see if he truly has the ability to do so!”

As he spoke, a fierce savagery crossed Yang Kai's face; his eyes flashed like lightning. Rather than shrinking from Luo Hai's might, he brimmed with fighting spirit.

Bing Long gaped at him, speechless for a long while before shaking her head, "Madman!"

To speak such madness at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—Bing Long thought Yang Kai's head must be somewhat unsound.

Yang Kai laughed uproariously, unconcerned.

From beginning to end Su Yan remained silent, nestled at Yang Kai's side and holding his hand as if never wanting to part, a calm, content smile on her face.

Bing Long sighed time and again; in ordinary circumstances such a perfect pair would be heaven-sent and envied.

But Yang Kai had drawn Luo Hai's attention—his future was uncertain. Su Yan was Ice Heart Valley's most cherished disciple, refined in the Ice Jade Skill; if this bond could not be severed, one day she might fall from her high place into pitiful ruin.

Bing Long was indifferent.

The three moved swiftly and soon arrived before a vast, magnificent ice palace on the inner island.

The palace seemed carved entirely from profound ice—crystalline as jade, white as snow—elegant yet imposing, inspiring awe.

From within the ice palace emanated an exceedingly powerful aura.

When Yang Kai approached the white jade ice palace, three Divine Senses almost instantly enveloped him; one was overwhelmingly powerful, far surpassing the other two.

Luo Hai!
