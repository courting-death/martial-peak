## Chapter 1267 — What’s Truly Fearsome Is a Thief Who Won’t Let Go

Yang Kai was full of doubt. According to Wu Yi, ever since Daiyuan had arrived here, she’d shut herself away and never gone out. Even when Wu Yi had taken the initiative to visit her a few times, their exchanges had been shallow. Yet now, as soon as he returned, Yang Yan was asking for his answer — clearly, she cared about this matter quite a bit.

Yang Kai couldn't help but suspect she wanted him to make a trip to Liuli Gate; the two women before him had no ties with Daiyuan and no reason to speak on her behalf, right?

Yang Yan heard this and without hesitation nodded, "If it's possible, of course I'd want you to agree to her request."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he stared at Yang Yan in silence for a long while before saying in a cool tone, "Explain your reasoning. You shouldn't be so overflowing with sympathy — what are you scheming?"

Yang Yan smiled mysteriously. "Calling it a scheme isn't wrong. But first let's weigh the gains and losses of you agreeing to her request. What she asks of you would take at most three days, and it's well within your capability. If what she says is true, then whatever the task is it shouldn't be hard for you. The only trouble is you'd have to make a trip to Liuli Gate."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and said nothing, indicating she should continue.

Seeing Yang Kai showed no aversion, Yang Yan's spirits brightened and she continued, "Put aside the promised lavish reward for now — with your current status you probably wouldn't even look twice at the reward she offers."

"Exactly, so helping her brings me no benefit, and brazenly barging into another sect is rather improper. If Daiyuan's standing were like Yin Sudie's, then fine. But I see she doesn't seem very favored in Liuli Gate." Yang Kai frowned.

Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled, "About her affairs, I was curious before, so I and Wu Yi made some inquiries — guess what we discovered?"

"What?" Yang Kai looked up at them.

Now Wu Yi spoke, "This Daiyuan is just as you guessed: she indeed isn't much favored in Liuli Gate, but that's something that happened within the last decade or so. Do you know who used to be the most outstanding, most renowned disciple of Liuli Gate?"

"Daiyuan?"

"Correct! Back then within Liuli Gate Daiyuan overshadowed Yin Sudie, but for some reason Daiyuan suddenly faded from the attention of Liuli Gate's upper echelons, and Yin Sudie took her place, allowing Yin Sudie to act as the young generation's representative and build a great reputation traveling about. What happened exactly we don't know. Yet the Liuli Gate leadership seems to both love and resent Daiyuan. The cultivation resources and living quarters they provide her are no less than Yin Sudie's, but they haven't deliberately fostered or cultivated her. It's very strange."

"Indeed strange!" Yang Kai was baffled. He hadn't clashed with Yin Sudie, but he'd seen Daiyuan act; he felt that Daiyuan at the Saint King Realm standard already counted as a very fine existence. Although in the Flowing Flame Sandland she had been bullied by a Battle Sky Alliance cultivator, that was out of anger and recklessness — if she fought seriously, Daiyuan wouldn't fear that person.

However, she still lagged somewhat behind Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, and Wei Guchang and the others — that was something Yang Kai could see.

"If I help her, what do I gain or lose? I don't seem to gain anything, though I won't lose much either." Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan in curiosity.

Wu Yi giggled, "Not losing anything is enough. As for gain... heh, doing someone a favor counts for something; years ago she was very favored — who knows if she might rise again. If that day comes, having befriended such a woman will help our future development. Besides, Yang Yan seems to have other plans."

Yang Kai couldn't help but fix his gaze on Yang Yan.

Yang Yan nodded slightly and asked, "Have you heard of Liuli Gate's Thousand Illusions Glaze Mountain?"

Yang Kai shook his head honestly; he was still not well acquainted with the powers on Dark Star and had little idea what they possessed, yet Yang Yan's deliberate mention of the Thousand Illusions Glaze Mountain made it sound significant.

“The Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is a naturally formed mountain composed entirely of Thousand Illusions Glaze. It lies within the territory of the Liuli Gate, which in fact chose to establish its sect there because of this very mountain. Thousand Illusions Glaze is a precious material for artifact refinement — it possesses many transformative and self-restoring properties. I need this material — and in great quantities!” Yang Yan said solemnly.

Yang Kai laughed in surprise, "Even if you say that, there's nothing I can do — since Liuli Gate set up their sect because of the mountain, their elders certainly won't hand over the Thousand Illusions Glaze to me."

“Of course not — and we couldn’t afford it even if we could!” Yang Yan snorted. “You have no idea — that Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is one of the most renowned places on all of Dark Star. The Liuli Gate used the mountain itself as the core of a grand formation, capable of emitting the Glazed Divine Light, which can restrain the body and bind the soul. It’s said that once, when the Liuli Gate faced a great calamity, they relied on this very mountain to survive it. Moreover, the mountain is a single massive whole — cutting even a small piece of Thousand Illusions Glaze from it is almost impossible. Even the Liuli Gate themselves can only harvest a sliver once every few decades. Most of what they obtain, they keep for their own use, while a small portion is sold — and every time, the major forces go mad bidding for it. The price is outrageous! We’re broke as it is, so how could we possibly afford such a thing?”

"Penniless again?" Yang Kai was astonished. He recalled last time he'd heard from a Haike Family cultivator that Yang Yan and Wu Yi had attended an auction and consigned secret treasures for sale. Though he didn't know how many Saint Crystals they'd obtained, it couldn't have been small — so how had they spent it all?

Yang Yan looked embarrassed and fidgeted, "Laying out materials for formations consumes enormous resources. You forbade us from continuing to sell secret treasures; with no income we naturally exhausted our funds."

"Even if you're poor, you can't sell secret treasures." Yang Kai's face grew stern as he warned, "At least until we're truly powerful we can't sell them."

"I know," Yang Yan pouted. In her mind she had dreamed of melting out a hundred or eighty high‑grade secret treasures and holding an auction to solve matters at once, but faced with Yang Kai's decree and Wu Yi's counsel she had not carried out that mad plan.

"Continue about that Thousand Illusions Glaze." Yang Kai smirked at her, "What exactly are you planning? How do you expect me to obtain that material under Liuli Gate's nose?"

Yang Yan chuckled and clapped her small hand, calling, "Xiaoxiao!"

At that moment a gray, grimy figure suddenly rushed in from outside and froze in front of the three of them, hunched over, hands hanging to its knees, its two eyes looking innocently at Yang Yan.

It was Yang Kai's Stone Puppet!

Yang Kai's eyes lit up; he immediately understood what Yang Yan intended.

"Xiaoxiao can treat even the restriction arrays I set as nothing; sneaking into Liuli Gate will be child's play. I refuse to believe Liuli Gate's formations are superior to mine. Once you take it into Liuli Gate, hehe, a great hollow will surely be opened within the Thousand Illusions Glaze Mountain."

Hearing that, Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat down his back.

The Liuli Gate is truly blessed with outrageous fortune! Of all things, they just had to possess something like the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain. They probably think that, with their countless protective sect formations surrounding it, not even a fly could hope to get inside.

But how could they have imagined that this world harbors things like stone puppets which defy the heavens?

As the saying goes, it’s not the thief who steals that’s to be feared, but the one who keeps thinking about stealing — and now Yang Yan had set her sights on the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain.

Stone puppets naturally love to devour rare minerals; since the Thousand Illusions Glaze can be used to forge instruments, it is surely among their favorites. Stone puppets come and go without a trace, lacking any life‑energy fluctuation; even an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm couldn't detect them. Sending a stone puppet in to take some Thousand Illusions Glaze would be effortless.

By the time Yang Kai left Liuli Gate with the stone puppet, Liuli Gate's elders would likely not notice the Thousand Illusions Glaze Mountain had lost much.

"I've long wanted that Thousand Illusions Glaze but never had the chance. Now that someone has come asking you to go — this is the best opportunity." Yang Yan finished, looking at Yang Kai with hopeful eyes.

"What do you intend to forge with the Thousand Illusions Glaze?" Yang Kai remained uneasy and frowned. Breaking into another sect to steal invites grudges if discovered; if Yang Yan planned to make something trivial, he wouldn't want to offend them.

"To forge an item!" Yang Yan smiled mysteriously without elaborating, only saying, "I can't say now because I'm not certain myself; my knowledge of forging and formations isn't sufficient. But I can tell you this: that material will be of great use to you as well. It won't disappoint; once the item is forged you'll be glad you chose to go."

"Another secret!" Yang Kai said with a bitter smile. These women today had some sort of sickness — always vague and dangling information, making him gnash his teeth powerlessly.

"So will you go to Liuli Gate or not!" Yang Yan urged.

"I'll think about it." Yang Kai was tempted but this was no trivial matter and required care.

“Come on, let’s go, please?” Yang Yan pleaded, and as she spoke, she took something out from her ring and waved it at Yang Kai. “It just so happens we can look for this along the way too. If we’re lucky, it might even help ease our current predicament!”

Yang Kai glanced at the object in her hand and couldn't help but be moved.

"Eldest Brother Yang, you should agree to Sister Yang Yan, and besides, I see you've been in seclusion a long time — it's time to go out and relax; perhaps this trip will bring other gains." Wu Yi urged as well, but her argument was subtler and began from Yang Kai's seclusion.
