## Chapter 2490 — Let This Old Man Give It a Try

"What’s so formidable about this Illusory Heaven Butterfly? Can we join forces to suppress it?" Liang Qiu asked nervously, wiping sweat from his brow.

Lan Xun sneered, "Among the Ancient Divine Spirits, the Illusory Heaven Butterfly’s attack power is the weakest. It can’t even compare to an ordinary Tenth-Tier demonic beast!"

"Really?" Liang Qiu was overjoyed at her words. If it couldn’t even match a regular Tenth-Tier demonic beast, what was there to fear? With so many experts present, anyone could suppress it with a single move.

Lan Xun continued, "But it’s innately skilled in illusions. Once it fully manifests, it can turn the world upside down! Even a Great Emperor would find it hard to guard against its illusions. Which Ancient Divine Spirit is easy to provoke?"

Liang Qiu’s face darkened. "I think... I should run. That little girl keeps staring at me, making this Young Master’s heart uneasy."

"Run?" Lan Xun looked at him coldly. "Where could you possibly run? Xiaoqi has already set her sights on you. Even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you’re still dead!"

"If I don’t run, am I supposed to just wait for death?" Liang Qiu retorted angrily.

Lan Xun said, "If you don’t run, only you will die. But if you do, everyone here will suffer first!"

Everyone’s expression changed at her words.

Xia Sheng exclaimed, "Princess Lan Xun, is that really true?"

Lan Xun said, "Don’t be fooled by the Illusory Heaven Butterfly’s graceful form. Among the Ancient Divine Spirits, it’s also one of the most bloodthirsty."

"Then what should we do now?" Yao Si asked. Though he was the son of a Great Emperor, he truly didn’t understand this Sacred Soul Seal business. For some reason, Lan Xun seemed to know about it.

Lan Xun fell silent for a moment, then said, "There might be a way to stabilize the situation." As she spoke, her beautiful eyes turned to Liang Qiu.

Liang Qiu frowned. "Why are you looking at me? Sure, I have something to do with her becoming like this, but not much, right? Besides, I don’t have the ability to reseal a Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence!"

Lan Xun smiled faintly. "You don’t need to seal anything. Xiaoqi just wants you dead. If you die... maybe her emotions will calm down."

"You want me dead?" Liang Qiu was horrified, stumbling back several steps and glaring at Lan Xun. "You actually want me dead? What right do you have to demand that?"

Lan Xun snorted, "It’s the only way I can think of."

Liang Qiu raged, "A bee’s sting, a viper’s fangs—neither is as poisonous as a woman’s heart!"

Lan Xun’s suggestion was naturally unacceptable to him. He’d finally advanced to the Emperor Realm in this Shattered Star Sea—how could he just die so easily?

"Watch your mouth, brat!" Xiao Chen barked, "Her Highness is giving you face by letting you die. Don’t be ungrateful!"

Liang Qiu sneered, "If she wanted you dead, would you die?"

Xiao Chen said, "Her Highness is always reasonable. She wouldn’t make such a request of me."

"Dodging the point, cowardly rat! What right do you have to lecture me?" Liang Qiu scoffed.

Xiao Chen flew into a rage, brandishing his longsword at Liang Qiu. "Today, you die whether you want to or not! It’s not up to you!"

Liang Qiu was about to retort when Yao Si suddenly stepped in front of him. He said calmly, "Brother Liang is my friend. If anyone wants his life, they’ll have to get through me first!"

Liang Qiu, standing behind him, hadn’t expected Yao Si to speak up for him at this moment. His heart warmed, and he whispered, "Thanks, Brother Yao Si. But honestly, this is partly my fault. I’d better run. If I can lure that girl away, great. If not, you all be careful!"

Yao Si said, "You’re involved, but it’s even more related to that kid named Yang."

Liang Qiu was stunned. "That’s right. She became like this entirely because of that kid." As he spoke, he shouted angrily at Yang Kai, "Kid, you can’t just wash your hands of this!"

Yang Kai snorted, "When did I ever say I was washing my hands of it?"

Liang Qiu said, "Since that girl cares so much about you, even breaking the Sacred Soul Seal for you, why don’t you go calm her down? Maybe she’ll regain her senses!"

Liang Qiu was just speaking offhand, but Yang Kai’s expression changed as he listened. He looked at Lan Xun, "Junior Sister Lan, would that work?"

Lan Xun frowned slightly. "I don’t know. Maybe it’s worth a try, but you’ll have to hurry. The seal is almost completely undone."

Yang Kai nodded without hesitation and immediately flew toward Mo Xiaoqi.

In the void, countless eyes watched Yang Kai nervously. The conversation here had naturally reached the ears of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators, and though most didn’t understand what was happening, it clearly seemed serious. Now that Yang Kai was approaching Mo Xiaoqi to try to resolve things, everyone’s attention was fixed on him.

As Yang Kai drew closer, he softly called out to Mo Xiaoqi, but she didn’t respond at all. He immediately realized she must have truly lost consciousness. He could only carefully release his Divine Sense, hoping to attract her true awareness.

Soon, Yang Kai was not far from Mo Xiaoqi and reached out toward her.

The void was utterly silent. Everyone held their breath, hearts pounding, eyes glued to Yang Kai’s every move, not daring to miss a thing.

Just as Yang Kai’s hand was about to touch Mo Xiaoqi, her delicate body suddenly trembled. The Illusory Heaven Butterfly circling her spread its wings, and an invisible force instantly swept out.

Yang Kai froze in place, his eyes going blank.

"Not good!" Lan Xun’s heart sank. With a glance, she could tell Yang Kai had fallen into an illusion, unable to extricate himself.

"Useless! Looks like this Young Master still has to run!" Liang Qiu shouted in frustration, his face full of disappointment.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s vacant eyes suddenly flickered. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood, rapidly retreating over a hundred zhang from Mo Xiaoqi. When he finally stopped, his face was deathly pale, and his clothes were drenched in sweat.

"Incredible!" Yang Kai looked at Mo Xiaoqi with lingering fear. Just now, he hadn’t felt anything, but the scenery before his eyes had suddenly changed. The whole world was nothing but a giant butterfly dancing, and his mind was completely captivated.

He knew it was the Illusory Heaven Butterfly’s illusion, but he simply couldn’t break free.

If not for the Warm Spirit Lotus acting at the critical moment and giving him a sliver of clarity, he would have been doomed.

His Divine Soul was extremely strong, far surpassing ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators, yet even he couldn’t resist the Illusory Heaven Butterfly’s illusion. No one present could possibly withstand it. And judging by the situation, Mo Xiaoqi’s seal wasn’t even fully undone yet. If it was, this place would become a living hell.

If the elites of all four Star Realm territories perished here, the entire Star Realm wouldn’t recover for at least five hundred years.

"Junior Sister Lan, is there really no other way to reseal it?" Yang Kai asked, panting.

Lan Xun looked utterly hopeless and slowly shook her head.

Liang Qiu’s face was ashen. “We’d better just run for it. Life and death are up to fate, and fortune is in Heaven’s hands…” Of everyone here, he was the most eager to escape—after all, Mo Xiaoqi had been staring at him nonstop since just now.

The others had no better ideas. Hearing this, they grew solemn, quietly circulating their Origin Qi, ready to flee at any moment.

Just then, a voice suddenly rang out from afar: "If none of you mind, let this old man give it a try?"

The moment those words sounded, everyone's attention snapped to him.

When they saw who had spoken, expressions shifted.

It was the old swindler.

Of everyone present, only Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi had dealt with this old swindler before. The rest were meeting him for the first time, but at this moment, his immortal-like bearing didn’t match his reputation as a conman at all.

If he’d stepped out in his usual guise, he’d probably have been blasted to pieces on the spot.

"You..." Lan Xun looked at the old swindler, a trace of doubt in her beautiful eyes. She felt she’d seen him somewhere before, but no matter how hard she tried, her mind was blank.

Yao Si’s expression instantly grew grave. Though his feeling was different from Lan Xun’s, this old man gave him an extremely unsettling sense. Sweeping his Divine Sense over, he was shocked to find nothing at all where the old man stood.

In other words, with his Emperor Realm cultivation, he couldn’t even sense the old man’s presence.

This was even more shocking than when Yang Kai had taken Liang Qiu’s blow head-on.

"Where did you pop out from, old man? Why didn’t I see you before?" Liang Qiu’s eyes were wide as eggs. If the old swindler hadn’t spoken up, Liang Qiu would never have noticed him.

"Heh, this old man has been here all along. My meager cultivation isn’t worthy of Young Master’s attention, so naturally you didn’t notice!" The old swindler smiled faintly.

"How strange, how truly strange!" Liang Qiu muttered in bewilderment, his face full of confusion. "There are odd happenings every year, but this year there seem to be even more than usual."

As he spoke, the old swindler walked step by step toward Mo Xiaoqi. Having seen what happened to Yang Kai, he still looked completely unafraid, which was rather admirable.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. "Sir, aren’t you a seller of Spiritual Pills and Medicine? You know about Divine Spirit seals too?"

Unlike the others, Yang Kai knew this old swindler a bit, so he was a hundred times more wary. The old man was a master of trickery—who knew what he was up to now? Yang Kai didn’t care if he died, but if he dragged Mo Xiaoqi down with him, or made her condition worse, that would be a real problem.

The old man smiled, "When you live long enough, you learn a bit of everything. Spiritual Pills and Medicines have long since sold out, so I had to change professions."

Yang Kai’s face was grim. "So now you’re in the seal business?"

"You know him?" Lan Xun looked at Yang Kai in surprise.
