## Chapter 1052 — I Didn't Peek

In the main hall, Yang Kai trudged forward with difficulty, the pressure bearing down like a mountain; sweat beaded finely on his brow as every muscle in his body spasmed and writhed to withstand assaults from all sides, his thoughts full of curses.

Xue Yue — this woman always behaved haughtily, untouchable; nobody dared be rude to her. She clearly had no idea that trouble can start with a careless word, and her outburst had dragged me, who had followed her, into this mess as well.

Feeling the deliberately emitted aura from Halika, a hidden chill flashed through Xue Yue's beautiful eyes. At her waist, a jade pendant gleamed, and one by one strange-shaped exotic beasts suddenly burst forth and charged out. These beasts roared soundlessly and raced about, forming a ring of soul-defense around Xue Yue that halted Halika's impact.

Ripples spread in circles, as if something had shattered. The arduous steps Xue Yue had just been taking suddenly became easy; she lifted her head slightly and strode forward with a light step.

Even Yang Kai, who had been unable to move, felt the pressure drain away.

It was as if, beneath that ring of exotic beasts, the branch leader Halika's momentum had been instantly dissipated and utterly destroyed.

Yang Kai relaxed all at once. He couldn't help glancing at Xue Yue's slender waist and thought to himself that, as the heir of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, the things she wore were clearly top-tier Secret Treasures!

"An Origin-Grade Divine Soul Secret Treasure?" Halika, seated and looking coldly this way, couldn't help paling slightly. The outward pressure he had displayed receded, and surprise appeared on his face.

Not just anyone could possess a Divine Soul Secret Treasure of that caliber. Halika immediately realized Xue Yue must be of some extraordinary background. Before he understood her identity and purpose, he dared not act rashly as he had moments before.

He glanced at Yang Kai again but did not take him seriously, instead turning to Xue Yue and asking, "What is the Young Lady called?"

Xue Yue smiled sweetly and said, "Xue'er."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he stood quietly not far behind her, pretending to be a guard.

"Miss Xue'er..." Halika inclined his head slightly. "May I ask what business you have?"

Xue Yue did not answer. She produced the token from before and handed it over.

Halika took it; his face changed and he finally rose from his chair. He cupped his fists and said, "So you are someone of Young Master Xue Yue. Miss Xue'er, please excuse my poor eyesight and lack of perception just now—do not blame this old man!"

Saying that, he respectfully returned the token.

"No need for such formalities," Xue Yue took it boldly, glanced around, and then walked to a nearby chair and sat down.

Halika remained standing, his expression puzzled. After a moment's thought he asked, "Miss Xue'er, when will Young Master Xue Yue be arriving?"

"He can't come," Xue Yue said with a grin. "He has some matters to handle and can't spare the time for now."

"Young Master Xue Yue can't come?" Halika was slightly stunned and hesitated, "Then about matters here..."

"He said he entrusted all matters here to me. Branch Leader, you only need to cooperate with me," Xue Yue put on an overbearing, imperious air.

"Entrusted with full authority?" Halika couldn't help but frown, his gaze on Xue'er tinged with distrust. "Pardon my presumption, Miss Xue'er—what exactly is your relation to Young Master Xue Yue?"

Xue Yue pursed her lips and smiled with abundant charm. "He entrusted such important affairs to me—what do you think I am to him?"

Halika's face lit with sudden comprehension and he looked at Xue Yue with a much more ambiguous expression, inwardly moved. He thought that Young Master Xue Yue had finally been moved by a woman like any other man. In the past, nobody had heard of Young Master Xue Yue caring for a woman; no matter how breathtaking a woman's beauty, he wouldn't glance twice.

Many of the guild's older generation had worried for Young Master Xue Yue, unsure if something was wrong with him physically or mentally.

Now it seemed he had simply never met a woman who struck his heart.

But... why did this Miss Xue'er bear a three-part resemblance to Young Master Xue Yue?

Could this girl be the illicit offspring Chairman Ai Ou sired in his romantic escapades? If so, her true relationship with Young Master Xue Yue would be...

Those thoughts flashed through Halika's mind, making him shiver and his expression grow stranger.

"Miss Xue'er, about that ancient—" Halika was about to brief her on the progress when Xue Yue raised a hand to cut him off.

"Let's talk tomorrow. I just arrived and I'm tired from the journey; I'll rest one night. It's not too late to handle things tomorrow."

Halika thought for a moment and nodded. "Very well. I'll have someone escort the Young Lady to rest."

With that he shouted out. Soon the guards at the door entered upon command. Halika instructed them briefly, bowed, and escorted Xue Yue out.

Yang Kai remained silent, following behind Xue Yue, his face thoughtful.

Although Halika hadn't finished speaking, Yang Kai indeed heard the words "ancient" and couldn't help but be curious what had happened on this cultivation star to involve something ancient, requiring someone like Xue Yue to come personally.

Whatever it was, it certainly would not be trivial.

Xue Yue had cut Halika off, clearly not wanting Yang Kai to hear that level of secrecy. She was genuinely amicable toward Yang Kai, but these were the guild's secrets and couldn't be leaked casually.

Yang Kai understood this and did not press further.

They rode with the guards across the mountains and soon arrived at a scenic, picturesque spot, secluded from the noisy branch center—a perfect place to rest.

It was an independent pavilion, exquisite yet grand.

Outside the pavilion were little bridges and flowing water, with natural steaming hot springs for bathing. Upon seeing it, Xue Yue's eyes lit up; she suddenly remembered she hadn't bathed in a long time. These past months she and Yang Kai had been racing across the star domain, hiding on that dust-smeared dead star; despite their decent cultivation, they were already covered in grime.

Seeing the natural hot spring, her delicate body tingled with temptation.

After the guards left, Xue Yue walked around the pavilion beside the mountain and water, clapped her hands and laughed, "Halika is quite capable of arranging things—he set me up in such a fine place. I never thought he was this clever."

Yang Kai sneered, "If you keep living like this, you'll find many things you couldn't see before."

Hearing that, Xue Yue thought for a moment and nodded, "You're right. An identity, a life—it's curious. But sadly I can't live in this guise forever. Once matters here are settled, I'll return to Shuiyue Star and resume my identity as Third Young Master Xue Yue."

Once they found the master who had once forged that Secret Treasure and had him craft one that could conceal gender, she could return to her former life.

"Enough talk." She suddenly grew a little listless, twirled elegantly, skirt swirling, and said, "I'm going to bathe and wash away the dust of this journey. You mustn't peek; if I catch you with ill intent..."

As she spoke she clenched a fist and swung it toward Yang Kai, then strode toward the natural bathing pool.

By the pool she loosened her robes, stripping while keeping a wary eye on Yang Kai's movements.

From her observations, she had concluded Yang Kai was not an upright sort; he was certainly capable of peeping in secret.

Hence the warning in advance.

But to her surprise, even after she submerged her sumptuous softness into the steaming pool, Yang Kai remained utterly motionless; he seemed to stand frozen in place.

She was a bit astonished and thought she'd been mistaken about Yang Kai's nature, believing he might actually be quite honest.

Just as she thought this, Yang Kai suddenly leapt into the air above the pool and then plummeted straight down; before he hit the water his clothes had already been stripped clean.

Plop...

Water splashed everywhere; the pool already shrouded in mist grew even denser and nothing could be seen.

"Yang Kai!" Xue Yue ground her teeth and called out fiercely with murderous intent.

Yang Kai leaned against the stone wall on the other side of the hot spring, looking nonchalant. "I wanted to wash away the dust from the journey too, and I didn't peek..."

He openly fixed his gaze toward Xue Yue.

Xue Yue was furious, cursing him a shameless pervert and withdrawing deeper into the water.

Her perfect body was veiled by white mist and faintly shimmering seven-colored light, obscuring the view but making it all the more tantalizing, making one itch to move closer and see how utterly intoxicating that hidden form was.

"You and I have long been intimate—only one step separates us. Why be shy about bathing together now?" Yang Kai curled his lips, unable to fathom what was going on in this woman's mind.

"Don't say another word!" Xue Yue snapped. A water jet shot over at him, and he dodged with a tilt of his head. "If you talk nonsense again I'll tear your mouth apart."

"I'm not talking nonsense; I'm stating facts!" Yang Kai chuckled oddly.

Xue Yue said nothing in reply, only the continuous sound of blowing bubbles could be heard.

Yang Kai no longer bothered her and contented himself with enjoying the warmth of the natural pool.

After a while, Xue Yue suddenly said, "Tomorrow I'll accompany Branch Leader Halika to handle some affairs, so I won't be taking you along."

"I know."

"Your strength is too low; it might be dangerous if you went along, so..."

"No need to explain." Yang Kai shook his head. "I know my limits and I won't pry into secrets I shouldn't. Some things are safer the less one knows."

"Good that you understand." Xue Yue smiled faintly.

"I'm going to rest." Yang Kai rose, circulated his Saint Yuan to dry himself, dressed, and headed toward the pavilion.

Watching Yang Kai's departing back through the mist, Xue Yue felt a sudden urge to tell him everything—the overwhelming impulse to reveal all!
