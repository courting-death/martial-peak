## Chapter 1292 — Delving Deep

If he could truly win the beauty, Wang Yuhan would not only have a lovely companion at his side; he might even leverage that connection to enter the Qiantian Sect. Two gains with one action—how could he not be eager?

But after meeting her several times and openly and covertly expressing his admiration, Shen Shitao gave him no sign of interest. Over time Wang Yuhan lost heart and no longer intended to pester Shen Shitao, lest he only make her unhappy.

However, while chatting with his Junior Brother Shen Fanlei on one occasion, he inadvertently heard an utterly shocking piece of news.

It turned out that Shen Shitao now possessed a fortune of a million Saint Crystals, and she even had several Origin-Grade, Upper-Level Secret Treasures in her hands!

It seemed that this wealth was precisely what she had obtained from the Flowing Flame Sandland. According to Shen Fanlei, his elder sister had been quite fortunate there—she had discovered a Saint Crystal vein within the Flowing Flame Sandland and mined a large quantity of Saint Crystals. Although she later handed over most of her gains to the Sect upon returning, she still kept a portion for herself. Moreover, the elders of the Qiantian Sect had rewarded her with countless Secret Treasures and Pills.

Those few Origin-Grade, Upper-Level Secret Treasures were precisely gifts from the high ranks of the Qiantian Sect!

Shen Fanlei was simple-minded by nature, straightforward and carefree, and he got along very well with Wang Yuhan. Thus, when he spoke of such matters, he had no sense of reservation. But while he spoke without intent, the listener was not without a heart—Wang Yuhan, who had originally given up on Shen Shitao, once again felt his desire stir.

This time Shen Fanlei had come out to use a hidden Thunder Pool here to cultivate a secret art and break through his current bottleneck. Wang Yuhan immediately suggested inviting Shen Shitao as well. The plan went down smoothly: his Junior Brother needed to break through, and as his sister Shen Shitao would naturally be duty‑bound to guard him. She promptly hurried out from the Qiantian Sect with Lü Ying and met the two at the outskirts of Zangxiong Valley, then they entered together.

At first everything went well, but two days earlier they accidentally tripped a restriction and were trapped. That was when that brat Yang Kai showed up. Seeing Shen Shitao taking a special interest in him, Wang Yuhan naturally grew extremely wary and began to take aim.

Now it seemed his approach had offended the beauty. Wang Yuhan stood with a sullen expression, pondered for a moment, then shook his head helplessly and followed, approaching the Thunder Pool with the others while secretly plotting how to win Shen Shitao's heart.

And indeed, as he thought of it that way, a fine idea suddenly came to him. A smile spread across his face at once, and he began planning how to find the right opportunity to put his scheme into action.

Elsewhere, after parting from Shen Shitao and the others, Yang Kai led Yang Yan back along their original route. After traveling several dozen li they stopped and rested.

"This is Zangxiong Valley?" Yang Yan, hearing Yang Kai describe the place, was not startled but instead showed a delighted expression, eager and raring to go.

"What do you want to do?" Yang Kai frowned and asked, feeling a sudden unease.

"Nothing… but if this truly is a great sect's ruin, it will be riddled with restrictions and formations!" Yang Yan's beautiful eyes glittered oddly; Yang Kai read an excitement there.

Gently rubbing his forehead, Yang Kai said, “Since we’ve come all this way, I’ve no intention of turning back. But where exactly do those two fragmentary maps point to? If it isn’t deeper within, then there’s no need for us to complicate things further.”

“Heehee, sorry to disappoint you—the direction they point to really is deeper inside. But don’t worry! There’s no restriction or formation in this world that I can’t break. We won’t run into any trouble here. If anyone were still alive in this place, I couldn’t make any promises, but the restrictions and formations left behind now are dead ones—without anyone to control them, they can’t exert their full power. How could something like that possibly stop me?” she said, her face full of confidence.

Yang Kai's spirit lifted and he nodded. "Very well. Since you say so, we'll push deeper and see whether the fragments point to the Guyang Sect's secret cave. If so, you'll be free to requisition materials for refining and array placement as you like."

Yang Yan brightened and couldn't wait to urge Yang Kai to set off.

The two made a wide detour to avoid an awkward run‑in with Shen Shitao and the others, then continued deeper into the ruins.

Shen Shitao’s words were not wrong in the least. In the outer area, the restrictions and formations they encountered were not particularly powerful. Those few, like the one that had trapped them earlier, were already among the strongest. None of these could hinder Yang Yan's deciphering—some took only a dozen breaths, others at most the time of one incense stick—before every restriction was cleanly undone.

With Yang Yan and Yang Kai together, they passed through unimpeded.

Five days later they seemed to have reached the inner circle of the Guyang Sect. Here and there ruined walls and shattered buildings showed that countless structures once stood in rows, now reduced to debris.

The restrictions and arrays they encountered here were in both grade and potency far stronger than before, and Yang Yan untangled them with extra care.

These formations had existed for so long they had become unstable; as Yang Yan worked to break them, unpredictable situations sometimes arose, and Yang Kai took up the duty of protecting her.

Yang Kai had meant to scour the ruins for anything of value, but soon abandoned the impractical idea.

Zangxiong Valley has existed for over two thousand years. Countless warriors have poured into this place; even the inner reaches have been trod by many a strong expert. So if anything good had been here, it had surely long since fallen into others' hands.

One day Yang Yan stared at a vast empty ground ahead and suddenly lifted both hands. A number of bizarre objects—like Secret Treasures—were blasted outward by her. They flashed and vanished into the void.

Yang Kai was unsurprised; he remained behind Yang Yan with Saint Yuan quietly coalesced, ready to act.

Yang Yan closed her eyes to sense for a moment, a smile curling at her lips. She turned to Yang Kai and said, "There was a great array here. Breaking it might take a while."

"Can we go around it?" he asked.

"Don't!" Yang Yan pleaded, eyes imploring. "We could bypass it, but it's rare to find an array like this. I want to break it. As I've told you before, the more I study arrays and refining, the more knowledge fills my mind in both fields. This is a great opportunity—breaking it will further my growth no less than actually refining or laying arrays, and it saves a pile of material costs."

Yang Kai shook his head helplessly and worriedly asked, "Is it dangerous?"

"Absolutely not!" Yang Yan wagged her head like a rattle.

"Alright then, go ahead. How long will it take?" Yang Kai asked.

"Two or three days. You can busy yourself and let the time pass,"
Yang Yan stuck out her tongue and immediately ignored him, throwing herself into the array.

Yang Kai didn't disturb her. After a moment he gestured and a Void King-Grade, Upper-Level refining furnace materialized. Its surface shimmered as it rapidly expanded until it reached about a one zhang diameter and then stopped.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged and with a flick of Divine Sense the furnace gave out a clear, high sound. The Fire Bird artifact spirit flew out, joyfully circled the furnace a few times, then dove back in and began spewing pure fire Spiritual Qi from its beak to refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl within.

Yang Kai did not idle either; he actively poured Saint Yuan into the furnace to strengthen its power, and with divided attention continued cultivating his Golden Blood Threads technique.

Killing time was easy. Whether cultivating the Golden Blood Threads or refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, both processes consumed a great deal of time, and thus nothing was wasted for Yang Kai.

That was why he did not oppose Yang Yan breaking the array here—if he could do nothing else, at least he would not squander the time.

Time passed quickly. Yang Kai was deep in the insights of the Golden Blood Threads technique when a faint sound came from ahead. Looking up he saw a vast area before them glittering, the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth wildly chaotic. Yang Yan stood to one side grinning as she retrieved the items she had earlier flung outward.

Moments later the light dimmed. Yang Kai felt that something was missing from the empty ground ahead and immediately understood: the great array laid here had been broken by Yang Yan.

He drew in the refining furnace and its artifact spirit and rose. "Finished?"

"Mm. Let's move on. I'm growing more fond of places like this. I should've gone with you into the Flowing Flame Sandland last time—I heard there were quite a few arrays there."

"If you had gone you'd likely have been disappointed. There aren't many arrays, but... I did see the ruins of an ancient sect inside that seemed remarkably intact. It would likely suit your tastes."

Yang Yan sighed. "A pity there's no chance now. Who knows how many years until the Flowing Flame Sandland opens again."

The two continued onward, talking as they went.

Along the way the restrictions and arrays they encountered indeed grew far fiercer. Each time Yang Yan unraveled one it required enormous time—no longer the light work of before.

Even so, Yang Kai watched in alarm. These arrays, despite their age, were the internal defenses of a great sect. For them to be so casually dismantled by Yang Yan—what would those who set them have thought if they knew?

Observing closely, Yang Kai saw that every time Yang Yan broke an array she smiled continuously; she was clearly reaping considerable gains.

On that account alone the trip had been worthwhile. Yang Yan's work would yield her great benefit and, invisibly, save Dragon Lair Mountain a great deal of expense.

Yang Kai had gained little, but he had lost nothing either. He could use the time to attend to his own matters—truly a case of multiple gains with one action.

Yang Kai even thought to himself that, in future if there were not enough funds to buy her materials, he might seek out places like this and have Yang Yan break the arrays.

Given how vast Dark Star is, there should be many places like Zangxiong Valley.
