## Chapter 707 — Lost Again

Watching Zhou Liang approaching with a sullen expression, Yang Kai felt his qi seem to be suppressed by the other's overwhelming aura; his hands and feet went icy and he could not move at all.

A Saint Realm expert was two major Stages above him; if the man truly wished to kill, he would have no strength to resist, and even Fei Yu could not escape that calamity.

Zhai Yao, standing behind Yang Kai, suddenly murmured softly, and both Yang Kai and Fei Yu looked startled and suspicious.

Zhou Liang ignored Yang Kai and Fei Yu, strode straight up to Zhai Yao, and urgently asked, "Young Master Zhai, are you injured?"

His voice carried urgency and concern, with faint traces of worry and fear, as if he greatly dreaded that Zhai Yao had been harmed in the recent fight.

The entire hall erupted; Nie Chufeng's smile froze on her face, she stood dumbstruck, and Nie Cong gaped with utter disbelief.

"It's nothing." Zhai Yao shook his head slowly.

"That's good." Zhou Liang exhaled lightly, relaxing; lingering fright showed between his brows as he said gently, "Young Master Zhai was startled. Zhou Liang arrived late—please do not hold it against me."

Zhai Yao smiled faintly. "No matter."

Only then did Zhou Liang glance at Yang Kai and Fei Yu, nodding slightly as he asked, "Are they Young Master Zhai's friends?"

"Yes." Zhai Yao smiled, "New acquaintances."

Zhou Liang's expression immediately softened; looking approvingly at Yang Kai he said, "The young are formidable. Since they are Young Master Zhai's friends, they are honored guests of my Fuyun City. Rest assured, I will give you an explanation for this matter!"

As he spoke his expression turned cold, like the eve of a storm; he pivoted and strode toward Nie Chufeng.

Nie Chufeng still had not come to her senses, her gaze was scattered—she could not accept the scene before her.

Although Zhai Yao had earlier produced Ao Gu's Golden Dragon Token, that merely signified he was Ao Gu's guest; why then did Zhou Liang treat him with such courtesy, even to the point of overt flattery?

Could there be a force behind this young man that even Zhou Liang feared dreadfully?

When she recovered herself, Zhou Liang was already standing before her.

"Uncle Zhou..." Sensing Zhou Liang's anger and annoyance, Nie Cong's face turned pale and he staggered, calling out hastily.

Smack...

A thunderous slap rang out; Nie Cong was flung like a sack of rags, tumbled several times through the air, crashed to the ground without a sound, and lost consciousness.

"Zhou Liang, what are you doing?" Nie Chufeng's lovely eyes cleared. Seeing Nie Cong struck unconscious, she screamed hoarsely.

Smack...

Another crisp slap sounded; a row of finger marks bloomed across Nie Chufeng's pretty face, and vermilion blood seeped from the corner of her thin lips.

She clutched her cheek, her beautiful eyes trembling. Terrified and aghast at the man who had always cherished her, she suddenly found him utterly strange.

The coldness on Zhou Liang's face plunged her as if into an ice cellar; an infinite chill rose in her heart.

"Wretched wench, do you know what crime you have committed?" Zhou Liang asked coldly.

Nie Chufeng, stunned, shook her head.

"Ignorant woman!" Zhou Liang's gaze sharpened. "All these years you have used my name to commit evil in Fuyun City with your bastard, swindling and preying on others. I turned a blind eye and indulged you. But today, I can no longer tolerate you!"

"Why?" Nie Chufeng shrieked.

"You offended someone you should not have!" Zhou Liang's expression was indifferent. "Leave—take your bastard and get as far away as you can. From this day forth, never set foot in Fuyun City again. If I see you here, you know the consequence."

Nie Chufeng's features drained of color; her face went pale as she stared at Zhou Liang in stunned disbelief—she had not expected him to be so heartless.

"Get out of here now!" Seeing she did not move, Zhou Liang roared.

Sensing Zhou Liang's murderous intent, Nie Chufeng's delicate body trembled; she immediately realized he was not joking and finally understood how powerful the force behind Zhai Yao truly was.

Nie Chufeng was certain that even if she had offended the Ao Gu family, Zhou Liang would never have dealt with her like this; his remorseless cruelty made clear to her the terrifying might backing Zhai Yao.

It was a hulking power that even Zhou Liang had to watch his step around.

Understanding this, Nie Chufeng broke into bitter sobs and begged, "Zhou Liang, don't be so cruel. I know I was wrong—may I apologize to him? I will never provoke him again."

Nie Chufeng was only a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivator—no sect, no backing—who had relied on her beauty and body to win Zhou Liang's favor and thus lived a life of ease in Fuyun City; without Zhou Liang, with her strength and means she could never have done so.

Over the years she had made many enemies in Fuyun City.

She knew all too well what fate awaited once she was no longer under Zhou Liang's protection.

In full view of everyone, Nie Chufeng fell to her knees, clinging to Zhou Liang's leg and begging loudly.

The onlookers did not pity the beautiful woman; most instead showed expressions of satisfaction.

This beauty was clearly unpopular in Fuyun City; she had committed many wrongs.

Zhou Liang remained unmoved, looking down at her coldly.

Nie Chufeng grew desperate, knowing he would not change his mind. Her expression suddenly steadied; she smoothed the stray hair at her ear, rose slowly and said, "Zhou Liang, you may expel me—I will not complain. But for the sake of our years together I have one request. If you agree, I will leave at once!"

Gazing at her lovely face, Zhou Liang's expression flickered as if recalling past tenderness. He sighed faintly, "Speak. I may grant your final wish."

Nie Chufeng forced a smile and whispered, "Last night you said a very skilled alchemist had come to the city lord's mansion. Could you ask him to help concoct a pill to reattach my son's severed arm? Since you say he is so skilled, surely he could craft such a pill?"

"It can be made." Zhou Liang nodded.

"Then..." Nie Chufeng's face lit up.

"But I cannot fulfill that request."

"Why?" Nie Chufeng grew hysterical. "We were once husband and wife—are you truly so heartless and unjust?"

"It's not that I'm heartless; you're simply foolish." Zhou Liang leaned in and whispered in Nie Chufeng's ear, "The young man you offended is the sole disciple of that alchemical master. That master—Ao Gu—is someone even Jin Jiao and I dare not provoke."

Nie Chufeng's lovely eyes widened in an instant.

"Get out." Zhou Liang waved his hand. "I hope you will not be so short-sighted in the future."

Nie Chufeng's face twisted with bitter anger; she bit her thin lips until blood seeped out, then bent to lift the unconscious Nie Cong. She cast a look full of venom at Zhou Liang and Zhai Yao, then used her movement technique to vanish swiftly from sight.

Many in the crowd withdrew with cold expressions and quietly followed after Nie Chufeng.

Those who bore grudges sought to settle scores—now was the time to reckon with this venomous woman.

Zhou Liang witnessed it all but did not intervene.

"That woman is as good as dead," Yang Kai murmured.

"Serves her right," Fei Yu sneered; she had the utmost contempt for women who traded their beauty to curry favor with the powerful yet lacked any self-awareness.

Zhou Liang approached and looked kindly at Yang Kai and Fei Yu. "Since you are Young Master Zhai's friends, why not sojourn at the city lord's mansion for a few days? There should still be some time before that Thousand-Year Demon Flower blooms."

Zhai Yao glanced at Yang Kai with some expectation, seemingly hoping he would accept the invitation to the city lord's mansion.

Yang Kai shook his head. "A few of my senior uncles are out on business. We must wait here for their return, so we will not trouble you."

"Is that so? I won't press it. If you have time, you are always welcome at the city lord's mansion." Zhou Liang smiled slightly and looked to Zhai Yao. "Young Master Zhai, let's return."

Zhai Yao acknowledged with a word, nodded to Yang Kai, and quickly left with Zhou Liang.

Silence spread; the spectators still seemed stunned by the earlier events, disbelief on every face.

For the sake of an obscure young man, Zhou Liang had struck his beloved concubine and driven her from Fuyun City—truly a display of extreme coldness and heartlessness.

Moreover, simply being connected with that young man had earned Yang Kai and Fei Yu such warm invitations from a figure like Zhou Liang.

Could the young man's backing really be that powerful?

After a long while the crowd slowly dispersed. Some busybodies hoped to pry information about Zhai Yao from Yang Kai, but Yang Kai and Fei Yu gave them no chance and had already slipped into an inn.

They were a little shaken as well.

Although they suspected Zhai Yao had some background, Yang Kai found he had still underestimated the other's origins.

He and Fei Yu speculated for a time but could not get to the heart of it and had to give up.

At the city lord's mansion, after returning, Zhai Yao immediately went to see his teacher.

In a quiet side chamber, Zhai Yao's teacher sat with his eyes closed, cultivating. Zhai Yao entered softly and waited; after a while the old man slowly opened his eyes.

"Teacher, I lost again." Zhai Yao drew a soft breath.

"Lost again?" The old man was surprised.

"Yes. Teacher, please take a look at this Spirit-Grade Pill." Zhai Yao respectfully handed over the Spirit-Grade Pill that Yang Kai had concocted.

The old man took it and his eyes lit up. "Pill Patterns?"

He extended his Divine Sense to examine it; his expression kept shifting, and he gave a soft exclamation. After a long moment he returned the Spirit-Grade Pill to Zhai Yao and, after some thought, said, "This is the pill your opponent refined?"

"Yes."

"What kind of person is he?"

"About my age." Zhai Yao hurriedly described Yang Kai's appearance.

The old man listened quietly, stroking his beard. When Zhai Yao finished he said, "This young man is indeed extraordinary."

"How so?"

"His alchemical technique is somewhat clumsy; it appears he has not undergone strict instruction. In other words, unlike you, he seems to have no teacher of his own."

"No way?" Zhai Yao exclaimed.
