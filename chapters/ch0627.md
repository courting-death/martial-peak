## Chapter 627 — Endless Regret

"How am I supposed to believe you?" Yun Xuan stared coldly at Yang Kai, disappointment shading her face. "I was originally inclined to have you join the Duao Alliance, but now that seems unnecessary. My squad's actions are led by me; I don't need others bossing us around, especially with baseless scare-mongering."

"I'm not scare-mongering…"

"Produce proof, or don't speak." Yun Xuan's voice was frosty.

Yang Kai shook his head helplessly and met Yun Xuan's gaze with a composed expression. "Then I won't accompany you."

Saying so, he turned and dashed outward. He had no proof; his sensing was only his one-sided claim.

"Hey, brother!" Ji Hong cried out in alarm and hurriedly called after him.

"Let him go!" Yun Xuan snapped, watching Yang Kai's retreating figure and shaking her head repeatedly.

Yang Kai's current behavior was a stark contrast to his earlier calm; Yun Xuan felt that if such a man truly joined the Duao Alliance he might pose a danger to the group, and her eagerness to recruit him cooled at once.

"Sigh…" Ji Hong sighed, looking at Yun Xuan. "Miss, he spoke with such certainty — did he really discover something?"

Yun Xuan's beautiful eyes flickered as she pondered for a moment. "Uncle Sun said there's no danger here; what could he have discovered? I didn't notice anything unusual either. He's probably overreacting."

"True!" Ji Hong nodded, placing full trust in Sun Ying's words.

Yang Kai's figure streaked through the mine tunnel at top speed. Each step he took left a deep dent in the ground, and a long afterimage trailed behind him; he had pushed his speed to its limit.

The route he had taken was already mapped in his mind; for this maze of branching tunnels he seemed to have an engraved chart in his head, every turn clear, and so he would not lose his way.

Through his Divine Sense he felt the fluctuations of that strange energy growing ever stronger — clearly something had already moved.

Yang Kai knew full well his own limits.

With cultivation at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and the methods of entering a demonic state, he was virtually invincible among Divine Roaming practitioners.

Faced with a Transcendent Realm master, Yang Kai felt no fear, but he had no confidence of victory either.

His prior slaying of the Spider Mother relied on the power of the Golden Pupil Eye within his Sea of Consciousness, and killing Xing Zong of Senluo Palace had likewise depended on the void force drawn by the Bone Shield — neither were truly his own innate ability.

Between the Transcendent and Divine Roaming Realms lay an immense gulf.

Moreover, the terrain here was ill-suited for a violent clash; should the mine collapse, everyone would be buried beneath the earth.

Thus, upon detecting a hidden enemy, Yang Kai's first thought was to get out of there as quickly as possible and make plans afterward.

It was a pity Yun Xuan had not trusted him, and Yang Kai felt helpless.

Staying to argue would only waste time, so Yang Kai decisively chose to leave.

He hoped they would be all right; besides, the Duao Alliance had a Transcendent Realm expert here — Sun Ying — whose strength was not weak and might not necessarily lose to whatever was hiding here.

At that moment another powerful energy fluctuation arrived — it came from Sun Ying.

From the faint buzzing and the slight trembling of the earth around the mine, it could be judged that Sun Ying should now be engaged in combat with that hidden foe.

Yang Kai's expression darkened and he sped up a few degrees.

At the same time, the ripples of that battle were noticed by Yun Xuan and the others.

Everyone's faces changed drastically.

"What's happening?" Yun Xuan froze.

Sun Ying had actually taken action!

As a Transcendent Realm powerhouse of the Duao Alliance who had accompanied them on this mission, he would not act rashly if there were no emergency; his duty was to ensure the team's safety and set up arrays around the perimeter to prevent the Gold Devouring Beasts from escaping.

But now that he had moved, it meant that something had appeared which Ruan Xinyu's squad or Zhou Luo's squad could not handle.

What kind of danger could compel him to act? Yun Xuan did not know, but she understood that it must be something exceedingly dreadful.

Thinking that, she suddenly recalled Yang Kai's warning; her expression turned complicated as she realized he had not been crying wolf but had truly sensed something amiss.

The earth shook violently, and the walls of the cavern crackled and snapped — the battle over there was straining the entire mine's supports.

A clash between Transcendent Realm masters could cause tremendous repercussions.

"Miss!" Ji Hong cried out.

"Move!" Yun Xuan dared not stay a moment longer; regret flooded her heart — had she known this, she should have heeded Yang Kai's counsel and led everyone outward then, which would surely have spared them much danger.

Saying this, her plump, delicate form became a streak of azure light as she chased after the direction Yang Kai had vanished in.

Ji Hong and the others followed close behind.

But after they had only run a few dozen zhang, a tremendous rumble erupted from the depths of the mine, and immediately the whole cavern suddenly collapsed. Countless massive boulders rained down and both the front and rear paths were sealed.

Yun Xuan's face went ashen. With no time to hesitate, she unleashed all her power, concentrating True Yuan to blast upward in an attempt to carve out an escape route.

The thunderous crashing never ceased. Far away Yang Kai's face had turned ashen as well — he knew his hopes had been dashed.

Sun Ying was indeed no match for that hidden enemy. In the recent collision Yang Kai had plainly felt Sun Ying's breath falter, and the destructive force unleashed by their duel had involved the entire mine.

Swearing inwardly, Yang Kai hurriedly projected his Bone Shield above him, and in the next instant he felt the falling stone pelt down like rain.

The clanging sound was ceaseless, and the weight pressing upon his arms grew ever heavier.

The mine's collapse continued for about the time it took to boil half a cup of tea. Only when things stabilized did Yang Kai, propping himself with the Bone Shield, grit his teeth — his face flushed intensely as every muscle flexed and veins stood out.

He had no idea how much rock and earth lay above him, but the weight was almost more than he could bear.

Fortunately, guarded by the Bone Shield, Yang Kai emerged unscathed.

He drew a deep breath and unleashed all his strength, surging upward in a violent burst.

A straight passage to the surface was swiftly cleared.

Moments later the pressure vanished, and Yang Kai shot out from beneath the earth. Sunlight poured down from above and the air tasted clean in his mouth and nose.

From his ears came the sound of distant birds beating their wings — the mine's collapse had disturbed those resting creatures.

Looking down, the ground was a shattered mess — across nearly a hundred li the land had subsided considerably.

The area was silent save for occasional further collapses and the faint sounds they made.

Not a single figure was in sight. Sun Ying's aura had vanished; Yun Xuan, Ruan Xinyu, and Zhou Luo were nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and searched carefully; soon, at roughly a one li distance, he detected signs of life.

He swept toward that location, arrived above the mine, poured out True Yuan, and flung slabs of boulder aside.

After a moment, he saw faint flickers of electric arcs below.

"Yun Xuan?" Yang Kai shouted; below came an eager reply: "Mm!"

Yang Kai grinned and, aiming at the spot where the arcs danced, punched down to fully open the channel, hauling Yun Xuan out as she had just shown a face.

Soon after, Ji Hong and the others also began to appear.

Many bore bruises and battered faces; most had broken bones.

Even as masters of the Divine Roaming Realm, such a large-scale mine collapse was not easily borne. Fortunately, under Yun Xuan's leadership they had struggled to pry open a path upward and had not been buried alive.

Had they been wounded and then entombed alive, even Divine Roaming practitioners would have had little hope.

Once outside, every face showed lingering terror. The feeling of having escaped death made them gasp and draw deep breaths, suddenly aware of how precious life was.

"Where's Pang Qi?" Yun Xuan turned and looked around; her pretty face blanched.

Ji Hong and the others fell silent and their expressions dimmed; they did not dare answer.

"Where is he?" Yun Xuan demanded sharply.

Ji Hong stammered, tears welling in his eyes.

Yun Xuan's delicate form trembled slightly — there was no need for further questions. She already understood the fate that had befallen the team member called Pang Qi.

"Now is not the time for that, hurry and leave!" Yang Kai said with a grave face. "You can break the arrays Sun Ying set, can't you?"

Yun Xuan came back to herself and after a long moment nodded lightly.

"Good." Yang Kai exhaled in relief.

Arrays set by a Transcendent Realm master, if not broken by proper method, would waste much time to force through. Since Yun Xuan knew how to dismantle them, there was no need for further trouble.

"But…" Yun Xuan hesitated.

"There's no 'but' — Sun Ying is already dead!" Yang Kai shook his head. He had been able to sense a faint trace of Sun Ying's aura earlier, but now there was nothing at all.

Yun Xuan's lovely eyes widened as she stared at Yang Kai, stunned and unable to accept his words.

A soft rustling came from below.

Everyone's expressions changed as they peered down.

Before long, a few figures staggered out a couple of li away from them — it was Zhou Luo, Ruan Xinyu, and the others, looking utterly ruined.

Yun Xuan cried out with joy.

Zhou Luo and Ruan Xinyu hastened over at the sound. Up close, everyone saw that each of them wore an expression of frantic terror as if they had witnessed something truly horrific.

"What about Uncle Sun?" Yun Xuan asked.

"He's dead," Ruan Xinyu murmured.

"What exactly happened?" Yun Xuan's body trembled. She had been leading her team to trap Gold Devouring Beasts and had made great gains; suddenly such a calamity occurred, and Sun Ying had died in so short a time — it was hard for her to accept.

"We don't know either," Ruan Xinyu answered, bewildered. "Something leapt out from the shadows. Uncle Sun engaged it, then… then that was it!”

It was plain she had been badly frightened. Sun Ying had been slaughtered before her eyes, and members under her and Zhou Luo had suffered grievous casualties from the shockwaves of the duel between two Transcendent Realm masters; only a handful had survived.

The unknown enemy left them in utter panic.

"We should leave at once." Zhou Luo's face was deathly pale, his prior swagger gone — a Transcendent Realm master could die in an instant. For them, remaining here would be courting death; all he wanted now was to flee this place.
