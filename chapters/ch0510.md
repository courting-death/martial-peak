## Chapter 510 — Fighting Side by Side

“It’s our turn!” Yang Kai withdrew his gaze from the sky and gently said to Su Yan.

Su Yan nodded slightly, brushed her hair behind her ear, and smiled faintly. “This seems to be the third time we’ve fought side by side!”

“Three times?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“You forgot?” Su Yan glanced at him. “The first time was in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, when you saved my life. The second was when we were at Dragon Confinement Ravine, and you covered our retreat. This here is the third.”

“The first time counts, too?”

“Of course.” Su Yan smiled happily and softly said, “The first two times, you helped me; this time… I’ll help you!”

Yang Kai tilted his head, chuckled, and nodded. “Alright!”

Watching the two quietly chatting with such ease and light-heartedness, as if they were teasing each other lovingly, Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru's noses twisted in irritation.

They felt completely disregarded.

With cold faces, four Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage experts—two from the Kang Family and two from the Qiu Family—approached Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Their movements were unhurried, expressions calm and confident, clearly certain they could capture Yang Kai.

The roughly hundred-zhang distance closed rapidly.

The smile on Yang Kai’s face gradually faded, his expression turning serious as he stared at the four approaching masters.

These four were no ordinary Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stagers; they hailed from the Eight Great Families and were each highly skilled.

“I should be able to handle one and a half,” Su Yan frowned slightly, her brows knitting as she felt considerable pressure from these four.

“About the same for me,” Yang Kai nodded gently. Based on their own strength, that was indeed the limit—but if they deployed their full arrays, all bets were off.

The four stopped ten zhang away from Yang Kai, politely cupping their fists in greeting. “Ninth Young Master, sorry for the offense.”

“Your lives are your own responsibility,” Yang Kai grinned.

His arrogance darkened the four men’s faces. One sneered coldly, “Ninth Young Master, just make your move…”

Before he finished, Yang Kai and Su Yan moved as one.

A scorching heat and a biting chill burst forth simultaneously, two utterly opposite energies unleashed at the same moment. Without prior communication or spoken words, their spiritual bond allowed them to perceive each other’s thoughts and intentions.

The blazing red True Yuan surged like a fierce flame, enveloping the ground beneath the four. Sensing the power contained in this pure, violent True Yuan, their expressions changed subtly. Now they understood why Yang Kai had been able to hold Liu Qingyao to a stalemate—it was not because Liu had held back.

He truly possessed the strength and capital!

Following the flame, countless sharp ice shards, like swords, lined up and howled fiercely as they shot toward the four.

Thousands upon thousands of ice shards swarmed like a locust plague, bloodless and unstoppable, laden with bone-chilling cold, nearly filling the entire space, leaving the four with no way to advance or retreat.

Each shard contained an extremely bitter coldness, with a devastating impact force.

Those ice shards were condensed from her internal freezing energy, forming an energy shock that even Divine Roaming masters from the Eight Great Families dared not underestimate.

Su Yan’s first strike was extraordinary.

In contrast, Yang Kai’s blazing True Yuan seemed somewhat trivial.

Of the four, two did not move, while the remaining two gave a simultaneous shout. Multicolored light burst from their bodies, forming a thin, film-like layer of defense before them, blocking all of the searing True Yuan and ice spikes rushing toward them.

Not only that, the two released bursts of energy that shattered the overwhelming ice shards.

Yang Kai and Su Yan’s initial combined strike yielded no results!

Just as the four Divine Roaming masters relaxed, the blocked energy between scorching True Yuan and freezing power began to unexpectedly and mysteriously merge.

The previously stalled and nearly exhausted attack suddenly churned like a flood, intensifying as it surged toward them with even greater aggression and intimidation.

The four’s expressions changed drastically. The two previously inactive Divine Roaming masters hastily executed countermeasures.

Boom, boom, boom...

Like waves crashing one after another, the prismatic defensive membranes protecting the four shattered. The combined cold and heat energy engulfed them, forcing them to fully experience the torment of ice and fire in tandem.

Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru watched, momentarily dumbfounded.

The scene before them immediately made them realize how vast the gap between themselves and Yang Kai truly was—a deep sense of powerlessness swelling within.

Against Liu Qingyao, they still entertained thoughts of catching up and hoped to someday match his pace.

But facing Yang Kai, such thoughts never formed; all they could do was look up to his back.

Anger and humiliation mixed in Kang Zhan’s heart as he shouted, “No need to hold back! Ninth Young Master isn’t so easy to kill!”

The four hardened their expressions, ceasing all mercy, furiously condensing strength. With roars, they tore apart the ice-fire cocoon and surged forward, unleashing martial skills and secret treasures, all targeting Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had just summoned his Bone Shield, devouring several strikes, but before he could retaliate, the two Kang Family masters closed in and grappled him.

At such close range, the energy absorbed by the Bone Shield could not be counterattacked.

With two fierce roars, the White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal were unleashed, brutally tearing at the two opponents.

Seizing a fleeting moment of respite, Yang Kai quickly created some distance. Stealing a glance at Su Yan, he found her locked in struggle with the two Qiu Family masters, barely holding on.

Annoyance swelled in his heart. The Dual Cultivation Technique they practiced together enabled their combined strength to exceed normal limits when fighting side by side, but their opponents clearly noticed this at once.

Hence, they split Yang Kai and Su Yan, intending to defeat them individually.

If the fight continued like this, his Bone Shield could defend without issue, no matter how skilled the enemy—it would not harm him.

But Su Yan’s situation looked increasingly perilous.

He wished to rush to her aid, but the two Kang Family masters clung to him closely without a gap.

“It should be alright,” Kang Zhan said, finally relaxing as the situation improved.

Qiu Ziru wiped his cold sweat and smiled bitterly, “I didn’t expect Ninth Young Master’s methods to be so extraordinary.”

“He is formidable, I understand that—but who is that woman? How can she be this strong?” Kang Zhan stared at Su Yan, full of puzzlement.

“That woman must be the most important person to Yang Kai,” Nan Sheng chuckled, his expression full of excitement.

Since they sought revenge against Yang Kai, naturally, they intended to give him the harshest lesson and most painful memory possible.

If that woman were accidentally slain by the two Qiu Family masters, it would be truly interesting! Nan Sheng secretly hoped for just that, although he knew it was unlikely, yet he couldn’t help but think it.

He even contemplated intervening to cause some chaos.

But looking at her overwhelming strength, Nan Sheng soon despaired.

His power was insufficient; his interference would be meaningless.

“Young Master Nan, our purpose this time is only to capture Yang Kai,” Kang Zhan said, catching his intention and giving a warning.

“Heh, I know,” Nan Sheng nodded.

While they spoke, the four Divine Roaming masters gradually pressed Yang Kai and Su Yan more fiercely.

Experts from huge powers were simply different. Even just two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stagers forced Yang Kai into a defensive posture; one of the two always clung tightly, preventing him from aiding Su Yan or releasing the energy absorbed by the Bone Shield to counterattack, leaving him only to defend passively.

Seeing Su Yan’s side growing increasingly dire, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

The Bone Shield that had served as his defense suddenly vanished, replaced by an antique mirror.

The mirror exuded an icy chill so sharp it pierced the bone; faint snowy scenes shimmered across its surface.

A dangerous aura radiated from the mirror.

Sensing the change, the two Kang Family masters’ expressions shifted as they rushed toward Yang Kai, attempting to disrupt his actions.

But it was too late.

Ripples spread suddenly across the mirror’s surface, and as they expanded outward, an icy chill instantly enveloped the entire world around them.

Whoosh...

A colossal dome-shaped formation of howling wind and snow, like an inverted bowl, appeared upon the land, enclosing Yang Kai, Su Yan, and the four Kang and Qiu Divine Roaming masters.

“A Mystery-Grade treasure!” Kang Zhan exclaimed in shock, his eyes scanning the endless whiteness, seeing nothing else.

Within that inverted dome, only relentless wind and snow could be seen. Just a glance sent an involuntary chill deep into one’s spine, not to mention standing within.

Several strange peaks loomed faintly within the enclosure, all shimmering in silver-white.

“How could there be such a Mystery-Grade treasure?” Kang Zhan’s face turned pale. Though he knew Yang Kai possessed another Mystery-Grade treasure beyond the Bone Shield, and was prepared, he never imagined it would be this type.

The use of such a treasure meant the combatants were trapped inside the barrier—it would be impossible to leave without a resolution.

And as the treasure’s master, Yang Kai had absolute advantage inside!

The treasure’s nature seemed to match the cultivation technique practiced by that woman.

In an instant, Kang Zhan realized the situation had turned grave.

He understood the power of Mystery-Grade treasures well; as a son of one of Zhongdu’s Eight Great Families, he possessed Mystery-Grade artifacts himself.

“Quickly break through this treasure’s defense!” Kang Zhan instantly ordered. Along with Qiu Ziru, they led their group rushing forward.

Within the silver-white world, Yang Kai and Su Yan finally reunited.

Gazing at the snowy landscape and towering glaciers around them, Su Yan took a deep breath. Her full bosom arched seductively as an expression of excitement appeared on her face.

Here, she felt as if she were in paradise, and her True Yuan circulated far faster than usual.
