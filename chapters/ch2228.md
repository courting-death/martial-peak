## Chapter 2228 — Monkey God Wine

Inside the great hall at the heart of the tree, Yi Quan invited Yang Kai to take a seat.

Since the other party was so enthusiastic, Yang Kai didn’t stand on ceremony. Although there was a vast difference in their cultivation, Yi Quan was clearly someone unconcerned with such formalities, so naturally he wouldn’t care about these things.

Next, Yi Quan produced a wine jar and two cups as if by magic, then poured a drink for both himself and Yang Kai.

“Is this the Monkey God Wine you mentioned before, Senior?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He took a deep breath, and a strange, wonderful fragrance immediately filled his senses. The aroma that permeated the air seemed to have a powerful effect on the soul; as the scent entered his body, he felt an incredible comfort.

"Exactly!" Yi Quan smiled slightly, then raised his cup and took a light sip, saying proudly, "The things produced here are completely different from those in your world, but they have their own unique qualities. This Monkey God Wine is brewed by the Spirit Monkey Clan of our Heavenly Yao Mountain, who spend tremendous time and effort on it. It’s greatly beneficial to the soul."

“But the cup isn’t full, Senior…” Yang Kai looked a little embarrassed as he pointed at his half-filled cup.

When Yi Quan poured the wine, he had only given Yang Kai half a cup.

“Haha!” Yi Quan laughed as he looked at Yang Kai. “Drink this half cup first, and if you can still drink more, this Lord won’t be stingy.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that the Monkey God Wine must be quite potent, not something ordinary cultivators could handle. In Yi Quan’s eyes, with his Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he’d be lucky to manage even half a cup.

With that in mind, Yang Kai said no more. He picked up his cup and began to drink slowly.

The spirit wine entered his mouth, sweet as dew, but as he swallowed, it was like a blast of icy wind. A chill shot up his throat to the top of his head, making Yang Kai shudder. When the wine reached his stomach, it brought a burning heat that spread through his limbs and bones.

The effects of the wine shifted several times, their strength lingering.

Yang Kai let out a low grunt, carefully sensing the changes in his body.

He discovered that the slight damage his Spirit Body had suffered during the earlier battle with Ban Qing was actually healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

This discovery made Yang Kai’s expression brighten. Without hesitation, he began to gulp down the wine.

“Slow down!” Yi Quan quickly called out, afraid Yang Kai’s greed would harm him.

But before he finished speaking, Yang Kai had already set down his cup. He said nothing, simply sat upright, closed his eyes, and a look of lingering satisfaction appeared on his face.

“Sigh…” Yi Quan let out a soft sigh and muttered, “I wanted to chat more about the outside world, but it looks like I’ll have to wait a few days.”

In his view, with Yang Kai’s meager cultivation, drinking half a cup of Monkey God Wine in one go would leave him drunk for days. Yi Quan couldn’t help but smile wryly. He’d brought out the Monkey God Wine out of kindness, having noticed Yang Kai had just experienced a fierce battle and his Spirit Body was slightly damaged, but hadn’t expected to delay his own affairs.

“What does Senior want to talk about?” Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze clear and sharp, showing not the slightest sign of drunkenness.

“Hm?” Yi Quan was stunned, looking at Yang Kai with a strange expression. “You’re all right?”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Do I look like something’s wrong, Senior?” Without the slightest hesitation, he reached out and took the jar of Monkey God Wine sitting in front of Yi Quan, filled his own cup to the brim, and downed it in one go. He set the cup down and praised in a deep voice, “Excellent wine!”

With a cup and a half of spirit wine in his belly, the damage to his Spirit Body was completely healed. Not only that, but his soul had been thoroughly tempered. The excess energy contained in the Monkey God Wine surged into the Warm Spirit Lotus, that supreme treasure of heaven and earth, to be absorbed.

Just as it had absorbed the Soul Jade before, the Warm Spirit Lotus now drew in all the energy from the Monkey God Wine, then slowly and methodically fed it back to Yang Kai’s Spirit Body, allowing him to continue benefiting.

“This…” Yi Quan was utterly dumbfounded, his face frozen in shock.

At his level of strength, there were few things in the world that could surprise him, but Yang Kai’s actions left him completely baffled. He couldn’t understand why Yang Kai showed no signs of drunkenness.

After all, even Wen Zishan, when he first came here, didn’t dare drink the fine wine of Heavenly Yao Mountain like this. No one could withstand such drinking, yet Yang Kai acted as if nothing had happened.

“It seems… you really are a bit different!” Yi Quan soon let it go and smiled. “People from your world aren’t all like this, are they?”

“Of course not.” Yang Kai laughed. “It’s just that I have some…” He hesitated, unsure how to explain, and finally said, “I have some means to deal with it.”

Yi Quan nodded and didn’t press further. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Yang Kai pick up the wine jar with both hands and say, “Many thanks for your generosity, Senior!”

With that, he began to drink heartily and without hesitation.

Watching him gulp down the wine, Yi Quan’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch.

In just a dozen breaths, Yang Kai had drained the entire jar of Monkey God Wine, not leaving a single drop. He wiped his mouth, still unsatisfied, and looked eagerly at Yi Quan. “Is there any more of this wine?”

“You want more?” Yi Quan’s eyes bulged. “What do you take this for? Even for the Spirit Monkey Clan, it takes a hundred years to brew a single jar of Monkey God Wine. What you just drank was a century’s work for the whole clan!”

Even with Yi Quan’s good temper, he was both amused and exasperated by Yang Kai’s shameless request.

If he’d known this would happen, he never would have brought out such a treasure to entertain Yang Kai. Now, Yi Quan regretted it deeply.

“Ahem…” Yang Kai coughed lightly, using the lingering effects of the wine as an excuse. “Senior, with your great wealth, don’t be so stingy…”

He could see that Yi Quan bore him no ill will, which was the only reason he dared speak this way. If it were any other Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert, such words might have brought disaster.

“I’m stingy…” Yi Quan nearly rolled his eyes. After a moment’s thought, he said, “Fine, if you tell me more about the outside world, this Lord will grant you another jar.”

“Senior, you mean it?” Yang Kai perked up. “What would you like to hear?”

“Anything!” Yi Quan’s request was simple. “Last time Wen Zishan came, he told me a few things, but in the end he got drunk and started raving. It was unbearable!”

“Then let’s start with Hall Master Wen…” Yang Kai smiled, cleared his throat, and, adopting the manner of a storyteller, began to speak under Yi Quan’s attentive gaze.

The Star Realm was vast. Yang Kai hadn’t been there long and didn’t know much about it, not even all ten Emperors, but even so, the information he possessed was beyond Yi Quan’s reach.

And it was precisely this information about the outside world that interested Yi Quan, so he listened with great enthusiasm.

Qingyang Shrine, Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, and even the Star God Palace and the entire Southern Territory—Yang Kai recounted everything he knew.

He spoke of local customs and traditions, strange tales and rare events, secret realms for training both great and small, and ancient legends passed down by word of mouth. Yang Kai’s storytelling had no particular order—he simply spoke whatever came to mind, letting the stories flow as he pleased.

Yi Quan simply listened quietly, only interrupting occasionally to ask a few questions before signaling Yang Kai to continue.

Everything about the outside world seemed to fill this master of Heavenly Yao Mountain with curiosity and longing.

The wonders of the flesh, the mysteries of secret techniques and Secret Treasures—these were things the beings of this world could never possess. They had never known what it was like to have a physical body.

The conversation lasted a full day and night.

Yang Kai talked until his mouth was dry, so naturally he found an opportunity to get another jar of Monkey God Wine from Yi Quan to moisten his throat.

Yi Quan listened with rapt attention, utterly fascinated by all the new information and intelligence he’d never encountered before.

The Divine Roaming world wasn’t very large; the outside world was undoubtedly far more exciting.

Moreover, Yi Quan was already a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert. Beyond that was the level of the Great Emperors.

Such heights couldn’t be reached by hard cultivation alone; they required insight and opportunity.

On the path to advancement, everything one saw and heard could become a catalyst.

The Divine Roaming world held no such opportunities for Yi Quan, but the outside world might. That’s why he longed to see it more than anyone—perhaps in that never-before-seen world, he could find his own path to becoming a Great Emperor!

Unfortunately, he was only a soul, without flesh and blood. He couldn’t survive long in the outside world. If he left this place, the laws of heaven and earth would reject him, and he would ultimately perish.

“Last time Wen Zishan came, he told this Lord that if a body could be created to perfectly merge with this Lord’s soul, perhaps I could escape this prison. How much do you know about this?” At some point, Yi Quan suddenly interrupted Yang Kai to ask.

“A Life Origin Pill?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and replied casually.

“What is a Life Origin Pill?” Yi Quan’s eyes lit up and he hurriedly pressed for details.

“Uh…” Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, “It’s a kind of Spiritual Pill. Because things are different here, you don’t have such things as Spiritual Pills.”

“And what are Spiritual Pills?” Yi Quan looked completely confused.

“Let me put it this way. In the outside world, there’s a special group called alchemists. They use special tools and techniques to combine spiritual herbs and rare medicines, remove impurities, and refine their essences into pills. That’s what a Spiritual Pill is. A single Spiritual Pill contains all the effects of the original ingredients, and can greatly enhance those effects.”

“So the Life Origin Pill is a kind of Spiritual Pill?” Yi Quan asked, eyes shining.

“That’s right. It’s said that if someone like you takes it, you can grow your own physical body.”

“It’s said?” Yi Quan raised his eyebrows.

Yang Kai smiled. “Because it’s only a legendary pill. As far as I know, no one has ever managed to refine one.”
