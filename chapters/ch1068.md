## Chapter 1068 — Wait and See

Half a month later, the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit that Halika had promised arrived right on schedule. After handing it over to Zong Ao, he cast a distant glance at Yang Kai, who was in the midst of cultivation, then swiftly departed without stopping.

They had done everything they promised; whether Lady Xue could awaken safely was no longer within their control.

All they could do was wait, and pray that Zong Ao truly had the ability to refine a Pill Cloud!

They did not know that the one who needed to perform the alchemy was Yang Kai, and Zong Ao couldn’t be bothered to explain too much to them.

Time flew by, and another month later Yang Kai slowly rose, stowed away the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags with some reluctance, and returned to Zong Ao’s palace.

The cultivation environment he’d obtained in these months was in no way inferior to that on the Floating Continent; his Third Stage of the Saint Realm had been thoroughly consolidated, and now through accumulation of time and power he could attempt to break into the Saint King Realm.

Such an opportunity might never come again, so of course he hated to interrupt his cultivation, but for his life he had no choice but to reluctantly give it up.

Zong Ao seemed to have been waiting for the moment he would show his skills. The instant Yang Kai entered the palace, Zong Ao tossed several Spatial Rings over and smiled: “All the ingredients for refining the Leaving Flame Pill are here. Halika and the others did a thorough job and prepared two thousand sets of materials for you, all Saint King-Grade. I want to see how you can refine a Leaving Flame Pill that produces a Pill Cloud.”

“Just don’t forget your bet, elder,” Yang Kai said coolly, casting him a casual glance.

“Hmph, I always keep my word,” Zong Ao snorted. “But you brat, are you ready to be enslaved by me for the rest of your life?”

He still couldn’t bring himself to believe Yang Kai capable of such boasts; nor did he dare to.

“Wait and see!” Yang Kai chuckled oddly, pocketed the Spatial Rings and strode inward.

Xue Yue remained as before — breathing steady, vitality abundant; nothing showed up for the moment. But since Zong Ao said that with her current condition she would only live a year or so, then that was all she had.

Counting the time, her limit was only a year.

Yang Kai was not anxious. By staking his entire life on the Leaving Flame Pill, it meant he would succeed no matter what.

“Senior Zong, may I borrow your alchemy room,” Yang Kai said as he stepped into the room Zong Ao used for refining pills.

“So long as you can make this old man concede wholeheartedly, it won’t matter even if you tear this place apart,” Zong Ao said, following right behind Yang Kai without the slightest hint of embarrassment—clearly determined to observe the entire process to the end.

If Yang Kai truly had a method to refine a Pill Cloud, he could steal it and learn it; even if he lost half of his Profound Yin Moon Water, he would gladly accept it.

Conversely, if Yang Kai failed, Zong Ao would be happy to watch and, in the meantime, take Yang Kai as a servant to command for life — to be his assistant and lackey.

Zong Ao, prepared for a drawn-out battle, dragged over the only chair in the alchemy room and sat heavily upon it, silent. His breathing was so subtle it seemed he did not want his presence to disturb Yang Kai or give him an excuse.

Yang Kai treated him as air. He paced before the dozens of cauldrons arrayed nearby, pausing now and then to pat them, investigating and nodding, a look of covetousness on his face.

Zong Ao was at least an Upper-Level Origin-Grade alchemist — possibly even a Void King-Grade — so how low could the quality of his cauldrons be?

Those dozens of cauldrons, large and small, were all of extremely high grade; the lowest were Upper-Level Saint King-Grade, with countless Origin-Grade ones. Simply these cauldrons alone were an enormous fortune.

Yang Kai’s own cauldron was still that little furnace left by the Great Demon God; on the Tongxuan Continent it was considered decent, but compared to Zong Ao’s it was worlds apart — not even in the same league.

A good cauldron could greatly enhance an alchemist’s stability and compatibility when engraving spirit formations, thereby improving a pill’s success rate and quality.

Thus aside from pills themselves, alchemists spent their lives pursuing good cauldrons; many would impoverish themselves to forge a great one.

With so many fine cauldrons here, how could Yang Kai not envy them? He secretly regretted not having added one to the wager and wondered if asking Zong Ao for one would be refused.

After surveying them, he fixed upon the highest-quality cauldron, patted it, nodded lightly, and decided to use it for now.

“Boy, you’ve got an eye for these things,” Zong Ao watched silently. Seeing Yang Kai stand before his favorite cauldron, he couldn’t help a cold snort.

Alchemists hold a special affection for their pill furnaces; many even regard their own furnace as a wife or daughter, a sacred possession forbidden for others to touch—anyone who dares to lay a hand on it would be met with their utter fury.

Perhaps because Zong Ao owned so many cauldrons, he lacked that twisted possessiveness, but he still felt a measure of displeasure.

Yang Kai ignored him, sorting the ingredients from the Spatial Rings into categories so he wouldn’t have to hunt for them later.

He sat cross-legged before the cauldron; his expression instantly turned solemn and reverent.

Zong Ao’s eyes brightened and he involuntarily muttered approval.

From the swift change in Yang Kai’s demeanor, Zong Ao could tell he was no novice; he had done his research. Otherwise he could not have adopted such a posture — all of his spirit and essence concentrated on the cauldron and the ingredients, nothing else in the world.

Zong Ao himself entered such a state when refining pills and naturally appreciated its subtleties.

However… two thousand sets of materials—this meant repeating the same sequence of actions over and over, two thousand times in total, refining two thousand identical pills. For anyone, maintaining the same task continuously for so long would inevitably shatter their calm and focused state of mind, leading to restlessness and irritation. Once that happened, there would be no hope of refining the pills—success would become impossible.

Zong Ao’s thoughts turned quickly and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth; he prepared to enjoy the show.

Suddenly a scorching force spread from Yang Kai — not Saint Yuan, nor force from his body, but bursting from his Sea of Consciousness.

“Divine Sense Fire?” Zong Ao’s face changed; his eyes widened and he couldn’t help but exclaim.

He leaned forward from the chair, craning his neck as if to see more clearly.

His countenance shifted — excited, horrified, covetous, and unbelieving all at once — so intense that he unconsciously crushed the armrest of the chair.

It was Divine Sense Fire!

Shockwaves churned through Zong Ao’s heart.

As an outstanding alchemist, how could he not understand the rarity of Divine Sense Fire? Even he did not possess this special Divine Sense. Divine Sense Fire is extremely rare — some are born with it, others acquire it — but those who possess it hold the ultimate capital of an alchemist.

Using Divine Sense Fire to refine pills greatly improves both efficiency and quality. Zong Ao had seen such alchemists in his life, but only a handful; those few used this power to produce pills with monstrous speed, forcing Zong Ao to concede.

Over two hundred years ago, after witnessing the strange methods of one such alchemist, Zong Ao had sought to mutate his own Divine Sense by refining a Fire Essence into his Sea of Consciousness.

That attempt nearly killed him; his Sea of Consciousness was damaged and his Divine Sense harmed, nearly costing his life.

He spent decades recuperating, taking many spirit-grade pills and using heaven-and-earth treasures to recover gradually.

Though he never achieved a mutation of his Divine Sense, during those years he devised a quantity-over-quality method of alchemy to raise the generation rate of Pill Patterns.

And now, a youth under thirty possessed Divine Sense Fire — of course he envied and resented him.

Envy aside, recalling his past suffering left Zong Ao wary; he dared not give way to greed.

Fixing his burning gaze, he watched as Yang Kai began condensing the herbal liquids. Divine Sense Fire lived up to its name; though the youth’s cultivation was low — only recently promoted to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm — under the Divine Sense Fire those Saint King-Grade ingredients were condensed into droplets in short order.

One by one exquisite spirit formations took shape in midair and were cast into the cauldron, and the condensed liquids were added in order. Though his timing and control still had flaws, for someone refining the Leaving Flame Pill the first time, it was already quite good.

No alchemist masters any pill immediately; it takes time and experience. Zong Ao was certain Yang Kai was refining a Leaving Flame Pill for the first time — and his success surprised him greatly.

More spirit formations were engraved and imprinted into the cauldron, replacing the previous ones. The formations merged perfectly inside the cauldron and interacted in subtle, pleasing ways with the liquids.

“How is this possible?” Zong Ao cried out. He could not understand how altering the spirit formation configuration while refining would not ruin the pill’s formation.

Though Zong Ao sometimes changed formations while refining, he did so cautiously and only when the process had a high tolerance for error.

But Yang Kai’s changes appeared wanton and casual; in the time since, he’d swapped out a dozen formations.

Zong Ao desperately wanted to grab Yang Kai and demand answers, but felt awkward about it, so he swallowed his questions and paced in silent anxiety.
