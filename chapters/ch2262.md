## Chapter 2262 — Startling Words

Gao Shan and Liu Shui, the two Elders, were the Left and Right Protectors of Fei Sheng Palace. Their cultivation and divine abilities were second only to Palace Master Ning Boyang. When the two joined forces, they could even exchange a few moves with an ordinary Emperor Realm master.

Yet today, the two Elders were nearly crushed, their confidence almost shattered.

First, Luo Yuan of the Eight Directions Sect appeared. Even when the two of them joined forces to besiege him, they were ruthlessly beaten, fleeing in panic like stray dogs. Then Yang Kai appeared, completely ignoring their sound-based attacks.

What is with the young people these days? Each one is more arrogant than the last, their means and cultivation reaching the heavens, completely beyond common sense. In their daze, the two Elders couldn’t help but feel a sense of sorrow at their own age.

Watching Ning Yuanshu thrown out by Yang Kai into the slash formed by the sound waves, Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s expressions changed drastically. If Ning Yuanshu were to die here, they would have no way to answer to Ning Boyang.

With a thunderous shout, Liu Shui stowed away his flute. As his figure flickered, he executed a divine art akin to shrinking the earth to a single step, instantly appearing before Ning Yuanshu. He turned to intercept the soundwave slash with his back, while his other hand reached for Ning Yuanshu.

Puh puh…

The slash struck Liu Shui squarely, making him stagger. A trace of fresh blood seeped from the corner of his mouth—he was clearly injured.

“Brat, you are seeking death!” Having suffered such a loss, Liu Shui was unwilling to let it go. He glared angrily and shouted at Yang Kai.

"Hehehe…" Yang Kai let out a sly, wordless laugh.

"Not good—get the Young Palace Master out of here, quickly!" Gao Shan suddenly shouted.

Liu Shui also realized this place was no longer safe. In the brief delay, Luo Yuan had already caught up. In the distance, Luo Yuan stretched out a hand, as if he could stir the world’s momentum. As his hand extended, the sky changed, and an unimaginable pressure spread out.

All the gathered martial artists turned pale.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s figures flickered as they fled into the distance. As they left, they didn’t forget to throw out a harsh threat: “Yang, you’d better come to the Palace and confess your crimes, or even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you won’t escape!”

“If you’ve got guts, don’t run!” Yang Kai cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui ignored him, having already fled without a trace.

In the next moment, Luo Yuan’s figure suddenly appeared before everyone.

Up close, Luo Yuan’s current state was enough to make one’s blood run cold. The dense, almost tangible energy swirled around him like a vortex. Wherever he passed, space shattered, the universe collapsed, and countless visible spatial cracks scattered like swimming fish, though they quickly healed under the laws of heaven and earth.

The martial artists present all retreated, not daring to come within a hundred zhang of Luo Yuan.

Yang Kai’s expression also grew solemn as he stared coldly at Luo Yuan.

At this moment, Luo Yuan’s aura was at its peak, but he was covered in blood. It was clear that in his earlier battle with the two Elders, he hadn’t gained much advantage. Though he looked miserable, his eyes were exceptionally bright.

“Senior Brother Luo…” The round-faced young woman looked at Luo Yuan with concern, calling out softly.

Luo Yuan didn’t look at her. He only glanced at Yang Kai.

In that glance, Yang Kai saw a soaring fighting spirit in his eyes.

He quickly said, "Brother Luo, a man should see things through to the end. Don’t give up halfway—they ran that way. Aren’t you going to chase them?"

He pointed in the direction Luo Yuan should go.

Luo Yuan looked at him for a long moment before nodding slightly. "When your cultivation improves a bit more, there will surely be a battle between us."

With those words, Luo Yuan chased after Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

After he left, heavy breaths rang out one after another. Everyone seemed to have a weight lifted from their hearts, exchanging glances with a strange sense of having survived a disaster.

In the crowd, one person tried to sneak away quietly.

But after only two steps, he suddenly felt a chill behind him. Startled, he quickly turned around.

"Huff…" In front of him stood a slovenly, red-faced, short and fat man with a bulbous nose, who blew a hot breath at him.

Caught off guard, Zhuang Pan inhaled most of that breath. His face turned pale as he staggered back several steps, clutching his mouth, making choking sounds as if he was about to vomit. Fortunately, his cultivation was decent, and he managed to suppress the urge.

The short, fat man grinned at him, then picked up his large green gourd and took a swig, letting out a loud burp.

“Old Drunkard…” Zhuang Pan looked at the man, his expression turning ugly.

When he saw another person emerge from behind the Drunken Old Man, his face grew even uglier, his mouth twitching as he said, “City Lord!”

Duan Yuanshan snorted coldly. "It’s rare you still remember I’m the City Lord, Deacon Zhuang. How thoughtful of you."

Duan Yuanshan, full of resentment, finally vented his anger, feeling a grim satisfaction.

Zhuang Pan forced a smile. “City Lord, you must be joking. I’ve worked under you for decades—how could I forget something so basic?”

“Is that so…” Duan Yuanshan shot him a sidelong glance and sneered. “A few days ago, it seemed you’d forgotten.”

“That’s not true.” Zhuang Pan denied it flatly, explaining, “There were some reasons a few days ago…”

As he spoke, Qin Chaoyang suddenly appeared at Zhuang Pan’s side. Together with Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man, they formed a triangle, surrounding Zhuang Pan.

Poor Zhuang Pan, with only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, saw the three of them eyeing him like tigers, clearly up to no good. He was so frightened his legs went weak, and he cried out, “What are you doing? Don’t forget, I’m not just the Deputy City Lord of Fenglin City anymore—I’m a Deacon of Fei Sheng Palace!”

At these words, the three all frowned, showing wariness.

Zhuang Pan himself wasn’t much, and any one of the three could handle him. If they joined forces, he’d have no chance of survival.

But Zhuang Pan’s current status was exactly what made them hesitate.

A Deacon of Fei Sheng Palace wasn’t especially high or low, but he bore the Palace’s name. If the three of them did anything to Zhuang Pan here, word would surely reach Fei Sheng Palace.

Qin Chaoyang had the Qin Family to protect, while Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man had all of Fenglin City to look after. If they offended Fei Sheng Palace, their good days would be over.

Seeing their expressions change, Zhuang Pan’s fear vanished. He grinned and said, “City Lord Duan, you’re all staring at me so fiercely—I’m really scared. Can’t you look a little less fierce?”

His words were full of mockery and ridicule, making the three look extremely displeased.

As he spoke, Zhuang Pan even stepped forward and patted the Drunken Old Man’s big belly, sneering, “Old Drunkard, don’t drink so much when you’re idle. Back in the day, you were the most handsome young master in Fenglin City. Now, look at what you’ve become. If those women who once admired you saw you now, how heartbroken they’d be.”

The Drunken Old Man said nothing, just took another swig from his gourd.

Zhuang Pan turned to Qin Chaoyang. “Old Ghost Qin, it’s not easy supporting the Qin Family alone, is it? Have you ever thought, if you die one day, what will become of your family? And what about Qin Yu?”

At these words, Qin Chaoyang’s face changed dramatically. Qin Yu was his greatest weakness and reverse scale. Zhuang Pan’s words had clearly angered him.

Zhuang Pan chuckled. “A wise man submits to circumstances. Why not join Fei Sheng Palace? As a Deacon, I might be able to recommend you.”

“Hmph!” Qin Chaoyang snorted heavily.

“Don’t know what’s good for you!” Seeing Qin Chaoyang give him the cold shoulder, Zhuang Pan’s smile vanished. He turned to Duan Yuanshan. “City Lord Duan, I accompanied the Young Palace Master to Fenglin City this time to invite you to join Fei Sheng Palace and work together for great things. What do you think?”

Fenglin City was a small city, lacking in resources, and previously no one had tried to seize it. But now, many mineral and earth veins had appeared nearby, making it a coveted prize.

Duan Yuanshan, as City Lord, if he joined Fei Sheng Palace, the city would become the Palace’s territory. The mineral and earth veins would naturally belong to Fei Sheng Palace, and any other force wanting a share would have to consider their own strength.

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan’s face remained cold and he said nothing.

Zhuang Pan sneered. “City Lord Duan, opportunity is right in front of you—don’t let it slip away. I know your cultivation has peaked at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Don’t you want to go further? If the Palace Master personally guided you for a while, you might have a chance to reach the Third Stage.”

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan trembled, his eyes flashing. But soon, he calmed down and snorted coldly. “It’s impossible for me to submit to Fei Sheng Palace.”

Zhuang Pan jumped up, furious. “Duan Yuanshan, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!”

“Get lost. Don’t ever show your face in Fenglin City again, or don’t blame me for being rude.”

He could barely restrain his killing intent as he let Zhuang Pan go—this tested his patience. Given Zhuang Pan’s previous actions, abandoning them in battle and putting them in mortal danger, killing him ten thousand times wouldn’t be enough. What’s more, after returning to Fenglin City with Ning Yuanshu, Zhuang Pan had been bullying and suppressing him and the Drunken Old Man at every turn.

Such a petty man—if not for his allegiance to Fei Sheng Palace, Duan Yuanshan would never have let him go so easily.
