## Chapter 2386 — So Foolish, So Naive

Hearing her say this, Yang Kai finally understood that the people Sangde had chosen were all extremely powerful and had no influential backers. No wonder he needed five years to prepare for this. It seemed there weren’t many who fit his requirements.

Sangde snorted, “I’ve tested him myself. If you have any objections, you’re welcome to get off the ship right now!”

Snake Lady nearly ground her silver teeth to pieces. She knew that falling out with Sangde now would bring her no good, so after thinking for a while, she suddenly gave a cold smile and said, “And what about after it’s done?”

Sangde replied indifferently, “After it’s done, you can do as you please, but before then, you’d all better behave!”

Snake Lady nodded heavily. “Fine, then I’ll wait and see.”

As she spoke, she glared fiercely at Yang Kai and said, “Brat, apologize to me now, or you’ll regret it.”

Yang Kai turned his head, showing Snake Lady the back of his head.

Snake Lady was so furious she nearly shattered her silver teeth.

If this woman weren’t so shameless, Yang Kai wouldn’t have embarrassed her so thoroughly—after all, they still had to work together. But she had no sense of propriety at all; if Yang Kai showed her even a hint of kindness, she’d probably cling to him endlessly.

Yang Kai had absolutely no interest in her.

“Hmm, what’s with that multi-deck ship?” Shen Fei suddenly frowned, looking toward the direction of Tongtian City, and said in a deep voice, “It can’t be coming for us, can it?”

“It’s the City Lord’s mansion’s multi-deck ship!” Man Kuai’s expression also turned grim as he recognized the emblem on the ship.

“Judging by its direction, it really does seem to be coming for us.” Snake Lady no longer cared to bicker with Yang Kai over trivial matters. Her pretty face darkened as she looked around and shouted, “Did one of you leak the information?”

At these words, Sangde’s face changed dramatically, his eyes blazing with anger as he swept his gaze over Yang Kai and the others one by one.

“It wasn’t me,” Shen Fei was the first to clear himself. “I, Shen, have always acted alone. I’m not in the habit of leaking secrets.”

“Me neither,” Man Kuai said.

Snake Lady sneered, “If it’s not you two, and not me, and the master would never leak it, then the only possibility is…”

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes turned to Yang Kai, sneering incessantly.

Yang Kai simply shrugged and said, “That’s right—it was me.”

Seeing him admit it so readily, Snake Lady and the others were all stunned. Then, the three of them moved at once, surrounding Yang Kai in the center, quietly circulating their Origin Qi, ready to strike at any moment.

Snake Lady said, “If you don’t give a reasonable explanation today, this sea will be your grave.”

Sangde’s face was also as cold as water as he stared at Yang Kai, looking extremely displeased. He had only just started working with Yang Kai three days ago, yet he’d already been betrayed. Naturally, he was furious.

Yang Kai tilted his head, looked at Sangde, and said calmly, “The man on that multi-deck ship is Yu Leping! Master, I don’t need to explain further, do I?”

Hearing this, Sangde’s tightly furrowed brows gradually relaxed. “So, you didn’t leak anything. He’s just here for revenge?”

Last time, Yang Kai had a conflict with Yu Leping in front of Sangde’s residence. Sangde knew about this, so now that he learned the pursuer was Yu Leping, how could he not understand what was going on?

No one had leaked any information. Yu Leping was just chasing after Yang Kai for revenge over what happened last time.

“You have a grudge with Yu Leping?” Shen Fei also put away his hostility and asked suspiciously.

They all knew Yu Leping—he was a strong expert from the City Lord’s mansion, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and held some real power there.

“Just a little thing…” Yang Kai chuckled. “A few days ago, I crippled one of his arms at the Master’s door. Who knew he’d hold such a grudge!”

“You crippled one of his arms!” Snake Lady and the others were all shocked at these words.

Yu Leping was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, on par with them in cultivation and strength. For Yang Kai to cripple his arm showed that Yang Kai was even stronger than Yu Leping.

In other words, this little-known Yang Kai’s true strength was definitely not to be underestimated.

For a moment, Snake Lady and the others all looked at Yang Kai with grave expressions, especially Snake Lady. She hadn’t taken Yang Kai seriously before, but now she had to reconsider whether falling out with him was in her best interest.

“Master, what do we do now?” Man Kuai frowned at Sangde. “We can’t just hand Brother Yang over, can we?”

Sangde only pondered for a moment before decisively saying, “Pretend we didn’t see anything. Keep going!”

As he spoke, he formed a hand seal and urged his Origin Qi, causing the multi-deck ship to speed up significantly.

Seeing him act this way, everyone understood his intentions. Sangde clearly wanted to lure Yu Leping and his people deep into the sea and then kill them to silence them!

The people he’d hired were all at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Though few, each was a top expert of the Dao Origin Realm. If Yu Leping really dared to pursue them, he might not have a good end.

As soon as their multi-deck ship accelerated, the City Lord’s mansion’s ship behind them seemed to notice and immediately sped up as well, chasing relentlessly.

After a day, the two ships were already tens of thousands of li away from Tongtian Island.

And for half a day now, the pursuing ship behind them had been waving flags nonstop, seemingly ordering Sangde and the others to stop, but Sangde ignored them, acting as if he hadn’t seen anything, pushing forward with all his might.

Only when they were far enough from Tongtian Island did Sangde gradually slow the multi-deck ship, eventually stopping on the sea.

Half an hour later, the City Lord’s mansion’s ship finally caught up. Yu Leping stood on the deck, his face extremely dark.

Once the two ships were side by side, Yu Leping suddenly flickered and landed directly on Sangde’s ship. Several City Lord’s mansion martial artists followed him over—at a glance, there were at least fifteen, with a few more remaining on the deck.

“Are you all blind? Didn’t you see this Lord’s order to stop the ship?” Yu Leping shouted angrily as soon as he boarded.

“Oh, so it’s Lord Yu.” Snake Lady sashayed forward, her slender waist swaying like a serpent, a charming smile gracing her face. “What brings Lord Yu out to sea with such enthusiasm? If I’d known you were following behind, I never would have left—I’d have waited for you, no matter what.”

“Snake Lady!” Yu Leping seemed to recognize her. Seeing her on this ship, he frowned and subtly widened the distance between them. Clearly, he knew Snake Lady was trouble—a venomous beauty! Getting involved with her would only end badly.

“Is Lord Yu chasing after me?” Snake Lady continued to flirt, giggling. “If you want me, just say the word. Why go to all this trouble?”

Yu Leping’s face darkened, and he snapped, “Mind your own damn business!”

As he spoke, his gaze swept over Yang Kai, a sinister smile appearing, but he quickly froze, glancing at the two beside Yang Kai in surprise. “Shen Fei, Man Kuai?”

Sangde had used a Secret Treasure to change his appearance, so Yu Leping didn’t recognize him.

“How did you all end up together?” Yu Leping looked utterly confused.

Whether it was Snake Lady, Shen Fei, or Man Kuai, all three were well-known on Tongtian Island for their strength and independence. There weren’t many like them left on the island.

For these lone experts to appear on the same ship was clearly suspicious.

But soon, Yu Leping seemed to realize something, his eyes flashing. “Why did you all go out to sea together?”

Snake Lady and the others were all the type who never acted without benefit. For them to gather like this, they were clearly after something. Maybe they’d found some precious treasure and teamed up for it.

The thought made Yu Leping’s heart burn. He’d come out just to chase Yang Kai, but now he’d stumbled onto such a secret. Didn’t that mean he could get a share too? Anything these people valued would surely be useful to him as well.

Snake Lady let out a melodious laugh. “Life on the island was getting dull, so we decided to come out and enjoy the endless sea and its boundless beauty. Surely, Lord Yu wouldn’t begrudge us a little sightseeing, would he?”

Yu Leping’s face was cold. “Do you take yourself for a fool, or do you take me for one?”

The City Lord’s mansion martial artists who’d come with Yu Leping also looked grim, their eyes fierce as they stared at Snake Lady and the others. Backed by the City Lord’s mansion, they’d always been arrogant on Tongtian Island and didn’t take Snake Lady and the others seriously at all.

“This Lord suspects you went out to sea to plot against Tongtian Island. All of you will come back with me for investigation. Disobey, and you’ll be killed without mercy!” Yu Leping waved his hand and shouted coldly.

“Looks like… Lord Yu really is a fool.” Snake Lady pursed her lips and smiled.

Yu Leping’s face darkened. “You dare insult me!”

Snake Lady said, “I’m just telling the truth. If you weren’t a fool, would you have jumped onto someone else’s ship?”

Man Kuai snorted coldly at the side. “You think this is still Tongtian Island?”

Yu Leping’s face changed dramatically as he finally realized something was wrong. On Tongtian Island, he’d always been domineering, and everyone feared him, so he’d unconsciously brought that arrogance out to sea, thinking no one would dare defy him.

But now, it was clear that wasn’t the case. Without the City Lord’s mansion’s protection, he was just another Third Stage Dao Origin Realm martial artist.

In the depths of the sea, with no one around, even if something happened, no one would know.

Sensing the malice in Man Kuai and the others’ eyes, Yu Leping panicked and quickly said, “Wait, this Lord only came out to sea for that brat!” As he spoke, he pointed at Yang Kai and said in a deep voice, “There’s some bad blood between us. Hand him over, and I’ll return to Tongtian Island immediately!”

Snake Lady sighed softly and shook her head. “Lord Yu, you’re so foolish, so naive. I almost can’t bear to hurt you.”
