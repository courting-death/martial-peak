## Chapter 1829 — Return to Twin Sharks

After arguing with Ghost Ancestor for a long while, Yang Kai finally got him to return all those Devouring Spirit Crystals; the price was that once they were back at Lingxiao Sect he would have Little Senior Sister refine a few extra Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills for him.

What Ghost Ancestor did not know was that Little Senior Sister coveted Void King-Grade medicinal ingredients and would have jumped at the chance—she was not like ordinary alchemists who labored and fretted—had she known, she would likely have cried that Yang Kai was sly and underhanded.

The Devouring Spirit Crystals Ghost Ancestor brought back numbered roughly forty to fifty; Yang Kai dispersed them, converting them into energy that returned to the surrounding heavens and earth.

Tongxuan Continent had already been linked to the entire Star Domain and could continuously absorb the power of the stars; with a Star Lord like Xia Ningshang, given time it would surely prosper again.

Afterwards, Yang Kai summoned Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai out of seclusion, handed each a Teleportation Token he had refined, and told them to watch over the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; if any outsiders came to harm Tongxuan Continent they were to take the Teleportation Token into the Space Array and go report to Qingmu Star.

The two had only just advanced to the Saint King Realm and were not powerful, so Yang Kai specially left behind a Blood Beast — a Steel-Flame Ghost Spider whose strength had reached the Tenth-Tier; although its power had diminished somewhat after being refined into a Blood Beast, beneath the Void King Realm it was still an unbeatable presence and could hold its own against a Void King Realm expert for a time.

With this Steel-Flame Ghost Spider guarding the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai at last felt safe to depart.

On this trip away from Dark Star he set up several Great Space Arrays along the route, thoroughly linking Dark Star with his homeland so that in future trips back and forth or journeys to other Cultivation Stars it would be extremely convenient.

This was only the beginning; Yang Kai planned to spread Great Space Arrays throughout the Star Domain, tying every prosperous Cultivation Star together.

Such work took time and effort and consumed vast quantities of Ethereal Crystals, so it could not be rushed.

After arranging matters on Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai brought Ghost Ancestor into the Space Array, poured in Saint Yuan, and activated the formation.

Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai respectfully saw them off.

Qingmu Star. Twin Shark Island. Inside Yang Kai's temporary palace.

In the innermost palace, the sisters He Zao and He Miao sat facing one another with legs crossed; whatever mysterious technique they cultivated, their palms touched and their Saint Yuan converged, circulating within each other while the world's Spiritual Qi flowed steadily into their acupoints.

There was no wind in the great hall, yet their hair flew and their robes rustled.

At that moment the Great Space Array in the hall suddenly emitted an odd sound; the formation, once placid as an ancient well, glowed with a pearly white light.

He Zao and He Miao were startled and immediately opened their beautiful eyes, rising to look toward the formation.

"Someone's come from Dark Star," He Zao said thoughtfully. Since Yang Kai had departed with Luo Lan, Lingxiao Sect cultivators had been arriving from Dark Star one after another, each possessing peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm strength, and even a Void King Realm expert had appeared; the sisters were gradually aware of Lingxiao Sect's might and legacy and felt proud to have joined such a Sect, so when the array was triggered again He Zao assumed it was someone from Lingxiao Sect.

No sooner had she spoken than two blurry figures appeared in the center of the formation; as the array operated the figures grew clearer, and when the white light dispersed Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor emerged.

"Ah—it's Brother Yang Kai!" He Miao cried out with delight.

He Zao tapped her on the head and scolded, "He's the Sect Master!"

He Miao stuck out her delicate tongue, looking embarrassed.

The two sisters quickly came before Yang Kai, bowed gracefully, and said with joy, "Greetings, Sect Master."

"Are you the ones on duty here?" Yang Kai turned and asked with a smile.

"Yes," He Zao answered sweetly.

"You've worked hard," Yang Kai nodded lightly to her.

Only then did Ghost Ancestor recover from the long-range teleportation; he shook his head and said, "This feeling is truly unpleasant—there is always the sense of being swallowed by the void."

Even someone as powerful as he felt discomfort after such long-distance teleportation; those of lower cultivation required time to recover each time before their breaths could steady.

If not for the Teleportation Tokens Yang Kai had specially refined, anyone stepping onto the Space Array would be cast into endless void and never find a way out.

He Zao frowned and looked at Ghost Ancestor. "And this is...?" she asked, uneasy at the evil, sinister aura he gave off; she could not understand why Yang Kai would walk with such a man.

"Hehe, are these two little girls disciples of the Sect?" Ghost Ancestor asked before Yang Kai could explain.

"Yes; He Zao and He Miao and their master Yue Xi have been accepted into Lingxiao Sect," Yang Kai nodded, then gestured and said, "Come and pay respects to the Grand Elder of our Sect."

"Grand Elder?" The sisters were struck with surprise; they had not expected such a villainous-looking old fellow to be the Sect's Grand Elder.

But since Yang Kai had said it, it could not be wrong.

They quickly composed themselves, wore solemn expressions, bowed to Ghost Ancestor, and said in unison, "Disciple pays respects to the Grand Elder!"

"Ha ha ha ha!" Ghost Ancestor laughed madly, clearly delighted, forcing out a genial smile as he waved a hand and said, "No need for ceremony, no need; the two little girls are quite fine. Since this is our first meeting, this old man will give you a little welcoming gift."

The sisters had not expected any benefit from a mere greeting and looked to Yang Kai for his opinion.

Yang Kai watched Ghost Ancestor with a strange expression, guessing the old man had been lonely too long; suddenly becoming Grand Elder and receiving disciples' reverence had puffed him up.

Otherwise, why would he casually bestow rewards on sect disciples?

No Grand Elder of any Sect was so extravagant.

A Grand Elder was usually a symbolic figure, someone disciples revered; only those who had accomplished great deeds or had outstanding talent could meet him and receive a bit of guidance and reward.

Ghost Ancestor's affability had cost him his dignity.

But it mattered little; Yang Kai would not stop him, so he smiled and said, "Since it's the Grand Elder's gift, take it."

The sisters were delighted and thanked him, "Thank you, Grand Elder."

Ghost Ancestor smiled as if prepared and took two copper lock-like items from his Spatial Ring; with a light wave they floated toward He Zao and He Miao. He said, "These are a pair of Heart-Union Lock Secret Treasures; they are not for fighting but to assist cultivation. If each of you refines one, with this Heart-Union Lock's help your minds can unite as one and your cultivation efficiency will double."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; though the Secret Treasure was not high-grade—only Origin-Grade Middle-Level—such an auxiliary cultivation artifact was exceedingly rare and especially suited to blood siblings like He Zao and He Miao.

Ghost Ancestor had clearly noticed their blood relation and thus bestowed the Heart-Union Locks.

He smiled without speaking, doing his best to appear like a sage.

The two sisters took the Heart-Union Locks and happily toyed with them.

"Have your master come see me; I have a few things to ask her," Yang Kai said, and then he left the hall with Ghost Ancestor for the sleeping quarters.

Before long Yue Xi arrived; having likely heard of Ghost Ancestor from He Zao and He Miao, she showed no great surprise and bowed properly.

"Sect Master, how did your trip go?"

In the sleeping chamber Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor sat apart while Yue Xi stood lower and asked softly.

"Not bad. Nothing unusual at the palace while I was gone, right? Any blind fools come to cause trouble?" Yang Kai sipped his tea and asked lightly.

"Nothing of the sort. Now everyone on Qingmu Star knows Twin Shark Island is directly under Senior Luo Lan's protection, so no fools dare seek death. The island's cultivators live peacefully, and Saint Crystal tribute arrives each month," Yue Xi answered.

"Peace is good. Did anyone from Lingxiao Sect come here?" Yang Kai asked.

"I was just going to report that, Sect Master," Yue Xi said with a graceful smile. "Since you left, quite a few from Lingxiao Sect have arrived; the disciples recorded the arrivals and I have the list for you."

Saying this, she stepped forward and handed over a piece of beast-hide paper.

Yang Kai glanced and saw names such as Qian Tong, Yang Xiuzhu, Lin Yurao, Chu Hanyi, Mo Yu, and others; aside from Qian Tong, who was in the Void King Realm, the rest were all at the peak of Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Their purpose was clear: to use Qingmu Star's world law to assault the shackles of the Void King Realm and attempt breakthroughs.

"Huh—Great Elder has come too?" Yang Kai noticed Ye Xijun's name and felt puzzled; she had once said she would guard Yang Yan and would not leave Lingxiao Sect while the Great Emperor remained unawakened, yet she had come to Qingmu Star—could it be that...

Thinking this, Yang Kai's expression turned serious and he quickly asked, "When did Great Elder arrive?"

"Great Elder Ye arrived more than three months ago."

"Do you know where they are now?"

Seeing the anxious look on Yang Kai’s face, as if something urgent had arisen, Yue Xi said awkwardly, “Disciple only knows that Hall Master Qian is currently staying at Qingmu Palace, discussing the mysteries of the Void King Realm with Senior Luo. As for the others… please forgive me, Sect Master, but I do not know where they have gone. Every elder who came here told me they were going to seek out secluded places for closed-door cultivation, so…”

"Hm, this is not your fault; you needn't blame yourself," Yang Kai comforted her. Their purpose was to break through the Void King Realm, so naturally they would search for suitable places to go into seclusion. Qingmu Star was vast and they could hide in any remote corner; Yue Xi could not be expected to know every choice they made.
