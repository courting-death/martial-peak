## Chapter 852 — The Young Are Formidable

In the pill workshop, a Saint Pill sprouted Pill Patterns under Yang Kai's hand; several masters took turns watching, utterly stunned, and for a long time could not speak.

Mi Na listened nearby and was equally stunned—her beautiful eyes shone with a different light as she kept glancing at Yang Kai, who sat meditating to recover; she bit her lip, clearly reluctant to accept it.

"This kid… has incredible luck," Chang Bao finally sighed after a long pause, envious.

"Yeah, his luck is simply incredible," He Feng echoed.

Du Wan glanced at them and murmured, "Is this really just luck?"

"What else could it be?" Hong Fang laughed. "Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds are the ultimate aims for any alchemist, but they’re tragically rare and no one knows exactly how they form. Each pill that manifests Pill Patterns or a Pill Cloud is made under coincidental circumstances. Still… it’s undeniable that an alchemist must be in their absolute best state while refining. In that respect, this youngster outdid all of us."

"Mm." Kong Ruoyu nodded lightly. "Back when I entered an enlightenment, the pills I refined left not a trace of wasted efficacy—something I was proud of. But compared to this kid, it’s nothing."

The masters went back and forth, apparently attributing the appearance of Pill Patterns to luck; Du Wan said nothing further.

Luck mattered, to be sure, but one’s state of mind while refining was even more important—especially in the final moments before a Saint Pill was completed, when Yang Kai had also constructed so many spirit formation diagrams…

Du Wan felt, vaguely, that the Pill Patterns on this Saint Pill were the result of Yang Kai’s effort rather than mere chance.

"The young are to be feared," Chang Bao said with rare gravity. "Tell me, should we old fellows even bother comparing our Saint Pills now?"

"No need, right?" He Feng blushed; before Yang Kai refined the pill, each of them had been very confident in their own Saint Pills, convinced theirs were superior.

But now, in the presence of a Saint Pill with Pill Patterns, their efforts could not be mentioned in the same breath.

Beyond the emergence of Pill Patterns, the time Yang Kai needed to refine a Saint Pill was itself far beyond what they could hope to match—there was simply no point in competing.

The masters exchanged glances and quietly put away their Saint Pills as if tucking away something shameful.

……

Yang Kai immersed himself in his comprehension; his Spirit Body felt as if it stood in a vast, empty field where nothing existed except countless spirit formation diagrams, faintly glowing and dancing before him.

His mind conveyed all the treasures and knowledge he had gleaned over the years from the True Alchemy Formula, and they swept across his vision like a rapid procession.

Those enormous, almost unfathomable pieces of knowledge—alchemical insights, experiences, and techniques—had previously been scattered memories in Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness; now, subtle links formed between them, and he suddenly achieved complete understanding.

It was as if a tightly closed gate slowly opened before him; beyond it lay the true mysteries of the Dao of Alchemy.

Yang Kai dove headlong into it, intoxicated by comprehension and wary of the slightest distraction.

As time passed, the True Alchemy Formula, which had been sealed in his Sea of Consciousness, was finally fully assimilated by Yang Kai; every obscurity vanished.

Any passage in the True Alchemy Formula he could now summon at will.

His personal understanding of alchemy suddenly soared to a new realm.

It felt as if the version of himself that once stood below, gazing up at the mysteries of alchemy, had been flung high to a vantage point where he could look down and see everything clearly.

This included the formation of Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds.

These two extremes of pills were not born only from chance; during refining there were concrete methods that could significantly increase the probability of their formation!

Pill Patterns were like the meridians of a pill; with meridians, a pill could remain potent and unspoiled for a long time.

A Pill Cloud, meanwhile, was an improved form of Pill Patterns.

Either way, they were natural spirit formation diagrams—summations of many spirit formations explained in the True Alchemy Formula. If those formations were cleverly fused into a pill during refinement, they could promote the generation of Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds!

In the final moment of refining that Saint Pill, fortune smiled upon Yang Kai and he acted on instinct; unexpectedly, through a twist of fate, he grasped the secret behind Pill Pattern formation.

From that point his understanding of alchemy was elevated.

Still, although Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds could be encouraged to form, actually implementing them was extremely troublesome and carried a huge risk of failure.

When the masters said Yang Kai was lucky, they weren’t entirely wrong.

Having completely mastered the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai felt his alchemical skills had gained a welcome improvement.

Stirred, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and looked around; when he clearly took in his surroundings he was astonished.

He was still sitting cross-legged in the pill workshop, but the masters and the pair of teacher and disciple Ye Xiong were gone; in front of him stood a girl with twin ponytails, curiously studying him.

She seemed startled by his awakening and let out a small sound.

"Wu'er?" Yang Kai frowned. "What are you doing here?"

Wu'er snorted, "Why can’t I be here?"

Yang Kai chuckled; unsure why the girl seemed a little hostile to him, he asked, "Where are the masters?"

"They left because you never woke up, and told me to keep an eye on you," Wu'er replied, disgruntled.

"Thank you for watching over me," Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and then stood.

"You—" Wu'er scolded, fuming. "You’re an alchemist yourself, so why make me help you refine? My senior sister teased me for a while…"

"Why did she laugh at you?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"She said: how could a Mystery‑Grade alchemist like me be helping a Saint‑Grade alchemist refine… are you even Saint‑Grade?" Wu'er tilted her head and sized him up skeptically.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded solemnly, not hiding it.

Wu'er sneered, "I don’t believe it. You can’t possibly be Saint‑Grade; my senior sister tricked me to make me laugh."

"Why don’t you believe it?" Yang Kai found it amusing.

Wu'er grew serious and, looking up as if it were obvious, said, "Saint‑Grade alchemists grow long white beards… and white hair. You don’t have either!"

Yang Kai paused and then laughed aloud.

Wu'er pouted, offended. "Why are you laughing? Do you think I’m naive because I’m young? I’ll get my senior sister to deal with you—she’s much fiercer than I am. Also, these are the Spirit‑Linking Pills you requested; time wasn’t enough, so I only made thirty… you’ll have to figure out the rest yourself, and I’m returning the herbs to you!"

"Keep them," Yang Kai waved a hand. "Spirit‑Linking Pills help training and suit your current realm; the herbs are for you to practice with."

Then, as if remembering something, he kept pulling out Mystery‑Grade materials from his Black Book Space and added, "Take these too; they’re useless to me now."

Wu'er had intended to refuse—her senior sister had taught her never to accept unearned favors and to beware of ulterior motives…

Though the man before her looked impressive and grand, that did not necessarily make him trustworthy.

But before she could refuse, piles of herbs began to accumulate in front of her.

Wu'er puckered her lips and stared, dazed.

The materials weren’t top-tier, but they were exactly what she needed; turning them into pills—whether for herself or to sell—would be a tidy sum.

More importantly, refining those pills would raise her alchemical skill!

Words that rose to her lips were swallowed back.

Gradually the stack of materials grew into a mountain; the man before her kept taking them out as if he carried a treasure trove on his person, endless supplies.

Wu'er was dumbstruck.

After a long while Yang Kai stopped and said, "That’s all. You’ll need several Spatial Pouches to hold them—go ask your senior sister or master for some."

"Oh." Wu'er answered foolishly.

Yang Kai smiled, patted her head, and turned to leave.

She only snapped back to herself after he left, grabbed up her floral dress, and hurried off to find her master to ask for Spatial Pouches.

In Elder Du’s room, the old man sat cross‑legged with his eyes closed, motionless, replaying Yang Kai’s actions from the day of refinement and the various spirit formation diagrams that had flashed through the void.

The more he thought, the more profound and mysterious it seemed.

A knock sounded at the door. Elder Du frowned, sent out his spirit sense, and upon recognizing the visitor exclaimed with delight, "Come in."

Yang Kai pushed the door open and entered, bowing respectfully.

Elder Du chuckled, rose to greet him, ushered him to a seat, and after pouring a cup of tea asked, "What did you gain this time?"

"A lot." Yang Kai replied seriously. "I owe you and the other masters thanks—if I hadn’t observed your refining I wouldn’t have had this opportunity."

"Don’t sell yourself short." Du Wan shook his head. "Observing was your skill. Ye Xiong and Mi Na were present too and they didn’t have the same insights—only you gained so much."

"Where are the masters?" Yang Kai looked around but did not see them.

"They left. They originally came here to work with me to unravel the spirit formations on that beast skin; now that the wish was fulfilled they waited half a month for you to wake and, seeing you didn’t, they departed."

"Oh, I wanted to thank them in person," Yang Kai said regretfully.

The masters had shown no concealment during refinement; they bared their secret techniques openly before Yang Kai’s eyes, and he was deeply grateful.

"There’ll be other chances," Du Wan chuckled. "Those old fellows are shameless—they’ll come to Giant Stone City before long. You can thank them when you meet again."
