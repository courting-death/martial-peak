## Chapter 1551 — Return to Tongxuan Continent

The days aboard the warship were as calm and uneventful as an ancient well—utterly mundane.

Time slipped away as Yang Kai pondered numerous secret techniques and pursued his cultivation.

One day a disciple came knocking to report, “Sect Master, we have arrived at the destination!”

“Arrived?” Yang Kai opened his eyes; a flicker of excitement lurked within them. In a blink he had left the cabin and stood in the great hall.

At that moment the warship hung quietly a million li outside a cultivation star, no longer moving forward.

The many disciples responsible for governing the warship all turned their gazes to Yang Kai as he appeared, waiting for his command.

Without Yang Kai’s order they dared not take action.

But… is this cultivation star truly the Sect Master’s homeland? Why does it look as though it’s already in decline, its glory fading with the dusk?

The disciples all looked toward the Tongxuan Continent with puzzled expressions.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened slightly as his gaze fell upon the Tongxuan Continent.

Before, his eyesight had been limited and he had not seen the wider wonders of the Star Domain; he did not realize what was wrong with the Tongxuan Continent. On the contrary, he had once thought it incredibly fertile—at least Zhongdu could not compare to it.

But now, returning from the Star Domain after decades of struggle and tempering, he could spot the Tongxuan Continent’s problem at a single glance.

It was old!

It had entered its twilight; an air of desolate grief hung about the star, gray hues like age spots marking the decline of this cultivation star.

Yang Kai felt a pang in his chest.

He had never before known his homeland would look like this—or rather, he had never realized the problem.

It seemed the fact that entering the Saint Realm was the pinnacle on the Tongxuan Continent was not without reason.

It was different from Dark Star. Dark Star’s spiritual qi was abundant, but an invisible law of the heavens suppressed matters there, preventing martial artists from comprehending the mysteries of the Void King Realm.

The Tongxuan Continent had no such heavenly suppression; however, its spiritual qi was thin, utterly unable to satisfy cultivators’ needs for ascending to higher levels.

Reaching the Saint Realm was already the limit.

In that instant Yang Kai had the root cause of the Tongxuan Continent’s problem laid bare in his mind.

“Sect Master, we…” a nearby disciple turned his head to him, respectfully seeking instruction.

“Go down.” Yang Kai waved his hand indifferently.

The disciples obeyed and piloted the warship downward.

The ten-odd-zhang-long warship pierced through the hazy expanse, passed beyond the atmosphere of the Tongxuan Continent, and descended with a thunderous roar upon this land where the Martial Dao had long since fallen behind.

Yang Kai’s divine sense swelled like a tide, instantly covering a radius of a hundred li; he needed to confirm his current location.

The spiritual qi was thin, yet it was laced with traces of demonic qi.

Was this the Demon Domain? Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow.

The Tongxuan Continent was divided into three great domains: the Human Domain, the Demon Domain, and the Yao Realm, the three races contending. The Human Domain was largest, occupying roughly seventy percent of the continent, followed by the Demon Domain. The Yao Realm was smallest.

Unexpectedly, he had returned to the Tongxuan Continent only to find himself directly in the Demon Domain, a result that surprised Yang Kai.

Yang Kai slowly raised his head and stared in a certain direction.

As his divine sense probed, several life-essences suddenly intruded upon his perception; one of them possessed the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, a presence that felt vaguely familiar to Yang Kai, though he could not immediately recall who it was.

There were only a handful of people in the entire Demon Domain who reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—likely one of the demon generals.

The Demon Race did, after all, have the Four Great Demon Generals, all of whom were Saint Realm cultivators.

They had evidently detected the warship’s arrival at this location and were hurrying here to investigate.

Perfect for gathering information, Yang Kai thought. He said coolly, “Wait here. I’ll go meet someone.”

Saying so, his figure flickered and he stepped outside the warship to wait in silence.

For Yang Kai now, a distance of a hundred li could be traversed in an instant—having cultivated spatial force, he could ride within spatial rifts and ignore spatial obstacles.

But for a demon general at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm without a suitable flying secret treasure, even if they rushed with all their might it would still take the better part of a cup of tea.

After that span of time, a mass of black qi appeared within Yang Kai’s view, full of violence and bloodlust, and several figures hid within it.

The black qi rolled onward and soon halted a hundred zhang away from Yang Kai.

The figures finally revealed themselves. The leader was hulking and muscular, his countenance fierce and terrifying; he wielded a long pole-like secret treasure and looked imposing.

At this moment the man looked over with sudden bewilderment; his crimson eyes shone with shock.

He had not seen Yang Kai, but the warship behind him was exceedingly familiar. As a demon general he naturally knew of such a craft hidden deep below the Demon Capital.

Years ago the Bone Race had once come to the Tongxuan Continent with a flying secret treasure—apparently called a warship.

Unfortunately, that warship had ultimately been destroyed by the dazzling Great Demon God; only scrap metal remained, sealed as a top secret tens of thousands of zhang beneath the Demon Capital.

Could there be someone from outside the stars again arriving on the Tongxuan Continent? At that thought the demon general was startled.

The last time such an event occurred, the Great Demon God sacrificed himself to save the Tongxuan Continent; that deed remained the Demon Race’s pride.

But who now could turn the tide and rescue the Tongxuan Continent from carnage?

Perhaps that human of old had the ability; after all, when the Bone Race rose once more the three races united under his lead to defeat them.

Yet it was said that over thirty years ago that man had departed the Tongxuan Continent and had not been heard from since—whether dead or alive none knew.

A thousand thoughts flashed through the demon general’s mind, but he did not panic; well versed in the Demon Race’s aggressive and warlike nature, he shifted his gaze and fixed Yang Kai with a grave look.

The next moment his face registered astonishment as if seeing a ghost in daylight; he gaped and pointed at Yang Kai, “You… you…”

He could hardly believe his eyes.

“Demon General Meng Ge, haha, long time no see—Brother Meng, are you well?” Yang Kai grinned at him.

“You are Saint Lord Yang Kai?” Meng Ge’s eyes nearly popped out; he never expected that the person who had arrived by warship would turn out to be the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The human youth who had vanished more than thirty years ago.

When the Bone Race revived back then and the three races fought together, Meng Ge and Yang Kai had fought side by side and he naturally remembered Yang Kai’s face. Hearing Yang Kai’s voice now, he instantly recognized him.

This man was indeed that fellow.

It was unbelievable—this fellow had gone missing for over thirty years, yet now he arrived aboard such a warship. Where had he been all these years? Rumor held he left the Tongxuan Continent to roam the Star Domain—had he succeeded?

At that thought Meng Ge trembled, struck dumb with astonishment.

“Indeed, it is I, Yang,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“How could I forget,” Meng Ge shook his great head, “though many years have passed, Saint Lord Yang Kai’s heroic bearing is not easily forgotten.”

“And how has Changyuan fared in recent years?” Yang Kai asked.

“You ask after the Lord Changyuan?” Meng Ge frowned, a trace of displeasure flashing across his face. Changyuan was the Demon Race’s Demon Lord, the Tongxuan Continent’s preeminent expert. Even though Yang Kai’s strength was considerable and he was the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, at the end of the day he was of the same level as Lord Changyuan; out of courtesy one should not address such a figure by name.

That youngster’s tone was arrogant—acting like an elder questioning a junior—and Meng Ge could not help bristle.

He said coolly, “Sect Master Yang need not worry—His Lordship has been well, and in recent years has been in seclusion within the Demon Capital, comprehending the Great Dao.”

As he spoke he swept his divine sense across Yang Kai; he wanted to know how much the human youth had grown in cultivation over those decades.

If Meng Ge’s memory was correct, Yang Kai had left at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; given his aptitude, in decades he should have reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

As his divine sense swept, Meng Ge’s face changed drastically.

He found, astonishingly, that he could not probe Yang Kai’s depth at all—his divine sense fell like a stone in the sea, causing no ripple.

Impossible! Meng Ge’s expression immediately grew vivid; his eyes widened.

Meng Ge himself cultivated at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; even if Yang Kai had truly reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, Meng Ge’s divine sense should not have been blind to him.

Not even the legendary Great Demon God’s purported Saint King Realm could elude such probing.

Could it be… that this fellow had risen to that realm, or even higher?

That thought surged and Meng Ge felt his soles twinge; his eyes filled with terror. He pursed his lips and said hoarsely, “Saint Lord Yang Kai… what realm do you currently occupy?”

“What realm?” Yang Kai raised his brow. Meng Ge’s small gesture did not escape his notice, though he took no offense—demons were like that by nature, proud and unruly. After a brief pause, he said, “It’s hard to explain his realm in simple words. You’ll understand when the time comes. Oh, right—go to the Demon Capital and tell Changyuan to meet me at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. I’ve just returned, but I’ll be heading there soon.”

Meng Ge swallowed and the insolence and arrogance on his face gradually subsided; like a tamed beast he became submissive.

This time Meng Ge wisely paid no heed to Yang Kai’s commanding tone. He suspected Yang Kai had reached a realm and height beyond his reach—a notion that filled him with fear and an unaccountable excitement.

“Saint Lord Yang Kai, be assured. I will go to the Demon Capital at once and inform the Lord of this news,” Meng Ge said in a deep voice.

“Mm, one more thing.” Yang Kai rubbed his nose. “Which direction is the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

Meng Ge was startled and pointed with his hand.

“Thanks.” Yang Kai smiled faintly; with his figure shifting he vanished. In an instant the pitch-black warship trembled and then, bizarrely and mysteriously, disappeared from Meng Ge’s sight.

“My Lord, who is that human brat, daring to behave so arrogantly and not hold you in proper regard?” a demon who had accompanied Meng Ge complained indignantly.
