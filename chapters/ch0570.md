## Chapter 570 — What’s Happening?

In a corner of Yang Kai’s residence, a crowd had gathered, bustling with lively activity.

Inside the mansion, people were densely packed here, almost all gathered in this place. Even those Divine Roaming Realm experts did not sit in meditation to cultivate, instead craning their necks to gaze ahead, their faces full of expectation and anxious anticipation.

More than a month ago, when the Cangyun Evil Land launched a large-scale assault, they were panic-stricken and despairing. Yang Kai wanted to lead them away, but due to the obstruction by Ye Xinrou and the seven from Fengshen Hall, they had no choice but to stay.

Everyone had believed they were about to die at any moment. In the end, it was Meng Wuya who summoned the Heavenly Journey Palace, which protected everyone’s safety and allowed them to finally breathe a sigh of relief.

Yet, their future path remained utterly uncertain, for in this vast world, nowhere else besides Yang Kai’s residence seemed safe.

But today, more than a month later, all these warriors wore radiant smiles full of joy and excitement. Each one was charged with energy and optimism towards their future and prospects, a stark contrast to their state a month prior.

Just dozens of Zhang ahead of this gathering stood two enormous pools. The pools contained an unknown liquid, in which various precious medicinal herbs floated and swirled, emitting a fragrance so rich and potent it filled the entire residence. The scent penetrated the nostrils and brought an indescribable feeling of clarity and comfort.

At this moment, both pools were filled with people sitting in meditation.

With cultivation arts in motion, miraculous energies arose from the waters, cleansing these warriors’ bodies and washing away impurities within them.

Faint traces of formation patterns could be discerned beneath the pool bottoms, faintly glowing. Under the formation’s influence, the medicinal effects of the pool’s water were continuously catalyzed and absorbed by the cultivators.

From time to time, someone would break through their current realm and ascend to a higher level.

Whenever this happened, the newly enlightened warrior’s face would light up with joy and excitement, and the onlookers would erupt in cheers.

Throughout the entire War City, this series of constant breakthroughs seemed to have caused slight turbulence in the flow of Spiritual Qi within heaven and earth.

“That pool that Miss Xia from Lingxiao Pavilion created is said to be more miraculous than the Yang Family Transformation Dragon Pool, genuinely capable of cleansing the meridians and marrow. No matter how poor your talent, just soaking in it for a few days can eliminate all impurities inside, propelling us to vastly improved potential,” said a thin young man excitedly to his companion, clenching his fists as if expressing his inner exhilaration.

“It’s not just said, it truly works,” his companion nodded earnestly. “Have you ever seen so many people breaking through simultaneously? I thought the Mystery Grade Pills from the mansion had already enhanced our talents enough, but I didn’t expect we could still make such leaps forward.”

“The Yang Family’s Transformation Dragon Pool is such a wondrous place. I’ve heard that only those with talent and who have made great contributions to the family have the qualification to enter and benefit from it; even so, it’s a treasure trove fiercely competed for by the Yang Family members. But compared to the pool here in our mansion—what is the Transformation Dragon Pool at all? This is the real Transformation Dragon Pool,” the third spoke equally excitedly, speaking freely without restraint. “Did you hear? When the Young Master was little and wanted to enter the Transformation Dragon Pool, the Yang Family rejected him many times. In my opinion, those Yang Family folks are all short-sighted and blinkered fools; how dare they refuse such a formidable Young Master.”

“Don’t slander the Yang Family here. No matter how unfairly they treat the Young Master, he remains part of the Yang Family. It’s not for us to criticize them behind his back.”

“Right, right.”

“Let’s just wait for our turn at the pool. Didn’t that Wutian from Yingyue Sect soak for only three days and break straight from the seventh stage of the True Yuan Realm to the peak of the True Yuan Realm? He’s now in seclusion hoping to achieve Divine Roaming Realm. We can’t fall behind him!”

“Heh heh, next batch is our Fei Yu Pavilion. Really looking forward to it. Those idiots from Tianyuan City just left like that, dying so inexplicably and losing such a great opportunity,” one sneered maliciously, full of schadenfreude.

Before the Cangyun Evil Land invasion, Liu Feisheng from Tianyuan City had led his people away from Yang Kai’s residence and quickly swore allegiance to Ye Xinrou. This caused significant grievance among the residents towards Tianyuan City.

Yet under the combined assault of the Yinming Ghost King and the Destruction Poison King, the people of Tianyuan City had long since perished.

Various murmurs spread among the crowd, all eyes and faces shining with hopeful anticipation.

Yang Kai emerged from his seclusion. Despite the long time, he had yet to refine the Golden Pupil Eye, sensing it was not the kind of Mystery-Grade Divine Soul Treasure he had imagined.

That golden-pupil single eye seemed more like the eye of a human or a demonic beast.

Though unable to refine it, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had merged significantly with it, but how to control it for his own use remained unknown.

Smelling the strong medicinal fragrance in the mansion, Yang Kai paused and looked around, finding no one nearby.

Releasing his Divine Sense, he quickly sensed an anomaly and hurried toward the gathering crowd.

“What’s happening?” Upon arriving, Yang Kai imagined some major event and asked hurriedly.

Hearing his voice, Qiu Yimeng, standing on a tall platform not far from the pools, waved and called to him, “Yang Kai, over here.”

Yang Kai immediately leapt onto the platform and looked around in surprise.

Everyone was gathered here, next to two medicinal herb-laden pools, filled with people. Looking closely, Yang Kai realized they were all members of the Blood Battle Gang.

Around Qiu Yimeng on the platform, the young generation’s leading figures all looked at Yang Kai with gratitude.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

Many in the Blood Battle Gang displayed fluctuations of True Yuan, clearly on the verge of breakthroughs.

“For that, you should ask Miss Xia. She created this; I don’t really understand it, only that it’s quite extraordinary,” Qiu Yimeng smiled, pushing Xia Ningshang forward.

“Senior Sister, what’s happening?” Yang Kai gazed intently at Xia Ningshang, who wore a veil.

Xia Ningshang whispered, “Didn’t you give me a lot of spiritual liquid? Refining pills doesn’t need that much, and the mansion’s pills can last a long time, so the alchemy room hasn’t been functioning these days. I wanted to use those things to improve their below-the-surface quality.”

“How did you do it?” Yang Kai asked. Though he knew long-term consumption of the Wan Yao Ling Ye could cleanse the meridians and marrow, seeing such swift results was startling.

“I used people as pills for refining,” Xia Ningshang replied quietly.

“Use people as pills for refining?” Yang Kai was shocked.

“I found a method in the spirit formations you taught me. Using spirit formations combined with the spiritual liquid and some other rare materials, it triggers the medicinal efficacy in the shortest time possible. Under the influence of the formations and medicine, impurities in their bodies are driven out. Using the approach and methods of pill refining, I refined them.”

Other alchemists refined pills, but now Senior Sister had transcended that level and could refine people.

Such formidable and outstanding talent could be glimpsed from this.

Yang Kai approached and gently asked, “No accidents will happen, right?”

“No,” Senior Sister shook her head lightly. “Though this method works fast and many can break through multiple minor stages, it’s still not as effective as long-term intake of spiritual liquid.”

“That’s enough,” Yang Kai nodded gently. For those in the residence, having this chance and fortune was already immensely satisfying and gratefully accepted.

Yang Kai had never expected Xia Ningshang could accomplish this with the Wan Yao Ling Ye to such an extent.

With this, the strength of the residence’s people would rapidly improve, greatly enhancing their ability to protect themselves.

Most importantly, continuous breakthroughs in minor stages and overall improvement in body quality would undoubtedly bring great morale to those once dispirited.

From the faces of the residence’s warriors, Yang Kai no longer saw confusion or despair. Instead, they were exuberant and motivated, as if injected with energy.

When the two finished speaking, Qiu Yimeng smiled softly and said, “This batch from Blood Battle Gang has been cultivating here for two days. In one more day, we’ll rotate the next batch. Every three days, a new group comes in. This will continue for a long time until all have finished.”

Huo Xingchen stood nearby, frustrated. “It’s all my old man’s fault. He recalled all the people I brought here. Otherwise, they’d have benefited too.”

“Yes, my Qiu Family’s Autumn Rain Hall people… ah,” Qiu Yimeng also sighed regretfully.

The Autumn Rain Hall had contributed much to Yang Kai’s side during the Succession War, but at the last moment, Qiu Shoucheng recalled them to the family.

Had they stayed till now, they too would have enjoyed such treatment.

“My old man is just too hateful. Clearly unfit to be Family Head anymore,” Huo Xingchen cursed darkly, filled with murderous intent toward his father.

“You all shouldn’t gather here. Do what you need to do. Just leave a few people here to guard and arrange matters,” Yang Kai instructed. “Remember to come to my room tonight. I have something to give you.”

By now, the existence of the Wan Yao Ling Ye was no secret. These young leaders of the mansion had stood firmly by Yang Kai since the Succession War, through ups and downs, and he intended to let them gain more benefits.

At this, everyone’s eyes brightened, their hearts secretly hopeful.

Qiu Yimeng gave Yang Kai a playful glare. “You’re kind after all. It’s worth our unwavering loyalty to you.”

Qiu Yimeng’s scolding hit Yang Kai harder than expected. While pretending not to hear, a shout came from below: “Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!”

Following the voice, Yang Kai saw Li Yuanchun of Tai Yi Sect waving to him from afar.

“Senior Li, please come talk,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

Li Yuanchun flickered and swiftly arrived on the platform, chuckling sheepishly. “Young Master Yang, long time no see.”

“Is it that long?” Yang Kai had been in seclusion, unaware of how much time had passed.

“Over a month now,” Li Yuanchun emphasized.
