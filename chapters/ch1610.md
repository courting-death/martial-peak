## Chapter 1610 — Send You on Your Way

Xue Lian's face darkened: “Kid, you really won't give me any face at all?”

“Who do you think you are?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Fine — there aren't many who dare speak to me like that. Tian Jiu is one, and now you are another. But today you will die here!” Xue Lian snarled, and a blood-red mist suddenly seeped from his body, enveloping him completely; his figure vanished beneath the crimson cloud.

Immediately that blood cloud shot forward with terrifying speed, and in an instant it wrapped around Yang Kai.

From within the blood mist came horrifying, astonishing fluctuations of power; threads of bloodlight, alive as beasts, writhed and tangled toward Yang Kai.

At the same time, a strangely profound force undulated outward.

Yang Kai suddenly felt his movements grow difficult; even his Saint Yuan was faintly being suppressed.

Domain!

Yang Kai roared. His own Shi exploded outward madly, and the surrounding space collapsed and warped inch by inch.

Yet his Shi was comprehensively suppressed by Xue Lian's Domain, only managing to expand less than three inches from his body before it could extend no further.

“Shi approaching consummation!” Xue Lian exclaimed in surprise. “The boy truly has grounds for pride — condensing his Shi to this level at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm is rare, but… you still fall short!”

He sneered, splitting off streaks of blood-red qi filled with violent aura, shaping them into multiple Jiao that lunged at Yang Kai from all directions.

This was the ferocious qi condensed from Yao King Feng E's own killing intent; any martial artist even fractionally pierced by it would instantly have their mind shattered and fall into madness.

Yang Kai, though ignorant of the deeper subtleties, would not allow such things near him.

Over a hundred Golden Blood Threads coiled around his body like a hundred extra arms, whipping and interweaving.

The pressure from the Domain eased greatly!

Golden Blood Threads inherently have the miraculous effect of breaking Shi. A Domain is the Shi's advanced form; the threads have a degree of restraint over it. One or two threads are insignificant, but when over a hundred strike at once, the effect shows.

Yang Kai's Shi instantly spread out to one chi beyond his body.

He gestured; the jade-green giant dragon condensed into a streak of green light and flew back into his hand, resuming the form of the Dragon Bone sword.

A lofty dragon's cry issued from the blade. Yang Kai gripped the sword with one hand, Saint Yuan poured in, and he swung it forward with ferocity.

The jade blade tore the void, cleaving the crimson violent aura in two and slashing toward Xue Lian hidden within the blood mist.

Xue Lian seemed unwilling to meet the strike directly and could only dodge; before he could react further, a hulking figure suddenly burst up from beneath the ground.

Stone Puppet!

The Stone Puppet had transformed into a stone colossus; the Heaven-Shaking Pillar in its hand had grown monstrously long, reaching about five zhang, a pitch-black giant staff carrying world-shattering force, and it slammed down hard while Xue Lian was unprepared.

Xue Lian was terrified. He dared not take the Heaven-Shaking Pillar head-on, so he twisted his body to evade and threw a punch.

The punch carried terrifying might and struck the Stone Puppet squarely in the chest.

With a clang, the Stone Puppet stumbled back several paces; stone chips flew from its solid, hard chest.

The Stone Puppet was visibly stunned.

Since its creation it had never been harmed — this was the first time!

Even losing a few stone chips counted as an injury.

The Stone Puppet’s round eyes suddenly gleamed with a savage, violent light. It pounded its chest with both fists, producing a series of deep, thunderous thuds. In the next instant, a searing heat surged from within its body, radiating a power that made one’s heart tremble.

That scorching aura erupted from within, as though it sought to burn everything in existence to ashes.

The Stone Puppet's surface suddenly melted and its whole body turned fiery red!

Yang Kai gaped, unsure what the Stone Puppet was up to. He had never seen it change like this, so he hastily withdrew to avoid a head-on collision with Xue Lian and focused intently on the Stone Puppet.

He had no idea whether this transformation was good or bad for the Stone Puppet.

Very soon the Stone Puppet's surface was covered by a flowing, lava-like layer, like rolling magma enveloping its whole body.

At a glance, the Stone Puppet appeared clad in molten armor; steam rose from that armor, and even Yang Kai dared not approach lightly.

“Sun's True Fire!” Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

From that molten armor he could sense the power of Sun's True Fire!

In an instant Yang Kai understood.

Long ago the Stone Puppet had indeed devoured Sun's True Fire, but in all the years since it had never used that power, so even its master, Yang Kai, did not know its bottom line.

But today, Xue Lian's punch had undoubtedly enraged the Stone Puppet; it had now drawn out all of its strength!

Clad in molten armor, the Stone Puppet had become a lava giant. It hefted its massive, obscene Heaven-Shaking Pillar in one hand, clenched the other into a fist, and a cruel smile — bizarre and uncanny — crept across its once-innocent face.

Stomp, stomp, stomp…

The Stone Puppet strode forward without fear, charging into the blood cloud and swinging its scorching, enormous fists at Xue Lian.

Xue Lian's wild cries rang out, and the dense blood cloud visibly thinned, as if being evaporated by the power of Sun's True Fire.

After a dozen or so blows, Xue Lian's figure was fully exposed again.

His face was ashen; he regarded the advancing lava giant with palpable dread and utter disbelief.

Even with all his vast knowledge and experience, he couldn’t tell what kind of creature this was before him.

The first time it had ambushed him it was only half a man's height, small and delicate; the second ambush it had grown tall and powerful; now it had turned into a giant forged from molten rock.

Xue Lian retreated again and again, not daring to clash with the Stone Puppet head-on.

The Fire Bird seized the chance and surged forward, spewing balls of flame indiscriminately.

Those fireballs carried not only searing heat but crackling arcs of lightning.

The Fire Bird had also devoured Sun's True Fire and had thus made a leap in strength; it had swallowed Qiantian Thunderfire as well, infusing its flames with fierce electrical fury.

Its flames were even more fearsome than the Stone Puppet's; lacking only the Puppet's brute power, the Fire Bird possessed several folds more agility.

Two great allies, one from beneath and one from the heavens, joined forces and pressed Xue Lian to the point where he could only defend and could not counterattack.

Yang Kai grinned.

With only the Fire Bird and the Stone Puppet, Xue Lian couldn't win. Even if he had been a yao king for tens of thousands of years and could use a trace of Domain power, the host body he had seized limited his strength.

If he were at his prime, he might have killed Yang Kai with a mere flick of the wrist.

The top tier of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm is not to be trifled with.

But now he was a dragon swimming in shallow water, unable to make any waves.

“Get lost!” Xue Lian was in a sorry state, flustered and cornered; he roared, then mustered his resolve, traded a punch with the Stone Puppet, and the colossal force sent the Stone Puppet reeling back ten or so zhang.

Yet Xue Lian's fist was scorched and gave off a nauseating stench.

The next moment he didn't slow — avoiding the Fire Bird's frenzied assault, he lunged straight at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was the key to this fight; if Xue Lian could kill him, the Stone Puppet and Fire Bird would be far less effective. He resolved to go all-out, seemingly attempting to slay him in one strike and reverse the tide.

The Domain's force surged again to cover Yang Kai as Xue Lian charged in savagely.

Yang Kai's Shi burst forth and resisted the Domain, but step by step he was pushed back and soon suppressed.

Xue Lian drew near with a feral grin and let out a piercing roar.

That roar was sharp as a blade—like hundreds of swords stabbing straight into one’s heart, piercing the soul and seizing the mind. Yang Kai’s movements faltered for an instant under its assault.

“Boy, you’re finished!” Xue Lian roared wildly, reaching out to grab at Yang Kai.

“Not necessarily,” Yang Kai's mouth curled into a strange smile. His body trembled and a low roar issued from his throat: “Dragon Transformation!”

Golden light flared; plates of golden scales rose from his right arm, wrapping the exposed flesh.

Light shone from his fingertips, the whole hand becoming grim and terrifying, like a dragon's claw.

The might of the Sacred Dragon spread outward.

Instinctively a trace of fear flickered in Xue Lian's eyes, and the surging pressure within him suddenly dropped.

The power of an Ancient Sacred Being suppresses any yao; let alone the sovereign among Sacred Spirits!

Whether this body belonged to Xue Lian or Yao King Feng E's soul, they were merely primordial aberrant species, incomparable to the Golden Sacred Dragon.

Yang Kai thrust his right hand forward, fingers together like a blade, stabbing with vicious intent.

There was a soft tearing sound.

Xue Lian's seemingly impregnable torso was pierced clean through by Yang Kai's right hand, as if it were tofu, offering no resistance.

A thudding sound came from Xue Lian's chest; Yang Kai's dragon-clawed right hand had seized his heart.

Xue Lian froze; the hand he had been reaching out with hung suspended above Yang Kai's head, motionless, his eyes trembling violently.

“Let me send you on your way!” Yang Kai snarled, his right hand clenching fiercely as he crushed Xue Lian’s heart in his grip.

“Kid, you're still too green!” Xue Lian laughed oddly as he died; as his heart burst the light in his eyes faded.

Yang Kai's face fell. He sensed something wrong and was about to withdraw when a blood-red light shot from above Xue Lian's head and made a beeline for his own skull without hesitation.

That blood-red light carried a most bizarre aura; it tore through the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness like a scythe and pierced into it.

“So this was your game!” Yang Kai snapped awake and did not delay; he plunged his mind inward and manifested his Spirit Body inside the Sea of Consciousness.

Within the Sea of Consciousness the ocean formed by the Divine Sense Fire churned and roared.

A strange figure stood in midair, bewildered, and stared around in surprise.

He found that this place was not quite what he had imagined.

“If you intend to seize my body, you'll be disappointed,” Yang Kai said to the stranger with a cold, mocking laugh.
