## Chapter 899 — Caidie Comes Calling

Senior Aunt Fei Yu was the same as ever, speaking without a filter and teasing Yang Kai until his face flushed and his blood raced; she, meanwhile, laughed so hard she could barely stand, her limbs trembling like flowering branches.

Cang Yan and the others soon arrived as well, met briefly with Yang Kai, asked about that group of demons under him, and cautioned him repeatedly to be careful and not to be deceived by them.

Feeling the concern from his senior relatives, Yang Kai was a touch warmed and readily agreed to heed their words.

From Cang Yan and the others, Yang Kai also learned that some time ago quite a few experts had gone to the Tianxiao Sect to inquire of Chu Lingxiao about that group of Demons. Some, in their outrage, had even requested that Chu Lingxiao personally take action to kill Yang Kai for consorting with Demons and thus cleanse the Sect’s name.

Chu Lingxiao didn’t bother to entertain them; he had secluded himself in a chamber and didn’t see outsiders.

Those people had no choice but to sulk away after staying at Tianxiao Sect for a while.

But as the reputation of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land spread, no one had come to Tianxiao Sect during this period — nobody wanted to offend the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and risk losing the chance to have that master assist with pill-refining.

Afterwards, Yang Kai went to visit the founder, Chu Lingxiao, and they spoke for a while.

Learning that Li Rong and the others were behaving themselves and staying peacefully in the Nine Peaks, Chu Lingxiao was extremely pleased, though he still gave Yang Kai several admonitions similar to those from the other seniors.

After staying three days in Tianxiao Sect and shaking off the fatigue accumulated from constant pill-refining and cultivation, Yang Kai felt refreshed and set off home with a light heart.

For nearly a year Yang Kai had been refining pills and improving his alchemy, continuously refining for others and using the insights to aid his cultivation — he had not rested a single day.

After this coincidental rest of a few days, Yang Kai suddenly felt his cultivation surge once more.

He understood then that this was the result of deliberate relaxation: a year’s worth of accumulation and sedimentation had, over these days, transformed into visible gains and nourished his growth.

Less than a day later, Yang Kai returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

No sooner had he entered the Nine Peaks than Li Rong’s divine sense reached him: “Master. That yao woman wishes to see you.”

“A yao woman?” Yang Kai halted midair, brow creasing as he thought for a moment and then sent a message: “Caidie?”

“Yes, it’s her!”

“What does she want?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

“She didn’t say. If you refuse to see her, I’ll send her away now.” Li Rong replied quickly.

“No need. I’ll come over.”

A moment later, Yang Kai appeared on the peak where the Ancient Demon Clan dwelt.

Strolling into the largest hall, he immediately saw Caidie sitting erect with her seven-colored wings folded behind her, expression cold and motionless like a statue, as if someone owed her money.

Yinya and Xueji, the two commanders, cast occasional glances at her, each sensing an immense pressure emanating from her.

This yao expert was chilling as a mountain; though strikingly beautiful and adorned with gorgeous seven-colored wings that added a dazzling allure, both Yinya and Xueji admitted they lacked the means to conquer this iceberg.

Approaching her would only leave one’s body and mind frozen solid...

When Yang Kai arrived, Caidie’s bright eyes finally moved and fixed on him.

Li Rong rushed forward and, coming to Yang Kai’s side, gave a wry smile and whispered, “She’s been here three days, sitting there without moving. We tried to greet her but she ignored us, saying she’ll wait for you.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded helplessly. “Thank you for your trouble.”

Saying that, he stepped forward with a smile and cupped his hands: “Miss Caidie.”

Caidie gave a slight nod in acknowledgement, her icy demeanor unchanged as she said lightly, “I have waited a long time for you.”

Yang Kai let out an awkward laugh — it wasn’t his doing that she’d waited — and composed himself before asking, “Did the Great Lord summon me for some matter?”

Caidie answered, “Yes; the Great Lord requests you come to Thundertree Palace.”

“Has your Huasheng Pool malfunctioned again?” Yang Kai frowned — when the Great Lord summoned him, that was the thought that came to mind.

“It isn’t the Huasheng Pool... don’t ask too many questions; when you arrive at Thundertree Palace the Great Lord will explain.”

Yang Kai was momentarily speechless; the commanders nearby rolled their eyes in unison.

Caidie had none of the manners of a guest — her words were commanding and imperious, like an order, which made people uncomfortable.

Han Fei’s expression darkened instantly.

Sharing that same icy temperament and being a Second Stage Saint Realm expert herself, Han Fei harbored an instinctive dislike for the other woman and had long wanted an excuse to teach this brat a lesson and remind her how to show proper respect before the master.

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, Yang Kai hurriedly said, “If the Great Lord wants me, then I’ll go; it must be important. Miss Caidie, wait a little — I’ve just returned from outside and have some matters to arrange.”

Caidie nodded lightly and said no more.

“Master, I will accompany you.” Li Rong immediately volunteered.

Yang Kai looked at her; though he felt the Great Lord wouldn’t harm him, he still nodded, “Mm, prepare yourself.”

Leaving the peak, Yang Kai headed straight for the Saint Lord’s garden.

He hadn’t expected to be gone several days when he left a few days earlier and wondered how Du Wan and the others had fared in his absence.

Those days’ pills were surely their handiwork.

Upon entering the side room Yang Kai saw five masters seated there, each with a pill furnace before them and prepared herbs laid out at hand.

The masters all stared at the pills in their hands in silence, their expressions grave; the atmosphere felt a touch uncanny.

Yang Kai was startled and quickly asked, “Masters, what has happened?”

At his voice, Du Wan and the others seemed roused from thought; they glanced up at him and smiled together.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

“Nothing happened; it’s just that us old fellows found our pill-refining skills have improved a lot,” Du Wan explained with a smile.

“Indeed, greatly improved,” Chang Bao added.

“So every time we refine a pill we examine the gains and losses,” Kong Ruoyu said lightly, “we were just inspecting them a moment ago.”

“I see...” Yang Kai exhaled in relief — he had feared the intense days of refining had truly worn these masters out.

“You may not be the best master, but we’re the best disciples,” Hong Fang laughed. “Before, refining a Saint Pill took at least two hours and drained much power and spirit, but now a Saint Pill needs only half the former time and consumes far less energy. That all comes from observing your pill-refining.”

Everyone smiled and nodded.

Since they hadn’t refined so much before, they hadn’t noticed their progress; but with Yang Kai away these past days, all the materials they accepted were refined by them.

After trying again and again and testing the gains seen while observing Yang Kai, each of them found remarkable improvement.

Both in time consumed and in the quality of the pills produced, there were noticeable upgrades.

Du Wan even had confidence he could refine a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill!

If he succeeded, it would mean he had truly entered the realm of a Middle-Level Saint-Grade alchemist.

Observing Yang Kai refine for months had yielded them more than decades of their own study; the five masters were overjoyed and had been tirelessly refining these days, producing twenty pills a day without fail.

But those twenty were made by the five working together, whereas Yang Kai could produce that alone.

In that respect they were humbled, feeling they couldn’t compare themselves to a pillmaster wielding the Divine Sense Fire.

“It’s a shame, though — in these days of refining we failed a few times and wasted good materials,” Du Wan said regretfully.

Alchemists cherished pills and treated rare herbs like treasures; any failed refinement pained them deeply.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, had never once failed in his pill-refining.

“Never mind; the Sacred Land is rich in resources now — we can afford it,” Yang Kai grinned. “What matters is that you masters have gained.”

“Good, you’ve returned; we wanted to discuss something with you,” Du Wan smiled.

“Speak; whatever you need.”

“Could you increase the daily quota of pills? Keep refining twenty yourself, and let us make the excess. That way we can continue to observe your technique while verifying what we’ve learned.”

“Yes.” He Feng nodded heavily. “This opportunity is rare; we old fellows plan to stick around for a while.”

“I just worry you’ll think us slow-witted,” Chang Bao chuckled.

“Not at all...” Yang Kai pondered, then said, “I actually have to go out soon; if you agree, have the five of you handle the twenty daily pills while I’m away.”

“Oh?” Du Wan’s brow rose. “You’re leaving again? Where to this time?”

“To the Yao Realm — the Great Yao Lord of that region has matters to discuss with me,” Yang Kai answered truthfully.

The five exchanged glances, surprised but not prying; they were pleased Yang Kai had told them frankly.

“Then be quick about it and return; if you’re gone long we’ll have wasted our chance to observe you,” Chang Bao joked.

“It’s fine — weeks of gains need time to consolidate,” Kong Ruoyu smiled. “I’d rather you go; when you’re done, come back at your convenience.”

“Just be careful; yao are still yao!” Du Wan warned gravely.

“Mm, I’ll leave it in your hands.” Yang Kai bowed and hurried off.

He had worried what would become of the refining while he was away; if the five masters didn’t help, production would have to pause.

Their volunteering to take over suited Yang Kai just fine.

After briefing Xu Hui and giving a few instructions, Yang Kai returned to the mountain peak and, led by Caidie, he and Li Rong headed toward Thundertree Palace.
