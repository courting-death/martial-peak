## Chapter 2024 — Resonance

After Lu Baichuan finished explaining, Yang Kai learned the entire sequence of events.

According to him, the Ethereal Jade Disc had been brought to the Lu family two hundred years ago as part of a Zhang Family woman's dowry. The Lu family's experts studied it many times but found no function—only that the object was extraordinarily hard.

Back then the Lu Family Head had questioned the Zhang Family Head and discovered the Zhangs likewise had no idea what the Ethereal Jade Disc was for. They had treated it as a rare material for artifact refinement and included it in a daughter's dowry when she married into the Lu family.

The Lu Family Head then took the Ethereal Jade Disc to several refining masters hoping to forge a Secret Treasure, but even those masters could not melt the rare "refining material," nor determine its category or origin.

Since then the Ethereal Jade Disc had been locked away in the Lu family's treasury—until Lu Baichuan's generation.

"How did you discover its use, and even glean a method for cultivating Spatial Force from it?" Yang Kai asked, intrigued.

"It was a coincidence," Lu Baichuan said with a bitter smile. "Over a decade ago, while training in this chamber, I noticed the Ethereal Jade Disc displaying energy fluctuations. I investigated but found nothing; it returned to normal after a while, and I assumed it was a hallucination, so I paid it no heed."

"Half a year later it reacted again. On my second probe I realized the first incident had not been an illusion; this time it lasted longer, but still yielded no gains. Two years later it reacted a third time and persisted for a full month. It was then I learned its name and glimpsed a thread of the Spatial Force cultivation method within it."

"So convoluted," Yang Kai muttered, eyeing Lu Baichuan suspiciously.

"I would not dare lie; it truly happened that way," Lu Baichuan hurried to say.

Yang Kai nodded. "Continue—I'd like to know why the Ethereal Jade Disc reacted intermittently and at irregular intervals."

Lu Baichuan smiled wryly. "My thought then was the same as yours: since I had caught a hint of cultivation and a likely use, I would not let the chance pass. After careful inquiry I discovered it reacted whenever a certain person visited my Lu estate."

"Who?" Yang Kai's eyes flashed.

Lu Baichuan's mouth twitched. "A young girl of the Zhang Family..."

Yang Kai frowned. Then, as if struck by an idea, he said, "Zhang Ruoxi?"

"It is she," Lu Baichuan nodded. "Whenever the Ethereal Jade Disc reacted, that girl was in my Lu estate and not far from the treasury. If the first two occurrences might have been coincidence, the third could not—she had stayed at my home for a month that time. After she left, the Jade Disc fell silent again. From then on I watched closely: every time the Zhang girl visited my Lu family, the Ethereal Jade Disc showed some response, and as she grew older the reactions became stronger. Lacking any innate aptitude for Spatial Force, I was only able to form a Spatial Needle thanks to this Jade Disc."

"That girl actually has a resonance with it?" Yang Kai was astonished.

Two explanations were possible: either Zhang Ruoxi possessed a special constitution that could trigger the Ethereal Jade Disc, or she bore the bloodline power of the great expert who had once refined it.

But having seen Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai had noticed nothing unusual; whether she had a special constitution would require deeper investigation.

The second possibility seemed less likely—if her bloodline activated the Jade Disc, other Zhang Family members should be able to do the same, unless some unique force within Zhang Ruoxi's blood had awakened, giving her conditions others lacked.

Yang Kai frowned and considered this while Lu Baichuan watched anxiously, careful not to act rashly.

"So you arranged for your heir to take Zhang Ruoxi as a bride—all for the sake of this Ethereal Jade Disc?" Yang Kai asked abruptly.

Lu Baichuan smiled awkwardly and nodded. "Exactly—while that girl stayed with my Lu family I had ample time to study the Jade Disc; perhaps I could advance further on the path of Spatial Force!"

He spoke with a fanatical gleam in his eyes.

But his expression soon fell; one misstep had ruined his plan, and his life now depended on Yang Kai's mercy—no more dreaming of future glory.

"Young Brother, I have told you all I know—please grant me mercy and spare my life," Lu Baichuan begged.

Yang Kai nodded and smiled. "That is of course no problem."

"Thank you, Young Brother..." Lu Baichuan rejoiced and kowtowed, but as his words fell he suddenly screamed and was hurled backward like a torn sack, crashing into the wall; half his bones shattered, he coughed blood, and collapsed limp.

"You..." Lu Baichuan stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, not expecting the man who had promised mercy a moment before to strike so viciously.

"I said I would spare your life, so I will not kill you—rest assured," Yang Kai continued with that smile. "The ones who will kill you are the Zhang Family."

But that smile in Lu Baichuan's eyes was like a demon's; he immediately suffered a Qi-and-blood attack to the heart, choking and gasping, and fainted.

Yang Kai rolled up the Source Crystals from the Lu family's treasury, removed Lu Baichuan's Spatial Ring, lifted him, broke the treasury's seals, and casually flew out.

Breaking the treasury's seals took some time; even holding Lu Baichuan's token, a dozen layers of seals were not easily opened.

By the time he flew from the treasury, half a day had already passed.

Yang Kai scanned outward with Divine Sense and was surprised: "The Lu family fled quickly—there's not a single person left."

Earlier, when Lu Baichuan had ordered his people to pack and leave, Yang Kai had been hidden nearby and had heard everything; he had not expected their efficiency to be so high.

But that no longer mattered—Yang Kai had promised the Zhang matron he'd avenge them. Now Lu Baichuan lay in his grasp, barely clinging to life. The three Void King Realm men who had gone to the Zhang estate were likely in equally dire straits; in any case, the task could be considered done.

Yang Kai never sought to slaughter an entire clan; with several hundred Lu family members, many infirm and elderly, he would not have raised his hand even if they had stood before him.

Thus, upon realizing the Lu family had fled, he had no intent to pursue; he instead returned along his original route.

At the Zhang Family manor gate, blood covered the ground; three Lu family Void King Realm corpses lay strewn in gruesome postures. Apart from those three, the other wedding escort had all been cut down by the Zhang Family—none had escaped.

The matron's face was pale and stained with blood—whether hers or the enemy's was unclear. The middle-aged beauty's breath was faint; her jade hand trembled on the sword, and her lovely face was streaked with crimson, lending a cruel allure.

The fat and thin warriors both sat collapsed; one clutched a thigh from which blood trickled, the other clutched his belly, blood seeping through his fingers.

Although the Zhangs had destroyed the Lu wedding escort, many of their own were wounded; fortunately none had died—a tolerable outcome.

The women were cleaning the battlefield and spat repeatedly on the corpses of Lu family warriors.

After a brief rest, the middle-aged beauty said, "Mother, Young Brother Yang has been gone half a day and hasn't returned—I'm worried and will go meet him. What do you think?"

"Very well." The matron nodded. "Gong'e, go—be sure to be careful."

"Yes." Gong'e nodded solemnly; unwilling to wait for herself to recover, she hurried off at once toward the Lu family's direction.

At that moment Zhang Ruoxi suddenly said, "Grandmother, do not go—Sir Yang seems to have returned."

Hearing this, the matron and the middle-aged beauty looked up and saw a figure rapidly flying through the sky toward them.

"He has indeed returned," the middle-aged beauty breathed with relief.

The matron smiled. "Young Brother Yang's strength is astonishing—it's good he returned safely."

"Eh—he seems to be carrying something... a person..." the middle-aged beauty watched intently, and as Yang Kai drew near she trembled: "It's that old thief Lu Baichuan! Yang Brother has captured that old scoundrel."

"Really?" A sharp light flashed in the old matron's eyes. She sprang to her feet and stared into the distance; after a moment she could not restrain a hearty laugh. "It truly is that old thief Lu Baichuan! The heavens' justice is plain—retribution never fails. Gaoxuan, my son, if you can hear this in the netherworld, you may now rest in peace!"

Tears rolled down her face.

Zhang Ruoxi supported the matron, grief swelling her eyes.

A figure flickered as Yang Kai descended before the gathered people, dropping the half-dead Lu Baichuan to the ground. He cupped his fists and said, "Thank you for waiting."

"Good, good—many thanks, Young Brother. Our Zhang Family is deeply grateful for this great favor," the matron said solemnly.

Yang Kai waved off her thanks. "No need, Old Madam—I merely fulfilled my agreement with Brother Zhang."

Hearing Zhang Gaoxuan's name, the matron's expression darkened.
