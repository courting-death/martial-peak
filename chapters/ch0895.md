## Chapter 895 — The Masters' Request

Trailing behind a handful of masters, Shui Ling still felt as if she were suspended on clouds, her whole body light and buoyant; no matter how she strained her head she couldn’t understand when Yang Kai had become friends with these masters.

What an extraordinary honor this must be.

Before long, the party arrived at the Saint Lord’s Garden.

Yu Ying didn’t lead them to the guest hall; she came straight to this place.

An Ling’er and Xu Hui immediately stepped out to greet them, exchanged a few polite words, ushered everyone inside, had maidservants serve tea, and Xu Hui announced in a clear voice, “The Saint Lord will arrive shortly; please wait a moment.”

“Mm, he is busy—let him be. We’ll rest a bit first!” Chang Bao waved carelessly, found a sturdy chair, sat down, and breathed heavily.

He was corpulent and moved with difficulty; he normally stayed behind closed doors at the Alchemists’ Association in Shining City. If he hadn’t come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to look for Yang Kai, he would never have exerted himself like this.

After guiding everyone here, Yu Ying excused herself with a word of apology and then left.

The five Saint-grade alchemists carried great influence; neither An Ling’er nor Xu Hui dared to be lax and both accompanied them with cautious attentiveness.

The five masters were amiable and showed no airs, chatting casually with Xu Hui and An Ling’er; the atmosphere was harmonious.

Shui Ling and Yun Xuan’s party, however, felt restrained and ill at ease.

Shui Ling had not expected that the group of old fellows they’d met outside were alchemy masters; once she learned their identities, she no longer dared speak freely.

Yun Xuan and the others likewise appeared very reserved.

The Duao Alliance was not a great power; being able to enter the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was thanks to Shui Ling. Before the five masters, Yun Cheng, leader of the Duao Alliance, sat rigid and solemn, saying nothing.

He simply couldn’t find an opening to speak, nor did he dare attempt it.

Everyone here held far higher status than he did; ordinarily it would be nearly impossible to see even one of them, and now they gathered together in one place. Yun Cheng felt the pressure of it like a mountain and did not know what to do.

As if sensing their embarrassment, An Ling’er kindly walked over and quietly asked Shui Ling and Yun Xuan about their relationship with Yang Kai.

Facing the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Shui Ling and Yun Xuan both unconsciously lowered themselves and answered with extreme caution.

But under An Ling’er’s gentle prompting, their expressions gradually relaxed, and when they spoke of Yang Kai occasional peals of laughter escaped them.

After waiting for about half an hour, a dignified figure rushed in from outside.

Everyone turned their gazes toward him and smiled in unison.

“Junior Yang Kai greets the masters! I am deeply flattered that you took the trouble to visit!” Yang Kai hurriedly bowed as he stepped forward.

The five masters smiled and nodded. Du Wan said, “Don’t be so polite—back then you called us masters; now… we don’t deserve such praise!”

He did not speak plainly, but the meaning was clear to all present.

Yang Kai smiled knowingly. “Elder Du flatters me. I owe much of what I am today to the guidance you masters once gave me.”

Seeing his humility, the five exchanged glances, hearts warmed; they felt reassured that Yang Kai had not grown arrogant with his success and that they had not been mistaken about him.

“Hey. There are people over here too—aren’t you going to greet them?” Shui Ling teased with a laugh.

As soon as Yang Kai appeared, her expression relaxed considerably—after all, no one here knew Yang Kai as well as she did.

She had come with Yang Kai from Zhongdu to the Tongxuan Continent, had taken part in the world-stirring Succession War, and had fought to the death against the Cangyun Evil Land.

Although Yang Kai now held the title of Saint Lord of the Sacred Land, Shui Ling still did not treat him as a stranger.

Yang Kai chuckled and called out, “Long time no see—the beauties have only grown more lovely.”

“Smooth talker!” Shui Ling blushed and snorted.

Yun Xuan could not help feeling a little embarrassed; she cast Yang Kai a shy glance, and Ruan Xinyu quietly nudged her and urged, “This is probably your last chance—if you don’t take it now, there won’t be another.”

Yun Xuan only gazed at Yang Kai in silence, which made Ruan Xinyu frantic.

If one put oneself in Yun Xuan’s shoes, one would never let Yang Kai slip away—he was not the same as before. Back then he seemed a rustic youth who hadn’t seen the world; now he was the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, a man of noble standing and considerable strength. Such a catch should not be let go easily.

Cling tight and you’d never worry for the rest of your life.

Yet Yun Xuan, foolish as she was, had no intention of acting, which drove Ruan Xinyu nearly frantic.

“This junior pays respects to Alliance Leader Yun!” Yang Kai bowed to Yun Cheng.

Yun Cheng’s body trembled with pride; he rose and returned the bow, “No need—Saint Lord Yang is too polite.”

Then, awkwardly, he added, “Last time the Duao Alliance was deceived by a villain and behaved rudely; please forgive us, Saint Lord Yang.”

“A trifle—no need to mention it,” Yang Kai replied with a casual laugh.

Hearing this, Yun Cheng felt much relieved; he had truly feared Yang Kai might hold a grudge, for if that were the case he would have had no face to remain here.

After a round of polite conversation and greeting everyone, Yang Kai finally took a seat.

“Why have you all come to my Sacred Land? Do you know one another?” Yang Kai asked, looking at the group with some puzzlement.

“Just a chance meeting!” Chang Bao chuckled. “We didn’t come together—we ran into one another outside the peak.”

“That’s right—I saw Yun Xuan and the others outside as well,” Shui Ling nodded.

“What a coincidence—no wonder I felt something auspicious was at hand today; it turns out masters and friends have come to visit,” Yang Kai laughed happily.

As he spoke he glanced knowingly at Yun Xuan; she had been staring at him intently. When their eyes met, Yun Xuan quickly looked away, her heart pounding fiercely.

As time passed she felt the distance between them widening; the last time she saw him he still seemed within reach on the clouds, but now—

This time she realized the man had already stood upon a height she could never hope to attain.

Her heart turned sour; she understood she would never catch up to Yang Kai and would forever have to look up at him.

A man like that was not someone a woman like her could match.

“Are you masters here to visit, or is there business concerning alchemy?” Yang Kai cleared his throat and asked the matter at hand.

The five exchanged glances, and soon the other four all fixed their eyes on Du Wan, clearly indicating he should answer.

Elder Du forced a smile and said, “It’s like this… well, we’ve heard that a master of extraordinary alchemical skill has appeared here, so we thought to pay our respects.”

Yang Kai gave an awkward, forced laugh; the corner of his mouth twitched.

Others might not know who this hidden alchemy master was, but Du Wan and the others certainly did—after all, Yang Kai had once, before them, refined a Saint-grade lower pill that bore pill patterns.

Du Wan’s modest words left Yang Kai somewhat unable to bear it, and for a moment he did not know how to respond.

“If that master is willing, we would like to study alchemy by his side…” Hong Fang took up the words.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched yet more noticeably.

“If he is unwilling, that’s fine,” Du Wan hastily waved his hand, seeing Yang Kai’s odd expression and assuming reluctance. “We don’t intend to covet anyone’s secrets; it’s just that there’s no one left to teach us in this art. Now that we’ve finally found someone, we thought we’d try our luck. Yang Kai, discuss it with that master—there’s no need to answer us immediately; take your time.”

“Indeed, if that master is willing to instruct us we would be overjoyed; if not, no matter—after all, it would be shameless to force the issue,” Chang Bao added in consolation.

Five pairs of eyes turned to Yang Kai, eager to know his answer.

Even Shui Ling and Yun Cheng watched tensely; for some reason they both felt the atmosphere had grown delicate.

Yang Kai drew a breath and said solemnly, “You flatter us. Our Sacred Land’s alchemist could certainly benefit from more exchange; your arrival would be nothing short of a boon to him. Very well—I will answer for that alchemist: it’s not so much instruction as mutual learning; let everyone learn from one another.”

“Truly?” Chang Bao cried in excitement.

“Would that be acceptable?” Du Wan asked Yang Kai.

“There’s nothing improper about it, and there’s no dark secret to hide,” Yang Kai replied with a laugh.

The five masters exchanged glances, elated, and their eyes toward Yang Kai filled with gratitude.

That Yang Kai agreed so readily was beyond their expectations.

On the way here they had felt some hesitation, thinking their request immodest, yet they could not resist the lure of alchemical secrets. They prepared themselves for refusal.

Yet unexpectedly, their request was granted with startling ease.

The five masters were overjoyed.

“Then what are we waiting for—we should go and pay our respects to that master now,” He Feng said, standing up.

“Hold on a moment!” Yang Kai laughed hoarsely. “Please wait a bit.”

He looked at Shui Ling and the others and asked, “And you—did you come to visit me or to refine pills?”

“If I say I came specially to see you, would you believe me?” Shui Ling asked with a mischievous smile.

Yang Kai curled his lips in a mock sneer.

“Then I’ll say I came to refine pills, hehe.” She produced a Spatial Pouch and casually tossed it at Yang Kai. “I want to refine three Tian Cang Pills; I’ve got all the materials—do whatever you think best.”

Yang Kai took it in hand, sent his Divine Sense through the Spatial Pouch, and nodded slightly. “Tian Cang Pills… when did you reach the Transcendent Realm?”

“Only four months ago! That’s why I need these pills to stabilize my realm.” Shui Ling answered, somewhat troubled.
