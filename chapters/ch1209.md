## Chapter 1209 — Instant Kill

After the four Battle Sky Alliance members saw Yang Kai pull out a head-sized Fire-Glow Crystal Core and a millstone-sized Crystal Stone in succession, they could no longer remain calm. Whether that Crystal Stone was genuine or not aside, the Fire-Glow Crystal Core was unquestionably real; for a moment greed swelled in their hearts and they already regarded Yang Kai as good as dead.

He’d casually produced two treasures worth a fortune—who knew what other fine things lay in his Spatial Ring?

Maybe he really had Flowing Flame Fireblaze!

Kill him, kill him for sure, then seize his ring and inspect it thoroughly. If they could get hold of this warrior’s ring, the rest of their cultivation lives would no longer be a worry.

"What else?" the white-bearded, middle-aged man asked, the corners of his eyes twitching. Though his heart was equally full of desire and possessiveness, compared with the other three whose thoughts were written on their faces he seemed much calmer—only the tremor in his voice betrayed his excitement.

"Over a dozen Cui Luo Grass, an Ancient Xuan Vine, three Chi Xue fruits..." Yang Kai took things out of the Spatial Ring one by one; every time he produced an item, the four across from him grew that much hotter-eyed.

These spiritual herbs and medicines were not as valuable as the two previous items, but they still fetched a high price—especially the dozen-plus Cui Luo Grass, the very kind every Sect longs for. The Battle Sky Alliance was no exception; taking these back could be traded for huge contributions, enough to have several elders grant a reasonable request.

"Also, nine Flowing Flame Fireblazes, but those are inconvenient to take out; even if I took them out you wouldn’t be able to see them," Yang Kai said with a chuckle, exposing everything he had gained since entering the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Apart from the colorless crystal absorbed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, he concealed nothing.

"There really are Flowing Flame Fireblaze?" the sharp-mouthed, monkey-faced man cried out in surprise.

"Yeah. Why would I lie? Didn’t you just see them?" Yang Kai grinned.

The four expressions gradually turned exceedingly odd.

Each of their faces showed embarrassment. The four of them had acted together, spending three whole months in the Flowing Flame Sandland searching everywhere for treasures. They had thought their gains were quite good and had been rather pleased—yet compared to Yang Kai’s haul, the difference was like heaven and earth. They didn’t even have one hundredth of what he’d collected.

This made them lose face; their gazes at Yang Kai grew ever more fervent.

“You’re lying!” The small, thin man’s eyes suddenly flickered as he shouted coldly, “Boy, you’ve got some nerve! How dare you try to deceive the four of us! Hand over your ring for inspection, and I might just let you go!”

Saying that, he and the sharp-mouthed warrior exchanged a look and, in tacit understanding, charged left and right toward Yang Kai.

Facing so many treasures, they no longer wanted to waste words; they grabbed any excuse to move in and seize them. Though arrogant bullies, they were elites of the Battle Sky Alliance, so even when confronting a First Stage of the Saint King Realm like Yang Kai they remained cautious.

The four of them had done plenty of killing and looting during their three months in the Flowing Flame Sandland, so they knew well that some people who looked weak on the surface could actually have hidden means. Even a lion uses its full strength when hunting a rabbit—let alone someone like Yang Kai, whose calm, indifferent demeanor from beginning to end seemed anything but ordinary.

They had an inkling Yang Kai relied on something, so at the moment of attack they condensed Saint Yuan to guard their bodies, hiding their killing moves and staying on high alert in case Yang Kai counterattacked before dying.

The white-bearded middle-aged man and the other fat warrior remained stationary, both feeling strange and suspecting Yang Kai might be deliberately drawing his companions out, but with such treasure before them they didn’t stop their fellows.

Who, upon seeing so many good things, wouldn’t risk a gamble? These were treasures worth dying for.

A First Stage of the Saint King Realm—how formidable could he be, more so than Qu Changfeng?

Even if Qu Changfeng were here, he couldn’t handle all four of them alone. So they kept an eye on Yang Kai while remaining ready to support each other at any time, lest he truly had some world-shattering method.

The thin man and the sharp-mouthed fellow moved with terrifying speed; in the blink of an eye they were three zhang in front of Yang Kai. Yang Kai, however, looked as if he were utterly surprised, as if he had only just noticed them charging. He hurriedly stuffed the items back into the Spatial Ring, appearing flustered—and that fluster made the two drop their guard, pushing their speed to its limit.

But very soon they saw Yang Kai reveal a faint, inscrutable smile.

At the sight of that smile the two realized something was wrong—it was the smile of a plotted trick coming to fruition, as if he had long ago set a snare here and was merely waiting for prey.

Even his look toward them was filled with contempt and mockery; there was none of the earlier fluster.

The next moment, the bodies of the two rushing toward Yang Kai seemed to be stopped by an invisible wall, coming to an abrupt halt. Two muffled groans sounded as the bodies of these two Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors crumpled—suddenly oppressed as if a great mountain bore down, breathing choked, flesh convulsed, bones audibly dislocated.

This eerie space had nearly trapped Yang Kai when he first entered; his body was far tougher than ordinary warriors and even he had feared this place—how could these two escape easily?

Although Yang Kai had spent over a month here cultivating his Space Blade, dispersing most of the dense, heavy spatial energy in the area, it was still enough to interfere with those two cultivators. All he needed was a single instant — and he could kill them with ease.

So when they rushed into this strange space, they had run into terrible luck.

Their faces drained of color, eyes filled with terror; they poured all their Saint Yuan into forcing the oppressive sensation to ease. Just as they tried to retreat from the weird area, a shout came from behind by the middle-aged man.

They looked up and saw a palm come down hard on their skulls.

The space could impede their movements, but Yang Kai was in his element here and utterly unaffected; he had long since grown used to the heaviness of this place.

Four Third Stage warriors acting alone or even one-on-two weren’t terrifying to him; but four together was different—if he failed to annihilate them all, anyone who escaped would be a relentless trouble.

That was why he kept revealing his gains one after another — he was deliberately using those priceless treasures to lure them into making a move.

The plan went extremely well. The timeless truth that men will risk death for wealth and birds will die for food was epitomized by these guys’ behavior.

No one seeing so many good things could remain unmoved.

Two loud cracks rang out.

The two Battle Sky Alliance warriors trapped in the eerie space burst into blood mist the moment Yang Kai’s palm struck their skulls; no bones remained.

The two Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors died in an unbearably miserable fashion—no chance to strike back—while Yang Kai stood there wrapped in cold intent, his gaze sweeping toward the remaining two as if an ancient demon-god himself.

It seemed only now Yang Kai bared his white fangs, looking malevolently at the two remaining Battle Sky Alliance warriors.

Of the two remaining men, the fat one had just managed to rush forward a single zhang when he saw his fellow disciple cut down. He immediately froze in place, staring at Yang Kai in shock and disbelief, his face filled with utter bewilderment.

The Saint Yuan fluctuation that surged from Yang Kai when he struck was indeed of First Stage of the Saint King Realm level—quite good, but not heaven-defying. Those two palm blows were not especially fast either. The fat man couldn’t understand why his two comrades had stood there without resisting and been killed.

It was plainly unreasonable.

"There’s something odd about him—maybe some restriction was set!" the white-bearded middle-aged man’s face went as dark as night; they were used to preying on others, yet today the prey had pecked their eyes—two fellows had died, and he was furious enough to feel sick.

"Who else wants to inspect my Spatial Ring?" Yang Kai’s mouth twitched; his expression was indifferent as he looked at the two and asked, while actually stepping straight toward them.

The fat man retreated a step, his expression deadly serious.

The white-bearded man’s brow knitted tightly; he’d just said Yang Kai must have some restriction laid to so easily kill two of his comrades, yet now the opponent was taking the initiative—what did that mean?

Could he be that confident?

The middle-aged man was cautious by nature; seeing the situation exceed his understanding, he didn’t hesitate and immediately drifted back while calling to the fat man, "Go!"

Then without looking back he fled toward the canyon.

Uncertain of the enemy’s backing and true power, he didn’t want to risk staying—he intended to carry news of this man’s treasures back to his comrades and gather reinforcements for revenge.

Undeniably, his idea was the sensible one; it was foolproof.

The fat man wasn’t nearly as shrewd. Although the middle-aged man had told him to leave, the fat man was confident in his own strength and had been blinded by the riches in Yang Kai’s ring. Seeing Yang Kai approach he felt joyous rather than afraid; a wash of green light burst out from his body, enveloping him. Immediately the bulky body deflated like a punctured balloon, visibly withering until within moments he had become a thin, gaunt figure.
