## Chapter 937 — A Sense of Loss

Yang Kai turned his head away, staring toward the direction the beggar had disappeared, a faint, cold smile on his lips before he vanished like a flash of thunder.

Above Piaoxiang City, the beggar was racing at top speed, anxiously glancing back toward the palace, but he could not find the young man; puzzled, he searched, and in the next instant the scene blurred—this man had already caught up to him, running side by side with utter ease, his expression impossibly relaxed.

"You..." The beggar's eyes went wide, his face like someone who'd seen a ghost, unable to accept that he had been surpassed in speed.

His specialty was explosive speed; he prided himself that no one under heaven could match him. Even in those days the brilliant, notorious Evil Lord Yang Bai had praised his swiftness and admitted he was inferior.

Yet this youth had overtaken him from behind, and by the look of it had not even used his full strength.

How could he not be shaken?

"Shadow King, don't waste your energy—you can't get away!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. Torrents of searing power erupted from his body like an invisible heavy fist that struck the beggar unawares. The beggar's form instantly went askew, as if grievously struck, flipping over in midair.

After a long moment he barely steadied himself, hovering in the void, his expression shifting as he looked at Yang Kai with deep reluctance and terror.

He had not expected to be inferior not only in speed but also in strength; that single blow made him realize the vast gap between them, and his will to resist or flee quickly faded.

The other had spoken truly—in the face of absolute might, any resistance is only futile struggling.

The ripples of power that erupted in midair alarmed the martial artists of Piaoxiang City, and they all looked up.

When they made out the two figures in the sky, many cried out in surprise.

"Huh, isn't that the beggar who hangs outside the Queen's palace?"

"Yeah, he stays at the palace gate all day. I don't know how the Queen can put up with him."

"If it were me, I'd have chased him away long ago."

"But look at him now—he's not just some beggar... with strength like that, how did he fall so low?"

"Who is that young man? He looks even more powerful."

...

The shouts never ceased; Piaoxiang City's fighters crowded closer to get a better look. In no time the streets and rooftops were filled, and some bolder warriors even flew into the air to hover around, ready to watch the spectacle.

Yang Kai paid them no heed; he truly did not think much of Piaoxiang City's fighters.

"Yang Family brat, are you really going to kill me?" the beggar cried, his expression full of righteous fury.

"I'm not out to kill you," Yang Kai said, shaking his head slowly. "I'm simply curious—one of the Six Great Evil Kings, the Lightning Shadow King, disguising himself as a beggar and hiding in Piaoxiang City—why?"

"The Lightning Shadow King?" A wave of shocked exclamations rose; everyone stood dumbfounded.

"No way."

"That beggar is actually the Lightning Shadow King?"

"He does look a bit like him..."

"So it really is the Lightning Shadow King who vanished over ten years ago. We all thought he was dead; turns out he's alive and right here in Piaoxiang City."

"Damn, I spat on him when I walked past a few days ago... am I doomed now?" The speaker turned pale with fear.

"I kicked him once... Shadow King won't come after me, will he?" another muttered, face drawn.

The surrounding martial artists threw sympathetic glances at him, wearing expressions that said he was done for, which only made the man more terrified.

"Fortunately, when I passed him I dropped a few coins—thank goodness I had pity, haha!" Some rejoiced while others panicked; the revelation of the beggar's identity left everyone with mixed expressions.

The Lightning Shadow King, the Thunder Beast King, the Destruction Poison King, the Yinming Ghost King, the Heaven-Dominating Force King, and the Enchantress Queen—these six were collectively known as the Six Great Evil Kings.

Before the Evil Lord's rise, the Cangyun Evil Land was ruled by these six, holding equal footing with Zhongdu.

When Zhongdu's catastrophe struck, the Six Great Evil Kings, led by Evil Lord Yang Bai, mustered all their forces and attacked Zhongdu.

But in the end Yang Bai fell in battle, and the Six Great Evil Kings suffered grievous losses; aside from Shan Qingluo escaping unharmed, four of the other five died, leaving only the Lightning Shadow King to flee Zhongdu by relying on his speed.

After that, there was no word of him.

Some said he had died; others that he had taken a new name and retired to the mountains.

After all, Zhongdu was swarming with experts—if he dared appear, he might be targeted.

No one expected he would disguise himself as a beggar and hide in Piaoxiang City, bearing humiliation to eke out a living.

If Yang Kai had not come to Piaoxiang City today looking for Shan Qingluo, his identity might never have been revealed.

He could fool others, but he could not hide from Yang Kai's perception.

Cultivation at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm is already the pinnacle of this world; it would be difficult for Yang Kai not to notice him.

"Yang Family brat, I'm no longer the Lightning Shadow King, and I am not at odds with the Zhongdu Eight Great Families. These years I have only tried to make a living here—why do you press me so?" the Shadow King bellowed.

"Then why hide yourself at Shan Qingluo's palace gate? Are you plotting against her?" Yang Kai snorted.

"Plotting against her?" The Shadow King froze, then raised his voice: "Are you mistaken? I stay before her palace because she permitted it; otherwise, do you think I'd remain here?"

Yang Kai frowned, raised his hand, and a golden rope shot out, binding the Shadow King. "Whether that's true or not we'll see. If it's not as you claim, you'll surely die today."

The Shadow King strained, but found he could not break the True Yuan rope. Bound as he was, he could not use even a fraction of his power. Horror filled his face—he had not expected Yang Kai to be so formidable.

He urgently blurted, "You won't find her—she's no longer in Piaoxiang City."

"Not here?" Yang Kai's brows knitted deeper as he released his divine sense; indeed, he detected no trace of Shan Qingluo's aura and felt a surge of disappointment.

"Where did she go?"

"There are still a few people left in the palace; you can ask them," the Lightning Shadow King said bitterly.

"Fine!" Yang Kai nodded and hauled the Shadow King into Shan Qingluo's palace.

The martial artists of Piaoxiang City watched the scene in stunned silence, their emotions unsettled.

The Evil Kings were the supreme force of the Cangyun Evil Land; each Evil King was synonymous with great power, yet this unknown youth had captured one with a mere gesture.

It was as simple and effortless as pinching a turtle.

The sight felt unreal to them; many rubbed their eyes to make sure they were not hallucinating.

All they saw were the backs of Yang Kai and the Lightning Shadow King as they disappeared.

Inside the palace, a few maidservants heard the noise and hurried out, just in time to meet Yang Kai as he entered.

When they recognized him, they all cried out.

The beauty Yunli and the maids Ruoyu and Ruoqing were still here; the three had been sent years ago by Shan Qingluo to serve Yang Kai.

"Young Master Yang?" Yunli covered her mouth and called out.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Shadow King... how did you..." Yunli looked at the utterly disheveled Lightning Shadow King, her eyes registering a mix of emotions.

"Please tell this Yang Family brat whether your mistress agreed to my staying here," the Lightning Shadow King snapped.

Yang Kai looked to Yunli. "Tell the truth, don't be afraid of him."

Yunli could only laugh and cry at once, nodding: "Young Master Yang, it truly was the Queen's permission that allowed him to stay here—she had him act as a protector of the palace. The Queen left long ago, and it was Shadow King who watched over Piaoxiang City from the shadows, preventing major turmoil. Outsiders had no idea the Queen had long since departed, thinking only that she was in seclusion cultivating."

Yang Kai frowned slightly, but since Yunli said so, it proved the Shadow King was not lying. He casually unlocked the Nether Heaven Lock and asked, "You said Shan Qingluo is no longer in Piaoxiang City—where did she go?"

Yunli, Ruoyu, and Ruoqing all shook their heads. "We don't know where our mistress went, but before leaving she seemed to have told the Shadow King something. He should know some clues."

Yang Kai turned to look at the Lightning Shadow King.

The Shadow King muttered a string of curses under his breath, then said angrily, "Shan Qingluo said she went to look for you. I don't know the details."

"Look for me? She should know I'm not in Zhongdu—why would she seek me there?"

"She didn't go to Zhongdu to find you. Before she left she spoke oddly, mentioning some higher-level world—something similar to what Yang Bai spoke of back then."

Yang Kai's expression changed; he suddenly remembered that when he left years ago he had indeed told Shan Qingluo about those matters.

"When did she leave?"

"Two years after you disappeared, she left. She said you carried her Soul Pursuit Seal; as long as she could locate the world you were in, finding you would be easy."

Yang Kai nodded, confirming the Shadow King's words were truthful.

The fact that Shan Qingluo's Soul Pursuit Seal lay within him was known to no one but the two of them; that Shadow King could know it only meant Shan Qingluo had told him.

"What about Bilo?"

"She left with her."

Yang Kai sighed, helpless.

He had not expected that the enchantress would leave Cangyun Evil Land to search for him, even claiming to seek a higher-level world.

Whether she had found it he did not know; if she had, that would mean she too was on the Tongxuan Continent—so why had she never come to see him?

Yang Kai had completely lost the trail of her whereabouts.

A sudden wistfulness rose in his chest. When the enchantress had clung to him, he had been vexed and wished she would go; yet now that she truly seemed lost to him, he felt a pang of regret.

He suddenly felt contemptibly foolish.

"I've said all I have to say. Since you've captured me, do as you wish with me." The Shadow King snorted coldly, putting on a look of resigned acceptance of death.
