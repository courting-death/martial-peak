## Chapter 858 — Saint Lord, help!

In ordinary fights, Yang Kai is reluctant to rely on the might of a secret treasure, but the enemy before him was the Demon General Xueli, so he immediately took out that Saint-Grade Upper-Level Silver Leaf Secret Treasure.

Otherwise he could never break through Xueli’s mental sealing.

A fierce silver light flared, locking onto Yang Kai’s consciousness and forcing it back. While Xueli was momentarily distracted, Yang Kai shot up into the sky a hundred zhang high.

“What a powerful secret treasure!” Xueli also felt the terrifying power contained within it; her brows knitted and displeasure shadowed her face.

Yu Mo transformed into a streak of light and chased after Yang Kai, Demon Yuan surging as he unleashed a precise martial skill to block Yang Kai’s escape while sneering, “Can you run?”

Yang Kai pretended not to hear and made a slashing motion in front of him with his hand.

The next moment, a pitch-black rift abruptly opened in the void.

Yu Mo’s expression went blank as he stared at that abyss-like void; his divine sense probed into it but sank like a stone in the sea with no response.

That black abyss seemed like an invisible beast that could even devour his divine sense.

“Yu Mo, return!” Xueli hurriedly called; though she didn’t know exactly what Yang Kai had done, the rift emitted an unsettling aura that made her heart race.

Through her perception, the space she occupied seemed to be fracturing.

While shouting, she swept her hand and dark Demon Yuan, like silk, shot straight toward where Yang Kai stood.

Half of Yang Kai’s body had already slipped into the void rift, but before he could escape, Xueli’s attack struck his shoulder with a sickening pop of bones dislocating.

Rampant energy burst forth, causing instability in the torn rift; the chaotic flows within the void surged like trapped beasts.

Fearing delay, Yang Kai dove in headfirst; before entering he shot Xueli a look full of hatred and wary contempt.

The torn rift quickly sealed, and the world fell suddenly quiet.

At the snowy peak, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others went pale and stared up blankly, all frozen in place.

Yu Mo also descended with a ashen face; frowning, he asked in a low voice, “Lord, what kind of technique was that?”

“I don’t know...” Xueli slowly shook her head, sensing around and her expression turned as cold as ice. “He’s already over a hundred li away!”

“What?” Yu Mo was stupefied. Moments ago that human brat had been right before him; now he was a hundred li away—how had that been possible?

Even with Xueli’s cultivation it would be impossible to move that far so quickly. Could there be a void passage already present there?

Yu Mo peered closely but found no clues.

“Where’s the one who was with that brat?” Xueli turned to look and discovered that Wu Jie was gone as well.

“He escaped!” Zhang Ao hurriedly answered.

“Pathetic!” Xueli ground her teeth and cursed. A whole group surrounded them and still two managed to run off. Yang Kai escaping wasn’t surprising—his method was too wondrous for Xueli to fully intercept—but the other person was only First Stage of the Saint Realm; how could he have escaped?

“Lord, shall we pursue?” Yu Mo asked softly.

“Of course we pursue. Even if I have to chase him to the ends of the earth, I’ll catch him—this time he won’t get away!” Xueli snorted, her lithe body turning into a streak of light as she left.

Yu Mo hurried after her.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan exchanged glances; the latter said, “Brother Zhang, what should we do?”

“Follow them—what else?” Zhang Ao forced a bitter smile. He hadn’t expected the mysterious instigator who urged him to come to the Endless Snow Mountains to be Demon General Xueli, but now that it had come to this there was no turning back.

If news spread that he colluded with a demon general, Poxuan Palace and Cao Guan’s War Soul Hall would be vilified and unable to survive in the world.

All he could hope now was that Xueli would keep her word and hand over the lands within tens of thousands of li for him and Cao Guan to govern after this was done.

Saints and Transcendents among them moved off in pursuit, following the direction Xueli had disappeared into.

A hundred li away, a patch of space suddenly twisted and folded; in the next instant a rift appeared and Yang Kai burst out, his face as pale as paper.

“The Demon General’s power lives up to its reputation!” He coughed lightly, teeth clenched in hatred.

He had thought that with the power to tear the void he could escape easily, but he had underestimated Xueli’s strength.

She might not understand the art of tearing space, but for a cultivator of her level, all paths lead to the same truth; a casual move could thwart Yang Kai’s escape.

Still, if not for his own ability to rip space, Yang Kai wouldn’t have stood a chance of getting away from such experts.

He released his divine sense and after a brief scan his face changed.

Xueli was rapidly closing in on him; she was only fifty li away and would reach him in mere breaths.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai tore the void once more and slipped into the rift.

Xueli, who was rushing over, suddenly halted; a terrifying divine sense spread silently in all directions as her face darkened.

A moment later Yu Mo caught up and, seeing her standing still, asked in surprise, “Lady, did you catch up?”

Xueli slowly shook her head. “The trace disappeared. I don’t know what method he used—seems to be able to form a void passage and teleport a hundred li away in an instant…”

“There’s such a method in this world?” Yu Mo was astonished.

“In ancient times there were many methods we don’t understand. Such wonders are beyond our reckoning.” Xueli waved a hand. “Enough talk—I’ll search for his location. Hmph, does he think he can escape? He’s severely underestimating me!”

Yu Mo fell silent and stood beside Xueli waiting.

In the boundless black void, Yang Kai panted heavily and sat cross-legged, looking helpless.

Xueli’s pursuit was too swift and Yang Kai had spent too much power tearing space; he could at most do it one more time before he was exhausted. Even if he escaped a few hundred li it would be useless—Xueli would catch up soon enough.

So he didn’t intend to leave.

Hiding within the chaotic currents of the void, no matter how great Xueli’s methods, she wouldn’t be able to find him.

He took out some pills and ingested them, beginning to recuperate.

Time slowly passed and his strength gradually returned. The wound from Xueli’s strike wasn’t serious; thanks to the Demon God Golden Blood, it had mostly healed.

Just as Yang Kai was idly passing the time, he suddenly heard some unusual sounds nearby.

His expression changed and he listened intently; after a moment he rose with a strange look and flew toward one direction of the void.

As he approached the sound grew clearer—someone was struggling and gasping as if close to death.

After a while Yang Kai finally reached the source of the noise.

Looking out, he was stunned and exclaimed, “Sect Master Wu?”

Ahead, amid the void’s chaotic currents, Wu Jie was struggling wrapped in a green aura, trying to shake off the interference, but the more he fought the slower his movements became.

The void’s turbulent eddies resembled a swamp, constantly tugging at his body and trying to devour him.

Wu Jie was in a sorry state, his power disordered; the green aura surrounding him had dimmed considerably—he was at death’s door.

Yang Kai never expected to meet Wu Jie in the void.

Wu Jie certainly didn’t expect it either. On the edge of life and death, he heard Yang Kai’s voice and looked up to find Yang Kai standing not far away. The chaotic currents that had terrified him flowed past Yang Kai’s feet as if they obeyed him; Yang Kai was completely unaffected.

Overjoyed, he begged, “Saint Lord, save me!”

Yang Kai let out a wry laugh and waved his hand. Mystic power burst forth, taming and regulating the chaotic currents around Wu Jie as if Yang Kai smoothed them out.

Wu Jie took the opportunity to leap out and hurried to Yang Kai’s side, pale and chuckling dryly, “Thank you, Saint Lord. Your timing couldn’t have been more perfect.”

“You escaped here using that method?” Yang Kai suddenly realized something.

Wu Jie’s appearance here meant he had also torn space to arrive. Thinking back, Yang Kai hadn’t seen Wu Jie when he left the snowy peak earlier; Wu Jie must have slipped away before Yang Kai acted.

“Yes.” Wu Jie nodded quickly. “But unlucky timing left me trapped here; I almost died.”

“Indeed, this place is dangerous.” Yang Kai nodded.

Wu Jie looked at Yang Kai thoughtfully. “But it seems Saint Lord has already comprehended some truth of this place.”

“A bit better than you,” Yang Kai admitted bluntly.

Wu Jie’s face darkened and he fell silent.

After all, it was Wu Jie who taught Yang Kai the method to tear space; he hadn’t expected his student to surpass him so thoroughly.

In any case, having just been saved, Wu Jie was immensely relieved.

“Xueli is chasing me; I can’t leave for now. Don’t rush to go—recover here for a while.” Yang Kai glanced him over and said, “If you go out you’ll surely be caught by her.”

“Recover here?” Wu Jie goggled, eyes popping.

“Any problem?”

“No! With you protecting me there’s no problem! I won’t refuse.” Wu Jie was smart and wasted no time; he took out pills and crystal stones, sat cross-legged, and began circulating his cultivation.

Yang Kai didn’t disturb him and silently watched the endless void.

He hadn’t expected that two people tearing space into this place could meet; he’d thought it was an isolated area, but it seemed whoever tore space entered the same transitional void, which is why he and Wu Jie had collided.

It seemed there were still hidden mysteries he hadn’t yet uncovered.
