## Chapter 620 — Restoring the Bone Shield

Differences in rank and disparity in status exist everywhere.

Duao City was indeed bustling and prosperous. Yang Kai walked along, observing; seeing the cultivation tiers and numbers of passing martial artists, he felt a slight shock in his heart.

It seemed that on the Tongxuan Continent, Divine Roaming Realm cultivators were a very common group. Of the martial artists Yang Kai met in Duao City, about sixty percent were of the Divine Roaming Realm, and occasionally one would encounter a Transcendent Realm expert.

In that other world, the Divine Roaming Realm was already a respectable tier; in some places even those of the True Yuan Realm could claim supremacy. But here, Divine Roaming Realm practitioners were nothing special.

When Yun Xuan led them into a large hall, Yang Kai noticed many martial artists entering and exiting; those who entered bore expressions of nervousness and expectation, while those who left displayed either joy or disappointment, which puzzled him—he could not tell what this place was exactly.

Inside the hall were many side rooms; outside those rooms a number of martial artists were queuing, waiting for something.

Yun Xuan led Yang Kai and Shui Ling directly to the innermost side room.

Within the side room, a thick soft rug covered the floor, the surrounding walls were carved with numerous lifelike patterns, and in the middle an incense burner held precious herbs alight, making the room warm and comfortable.

A corpulent old man sat on a grand chair, bearing an arrogant air as he coldly looked at a martial artist at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm before him, his expression somewhat impatient.

As Yang Kai reached the doorway with Yun Xuan, he happened to hear the old man say coolly to that martial artist, “Without a Cangkong Poison Feather, I simply cannot repair this Secret Treasure. Moreover, you are not a disciple of my Duao Meng; the fee would have to be increased by twenty percent. You have neither the materials nor the sufficient payment—how can I take this on? What sort of person do you take me for?”

While speaking, he waved his hand lightly. “Go away. Find the materials, gather the payment, and then come to see me. Or you may seek other refiners; their fees are not as high as mine.”

“Master…” the martial artist tried to beg again, but the old man glared and the rest of his plea was swallowed. He left in dejection, shaking his head in helplessness.

Passing through the doorway, the martial artist sighed heavily. Yang Kai glanced at the Secret Treasure in his hand and, upon pondering the old man’s words, suddenly understood what this place was.

The old man seated inside had also noticed Yun Xuan outside and his face brightened; he smiled and beckoned, “Miss Yun, you’re here—come in quickly.”

Yun Xuan smiled slightly and entered, greeting warmly, “Master Ma.”

The old man’s smile became cordial; not a trace of the impatience and arrogance he had shown toward the earlier visitor remained. Yang Kai watched in astonishment, wondering what charm Yun Xuan possessed to make the old man’s attitude change so completely.

Even if she was from Duao Meng, that alone should hardly have warranted such a transformation.

Moreover, the old man regarded her with the kindness of an elder toward a junior, without the slightest lecherous gaze.

“Have you another Secret Treasure that’s been damaged?” Master Ma said with a wry smile, reaching out, “Take it out and let me have a look.”

Yun Xuan stuck out her tongue coquettishly, looking playful and charming. With a flick of her small hand a brilliant light appeared in her palm. Yang Kai focused and saw it was a spear-shaped Secret Treasure, arcs of electricity dancing along it—its grade was not low.

Yet the spear bore some cracks, its shaft speckled as if it had been corroded by something.

“The battle you encountered was no small matter.” Master Ma’s face darkened as he regarded Yun Xuan thoughtfully and sighed, “Ah, a young girl—why fight so recklessly?”

Yun Xuan gave a light laugh. “It got like this accidentally.”

“You, ah, I do not know how to speak to you.”

“Then don’t say anything, elder!” Yun Xuan coquetted, and as she spoke she produced some materials and Crystal Stones, handing them to Master Ma. “These are the repair materials and the payment.”

“Keep your payment,” Master Ma shook his head.

“I am only an ordinary disciple of the Meng; how could I break the rules of the alliance?”

“I say no, so no. I still have that right—what, do you look down on me?” Master Ma feigned anger and put on a stern face.

Yun Xuan stuck out her tongue and, with no choice, took back the Crystal Stones.

“Come back in three days to collect it. This time I will refine it to the point that it cannot be damaged!” Master Ma’s face shone with confidence.

“Thank you, Master Ma.” Yun Xuan was delighted.

“This master can repair Secret Treasures?” Yang Kai, who had been observing the whole time, finally asked.

The clothing Master Ma wore looked refined, and on his chest were carved some special insignia. Yang Kai did not know what the insignia meant, but guessed they were the mark of a refiner.

It was the same principle as the insignia worn by alchemists on their chests.

Hearing this, Master Ma glanced up at Yang Kai and let out a soft laugh, “I work in this trade, of course I can repair them. Are you a new member of Yun Xuan’s squad?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Yun Xuan added, “Master, he is a… well, a friend, not a member of my squad.”

Master Ma laughed, “Your friend is somewhat ignorant—entering the alliance’s Secret Treasure Hall and still not knowing what it’s for.”

“He’s been away from the wider world for a time; he’s a bit slow to catch on,” Yun Xuan said, glancing at Yang Kai and explaining, “This is our Duao Meng’s Secret Treasure Hall. Many refiners of superb technique sit within; Master Ma is the most formidable—whatever Secret Treasure comes into his hands, he can refine and repair to perfection.”

Saying that, she suddenly realized, “Do you have a Secret Treasure that needs repairing?”

Yang Kai nodded and casually produced the Bone Shield.

That Bone Shield had been damaged when it had absorbed many blows for Yang Kai beneath Zhongdu, and had been further harmed in a great eruption on the Wasteland.

Yang Kai had wanted to find an opportunity to repair it; he had not expected Yun Xuan to bring him straight to such a place—truly, as the proverb said, the pillow was brought to one who nodded off, saving him the trouble of seeking it himself.

Master Ma reached out to take the Bone Shield, gently stroking it and releasing True Yuan to sense its internal structure. His face suddenly darkened and he was filled with annoyance. “Which bastard forged this Secret Treasure?”

Yang Kai shrugged. “I don’t know.”

“Incompetence—utter incompetence. The materials used in this Secret Treasure are not expensive, yet there was no need to forge it into such a low-grade piece!”

Yang Kai smiled wryly. A lower-level Mystery-Grade item would already be enviable in that other world, but in Master Ma’s estimation it was worthless.

“The technique is clumsy beyond belief. The refiner who made this Secret Treasure should be dragged out and killed,” Master Ma said in a fury.

Yun Xuan said softly, “Master has extremely strict standards for refinement.”

Yang Kai nodded gently; he, too, had noticed how obsessed Master Ma seemed with refinement—strict to himself and strict to other refiners.

Master Ma looked Yang Kai over again and said doubtfully, “Yun Xuan said you came from a remote place; indeed. Only in outlying corners would one still use such outdated methods to forge Secret Treasures. This technique has a history of thousands of years and has long been discarded.”

“Can you repair this Secret Treasure?” Yang Kai asked.

“So long as you have the materials, I can repair it!” Master Ma smiled confidently. “What materials do you have?”

“Uh…” Yang Kai thought for a moment; he seemed to have only the Ice-Flame Star Sand he had obtained a few days ago. He hurriedly produced it. “Will this do?”

“Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Ice-Flame Star Sand?” Master Ma’s expression brightened immediately; his gaze was intense as he looked at the ice-blue flame dancing in Yang Kai’s hand.

Once those granules of star sand were taken out, the temperature in the side room dropped considerably; both Yun Xuan and Shui Ling shivered involuntarily.

Sensing their reactions, Yang Kai quickly circulated his True Yuan to envelop the Ice-Flame Star Sand, preventing its chill from spreading.

Master Ma’s eyes lit and he secretly nodded; this young man’s True Yuan was indeed pure, and his control over it was remarkable. Though inexperienced, he had some skill.

“Ice-Flame Star Sand can indeed be used to repair your Secret Treasure.” Master Ma suppressed his excitement and nodded. Although Spirit-Grade upper-level materials were precious, as the top refiner of the Secret Treasure Hall he had seen countless valuable materials and would not lose his composure.

“But it is somewhat overqualified. This is Spirit-Grade upper-level material while your Secret Treasure is only lower-level Mystery-Grade. The disparity is obvious. To use Ice-Flame Star Sand on this Bone Shield…” Master Ma’s mouth twitched slightly. “What a waste.”

“If it can repair the Bone Shield, that is enough,” Yang Kai insisted.

“You really intend to do that?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded.

Master Ma frowned but ceased to dissuade him—after all, both the Secret Treasure and the material belonged to Yang Kai; he could use them as he pleased. He exhaled softly and said, “Very well. Since you insist, I will take action. But to repair this Secret Treasure, Ice-Flame Star Sand alone will not suffice; one more material is required.”

“What material?” Yang Kai asked.

“Either Xuanwu Iron or Kongchan Jade—either one will do. If you procure the former, I can refine the Bone Shield into a middle-level Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure. If you procure the latter, I can refine it into an upper-level Mystery-Grade, or even a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure, depending on your own ability,” Master Ma said proudly.

“Xuanwu Iron, Kongchan Jade?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“One is a Mystery-Grade material and the other a Spirit-Grade material,” Shui Ling explained softly.

“Where can one obtain these two materials?”

“That you’ll have to figure out yourself.” Master Ma snorted lightly, apparently displeased by what he regarded as Yang Kai’s wasteful handling of rare things. “However, with sufficient Crystal Stones, you can buy anything in Duao City. Xuanwu Iron and Kongchan Jade are not utterly unparalleled rarities; they should have stock.”

“I see. Roughly how many Crystal Stones would these two materials cost?” Yang Kai directed this question to Shui Ling.

Shui Ling pursed her lips and smiled, “With your current fortune, you probably can’t afford them.”
