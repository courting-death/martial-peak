## Chapter 654 — The Cavern

Under the pursuit of Chu Jian, a powerful cultivator at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Yang Kai showed no panic at all; on the contrary, he remained clear-headed and began to haggle with Han Fei, trying to use the fact that he had just saved her to make her change her hostility toward him.

Beneath the magma, Chu Jian took the lead. A burst of terrifying force from his sturdy frame pushed the searing magma aside. Although he dove down at tremendous speed, he still could not see Yang Kai and Han Fei, and could only lock onto their position with his Divine Sense.

“Human, you can’t escape. Surrender obediently and you’ll suffer less! If I catch you, I’ll flay you alive!” Chu Jian shouted angrily as he gave chase.

Yang Kai paid him no mind and kept diving down; if he stopped now, that would truly be the end.

In any case, he had no desire to fall into the hands of someone like Chu Jian.

Before long, the two of them reached the depth at which they had been sitting in meditation for the past month.

After arriving, Han Fei’s condition indeed worsened considerably. Even wrapped in Yang Kai’s True Yuan, her demonic qi flickered and rose and fell, instinctively rejecting the surrounding Yang Qi, and a trace of panic even appeared on her fair features.

Han Fei had said earlier that this was basically the limit she could reach; any deeper and she would be unable to proceed.

In other words, once they reached this depth her life and death were essentially in Yang Kai’s hands. If he wished to kill her, he could abandon her here and whether it was the Chu Jian coming after them or the Yang Qi of this place, it would be enough to finish off the badly wounded Han Fei.

Of course she was nervous.

Yang Kai glanced at her, grinned, and increased his True Yuan output, wrapping her tightly—he had no intention of abandoning her.

Sensing this, Han Fei could not help but exhale in relief; she cast him a cold, complicated look.

“Human, you’ve angered me. I’ve decided—I'll make your life worse than death!” Chu Jian’s enraged roar came from above. Seeing that Yang Kai showed no sign of compromise, his face could not be kept, and he stopped caring about anything else—his only thought was to seize Yang Kai and torture him to vent his hatred.

As he spoke, he shifted into a higher gear and pursued them with unrelenting speed.

Yang Kai’s expression changed and he hurried to dive even faster, but his cultivation was after all not as mighty as Chu Jian’s, and the gap between them was steadily closing.

It also seemed that Chu Jian’s imposing aura, released so freely, had destabilized the volcano, causing the magma below to surge upward rapidly and obstruct Yang Kai’s descent.

Twenty zhang, thirty zhang, fifty zhang…

As they went deeper, the surrounding Yang Qi and the heat intensified. The swelter drenched Yang Kai in sweat; the woman tucked under his arm, Han Fei, was even more soaked—sweat trickled from her brow down the length of her fair neck and slid into her bosom.

“Are we at the limit?” Han Fei asked suddenly. With her keen sight she could naturally see the hardship on Yang Kai’s face.

Yang Kai remained silent.

“What rotten luck—to die together with a human like you!” Han Fei sighed softly, looking as though she felt a lingering regret about her own life.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai snapped. He hadn’t expected that at a time like this she would still look down on him.

He had sensed it back at Mo Shen Fort—many of the Ancient Demon Clan looked down on him. Guan’er now treated him amiably, but at first she too scorned him.

In the eyes of many of the Ancient Demon Clan, humans were a low, third-rate race; only their clan possessed noble bloodlines, and the looks they cast at him were filled with obvious arrogance and contempt.

Such gazes made Yang Kai very uncomfortable.

Han Fei’s attitude was even more conspicuous; from the moment she first saw him until now she had always spoken to him with a lofty air.

Yang Kai could not understand what she had to feel so proud about.

Suddenly, with a soft rustle, a pair of wings unfurled behind Yang Kai.

As the wings spread, Yang Kai’s speed leapt another notch. Under his control, those broad, resplendent wings contracted into a sheath, wrapping Yang Kai and Han Fei tightly within.

The oppressive heat immediately eased considerably.

“The laws of the Heavenly Dao?” Han Fei’s beautiful eyes trembled violently as she stared dumbfounded at the Wings of Yang Flame that cocooned her, calling out in astonishment.

From those gorgeous wings she sensed a profound, unfathomable mystery and power.

Such mystery and power were not something Yang Kai could have cultivated by himself, but were obtained through some special opportunity—the power of the laws of the Heavenly Dao.

“You actually—” Han Fei covered her small mouth, stunned and speechless.

“You have some perception,” Yang Kai taunted. “Yes, this really is the power granted by the laws of the Heavenly Dao.”

“Your good fortune is something that makes others envious,” Han Fei murmured. She reached out to stroke the wings, but the instant her hand touched them a crackling sound ran through her fingers.

The yang elemental energy contained in the wings conflicted with her demonic qi; it would not injure her, but it would purify her demonic qi.

She withdrew her hand, bit her reddened lip, sensed for a moment, and said with a pleased expression, “Chu Jian’s speed has slowed.”

“He should be near his limit,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“But as long as he blocks the passage above, we can’t get out; sooner or later he’ll catch us,” Han Fei said helplessly.

“You think Lady Li won’t pay attention to his movements?” Yang Kai sneered. “You’ve been with Li Rong for so many years and you still don’t understand her. She is merciful, but that does not mean she is ignorant. If Chu Jian dared bring people out to attack us, even if Li Rong doesn’t learn of it at once, she will find out in a few days and come to rescue us. We only need to hide for a while.”

Han Fei’s face reddened and she fell silent.

As one of the four commanders, in normal times she would naturally have been able to think through such a simple matter, but the events of today had repeatedly exceeded her expectations and left her unable to think clearly.

“Human, you will regret this!” Chu Jian’s unwilling roar came from above. “Han Fei, if you don’t want to die, bring that human out and I’ll spare your life!”

No one answered him; when Chu Jian shouted, both Yang Kai and Han Fei noticed that he had paused in his pursuit.

Even a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, in such a suppressive environment, could not chase very far.

Seeing a chance of escape, Han Fei’s expression brightened and she looked radiant.

“Put me down.” She suddenly realized she had been tucked under his arm the whole time and had not resisted.

“Your wounds…” Yang Kai glanced at her.

“Do not compare me to your fragile human body. My Ancient Demon Clan—” she began.

Before she could finish boasting, Yang Kai released her. Sensing his disgust, Han Fei wisely refrained from continuing and instead followed closely at his side, protected by his True Yuan and the Wings of Yang Flame.

Chu Jian’s roars continued from above and the magma grew ever more restless. Both Yang Kai and Han Fei anxiously searched for a way out and expanded their Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

Suddenly Han Fei’s face lit up; she pointed in a direction and cried, “This way!”

Yang Kai was startled, followed the direction she indicated with his senses, and couldn’t help but smile as he turned and darted that way.

After a moment, the magma that had been enveloping them abruptly vanished and the two slipped into a narrow passage.

The passage was pitch black but unusually dry, and the heat here was nowhere near as unbearable as being in the magma.

That such a place could exist beneath a volcano pleasantly surprised Yang Kai.

They sat down on the ground, panting heavily; both of them felt the joy and thrill of having escaped from death.

Gradually adjusting to the dark, Yang Kai looked around and found that on his left the scalding magma was still surging upward, while on his right lay a passage that seemed bottomless.

“We should go deeper inside, in case the magma rushes in…” Yang Kai suggested warily. The magma was now being pushed upward by some force; once that force vanished, it would certainly flood into the passage.

Han Fei agreed and offered no objection. She laboriously steadied herself to her feet and followed behind Yang Kai.

In the pitch-black darkness Yang Kai groped forward. Han Fei dared not stray far—after all, the Yang Qi here was still strong and she needed to rely on Yang Kai’s True Yuan to resist its erosion.

Drip, drip—the sound of Han Fei’s blood falling from her wound onto the ground echoed sharply in the silent passage.

Yang Kai showed little sign of concern; judging by Han Fei’s prior condition and the robust constitution of the Ancient Demon Clan, such grievous wounds were not enough to kill her.

They followed the passage inward for an unknown length of time, winding and turning, until Yang Kai suddenly discovered they had come to a cavern where energy was extraordinarily concentrated.

The cavern was vast, its ceiling lost to darkness, utterly lightless. Yang Kai could not see what lay within, but when he opened his Divine Sense he detected no trace of living breath.

That reassured him considerably.

He knew that in such a special environment there could very well be strange lifeforms—creatures that were generally fierce and powerful. If they encountered such beings now, neither he nor Han Fei would be able to withstand them.

“Rest awhile,” Yang Kai exhaled softly.

Han Fei nodded slightly. The two of them groped over and sat down cross-legged.

As she sat, she gave Yang Kai a little tug, forcing him to sit beside her.

Realizing her intention, Yang Kai gave a half-suppressed laugh.

This woman clearly could not do without the shelter of his True Yuan, yet was too embarrassed to admit it and could only express it through her actions.

“How hypocritical,” Yang Kai thought.
