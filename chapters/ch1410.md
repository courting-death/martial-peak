## Chapter 1410 — They Deserve to Be Killed

Behind the woman stood a man of peculiar appearance — a sharp-nosed, monkey-faced fellow with narrow, slitted eyes that seemed hardly able to open, and two little fissures for pupils; a mouth that jutted forward with protruding buck teeth, like a rabbit, provoking derisive laughter.

He looked repulsively lecherous, and standing beside that breathtakingly beautiful woman he formed an extremely stark visual contrast, only serving to make her beauty even more extraordinary while making his own ugliness all the more hideous.

From their positions it was clear this buck‑toothed man was likely the younger of the two or her disciple, for he stood half a pace behind her with a respectful expression, deferential as though he followed her lead; his cultivation stood at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet the Saint Yuan ripples faintly emanating from his body were far denser and purer than those of an ordinary First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner.

On seeing the woman, Yang Kai's face darkened; he didn't know what background she had. If she were an enemy, this would be a difficult situation. Facing the woman in palace attire, Yang Kai felt a certain oppressive sensation that Jin Shi, Old Woman Feng and the others could not produce.

From this it was evident her strength surpassed that of Jin Shi, Old Woman Feng and the others.

Yet when he saw the buck‑toothed man, Yang Kai showed a look of surprise.

He recognized him — the buck‑toothed man was Ge Qi, the very one who, after the last Jubao Tower auction, had used a Star Emperor Token to trade a Spiritual Pill with him!

Yang Kai's impression of him was deep: when that fellow met Yang Yan he acted like a mouse seeing a cat, not only frightened but deeply reverent, even calling himself "Xiao Qi"!

How could Yang Kai forget such an odd‑looking, strangely behaving man?

He still remembered that after they had exchanged the Spiritual Pills, the other party mentioned that, if possible, his elder would come to pay a visit to him and Yang Yan. Thinking about it now, that palace-robed woman must be Ge Qi’s elder—and the Spiritual Pill he had wanted to trade for with the Star Emperor Token back then was meant for her.

Enemy or friend? Yang Kai frowned, uncertain.

Nevertheless, the arrival of the two successfully drew everyone's attention, easing the previously tense atmosphere considerably.

Moreover, when the powerful figures present took a clear look at the woman's face, they all displayed expressions of disbelief, and some were utterly terrified, as if they greatly feared this woman in palace attire.

Even Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance and Cheng Pengxuan of the Leitai Sect reacted the same way. The two exchanged a glance and showed signs of apprehension, secretly troubled.

As the two great powers on Dark Star, the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect would not put anyone on equal footing, save for the mysterious Star Emperor Mountain. Mo Xiaosheng and Cheng Pengxuan were both great elders within their factions, holding lofty ranks and extraordinary strength; that they felt such dread meant this woman in palace dress must possess an extraordinary identity and backing.

Yang Kai watched their reactions; though he still didn't know whether these newcomers were friend or foe or what their origins were, he could tell this woman was undoubtedly a renowned figure.

"How could it be her?" Qian Tong looked as if he'd seen a ghost, rubbing his eyes hard while his eyelids twitched.

Fei Zhi Tu's mouth hung open like a hippo's; his expression was little better than Qian Tong's.

"Elder, who is this senior?" Wei Guchang asked curiously at the side. The moment the woman in palace attire appeared, she exerted absolute pressure over all the experts present without speaking, which left Wei Guchang puzzled and inexplicably excited.

An expert should be like this!

"Her? She is the former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain..." Qian Tong replied bitterly.

Wei Guchang's frame trembled and he looked at the woman with even greater admiration, apparently not expecting such an illustrious background.

Star Emperor Mountain was the most mysterious and powerful force on Dark Star; no one knew how many experts it possessed or the depth of its foundation, but it was said to inherit the legacy of the Starry Sky Emperor. Thus even the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect bowed a measure before Star Emperor Mountain.

Fortunately Star Emperor Mountain did not seek to seize everything, and it rarely appeared on Dark Star; otherwise other sects would have no room to develop and would long since have been unified under Star Emperor Mountain.

Though Qian Tong's words were quiet, they still entered the woman's ears. She turned slightly and cast a glance with phoenix‑like eyes in his direction; under her gaze Qian Tong felt his scalp tingle and managed a forced smile.

The younger generation might not recognize her, but every expert of Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and above present knew her reputation and terrifying methods. Recalling the many great events that occurred when she led Star Emperor Mountain over a century ago, Qian Tong felt increasingly uneasy.

How did she come to be here?

"I have been out of the world for a long time; I did not expect upon returning to meet so many old acquaintances," the woman in palace attire suddenly parted her red lips; her voice was pleasing as a spring breeze, soothing body and mind. "Young Qian, Young Fei, you two have reached such realms now — it seems you have not wasted these years."

When she spoke, the earth shook.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, both venerable elders of Yingyue Hall with lifespans stretching over centuries, had actually been addressed by this woman as “Young Qian” and “Young Fei”…

Countless Saint King Realm martial artists nearly dropped their eyes from their sockets, while many couldn't help laughing secretly.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu couldn't laugh. They exchanged looks and hurriedly bowed with clasped fists, "Greetings, Senior Sister Ye, a hundred years have passed since we last met; Senior Sister Ye's presence remains radiant — congratulations!"

"Enough." The Ye‑surname woman waved her hand lightly, her delicate face showing no clear emotion. "I barely hang on to life; what radiance is there to speak of?"

Saying so, she turned and beckoned to the other side, "Young Hei, come here!"

There, Ren Tianrui of Jubao Tower, nicknamed Little Black Face, reflexively answered, not understanding why the senior called him, until he saw his master Yan Pei stride forward with a smile and quickly reach the woman's side.

Ren Tianrui blinked and suddenly realized.

So his master had slowly grown from the young black face into the old black face...

The senior wasn't calling him at all — she was calling his master.

"Yan Pei pays respects to Senior Sister Ye. Does Senior Sister Ye have any instructions?" Yan Pei asked respectfully.

"What has happened here to gather so many people?" Ye frowned slightly and asked calmly.

Yan Pei, as the chief auctioneer of Jubao Tower, was extremely eloquent; in a few words he concisely related the situation here without any redundancy.

Although he did not explain every detail, Ye was shrewd and understood the ins and outs.

At those words, she let out an irritated snort. “Bullying the weak with their strength, preying on those beneath them—they deserved to be killed!”

Saying this, she glared icily at Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng. The two top experts on Dark Star frowned with displeasure. They indeed respected Ye's reputation and prestige, but that belonged to a century past; now that they had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, being treated with such disdain naturally angered them.

Moreover, Ye no longer represented Star Emperor Mountain. Over a hundred years ago she disappeared after a dispute with Star Emperor Mountain, and since then there had been no news.

In other words, she was now alone — no matter how great her name, could she contend with a whole sect?

Anger or not, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng did not act rashly; they were still uncertain of her intentions, and it would be unwise to make an enemy impulsively.

After learning the cause of the conflict, Ye cast her beautiful eyes upon Yang Kai and asked the buck‑toothed warrior at her side, "Young Qi, is he the one you spoke of?"

Ge Qi bowed respectfully. "Yes, Patriarch; it is this person."

"Where is the Lord?" Ye's brows knit as she murmured softly; her voice was so faint that even the cultivators present could not hear clearly, or else it would have caused an uproar. She glanced toward the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain and understood inwardly that the Lord must be behind the array.

With that thought she revealed a gentle smile and gave Yang Kai a slight nod, "You are Yang Kai, are you not?"

Yang Kai felt uneasy, but kept a composed manner and clasped his fists, "I am Yang Kai. May I ask what guidance Elder has come to bestow upon my humble mountain?”

"Guidance is too grand a word." Ye smiled faintly; her peerless charm left the onlookers stunned. Those with weaker will and slightly lower strength could not turn away as if some invisible attraction drew their eyes. "I have come only to meet someone, and if my guess is correct that person should be within this mountain. If convenient, might I ask the Young Brother to open the array so I may enter?"

Her tone was mild and showed no hostility, framed as a request, but Yang Kai's brow tightened and for a moment he could not decide.

He had his suspicions about whom she wished to meet — it could only be Yang Yan. Ge Qi's behavior at the Jubao Tower when he saw Yang Yan had been so astonishing, and he had said his elder would pay a visit before leaving.

They had no particular ties, so whoever she came to see would certainly be Yang Yan.

Yet her origins were unknown; friend or foe was unclear. How could Yang Kai lightly open the array? If she harbored ill intent toward Yang Yan, it would be inviting a wolf into the house.

With her abilities, once inside Dragon Lair Mountain none of the interior cultivators could stop her, so Yang Kai hesitated.

Seeing Ye speak so amiably and even say "please," Qian Tong and the others were dumbfounded and stood frozen.
