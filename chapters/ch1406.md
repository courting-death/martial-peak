## Chapter 1406 — Trap

Yang Kai frowned tightly. He stood at a spot on Dragon Lair Mountain, his body covered in blood, looking wretched, and he fixed a bewildered, strange stare on a point not far ahead.

On the ground ahead was a huge, deep pit, and scattered beside it were countless torn pieces of flesh, a sight that was ghastly to behold.

This was clearly the consequence of Xie Li's self-destruction.

But Yang Kai simply could not bring himself to believe the scene he had just witnessed!

How could Xie Li choose to self-destruct? Even if he bore the greatest hatred toward him, he was not the sort to sacrifice his life for revenge. Besides, their fight had only just begun—could he really have had no confidence at all in defeating him?

Only someone driven to a dead end would opt for such an extreme method to perish together with the enemy; otherwise, if he exploded and the enemy did not die, would that not make the bereaved suffer while the enemy rejoiced?

Yang Kai instinctively suspected Xie Li was playing some trick, thinking that everything he had just seen was an illusion.

Yet the giant pit and the fierce energy blast just now were plainly the kind of effects that only a warrior of that level could produce by self-destruction; this could not be faked. In his Divine Sense perception there was no trace of Xie Li's aura left in heaven and earth—he had truly vanished.

Is he insane? Yang Kai cursed inwardly, and a flicker of unease crossed his eyes.

A Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert exploding at only three to five zhang away—that terrifying energy swept outward. If Yang Kai had not sensed something was wrong and prepared in advance, this time he most likely would have been dragged down by him.

The two layers of protection formed by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird and the Purple Shield at the last moment reduced the force of the self-destruction to roughly sixty percent. Even so, when the aftershock struck, Yang Kai felt like a lone skiff on a storm-tossed sea, constantly in danger of capsizing.

Fortunately his body was tough and his Golden Blood possessed powerful regenerative ability; at the crucial moment he had even torn open a spatial rift that swallowed most of the aftershock.

For now he looked battered, but there was no grave harm.

In other words, Xie Li had died in vain!

Yet Yang Kai still frowned, without the slightest excitement. He vaguely felt that something was off.

Unless Xie Li had lost his mind. Otherwise he could not have made such a foolish choice. Xie Li had always served as the Deacon of Yingyue Hall and his cultivation was respectable. Such a person was unquestionably shrewd. He would never have used self-destruction to launch an attack.

Yang Kai was utterly baffled.

Recalling Xie Li's expression before the self-destruction made Yang Kai even more perplexed.

Just as he was at a loss, another anomaly arose: in the giant pit, a chunk of flesh from Xie Li's explosion suddenly writhed strangely, and immediately a blood-red radiance shot out from it.

At the same time, four or five identical blood-red rays shot in from all directions; their origins were the spots where the Xie Family's Saint King Realm warriors, whom Yang Kai had slain before, had fallen.

The moment those blood-red rays appeared, they all rushed toward Yang Kai's position, moving with terrifying speed and without a sound.

By the time Yang Kai noticed, they were already upon him!

Yang Kai's face changed. Although he did not know precisely what those blood-red rays were, he sensed their peculiarity. He extended his hand before him and a Vast Heaven Shield formed to block them, then Golden Blood Threads vibrated from his hand and sliced toward those blood-red rays.

Swooshing sounds tore the air as the razor-sharp Golden Blood Threads, in an instant, cut those blood-red rays back and forth hundreds of times.

Yet only one of the rays, which looked slightly weaker, was scattered and revealed its true form—it appeared like a silkworm pupa, its body cut into countless segments and dissipating into the world as if it had never existed.

The remaining rays, however, attacked at even greater speed.

Astonishment showed on Yang Kai's face as he hastily pulled back, but the rays were undoubtedly faster; in the blink of an eye they reached the Vast Heaven Shield, and the thick shield seemed like nothing, utterly unable to stop their advance.

Several blood-red rays flashed and pierced into Yang Kai's mind; his Divine Sense defenses could not block them at all.

Damn!

Yang Kai's expression sank. He immediately closed his eyes and sent his mind into his Sea of Consciousness. The next moment, his Spirit Body manifested within the Sea of Consciousness; he turned his head and looked around, quickly locating the intruders' traces.

They were exactly like what he had just seen—silkworm-pupa-like things, blood-red in color, quietly floating above some spot within his Sea of Consciousness.

When Yang Kai discovered them, they simultaneously erupted with light and then converged and fused; in the blink of an eye several of the strange silkworm-pupa things merged into a single entity.

A somewhat familiar aura emanated from within.

"Lu Ye!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. Although he had only sparred with Lu Ye once, he still remembered the man's aura because he was too strange.

What surprised him was that Lu Ye's trace was hidden behind those blood-red rays.

Could it be... Xie Li's self-destruction was also controlled by Lu Ye? Otherwise, how could a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert choose such an extreme method at the very start of a battle?

And one of those blood-red rays had clearly shot out from a piece of Xie Li's flesh.

Recalling Xie Li's change in expression before the self-destruction, Yang Kai faintly felt his guess was correct. If so, Lu Ye was truly remarkable—he could even control a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert!

Who exactly was he? In an instant Yang Kai elevated his estimation of Lu Ye and no longer dared to underestimate him in the slightest.

Narrowing his eyes at the blood-colored silkworm pupa, Yang Kai judged that this thing should be condensed from Divine Sense power rather than being a physical object. Could Lu Ye, merely a Saint King Realm cultivator, possess such potent Divine Sense?

He could hardly believe it.

Yang Kai's speculation was correct: Xie Li had indeed been controlled by Lu Ye. Lu Ye had once stood at the very pinnacle tens of thousands of years ago; though now he traveled shallow waters and his cultivation was not outstanding, the secret techniques he wielded were far beyond those of ordinary Origin Returning Realm practitioners. Even someone as shrewd as Xie Li would never have imagined Lu Ye could plant a Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu within him.

Through this Gu, Lu Ye secretly manipulated the fates of the Xie Family, the Haixin Sect, Liu Yun Valley, and the many warriors he had brought under his control.

He had never intended for Xie Li to seek out Yang Kai to take revenge or to kill Yang Kai; his original plan was to use the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu to control Yang Kai and reclaim what was his.

In the Flowing Flame Sandland his precious item had fallen into Yang Kai's hands, and Lu Ye had longed to take it back—now at last he had found an opportunity.

His original intent was not to have Xie Li self-detonate to kill Yang Kai, but only to severely wound him so he would have no strength to resist.

Yet in scheming everything out, he had not expected Xie Li to choose to close into melee against Yang Kai; if not for Yang Kai's formidable power, his plan would likely have failed, for if Yang Kai had died, he would never have recovered his possession.

The Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was not a poisonous insect but a thing condensed from Divine Sense secret arts; it was bizarre beyond measure and hard to defend against. Now that several Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu had merged into one, its power exceeded before—controlling a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior would be effortless.

In his Sea of Consciousness Yang Kai stared at the silkworm-pupa-like thing with an expression of baffled suspicion.

Although he did not recognize the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu, Yang Kai knew it was no good. With a thought, the seawater below, rolling like flames, surged forth en masse toward the pupa to envelop it.

The pupa showed no intention of resisting and allowed itself to be wrapped tightly by the seawater.

The mighty Divine Sense Fire continuously burned the pupa, yet it appeared unmoved; its red glow flickered and it acted as if nothing had happened.

Yang Kai's face changed subtly. He secretly felt he had underestimated the damned thing—his Divine Sense Fire seemed unable to inflict much harm. With that realization he ceased the useless effort and waved his hand, letting the seawater fall back.

Just as he was about to employ another method, the blood-colored pupa suddenly trembled and transformed into a blood-red ray that shot straight at his Spirit Body.

Yang Kai would not let it succeed. Within this Sea of Consciousness he was sovereign: where his mind moved his form followed; he could control everything.

He coldly snorted, and a barrage of fiery red spears condensed from pure Divine Sense power appeared, filling the sky and being unleashed at the blood-colored pupa. But the pupa was astonishingly nimble, bobbing slightly and evading all the attacks.

This proved troublesome; a hard glint crossed Yang Kai's face. The World-Ending Demon Eye hovering above the Sea of Consciousness suddenly opened, and from its huge golden pupil a golden beam shot down to envelop the target.

The blood-colored pupa dodged a few times but could not avoid being shrouded within it.

The wildly twitching Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu immediately quieted, as if frozen in place. Its fat body twisted and emitted a series of squeaking, strange sounds, appearing exceedingly uncomfortable.

Lu Ye's methods were indeed formidable—using the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu to command so many Origin Returning Realm warriors to serve him—but he had greatly underestimated Yang Kai in attempting to use the Gu to control him.

Within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness was the World-Ending Demon Eye, a natal divine art whose greatest use was purifying others' Divine Sense power. Since the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was condensed from Divine Sense, it was naturally countered.

Crackling sounds rang out as the blood-red mist on the pupa's surface was evaporated; no matter how it struggled, it could not escape the shroud of golden light.

Yang Kai watched coldly from the side, his expression neither surprised nor pleased, though inwardly he was greatly amazed. He did not know how strange Lu Ye's Divine Sense truly was—under the World-Ending golden light the blood-colored pupa still did not immediately dissolve; it seemed disposing of it would require further effort.

Time is long and dreams are many, Yang Kai pondered briefly and issued a mental command. The next moment a buzzing arose from the Seven-Colored Treasure Isle within his Sea of Consciousness, as if countless insects were urgently flying this way, beating their wings; clearly a black cloud there was rapidly approaching.

Soul Devouring Worms!
