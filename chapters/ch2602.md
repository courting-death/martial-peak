## Chapter 2602 — Soft Rice

After sealing Shi Huo's Origin into the Incarnation, Ruoxi's face went pale.

Her earlier actions may have looked casual, but they had clearly taken a heavy toll. She glanced around, reached out, and the Myriad Beasts Seal that Shi Huo had snatched away shot back into her hand with a whoosh.

"Sir, I'll keep this gift you gave me." Ruoxi clutched the Myriad Beasts Seal tightly, her eyes full of reluctance.

"Where are you going?" Yang Kai was startled, hearing the hidden meaning in her words.

Ruoxi pressed her red lips together and said, "My bloodline power has awakened. I need to inherit my ancestor's strength."

Yang Kai immediately looked toward the Blood Gate.

Ruoxi smiled radiantly, the coldness she had been forcing on her face instantly melting away. In a gentle voice, she said, "Sir, once I come out, I'll be able to help you. I won't drag you down anymore, and what happened today will never happen again."

Yang Kai opened his mouth, then sighed solemnly, "It's my fault for not protecting you well! Absolutely my fault."

Ruoxi shook her head. "It's not your fault, Sir. I was too willful."

Yang Kai said nothing more, only gazing at her. "You really have to go?"

Zhang Ruoxi nodded firmly, her expression resolute.

Yang Kai nodded. "Then go. Since it's your ancestor's power, there's no reason not to accept it. But be careful in everything."

"Ruoxi understands." Her eyes grew slightly moist. She glanced at Xiaoxiao and said, "Sir, I'll take Xiaoxiao in with me. I'll make sure he inherits Tai Yue's power! Please let the Stone Spirit Race know about this later."

"Alright!" Yang Kai nodded.

The Stone Spirit Race had mobilized everyone this time, all to send Xiaoxiao into the Blood Gate to inherit the Divine Spirit Tai Yue's power. Unfortunately, things hadn't gone as they hoped. But now that Zhang Ruoxi was taking Xiaoxiao in, there was no problem.

"Xiaoxiao, once you're inside the Blood Gate, listen to Ruoxi in everything. Don't cause her any trouble." Yang Kai reminded Xiaoxiao again.

Xiaoxiao nodded repeatedly, mumbling continuously, looking very well-behaved.

"Don't worry, Sir. Since Stone Uncle could inherit Shi Huo's Origin, Xiaoxiao inheriting Tai Yue's Origin will be even less of a problem." Ruoxi reassured him.

After speaking, she turned her head to look at Fan Wu and the others. The tenderness on her face was instantly replaced by icy coldness as she said coldly, "If anything happens to my Sir in the Ancient Land, the day I walk out of the Blood Gate will be the day you three are buried!"

Her words were utterly blunt. If it were anyone else, Fan Wu and the other two would have already rushed over to fight. But with Zhang Ruoxi saying this, the three of them didn't dare show any temper at all.

Fan Wu, even more terrified, cupped his fists and said, "Please rest assured, my lady. As long as I, Fan Wu, am here, nothing will happen to this sir."

Luan Feng and Cang Gou also responded nervously.

The three secretly thought that, seeing this situation, if they wanted to live comfortably in the future, they'd have to get on good terms with Yang Kai. As long as they did, would they need to fear this Heaven’s Punisher descendant causing them trouble?

For a moment, in the eyes of the three, Yang Kai had become a shining treasure. Everyone wanted a bite.

"Sir..." Ruoxi turned her head again, her beautiful eyes full of reluctance. Pressing her red lips together, she said, "Ruoxi... is leaving now."

Yang Kai sat on the ground, feeling somewhat sentimental, but forced a smile. "It's not like we're parting forever. We'll meet again someday. I'll wait for you to come out of the Blood Gate."

Ruoxi lowered her head, and a blush suddenly spread across her cheeks. She asked nervously, "Before I go, could you grant me one request, sir?" She sounded uncertain, and as she spoke, she sneaked a glance at Yang Kai, looking guilty and shy.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "Go ahead. Not just one, even ten or a hundred—if I can do it, I will."

"Then... Sir, close your eyes!" Ruoxi bit her lip, mustering her courage. After speaking, her face felt hot and flushed.

Fan Wu and the others watched from the side, all showing meaningful expressions. They suddenly realized they'd underestimated the relationship between this Heaven’s Punisher descendant and Yang Kai. They'd thought they were just close friends, but now it seemed... this Heaven’s Punisher descendant was awakening to love.

This was serious. If that was the case, getting on good terms with Yang Kai wouldn't be enough—they'd have to obey his every word.

This really fulfilled what Yang Kai had said before.

Who can say what the future holds? Fortune turns with time.

Back then, Yang Kai was talking about the Stone Spirit Race, and Fan Wu hadn't cared at all. But now, it seemed he was absolutely right.

Yang Kai was also surprised. He wasn't some naive youth—Ruoxi's demeanor and tone made everything clear. He sighed inwardly. Ever since coming to the Star Realm, he'd never dared to flirt, since far away, there were still Su Yan, Xia Ningshang, Shan Qingluo, and Xue Yue waiting for him.

After so many years in the Star Realm, he'd lived with strict self-discipline, never getting too close to any woman.

But he was still a man, after all...

Thoughts swirling, Yang Kai closed his eyes as she asked.

Ruoxi bit her red lips, her heart pounding like a war drum. Her burning cheeks felt as if they were on fire.

Step by step, she came before Yang Kai, knelt down, reached out with trembling hands to cup his cheeks, closed her own eyes, her long lashes trembling nervously, and gently pressed her red lips to his forehead.

A warm sensation quickly spread across his forehead, and a captivating fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose. Her hair brushed across Yang Kai's cheek, sending a tingling sensation through him.

It seemed to last only a moment, or perhaps a thousand years. Ruoxi jumped up like a startled rabbit, her eyes misty, her delicate ears flushed red. Flustered, she said, "S-sir, Ruoxi really... really has to go now. Take care!"

With that, she turned and rushed toward the Blood Gate, as if she couldn't stay a moment longer.

But her body suddenly went soft, and she nearly tripped over a stone.

"Pfft..." Cang Gou couldn't help it and almost laughed out loud.

Ruoxi immediately glared at him in embarrassment. Cang Gou's smile froze, and sweat broke out on his forehead.

"Take good care of my Sir, or you'll be dead!" Ruoxi left these words behind, then darted into the Blood Gate and disappeared. Xiaoxiao whimpered in front of Yang Kai, as if saying goodbye, then waved to the Stone Spirit Race ten li away before following her into the Blood Gate.

Crash...

A strange sound rang out. The Blood Gate, which had stood in the Wild Ancient Land for countless years, suddenly vanished as if it had never existed.

As soon as the Blood Gate disappeared, the mysterious force suppressing the Ancient Land's creatures also dissipated.

Fan Wu and the others all breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a deep sense of having survived a disaster. They thought, this little ancestor has finally left. If she hadn't, the three of them would have found it hard even to breathe.

The three exchanged glances, then with a flash, appeared before Yang Kai and cupped their fists in unison. "Congratulations, Sir Yang!"

At this moment, none of the three dared to act superior in front of Yang Kai. They all lowered their stances, afraid of offending him and being reported to the Heaven’s Punisher descendant later.

Yang Kai was still savoring the warmth of that kiss, touching his forehead. Hearing them, he looked up and said irritably, "What's there to congratulate?"

What’s there to congratulate, really? Anyone who manages to latch onto the descendant of a Heaven’s Punisher like her—well, in the Star Realm, they could walk wherever they pleased. Even the Great Emperors would have to show them some respect.

"Is there really anything to congratulate me for? Eating soft rice—is that something worth celebrating?" Yang Kai snorted sarcastically, his gaze sweeping over the three. "Or do you all think I am some pretty boy living off a woman?"

Fan Wu and the others were speechless. They had no idea what Yang Kai was thinking, so they just stood there awkwardly, not daring to speak.

"I've got things to do. You can go!" Yang Kai waved his hand, then suddenly remembered something. "Have the Stone Spirit Race stay."

"Yes!" Fan Wu and the others quickly cupped their fists and retreated respectfully.

After they left, Yang Kai finally looked up at the sky.

In the sky, the Third Disciple from Ice Heart Valley stood there, frowning, pouting, looking unhappy, her gaze fixed on where the Blood Gate had been.

She had come here with Ruoxi. Now that Ruoxi was gone, she was suddenly alone and, in her confusion, couldn't quite grasp the situation.

"Third Disciple!" Yang Kai called out.

Third Disciple immediately looked over. When she saw Yang Kai's face, she suddenly brightened and grinned mischievously. "Come catch me, come catch me..."

As she spoke, she seemed about to run off and keep playing hide-and-seek with Yang Kai.

"Third Disciple, stop fooling around. Don't you want to see Senior Bing Yun, An Ruoyun, Sun Yunxiu, and Changsun Ying?" After what happened with Ruoxi, Yang Kai had no mood to play. He directly listed her closest people.

Third Disciple was clearly shaken. Her body froze in midair, and she slowly turned back, her beautiful eyes trembling violently, showing her chaotic mind.

Yang Kai was worried something might happen to her, but unexpectedly, after a moment, a trace of clarity appeared in her eyes. She gritted her teeth and asked, "You know my Master?"

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise. "You're better now?"

When she spoke, her demeanor was normal, clearly having regained her senses.

"Do you know my Master?" Third Disciple pressed urgently.

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Is she... still alive?" the Third Disciple grew emotional, nervously watching Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied solemnly, "Senior Bing Yun has already returned to the Ice Heart Valley. Your Senior and Junior Sisters all care about you, but they've never been able to find you."
