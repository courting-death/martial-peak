## Chapter 122 — One Man Battles Ten Elites

After a moment, a furious shout seemed to echo from afar. The distance was too great to hear clearly.

Upon hearing the voice, Yang Kai’s expression instantly brightened. He recognized one voice as Meng Wuya’s, another as Long Zaitian’s, along with many other shouts and roars intermingled.

A fight had broken out? Yang Kai’s heart stirred with understanding. He knew this commotion was likely caused by Meng Wuya seeking vengeance.

Yet, the scale of the disturbance was far too vast. Judging by the direction of the voices, a fierce battle was raging in the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area, which was tens of li away from here.

Even across such a distance, the earth trembled violently. Yang Kai could even sense the surge of Yuan Qi unleashed by the masters there.

So powerful! He wondered when he himself might ever reach such heights. His eyes gleamed with anticipation and excitement.

Suddenly, the sound of several doors opening rang out. The guarding disciples of Black Wind Trade Market’s wooden houses emerged simultaneously.

Su Yan of Lingxiao Pavilion, Hu Jiao’er of the Blood Battle Gang, and Fang Ziqi of Fengyu Tower all wore grave expressions as they gazed toward the direction of the battle. Then, in unison, they sprang into motion, their figures blurring into three afterimages—one white, one green, and one gray.

The white shadow was Su Yan, leading the charge; the green shadow was Hu Jiao’er, in the middle; and the gray shadow was Fang Ziqi, bringing up the rear. The strength ranking of these three guarding disciples was clear at a glance.

“There’s a commotion—let’s hurry over and see!” Someone shouted in panic, while others, eager for chaos, raised their voices and chased after the three guarding disciples.

Many followed, and in an instant, Black Wind Trade Market descended into chaos. Vendors hastily packed up their stalls, and customers fled in all directions.

“A battle between Divine Roaming Realm masters! A rare spectacle indeed. If we miss it today, who knows when we’ll see such a scene again? Come, let’s go watch!” An excited disciple of Fengyu Tower called out eagerly to his senior brothers.

“Better not. What if we get caught in the crossfire and die horribly?”

“We’ll just watch from a distance. These are masters; their moves are precise. They won’t harm innocents.”

Within moments, another large group rushed out.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. He knew exactly what had happened but hadn’t expected Old Meng to stir up such a commotion. This battle would surely attract the attention of the three nearby factions, drawing everyone in.

After a moment’s contemplation, Yang Kai too joined the crowd, racing toward the scene.

He wanted to know the outcome of this battle! Would Shopkeeper Meng win or lose?

While the Black Wind Trade Market was in turmoil, the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area was already engulfed in fierce combat.

After Meng Wuya arrived with Long Jun, he immediately sought out Long Zaitian. The latter hadn’t even grasped what was happening before he was stunned by a flurry of killing moves.

Long Zaitian felt deeply wronged. He didn’t even know Meng Wuya, yet the other attacked relentlessly, provoking great anger. As an elder and Vice Leader of the Blood Battle Gang, he had never suffered such humiliation. His fury surged, and he unleashed his full strength to fight Meng Wuya.

Within fewer than ten moves, Long Zaitian was blasted from the sky by Meng Wuya. Just as Meng Wuya was about to end his life, Hu Man and others intervened.

Though Hu Man was pleased to see Long Zaitian suppressed, he was also a senior elder of the Blood Battle Gang. Meng Wuya was alone, and to humiliate Long Zaitian so openly was intolerable to the others.

Even if Hu Man had not acted, other masters would have come to Long Zaitian’s aid. Thus, Hu Man had no choice but to step forward and make a show of support.

The scene quickly became chaotic. What was originally a one-on-one duel instantly turned into a group fight! Meng Wuya, alone, faced ten Divine Roaming Realm masters of the Blood Battle Gang without faltering, his imposing presence unmatched.

Moreover, he spared no effort to humiliate his opponents verbally, his venomous words as poisonous as a viper’s. Not only did he suppress Long Zaitian in strength, but he also shamed him with scathing insults.

Long Zaitian’s aged face flushed purple with fury. He wanted to retort but could not bring himself to lose face. Instead, he gritted his teeth and attacked silently, occasionally receiving a blow or two from Meng Wuya. He spat blood repeatedly, his expression utterly miserable, far removed from the dignity of the Blood Battle Gang’s Vice Leader.

After another exchange, Meng Wuya retreated to midair while the Blood Battle Gang’s masters stood firm on the ground. Both sides paused, glaring at each other from a distance.

Long Zaitian clenched his teeth so hard they nearly shattered. Blood dribbled from his mouth as he trembled with rage but dared not act recklessly. Swallowing his humiliation, he demanded, “May I ask who you are, sir? What grievance have I caused you to suffer such humiliation?”

He was unwilling to accept this! If he had truly offended the other with cause, then others seeking revenge would be understandable. But Long Zaitian had never met Meng Wuya before. The other came at him with blows and curses, leaving him bewildered and confused.

He had to clarify! A man can be killed but not humiliated. If this was a misunderstanding, then even if he died today, he would seek justice.

“Hmph!” Meng Wuya stood proudly in midair, snorting coldly with disdain. “You neither provoked me nor offended me.”

Long Zaitian’s body trembled violently. He pointed a shaking finger at Meng Wuya and stammered, “You…”

Before he could finish, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his throat rasping with harsh sounds. His gaze was filled with hatred.

“You say I neither provoked nor offended you, yet you come to beat and curse me? I am old, half buried in the earth, and yet I must endure such humiliation. Is this not unjust?”

“Feeling suffocated, are you? Wanting to kill me but powerless to do so?” Meng Wuya sneered mercilessly, showing no mercy.

Long Zaitian took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, moving cautiously as if fearing a single misstep would be fatal.

“I curse your eighteen generations of ancestors!” Meng Wuya roared. “You know the frustration of being powerless to resist! Your current plight is exactly what my precious disciple endured that night!”

“Your disciple?” Long Zaitian forced out the words.

A murderous gleam flashed in Meng Wuya’s eyes as he said coldly, “If your Long family has the courage—if you dare! You dare lay a hand on my disciple, a member of your Long family!”

“Could you be more specific?” Long Zaitian asked cautiously, suddenly realizing that this was no mere troublemaker but someone with a genuine grudge.

“Specific enough. Heh!” Meng Wuya’s face turned cold and fierce. “There’s nothing good to say. When you reach the underworld, ask your grandson Long Hui what he and his men have been up to recently!”

“What about Long Hui?” Long Zaitian’s expression changed drastically.

“What about him?” Meng Wuya sneered.

“Grandfather, I haven’t seen my younger brother for nearly a month. The last time he took Master Wen out on some errand, he hasn’t returned since,” Long Jun suddenly spoke.

Long Zaitian’s face turned ashen.

Putting together Long Jun’s words and the tone of the newcomer, Long Zaitian guessed that Long Hui was likely doomed.

Though the newcomer hadn’t stated it outright, Long Zaitian knew his grandson’s character well.

Since this master was avenging his disciple, it was clear the disciple must be a beautiful woman!

In an instant, Long Zaitian understood the entire situation. His heart ached with pain and burned with anger. Pain for his grandson’s likely death, and anger at his own blindness for not recognizing such a formidable master’s disciple.

“Long Zaitian, the grandson you raised!” Meng Wuya’s rage blazed. “I have come today only to take your life, so you will know there are some people you must never offend!”

Having said his piece, Meng Wuya took a deep breath and slowly raised one hand.

As his hand lifted, the entire world seemed to shift in color.

The Blood Battle Gang’s members stared in horror, rushing to Long Zaitian’s side, their gazes fixed tensely on Meng Wuya’s movements.

That hand descended swiftly, striking toward Long Zaitian with a furious roar: “Die!”

A colossal palm suddenly fell from the sky, carrying the might of heaven and earth, an unstoppable force that shook the firmament.

At the same moment, the Blood Battle Gang’s masters unleashed their most powerful killing moves, raising their defenses to meet the blow.

Yuan Qi surged wildly, sand and stones swirling.

Meng Wuya’s single palm faced ten elites without fear, his dominance absolute. At this moment, Shopkeeper Meng was more reliable than ever.

A tremendous explosion echoed as the giant palm landed atop the Blood Battle Gang’s masters, but they combined their strength to block it.

No, they did not truly block it—only slightly delayed the palm’s crushing force.

The ten Divine Roaming Realm masters of the Blood Battle Gang simultaneously crouched low, eyes bloodshot with fury, desperately pushing their Yuan Qi.

Cracks splintered the ground.

This was the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area, riddled with tunnels below. The collision of Yuan Qi caused the underground passages to collapse.

With a rumble, a hundred-zhang area of earth suddenly sank, and the Blood Battle Gang’s masters used the momentum to scatter and escape.

The giant palm finally struck, its power enough to shatter heaven and earth, leaving a massive handprint in the ground.

Long Zaitian survived thanks to the protection of his comrades, but he coughed blood incessantly, his face pale. This battle had dealt a severe blow to his body and spirit. Though old and frail, this strike had drained much of his strength.

The other Blood Battle Gang masters wore grim expressions. They had never imagined Meng Wuya’s strength to be so profound. Was he truly a Divine Roaming Realm master? How could he be so powerful? Moreover, the martial technique he used was extraordinarily potent, likely above Mystery-Grade.

Casting a cold glance downward, Meng Wuya snorted lightly, preparing to press the advantage. But suddenly, a terrifying surge of Yuan Qi erupted from below.

Even someone as strong as Meng Wuya’s expression changed drastically as he stared in shock toward a direction underground.

The next moment, a fiery red light shot out from beneath the earth, flickering gracefully—a fire dragon a hundred zhang long.

Following closely behind was an ice-blue figure, wings spread wide, equally a hundred zhang in length—a magnificent ice phoenix!
