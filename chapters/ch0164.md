## Chapter 164 — Straying from the Path

However, if someone was willing to exchange martial techniques with him, he could consider giving away the Flame Yang Explosion. Unfortunately, the sect strictly prohibited disciples from privately exchanging martial skills, which was quite regrettable.

Just as he was about to take a step forward, a cold voice rang out from not far away: “Yang Kai!”

Turning his head in the direction of the voice, Yang Kai frowned slightly.

The one calling out to him was a young man in his mid-twenties, whom Yang Kai recognized as Cao Zhengwen from the Law Enforcement Hall. A few months ago, it was he who had ordered Yang Kai and Li Yuntian to be thrown into the Forest Prison.

Cao Zhengwen approached with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression indifferent and his gaze cold.

“Is there something you need, Senior Brother?” Yang Kai asked.

Cao Zhengwen snorted coldly, saying nothing, but instead flicked his hand, sending an object flying straight towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai extended two fingers, pinching the object between them. His calm demeanor made Cao Zhengwen's face twitch. He clearly hadn’t expected Yang Kai to easily dissolve the hidden energy he had infused into it.

“What is this?” Yang Kai looked at the object in his hand; it was a letter, but he did not open it immediately.

“Promotion Order!” Cao Zhengwen explained sternly, “By the order of the Elder Council, Trial Disciple Yang Kai has broken through to the Open Origin Realm and is thus eligible for promotion to an Outer Disciple.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow: “Promotion?”

“Indeed!” Cao Zhengwen nodded, “You have been in the sect for three years, remaining at the Body Tempering Realm, which is why you were demoted to a Trial Disciple. However, seeing your diligent cultivation, you have finally broken through to the Open Origin Realm. The Elder Council has decided to give you a chance for promotion!”

“A chance?” Yang Kai detected the deeper meaning in his words.

Cao Zhengwen continued meaningfully, “As long as you complete the task assigned by the Elder Council, you can be promoted from Trial Disciple to Outer Disciple! Throughout the history of Lingxiao Pavilion, you would be the only Trial Disciple to receive such an honor. This is a rare opportunity, Junior Brother Yang; you must seize it well. Whether you can turn your fortunes around depends on this.”

“I’m not interested!” Yang Kai waved his hand, tossing the Promotion Order back.

Cao Zhengwen’s expression changed, and he raised his hand to catch it, speaking sharply: “Yang Kai, this is the order of the Elder Council! Do you dare to refuse?”

“What of the Elder Council?” Yang Kai replied impatiently, “I neither steal nor rob. I’ve been honest and upright as a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Are they really going to force me to accept a promotion?”

Although Yang Kai did not know what the task in the letter entailed, he suspected it would not be easy and might even be quite dangerous.

“So you are just this kind of person who willingly settles for mediocrity,” Cao Zhengwen mocked with a sneer.

In fact, this Promotion Order should have been given to Yang Kai when Su Yan rescued him from the Forest Prison, but after that, he had gone to the Jiuyin Valley with Xia Ningshang, and then the Inheritance Celestial Cave had appeared again shortly after his return, leading to the delay until now.

“Whether I am mediocre or not is not for you to decide,” Yang Kai said, turning to walk past Cao Zhengwen.

“Yang Kai!” Cao Zhengwen shouted angrily, drawing the attention of many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, “Don’t think that just because you gained some opportunities in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, you can act so arrogantly. You are not the only one who encountered fortuitous events there! To dare ignore the order of the Elder Council, do you know the consequences?”

“Scram!” Yang Kai turned back, glaring at Cao Zhengwen with a fierce expression. The latter was momentarily stunned. By the time he regained his senses, Yang Kai had already vanished from sight.

In front of the Martial Technique Pavilion, a silence fell as many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples witnessed the scene, their hearts filled with shock.

Yang Kai actually ignored the order of the Elder Council! This was simply unbelievable. For them, the orders of the Elder Council were absolute laws; when a command was issued, even if it meant facing a mountain of blades or a sea of flames, they would charge forward without hesitation. Who had ever dared to refuse? Yet just now, right before their eyes, a Trial Disciple had rejected the Elder Council’s directive!

Was this not straying from the path? Did he still hold any respect for his superiors? While many admired Yang Kai, they also secretly criticized him, thinking that he must be a person who willingly settled for mediocrity, which was why he rejected the promotion order.

Cao Zhengwen stood there with a darkened face, the Promotion Order in his hand crumpled into a mess, feeling both furious and somewhat at a loss.

The Grand Elder had explicitly told him that he must ensure Yang Kai accepted this Promotion Order and complete the task assigned.

What the task was, Cao Zhengwen had secretly glanced at it.

To venture alone into the Cangyun Evil Land and slay an evil cultivator whose strength was not below his own!

This task was simple in some respects, yet difficult in others. The Cangyun Evil Land was a place where countless evil cultivators gathered. If he could encounter a lone evil cultivator, it would be easy to complete the task. However, if luck was not on his side and he ran into a powerful opponent, even the Elders might not be able to escape.

Cao Zhengwen had thought that Yang Kai would surely accept the task, but he never expected him to be so bold as to refuse the Elder Council’s order in front of so many people.

How was he supposed to explain this? After standing in place for a long time, Cao Zhengwen gritted his teeth and turned to leave.

Having his mood spoiled by Cao Zhengwen early in the morning, Yang Kai’s expression was somewhat gloomy.

If it weren’t for that person insisting on bringing him to Lingxiao Pavilion three years ago, he wouldn’t have traveled such a long distance to come here. But why did that person want him to come to Lingxiao Pavilion? What was the connection?

Having been in the sect for over three years, experiencing the warmth and coldness of the world, Yang Kai felt no sense of belonging to Lingxiao Pavilion whatsoever.

If he had any lingering feelings, it would probably only be for Su Yan.

Yet this feeling of attachment had only developed recently.

Right, there was also Xia Ningshang. Interacting with this little Junior Sister felt quite warm.

As he walked, someone hurriedly caught up from behind. A fragrant breeze brushed past as a person gasped for breath and called out, “Junior Brother Yang…”

Yang Kai halted his steps and turned to look; the person was actually Lan Chudie.

Although their time together in the Inheritance Celestial Cave had not been particularly pleasant, she was still a fellow disciple, and since she had not provoked him, Yang Kai patiently greeted her: “Senior Sister Lan!”

Lan Chudie smiled sweetly, perhaps due to her breathlessness, her ample bosom heaving, making one’s heart race. She seemed to have forgotten everything that had happened in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, looking at Yang Kai naturally and saying, “I thought you would ignore me from now on.”

“That’s not the case; you’re overthinking it, Senior Sister,” Yang Kai replied with a light smile.

Lan Chudie’s bright eyes fixed on Yang Kai as she said with a gentle smile, “I was wrong in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. I hope Junior Brother can forgive me and not hold it against me.”

She was a clever woman, directly addressing the matter that had occurred in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, yet she brushed over it lightly, making her seem sincere and unpretentious.

Not to mention that Yang Kai was not a petty person; even if he had grievances, they would be resolved in an instant.

Smiling faintly, Yang Kai shook his head: “Senior Sister is being too serious; it was not a big deal.”

“Since Junior Brother can say this, I feel much better,” Lan Chudie said, placing her hand over her ample chest, her expression one of relief. Then she furrowed her brows slightly and said, “However, Junior Brother, you were rather reckless today. Why did you refuse the Elder Council’s order? This could lead to trouble.”

“Didn’t Cao Zhengwen say that I am a person who willingly settles for mediocrity? Since I’m mediocre, why should I think about promotion? What’s wrong with being a Trial Disciple?” 

Seeing that Lan Chudie was about to speak again, Yang Kai frowned and said, “I don’t feel like talking today. Please forgive me; I must take my leave.”

Lan Chudie was taken aback and nodded with a smile.

She could naturally see that although Yang Kai spoke to her in a calm tone, there was still a hint of coldness in his demeanor. If she continued to pester him, it would only become bothersome.

After bidding farewell to Lan Chudie, Yang Kai returned to his cave abode, only to find that Xia Ningshang was nowhere to be seen; she must have already left. Moreover, there were two potted plants that he recognized, which had been placed here. It took him a moment to recall that these were the two pots he often saw Shopkeeper Meng tending to at the Contribution Hall.

Usually, he would often see the old man taking care of these plants, but now they had been moved here by Xia Ningshang.

Within Lingxiao Pavilion, due to Yang Kai’s refusal, a surging undercurrent began to stir.

At the Grand Elder’s residence, Cao Zhengwen exaggeratedly reported the morning’s events, and upon hearing it, Wei Xitong choked on his tea.

“He refused?” The Grand Elder thought of countless possibilities but never imagined that Yang Kai would be so audacious.

“Yes,” Cao Zhengwen said, his frustration evident. “Not only did he refuse, but he also openly disrespected the authority of the Elder Council in front of many Junior Brothers and Sisters. Grand Elder, he shone brilliantly with an unknown martial skill in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, and perhaps because of this, he has grown arrogant, thinking himself important, which is why he disregards the Elder Council. This person must be severely punished; otherwise, it will be hard to maintain order! If in the future any disciple can refuse the Elder Council’s orders, then…”

“Shut up!” Wei Xitong slammed the table heavily, glaring at Cao Zhengwen in anger. “He refused; why don’t you just force the order on him and make him accept it?”

Cao Zhengwen was taken aback, thinking that if he had already refused, why should he make things difficult for himself? Wasn’t that just putting his warm face against someone else’s cold rear?

His refusal was a good thing; it was a perfect opportunity to teach him a lesson. Why was the Grand Elder reacting this way?

However, seeing the Grand Elder’s gloomy expression, Cao Zhengwen did not dare to say more.

“Go, no matter what method you use, even if you have to kneel and beg him, make sure he accepts this order!” Wei Xitong said after pondering for a while, his voice heavy.

“Ah…” Cao Zhengwen was stunned.

Kneel and beg him?

“Why are you still standing there?” The Grand Elder slammed the table again, turning it to dust.

“Yes!” Cao Zhengwen did not dare to linger and hurriedly left.

In the second elder’s pavilion, Su Xuanwu sat cross-legged on the ground, a chessboard in front of him with black and white pieces interwoven. The black pieces were overwhelming, surrounding the white pieces without killing them, creating a deadlocked situation.

A disciple beside him was reporting the situation. After hearing it, Su Xuanwu revealed a strange expression: “He refused?”

The disciple replied respectfully, “Yes, he refused brazenly and arrogantly.”

Su Xuanwu’s expression changed repeatedly, and after a long while, he suddenly burst into laughter: “Good refusal, good refusal! Senior Brother, oh Senior Brother, you’ve brought this upon yourself; this feeling must not be pleasant.”
