## Chapter 344 — The Might of Soul Techniques

The high platform where everyone stood was about seven or eight zhang from the ground. By this time, the water level of the Corrupted Fountain Water had already risen to three or four zhang.

But at this moment, the viscous flow of the Corrupted Fountain Water was rising at a mad pace, as if it were expanding.

Everyone's expressions changed drastically.

In just a few breaths, the Corrupted Fountain Water had spread to the level of the high platform and was still climbing wildly.

"Not good!" Tao Yang exclaimed, his face pale as he watched everything unfold.

Others quickly shrank towards the center of the platform, fearing that if they were not careful, they would fall off the platform and plunge into the evil Corrupted Fountain Water.

Such a widespread outbreak of the Corrupted Fountain Water left them all without a plan as they were enveloped in despair.

The elder over there also looked terrified. Although he was aware of the existence of the Evil Spirit Spring Eye, it was his first encounter, and he had no idea what was going on.

Seeing that the Corrupted Fountain Water was about to envelop them from all directions, the elder knew that this was not a place to linger. He let out a fierce shout, his anger igniting and expressing his determination, "If you don't want to die, come with me!"

As he spoke, he unleashed a fierce technique that opened a gap in the encirclement of evil spirits, using his True Essence to protect his four juniors as he rushed towards Yang Kai and the others.

Several members of the Xiaoyao Sect quickly followed suit, various Martial Skills and treasures guarding their sides, and for the moment, they did not fear for their lives.

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent as he narrowed his eyes at the elder approaching rapidly. A cold glimmer flickered in his eyes.

The elder's intention in flying over was clear.

Another moment passed, and the entire area would probably be engulfed in the Corrupted Fountain Water. By then, the high platform where Yang Kai and the others stood would be their only refuge.

With a defensive barrier formed by twenty layers of True Yang Yuan Qi, they should be able to withstand the erosion of the Corrupted Fountain Water.

In this life-and-death crisis, the elder was prepared to take a risk.

Flying closer, the elder didn't rush to take action. He looked at Yang Kai and said, “Young friend, there have been many unpleasant matters between us. But at this moment, I won't dally with you. Why not ask your friends to make some room?”

Yang Kai looked at him with contempt, casually replying, “Couldn’t you see that we’re already full here?”

The elder's face darkened, urgently saying, “That’s why I'm asking you to make some room! The Corrupted Fountain Water is behaving unusually; we don’t know what changes may occur. Without this old man's presence in the Divine Roaming Realm, what are your chances of survival? These friends of yours vary in strength; why not let a few of the weaker ones out? Remember, aiding others is also aiding yourself!”

“Elder…” Yu Qing cried out in panic. He understood that the elder had no intention of bringing the Xiaoyao Sect members along, which naturally stirred his anxiety.

Others listened with fury on their faces as well. The elder’s words clearly implied that he wanted a few to step out and die in their place.

Yang Kai coldly laughed and shook his head, “I am quite comfortable as is. Thus, I don’t wish to assist others!”

“You bring this upon yourself.” The elder's expression turned malevolent, and he shouted angrily.

The Corrupted Fountain Water continued to swell higher, and he could no longer afford to waste time.

“If I can’t live well, none of you from the Xiaoyao Sect will either! Join me to drive them out; only then can you hope to survive!” The elder raised his arm and called out.

“Alright!” Yu Qing responded happily without hesitation.

The expressions of the others on the high platform darkened to the extreme. It was evident the old man was desperate, and with the strength of a Fifth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert leading seven or eight True Essence Realm practitioners against them, they had no idea whether they could withstand it.

The only calm one was Yang Kai, who smiled lightly, looking at the elder with disdain and mocking amusement.

Suddenly, a fire dragon shot out from the high platform, flying straight at the elder and the others. It was unclear who attacked first.

The high platform covered by the True Yang Yuan Qi barrier had now become their only sanctuary. No one would want to let anyone go. The elder’s aggressive stance was intolerable, prompting some to act.

In the next moment, various Martial Skills and treasures burst forth in brilliance.

The group around the elder also refused to cower and retaliated accordingly.

However, after just one round of conflict, the people on the high platform realized something was off.

Their attacks aimed at the elder were all intercepted by this Divine Roaming Realm master single-handedly.

Although the elder struggled, he managed to block them.

On the other hand, the attacks from True Essence Realm martial artists behind him left the high platform’s group in a fluster.

Everyone's expressions turned grim. With a Divine Roaming Realm expert blocking their way, even if they wanted to eliminate the others behind, they couldn’t do so effectively.

In just a moment, the Corrupted Fountain Water rose significantly, looking ready to swallow that group whole.

The four young people beside the elder and the Xiaoyao Sect members were also using all their strength, desperately unleashing their methods to attack.

Meanwhile, the elder’s eyes, sharp as a hawk’s, remained fixated on Yang Kai. He sensed that this young man was rather peculiar and must possess some unknown abilities.

Under normal circumstances, he would cautiously test him to avoid mishaps. But in this moment of crisis, he had no time for such consideration.

With a flick of his hand, a massive palm print came crashing down towards Yang Kai, intending to annihilate him with one strike.

Yang Kai scoffed, pointing forward to conjure a blood-red shield before him.

Boom…

The palm print smashed against the shield made of Yang Liquid, instantly shattering it but still managing to block the elder's assault.

Before the elder could attack again, an imperceptible force blasted through Yang Kai's mind, silently and mysteriously bypassing the elder's defenses, and surged into the crowd behind him.

The elder’s expression changed. In that fleeting moment, he seemed to detect a power from Divine Sense.

Before he could comprehend the situation, a burst of purple light suddenly erupted behind him.

The radiant explosion formed a fan shape, enveloping all of the elder’s four junior disciples and the members of the Xiaoyao Sect within.

The silent attack spread forth, and the True Essence Realm experts unexpectedly dazed, their faces pale with anguish.

Soon after, another burst of light erupted…

A third burst…

“Ah…” Yu Qing clutched his head. The excruciating pain rendered him unable to channel his True Essence, and he fell headlong toward the ground.

As he plunged into the Corrupted Fountain Water, a sizzling sound ensued as his clothes and flesh were visibly corroded, leaving only a pile of white bones.

Apart from Yu Qing, the remaining members of the Xiaoyao Sect and the elder's four juniors suffered the same fate, with a few dropping down alongside Yu Qing, while the rest were brutally torn apart by the encroaching evil spirits.

In the blink of an eye, only the elder remained of his faction, and he appeared to have sustained injuries as well.

Stumbling back, the elder looked at Yang Kai with terror in his eyes, trembling as he uttered, “Soul Technique!”

Yang Kai smirked, grinning brightly.

“How is this possible!” The elder's face was one of disbelief, unable to accept what he had witnessed.

This was merely a True Essence Realm martial artist of the Sixth Stage; how could he possibly unleash a Soul Technique? Moreover, this Soul Technique seemed rather familiar, clearly resembling the one previously used by the Soul Evil Spirit, albeit with a slight modification in the attack range.

“It is indeed a Soul Technique!” Yang Kai provocatively gazed at him. “I acquired it from that earlier origin; old man, you are finished!”

“Impossible!” The elder’s expression turned savage. Although the three bursts from earlier hadn’t severely wounded him, his Divine Sense had sustained some damage, with the pain in his mind becoming ever-present. “Even if you grasp a Soul Technique from the origin, without cultivating Divine Sense, you cannot execute it!”

As he spoke, his gaze suddenly brightened, incredulously staring at Yang Kai, “Could it be that the earlier origin enabled you to cultivate your Divine Sense as well?”

“Let’s say that’s true.” Yang Kai chuckled, not bothering to argue.

His Divine Sense had long been refined, and its power was considerably strong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to invoke the Soul Technique three times with such composure.

Even an expert just stepping into the Divine Roaming Realm couldn’t consecutively perform a Soul Technique three times.

On the high platform, everyone looked at Yang Kai with astonished joy, utterly surprised that he had once again turned the tide at this critical moment.

Though their time spent with Yang Kai was short, in this brief period, he had repeatedly showcased unbelievable capabilities, creating miracles time and again.

All were aware that had they not encountered Yang Kai on this trip to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, they might have perished several times over.

Setting aside the gratitude owed for saving their lives, merely Yang Kai’s strangeness and might were enough for them to silently resolve to befriend him, ensuring no conflicts would arise with him in the future.

The elder painfully glanced at the Corrupted Fountain Water below. The four juniors he had desperately protected had all perished, and he naturally harbored intense hatred towards Yang Kai.

His expression fluctuating, after a moment's hesitation, the elder suddenly turned and fled, saying, “Brat, live well; one day, I will skin you alive!”

Even though Yang Kai had mastered the Soul Technique, the elder was not afraid of him.

The elder was only fearful of the rapidly rising Corrupted Fountain Water below!

Unable to swiftly seize the platform, the elder could only run for his life, hoping to escape.

“Want to leave? You think you can?” Yang Kai shouted coldly, leaping off the high platform in swift pursuit. As he soared, a surge of Divine Sense power flashed in his mind, this time different from before, condensed into a point and transformed into a streak of purple light, swiftly striking towards the elder’s head.

This was another Soul Technique obtained from the Soul Evil Spirit’s origin; however, while the previous one was an area attack, this one was a single-target attack. Both shared similarities but differed in execution.

The elder clearly did not anticipate Yang Kai possessing such an ability, caught off guard, and was struck by the purple light, his body going rigid and stumbling downwards, half of him plunging into the Corrupted Fountain Water.
