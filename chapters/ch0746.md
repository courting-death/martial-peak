## Chapter 746 — Deep into the Seabed

Seeing Yang Kai’s attitude suddenly turn cold, the Saintess snorted, “I never expected you to save me. Just mind yourself!”

Finished, she stomped off to the side in vexation, clearly unwilling to speak further with Yang Kai.

Seeing this, Yang Kai secretly let out a breath of relief.

He still did not know what awaited below. If there truly was some enormous danger and this Saintess stuck to him the whole time, it would really hamper his freedom of action; far better to roam alone without needing to mind another’s life or death.

Although this woman had previously let him stay aboard the large ship, they had only met by chance. Yang Kai had no obligation to safeguard her.

In his eyes she was just a girl raised in a greenhouse, relying on a bit of ability to try to prove herself. She needed to suffer a setback to learn how perilous this world truly was.

After a long wait, the Seven Families Alliance cultivators finally concluded their discussion. At the Yellow-Faced Elder’s shout, the chosen outsiders clustered into seven teams.

When he had signed up, Yang Kai had casually picked a family. Only now did he discover the one he chose happened to be the Hai Family to which that Yellow-Faced Elder belonged.

This team of outsiders numbered around forty. Each looked fairly strong; among them there was one Transcendent Realm cultivator. The Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was not in this team but with another family.

The Yellow-Faced Elder came before them, cleared his throat, swept his gaze once, and said, “This old man, though unworthy, is Hai Wangu, Protector of the Hai Family within the Seven Families Alliance. This time this old man will lead everyone into the ancient ruins beneath the sea. I ask that you heed my commands and not act rashly, lest needless casualties occur! En, besides you all, my Hai Family will also dispatch over a dozen capable experts to coordinate with you. Since you chose my Hai Family, this Hai will certainly do his utmost to safeguard you. But unpleasant words first: if anyone damages the interests of the group at that time, do not blame this Hai for being ruthless.”

Saying so, he swept a majestic gaze around. Everyone fell silent, not uttering a word.

Hai Wangu nodded in satisfaction. “Then… life or death per fate. Set out!”

As he spoke, he was the first to leap and fly out. The forty-some outsiders, together with the Hai Family’s dozen-plus cultivators, converged and followed his steps, shooting toward the sea’s surface.

At the same time, the remaining six families also moved.

While speeding along, Yang Kai quietly sized up the Hai Family group. There were only a little over a dozen, but counting Hai Wangu there were three Transcendent Realm experts; the rest were all peak Divine Roaming Realm. Though few, their overall strength was far superior to the outsiders.

The Hai Family had sent out true elites and thus firmly held the initiative.

The other six families had basically deployed the same kind of lineup.

Not long after, they reached the sea’s surface. Hai Wangu beckoned casually and produced a round disk-shaped Secret Treasure. Silvery radiance flowed over it, emanating a rich energy fluctuation—clearly a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure.

“Everyone, come closer. This old man will take you down,” Hai Wangu called out.

All hurriedly approached him.

Hai Wangu poured True Yuan into the disk Secret Treasure. In an instant, a silvery light curtain wrapped a twenty-zhang radius around him. Under his control the light curtain rapidly sank, taking everyone down into the sea.

Seeing this display, quite a few faces grew solemn.

Though Hai Wangu had not unleashed any powerful Secret Treasure or Martial Skill, merely this ability to bring dozens underwater together made people look at him with new eyes.

Secretly observing their expressions, a faint pride surfaced on Hai Wangu’s face.

All around was deep blue seawater; below lay pitch-black depths without end. The profound gloom stirred unease in their hearts. Many cultivators who had never plunged deep into the ocean could not help but swallow and edge closer toward Hai Wangu as though finding more safety there.

Yang Kai looked around and found bright streams of light in every direction—the other six families’ groups, each employing different methods, rushing toward the depths.

The silvery light curtain Hai Wangu produced was extremely tough. Seawater flowed outside, unable to seep in the slightest. Colorful fish swam past, and the crowd pointed them out, filled with novelty.

As they descended, the expression on Hai Wangu’s face gradually lost its earlier ease.

The sea was unfathomable. The deeper they went, the greater the pressure. Even as a Transcendent Realm expert, maintaining such a large-scale Secret Treasure required massive True Yuan expenditure.

The silvery light curtain seemed heavily compressed, losing its prior smooth roundness, and its space slowly shrank.

Noticing this, several cultivators’ faces changed slightly. They frowned at Hai Wangu, unsure if he could persist.

After descending a while longer, Hai Wangu suddenly spoke, “Everyone, this old man must ask a favor. Could you circulate your True Yuan to help this old man maintain the Secret Treasure? At this rate we may not reach the seabed.”

Hearing this, many cursed in their hearts.

This old fox clearly still had reserves yet put on an appearance of hardship. He simply did not want to expend too much True Yuan and wished to keep his state, thus trying to make everyone else help.

Seeing the silvery light shrink to the edges of their bodies, the cultivators had no choice. One after another they hastily circulated True Yuan and struck it toward the Secret Treasure in Hai Wangu’s hands.

Hai Wangu smiled and nodded, accepting these streams of True Yuan and converting them into the Secret Treasure’s might.

Yang Kai also went through the motions, sending out a few strands of True Yuan. He scoffed inwardly; everyone harbored the thought of conserving True Yuan and was unwilling to exert much, hoping others would burn energy and attention so they could seize initiative in the coming exploration.

They had not even reached the seabed and were already scheming; who knew what it would be like once they arrived.

After receiving their True Yuan, the silvery light curtain indeed expanded again.

But after a while Hai Wangu once more begged for assistance.

This repeated many times, yet the so-called ancient ruins still did not appear. Everyone’s True Yuan consumption was enormous, and impatience flared as they questioned him one after another.

Hai Wangu explained unhurriedly, “No rush, no rush. We are almost there. The seabed’s depth is beyond your imagination.”

After about the time it takes a stick of incense to burn, someone suddenly exclaimed, pointing downward, “Look down there!”

Following his finger, everyone looked and their spirits surged. Down below multicolored lights flickered in incomparable beauty, and within that halo a boundless ruin unfolded before their eyes.

“Ancient ruins!” They could not help but grow fervent.

“Seems we are finally here,” Hai Wangu smiled faintly. The speed at which he led them downward abruptly increased.

Soon they reached the outskirts of the ancient ruins. From outside, the ruins occupied an extremely vast area, roughly several dozen li across. Within lay desolation; many palace-like structures and rows of dwellings had once stood neatly, but most had collapsed, leaving only broken walls.

Moreover, the massive ruins were wrapped in some inexplicable barrier; thus, even at the seabed, the interior was abnormally dry without a trace of moisture.

At the ruins’ edge innumerable corals swayed with the currents, radiating multicolored light that cast a gloomy chill across the ruins.

The crowd could not help but feel a chill of dread, unsure whether dangers lurked within.

Hai Wangu, however, walked as if in a courtyard stroll, continuing to maintain the Secret Treasure while leading everyone straight toward the ruins.

The outer barrier blocked seawater but ignored their intrusion. A group of several dozen slipped inside with ease.

Hai Wangu withdrew the Secret Treasure and drew a gentle breath. His old face brightened and expectation flickered in his eyes.

“Since we are here, let us act quickly. The other six groups should be arriving!” Hai Wangu said.

Faces darkened. Seeing his relaxed bearing, everyone realized they had all been tricked by this old fox.

To maintain that Secret Treasure, most here had expended no small amount, while Hai Wangu remained vigorous.

His present proposal clearly indicated he had no intention of giving them time to sit and recover.

As he spoke, the other six groups indeed arrived one after another from different directions.

Lacking time to curse, these cultivators hurriedly took out Pills and popped them into their mouths, following Hai Wangu forward while secretly circulating their cultivation arts to refine the medicinal efficacy and replenish their spent True Yuan.

To avoid arousing suspicion, Yang Kai also went through the motions, tossing a random Pill into his mouth.

After entering the ancient ruins, Yang Kai felt from a certain direction an exceedingly rich Yang attribute energy flowing out. That Yang attribute energy filled the entire ruins, making the place not cold but instead warmly comfortable.

However, he did not break from the group and head that way. The ancient ruins were mysterious and unpredictable; he intended to follow the main force first and sound things out.

The crowd walked along while marveling unceasingly.

Everything in these ruins was clearly aged—at least a few thousand years old. Who knew which colossal force this had once been that, after vicissitudes of the ages, had sunk to the seabed.

Everyone closely watched their surroundings, Divine Sense extended, probing for places where treasures might exist.

Hai Wangu spoke as he walked: “If you find anything, please hand it to this old man. Rest assured, after we leave and return above, this old man will take everything out and share it with all of you. My Hai Family will absolutely not monopolize the finds. Of course, the more effort contributed, the more benefits one will receive in the end. That holds for my Hai Family as well!”

He spoke righteously and with solemn vows, but having just suffered a loss, no one dared believe him.
