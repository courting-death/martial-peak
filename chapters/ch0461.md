## Chapter 461 — Divine Soul Treasure

Five Divine Roaming Realm experts were dispatched to guard the treasures; only at this rank and in such numbers could they intimidate the enemy.

Yet, this meant five fewer top fighters available for battle.

However, with the arrival of the third batch of treasures disrupting the balance among the six major factions, if Yang Kang and the others failed to handle the situation well, they would only become more passive, gaining less and less.

Yang Kai frowned, contemplating how to expand his advantage.

Without waiting long, the fourth batch of treasures appeared once more.

There was nothing new; they still emerged from the lakebed. But this time, everyone was on alert. Though rushing forward, no one acted recklessly.

They now had to guard not only against the enemy’s attacks and plundering but also the energy bursts from the treasures themselves. One careless slip could mean annihilation of their souls; who would dare be careless?

When the martial artists of the six factions charged to the center, they suddenly halted. No one wanted to be the first to break the ice, waiting for others to move first, so that the energy from the treasures would be triggered before planning their next step.

The scene became deadlocked, treasures densely suspended in midair, while martial artists hovered at the edges, wary and studious of one another.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow. Although he had anticipated such a stalemate, he had no good solution.

Whoever moved first would suffer losses, yet endlessly enduring the standstill was no option. The fifth batch of treasures was soon to arrive; if they did not seize the current batch now, the situation would worsen with the next.

Yang Kang sneered coldly, "Do you really think I’m a fool? Whoever wants one can take it! Let’s see if you can get it back!"

Before his words fell, a surge of Divine Sense suddenly erupted from the densely packed treasures.

A soul technique! This unexpected burst instantly disrupted the stalemate.

An invisible, intangible force swept out, blasting these treasures aside and hurling them into the crowd hovering midair.

One by one, the energies within these treasures triggered, sending attacks in varying strengths flying in all directions, causing chaos.

Yang Kai turned to glance at Liu Qingyao. His brow tightened.

That soul technique had been launched by this man. Why was Liu Qingyao here? No one knew; until now, he had neither sided with any Yang Family young master nor befriended anyone intentionally. Normally, he only lingered in War City, yet this time he silently arrived at Po Jing Lake. His intentions were a total mystery.

Now, abruptly breaking the deadlock, it was clearly no good omen.

Fortunately, everyone had prepared this time. As the treasures crashed down, they guarded against the attacks released from them. These treasures were not of the highest rank; even empowered by True Essence from powerful warriors, they could not cause great harm.

Such scattered attacks were easily countered by the martial artists working together.

With all attacks blocked, the battle returned to a scrambling contest over the treasures. Yang Kai’s forces received orders not to provoke Yang Wei’s side, and vice versa; the two sides tacitly agreed to coexist peacefully.

After the stalemate was broken, the fourth batch of treasures was quickly divided.

No one was given a moment’s respite before the fifth batch appeared.

Strangely, this batch did not emerge from the lakebed but appeared mysteriously in the sky.

Golden, mystical patterns flickered in the void, converging into circles of various sizes. From each golden ring, hundreds of rays shot down towards the ground.

Martial artists who had just seized treasures were hit, dizzy and disoriented by the fifth batch.

The unleashed attacks struck aimlessly about, spreading even into the onlookers, drawing a chorus of curses.

The battle zone suddenly expanded. With this fifth batch’s sudden arrival, chaos spilled beyond Po Jing Lake and spread outward.

Reluctantly, those left behind in each faction’s camp also joined the fray, scrambling for the newly appeared treasures.

For a time, the scene was chaotic, everyone on edge.

The fierce conflict thrilled the bored onlookers, their blood burning with excitement, itching to join the battlefield and try to seize some treasures.

The six Yang Family young masters constantly issued new commands to their allies, eyes sharp, ears alert, altering strategies at a moment’s notice.

Interestingly, Yang Wei’s actions perfectly mirrored Yang Kai’s, as if cast from the same mold. Whenever Yang Kai deployed new men, Yang Wei did as well; when Yang Kai recalled them, so did Yang Wei. Even in guarding the plundered treasures, he used five Divine Roaming Realm masters just as Yang Kai had.

Yang Kai noticed this but said nothing. Whatever his eldest brother wished to do was his freedom.

A bell-shaped treasure was triggered, releasing ear-piercing demonic sounds that were unbearable. True Essence churned, Primordial Qi surged upward. Nearby martial artists barely resisted its assault and, attempting to seize it, accidentally blasted it away amid the melee. It tumbled far into the crowd of spectators.

The crowd erupted upon spotting the falling treasure, everyone employing their best skills.

Soon the treasure vanished without a trace; no one knew who had managed to snatch it amid the chaos.

Lamentations filled the air from those who missed out on this rare opportunity. To have so many treasures appear, yet only one fell into the crowd—and they failed to secure it—how could they not regret it?

While observing who had taken that treasure, a sudden, anguished cry rang out. A middle-aged man in his forties collapsed, bleeding from all seven orifices, dead.

Everyone was shocked.

From the dead man’s embrace, the previously missing bell-shaped treasure seemed to be drawn by an invisible force. It flew swiftly out, accelerated in midair, and crashed back into the chaotic battlefield at Po Jing Lake.

Horror flashed across everyone’s faces, and they quickly restrained their greed.

They knew this middle-aged man had not died without cause, but because he tried to claim the treasure as his own, inviting his demise.

Someone in the crowd was undoubtedly watching the treasure’s movement. If anyone acted greedily, they would be silently executed immediately.

Understanding this, those who had tried to seize the treasure earlier showed relief. Fortunately, they hadn’t obtained that bell-shaped treasure; otherwise, the corpse on the ground wouldn’t be this man—but themselves.

The Zhongdu Yang Family’s ruthlessness was thoroughly demonstrated.

After several greedy idlers met their end, the curious onlookers no longer dared consider snatching treasures. For any greedy act was followed instantly by silent death.

The chaotic battlefield remained chaotic. After the initial appetizer, new batches appeared in quick succession, allowing no breathing room.

Often, the previous batch was not yet fully contested before the next arrived, and each new appearance forced action.

Deaths increased relentlessly. Every faction suffered heavy losses.

The six Yang Family young masters’ entourages dwindled over time. Half their Divine Roaming Realm experts had been dispatched at first, then even young leaders like Huo Xingchen were forced to join.

But each of these had Divine Roaming Realm guardians protecting them; otherwise, none could survive such a battlefield.

Besides the Divine Roaming guardians left to watch the treasures, each young master only had one Blood Servant remaining by his side.

When the seventh batch appeared, the battle at Po Jing Lake grew even fiercer because they contained Heaven-Grade treasures.

The eighth batch was mostly Heaven-Grade.

The ninth batch was entirely Heaven-Grade…

Everyone fought with flaming eyes; every person was an enemy. There was no hesitation in unleashing their True Essence and Divine Sense, employing every possible means to secure treasures for their own faction.

The onlookers held their breath, watching the escalating situation.

Martial artists arrived and departed ceaselessly. Those who seized treasures hurried to return them to guardians of the Divine Roaming Realm in their faction. The cost to each was immense. Fortunately, by then, Xia Ningshang and the Pill Master from Yao Wang Valley had refined pills to rapidly replenish True Essence, giving Yang Kai’s faction advantages in endurance and persistence.

By mid-battle, they had already consumed these pills.

Though physically and mentally drained, True Essence replenishment allowed them to fight without restraint.

A soul force burst forth, emanating a cold sensation and blossoming with radiant light in midair.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened.

A Divine Soul Treasure! An offensive one at that. More importantly, it was a Divine Soul Treasure highly compatible with Yang Kai’s own soul power!

With this treasure’s aid, the power of Yang Kai’s soul techniques could be greatly enhanced.

Though eager to personally seize it, he restrained himself and gave a subtle signal to Dong Qinghan nearby.

Dong Qinghan, accompanied by the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians, might not have sharp eyesight himself, but the two elders certainly recognized the treasure’s true value.

Receiving Yang Kai’s silent signal, Dong Qinghan immediately abandoned his opponent and charged towards the treasure, the Wind and Cloud elders close behind.

They had barely arrived when a figure blocked their path, sneering coldly at Dong Qinghan: “Fatty, you are an ally of Yang Kai, aren’t you?”

Dong Qinghan’s forehead twitched, his expression turning grim.

Huo Xingchen’s casual “Fatty Brother” was affectionate, but this man’s tone made him quite displeased.

A cold gleam stretched in Dong Qinghan’s eyes as he stared down the other, clearly fired with genuine anger...
