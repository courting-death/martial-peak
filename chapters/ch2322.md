## Chapter 2322 — All Are Puppets

Although the Chiyue Sect could no longer compare to the truly top Sects of the present age, the many foundations and legacies left behind from tens of thousands of years ago still lent it an extraordinary atmosphere. As Yang Kai made his way forward, he found himself thoroughly enjoying the sights along the journey.

However, he could sense that the Spiritual Qi here in the Chiyue Sect was not particularly dense. For such a spiritual mountain and treasured land to lack corresponding Spiritual Qi meant the Earth Vein here was not strong. Normally, such a territory would not be chosen as the site to establish a Sect, but the founder of the Chiyue Sect had clearly chosen to take root here because of that particular secret realm.

It was just like how Wen Zishan had established the Qingyang Shrine in the Qingyang Mountain Range—the existence of the Divine Roaming Mirror was the decisive factor.

The mountain path was rugged, and everyone flew through the air. Below, a sea of clouds and mist wound around, making for a beautiful scene.

"Eh... That little mountain over there looks like a demonic beast," Chi Yue suddenly exclaimed, as if she had discovered something, pointing at a small peak not far away, about fifty zhang tall.

"The one beside it is interesting too. It looks like a person standing with a sword!" Gu Cangyun gazed intently at another peak, looking quite intrigued.

Everyone turned to look in that direction and soon discovered that there were more interesting peaks than just those two. Inside the Chiyue Mountains, there were at least a dozen or so small peaks shaped like various living creatures. Without exception, these small peaks were not particularly tall, ranging from several dozen to over a hundred zhang, some crouching, some standing, as if those creatures had been magnified countless times.

Yang Kai also found it amusing and couldn't help but take a few more glances. But soon, his expression changed, and his Divine Sense swept out, enveloping those oddly shaped small peaks.

After a moment, his expression changed slightly, and he said in shock, "Sect Master Ye, these small peaks... they're not as simple as they appear, are they?"

Ye Hen smiled and said, "Young Master Yang truly has sharp eyes to notice this. I am impressed."

"Is it really as I think?" Yang Kai's face grew solemn.

Ye Hen nodded, "That's right. It's exactly as you think."

"Father, what are you talking about?" Ye Qinghan looked at her father in confusion, not understanding what kind of riddle he and Yang Kai were speaking in.

Chi Yue and the others were also at a loss, but felt it was not their place to ask.

Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a sense of respect and praised, "Your Sect's ancestors were truly remarkable people. I had thought Miss Ye exaggerated the Chiyue Sect's former glory, but now I see there was not a bit of falsehood."

Ye Hen sighed, "The foundation remains, but the inheritance has declined. I am ashamed."

Ye Qinghan said, "This is not Father's fault. If our ancestors of that generation had not lost the inheritance, we would not have ended up like this."

"Insolence!" Ye Hen glared at Ye Qinghan. "How can you so casually comment on the actions of your ancestors?"

Ye Qinghan pouted, looking quite displeased.

Seeing Ye Hen's mood sour, Yang Kai did not ask further. Instead, his impression of the Chiyue Sect improved greatly. He thought that if the Chiyue Sect could truly recover those lost inheritances, in a hundred years it might well rise to the level of a top Sect. Just those inconspicuous, oddly shaped small peaks alone were enough to achieve this.

Before long, the group arrived at the main peak of the Chiyue Mountains, known as Chiyue Peak. Like the main peaks of other great Sects, its summit was adorned with grand pavilions and lofty halls, their imposing presence making it clear that this was a place of utmost importance to the Chiyue Sect.

At the peak stood an ancient great hall, unyielding through the ages, exuding an aura of desolate years.

The group descended in front of the great hall.

The other members of the Chiyue Sect seemed to have already received word and had been waiting here. Upon seeing Ye Hen and Yang Kai, they all bowed in greeting, but Shi Cangying was nowhere to be seen.

Ye Hen introduced the high-ranking members of the Chiyue Sect to Yang Kai one by one.

After some polite exchanges, Ye Hen led Yang Kai and the others into the great hall to welcome them.

Outside the hall, warriors clad in black armor and holding long halberds stood guard on both sides. In addition, various demonic beasts of different shapes and sizes crouched on the ground, motionless.

As Yang Kai and the others passed by these guards, he noticed that they did not move at all, not even blinking, nor did they show any intention of greeting.

This made Yang Kai feel a bit strange. After glancing at the guards a few more times, he was suddenly startled and stopped in his tracks, sending out his Divine Sense to scan the guards.

Seeing this, Ye Hen also stopped and looked at Yang Kai with a smile.

"Sect Master Yang, what's wrong?" Gu Cangyun asked in confusion, not knowing what Yang Kai had discovered.

Yang Kai looked around for a moment, then took a deep breath and said to Ye Hen, "Sect Master Ye... are all these guards actually puppets?"

"What?" Chi Yue and the others widened their eyes in disbelief, looking at the guards on both sides and releasing their Divine Senses to investigate.

After a moment, all of them had their eyes wide open, looking utterly incredulous.

Previously, they hadn't paid much attention, only feeling that the guards seemed a bit odd. But after Yang Kai's reminder, they realized that these black-armored, weapon-wielding guards were not living beings at all, but extremely lifelike puppets.

They looked no different from real people; even the exposed skin matched a normal person's.

Chi Yue and the others looked around again and found that the various demonic beasts crouching on the ground were also puppets.

Now they were completely shocked.

Ye Hen smiled and said, "These are some of the few Earth-Grade puppets our Sect possesses. I hope Young Master Yang and everyone else won't laugh."

Though he said this, his face was filled with pride, clearly very proud of his Sect's heritage.

The other high-ranking members of the Chiyue Sect also wore proud expressions.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and asked, "Are there different grades of puppets?"

Ye Hen nodded and replied, “Of course. In our Chiyue Sect, all puppets are divided into four major grades: Heaven, Earth, Mystery, and Yellow. Each grade is further split into three levels. The higher the grade and level, the more formidable the puppet.”

"Then these Earth-Grade puppets..." Chi Yue pointed at the thirty or so puppets around them and asked curiously, "How strong are they?"

Ye Hen said solemnly, "The strongest can reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and the weakest are at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!"

A collective gasp sounded as everyone looked at Ye Hen in disbelief.

If what he said was true, then these thirty or so puppets were equivalent to thirty or more Dao Origin Realm experts, some even at the third stage.

What a terrifying force this was!

And this was only the strength of the puppets themselves, not counting the strength of the warriors controlling them.

If a First Stage Dao Origin Realm warrior could control a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm puppet, they would be able to fight even the strongest opponents in the Dao Origin Realm.

Ghost Ancestor exclaimed, "Your Sect's puppet arts are so extraordinary, yet there are still people who seek other secret techniques to replace them. Truly short-sighted, not knowing how fortunate they are!"

Ye Hen said sadly, "Our Sect no longer has the methods or secret arts to control these puppets. Now, they are only placed here as decoration."

The other high-ranking members of the Chiyue Sect also fell silent, their previous pride gone, replaced by dejection.

"Let's not dwell on this. Young Master Yang and honored guests have come from afar. Our Sect has prepared some wine to welcome you. Please, this way!" Ye Hen quickly changed the subject, clearly not wanting to continue discussing this sad topic.

Naturally, Yang Kai and the others did not refuse. It would be impolite to decline such hospitality, so they followed Ye Hen into the great hall.

Although the high-ranking warriors of the Chiyue Sect did not know why the Sect Master valued Yang Kai and the others so highly, even personally coming out to greet them, they did not dare to ask. At the banquet, they were very courteous, frequently offering toasts, and for a time, everyone enjoyed themselves.

Yang Kai and Ye Hen sat together, neither feeling restrained. Yang Kai was extremely forthright, drinking heartily whenever someone toasted him, making others feel he was open-minded and a worthy friend.

After several rounds of wine, the music ended and the guests dispersed.

Yang Kai and the others were arranged to rest in one of the great halls on the main peak.

The group occupied the entire palace; except for a few serving maids and attendants, all the disciples of the Chiyue Sect had withdrawn.

Chi Yue and the others each went to rest. Led by a maid, Yang Kai arrived at his own room. After instructing the maid not to disturb him unless summoned, he set up a barrier, enveloping his room.

With a wave of his hand, a graceful and beautiful young woman appeared before him out of thin air.

Hua Qingsi glanced over and complained, "I was in the middle of a crucial moment in my cultivation. Why did you summon me?"

Now the Small Xuan Realm was filled with Spiritual Qi. Aside from the world laws not being fully perfected, the cultivation environment was even better than the Heaven-Grade Sacred Land of the Star God Palace. During this time, Hua Qingsi and Zhang Ruoxi had been cultivating inside with great enthusiasm.

Especially Zhang Ruoxi, whose strength had been rising rapidly. She had already broken through to the Void King Realm, which truly made Yang Kai look at her in a new light. After the mysterious power in her bloodline awakened, Zhang Ruoxi seemed like a completely different person.

Although Hua Qingsi had not broken through, her Origin Qi had become much more refined during this period, laying a solid foundation that would be of great help when she broke through to the Emperor Realm in the future.

Naturally, she was a bit displeased at Yang Kai suddenly interrupting her cultivation.

"How is your cultivation going, Sister Hua?" Yang Kai asked with interest. The stronger Hua Qingsi became, the more helpful she would be to him, so he naturally hoped she could reach the Emperor Realm as soon as possible.

If that happened, it would be like having an Emperor Realm bodyguard at his side, able to fight anyone he wished.

Hua Qingsi frowned and said, "I'm just a little bit short. It always feels like I'm missing something. Maybe the opportunity hasn't come yet."

Her tone was a bit frustrated. After all, Yang Kai had even given her a Supreme Mystic Pill, such a precious treasure. If she still couldn't break through to the Emperor Realm, it would be hard to justify.
