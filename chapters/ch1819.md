## Chapter 1819 — Outsiders

"The Spiritual Qi here used to be even thinner." Yang Kai smiled faintly, took a careful measure of the surroundings, and his brow creased slightly.

"What's wrong?" The Ghost Ancestor, seeing his unusual expression, asked.

"It shouldn't be like this." Yang Kai displayed a trace of suspicion. "The Spiritual Qi of this continent shouldn't still be so thin by now. So much time has passed; it should have become a great deal richer."

The reason the Tongxuan Continent's Spiritual Qi had once been sparse was twofold: first, the Great Demon God had laid down a sealing that isolated this Cultivation Star from the Star Domain, preventing outside Spiritual Qi from flowing in; second, the star's own Stellar Origin had been in decline.

But after Little Senior Sister refined the Origin power and became the Star Lord of the Tongxuan Continent, this place ought to have changed.

The stronger Little Senior Sister became, the more feedback the Tongxuan Continent would receive.

After such a long time, the Tongxuan Continent could not possibly still have so little Spiritual Qi.

"This isn't some sacred mountain or grand river; it may simply have been lacking in Spiritual Qi to begin with," the Ghost Ancestor glanced at the terrain and remarked casually.

Yang Kai nodded slightly in agreement.

"Let's go back to my old sect." Yang Kai called, checked his bearings, and led the Ghost Ancestor toward the direction where the Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay.

He decided to set up the Great Space Array within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. That place contained a natural grand formation formed by the convergence of the Nine Peaks, one of the rarest lands of dense Spiritual Qi on the entire Tongxuan Continent. With his current abilities, laying a few restriction barriers nearby would be enough to conceal the existence of the Space Array completely. Given the level of cultivators on Tongxuan Continent, even if they had ten thousand years, they wouldn’t be able to break through it.

Three to five days passed in a blink.

Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor flew through the air, brows knitted, periodically scanning below.

"Elder, have you noticed anything amiss?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

"Your homeland's Spiritual Qi is leaking badly, as if a punctured balloon were losing air everywhere."

"You noticed it too." Yang Kai's face darkened.

When Yang Kai first noticed that the Spiritual Qi of Tongxuan Continent was unusually thin, he had felt something was off. However, since the place he had landed in back then wasn’t exactly a land of rich essence or natural beauty, he hadn’t paid it much attention.

But after flying for three to five days, everywhere they passed lacked any abundance of Spiritual Qi. Whether towering mountains or rushing rivers, all seemed moribund.

This discovery weighed suddenly heavy on his heart.

There were only two likely causes for this: either the Tongxuan Continent itself had fallen into trouble, or Star Lord Xia Ningshang had met with misfortune.

Either possibility would be extremely unfavorable for Little Senior Sister.

Yang Kai suddenly regretted coming here; he longed to return at once to the Dark Star to check on Little Senior Sister.

But then he thought that Little Senior Sister was perfectly safe within the Lingxiao Sect, so perhaps the problem lay with the continent itself.

Yet what could possibly render an entire continent so lifeless, causing its already scant Spiritual Qi to grow ever thinner?

"Huh? What are those people doing down there?" The Ghost Ancestor abruptly spotted something and pointed downward.

Yang Kai halted midair and peered down from ten thousand zhang above.

Below lay a vast valley, and within it, a bright hexagram-shaped array was in full operation. Around the formation stood countless cultivators packed densely together, each forming hand seals with great effort to maintain the array’s circulation. From time to time, some would collapse from exhaustion, but others immediately stepped forward to take their place.

Around the array, a number of black-clad warriors looked on with cold indifference, sometimes shouting orders or even striking people.

Each of these black-clad men emitted a powerful aura, yet none participated in maintaining the array; they acted instead as overseers.

"Origin Returning Realm?" Yang Kai's brow jumped in surprise. "How is that possible? How could Origin Returning Realm experts appear here?"

Since ancient times on the Tongxuan Continent, the mightiest cultivator to emerge had been the Great Demon God, and even he had only grazed the mysteries of the Saint King Realm; after him the continent's peak had been the Saint Realm.

It was only because Little Senior Sister had refined the Stellar Origin that she had, by chance, advanced to the Origin Returning Realm.

But now, as Yang Kai passed over this valley, he sensed the auras of two Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

Though only at the first sublevel, they were unquestionably of the Origin Returning Realm.

"There were no Origin Returning Realm experts before in your homeland?" the Ghost Ancestor asked.

"The strongest in the past reached only the Third Stage of the Saint Realm!"

"Then they must be outsiders!" the Ghost Ancestor pointed down. "And look at that array: when it runs it seems to be devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi. They appear to be using it to refine something!"

"Outsiders..." A murderous light flashed in Yang Kai's eyes. "They're courting death!"

In that instant, he understood.

The reason the Tongxuan Continent had been safe and untroubled for so long, free from the incursions of Star Domain experts, was entirely due to the sealing restrictions the Great Demon God had set up; the Great Demon God's talent and foresight had arranged a barrier that hid this entire Cultivation Star from the Star Domain.

But that barrier had been broken by Yang Kai in the past, allowing the Tongxuan Continent to rejoin the Star Domain.

Decades later, Star Domain experts had finally discovered the Tongxuan Continent and invaded.

Yang Kai had left the Tongxuan Continent years ago partly to search for Su Yan and partly to pursue a higher Martial Dao, so he would not be powerless while his homeland was ravaged. The Bone Race invasion back then was proof: if not for the Great Demon God's farsightedness, the continent would already have been enslaved.

And now such an event was happening once again.

The arrays below were extracting the Tongxuan Continent's Spiritual Qi, effectively stifling Xia Ningshang's path of cultivation.

Furious, Yang Kai's body plummeted like a meteor, wrapped in endless cold.

The valley below gathered at least a thousand people.

Ninety-nine percent of them looked furious and resentful, their faces full of unwillingness. Yet under the threat to their lives they had no choice but to help sustain the grand array. They suffered bitterly but dared not resist, for those who resisted were all slain by the black-clad men.

The origins of these people were unknown, but each possessed astonishing strength that Tongxuan Continent cultivators could not resist.

Fewer than ten black-clad men stood with their hands behind their backs, and one young man sat upon a high chair. Beside him were two fair-faced girls attending him, their fearful expressions betraying that they had been seized from somewhere else.

The youth cradled an old-fashioned teapot in his hands, eyes half-lidded with leisurely air, yet occasionally a flash of sharpness shot from his gaze as it swept over the enslaved thousand.

After a while his eyes brightened; he extended a finger and pointed in one direction: "Bring that woman here."

Hearing this, the two girls by his side trembled and showed alarm. Exchanging a glance, worry filled their beautiful eyes.

The youth read them and sneered, "So you know something, do you?"

The two girls were instantly terrified and thudded to their knees, bodies trembling and silent.

"Hmph. That woman deliberately wore wide clothes and smeared dust on her face to hide her figure and looks? Does she think she can escape my eye? I've seen countless women—if she's a rare beauty I can tell at a glance... From how you look, that woman must have an extraordinary status in your Tianmu Palace; otherwise what would you be so worried about?"

The girls were horrified. One of them mustered courage and said, "Young Master, that woman is actually hideous beyond bearing; she is unfit to look upon. Young Master, please don't trouble yourself with her—let your servant attend you properly instead."

She forced out a coquettish smile that, due to her fear, looked slightly stiff yet all the more pitiable.

A lewd smile curved the youth's mouth as he reached out and hooked the girl's chin.

The girl did not dare move.

Slap— with a crack the youth struck, and the girl screamed as she was flung far away.

"Do I need you to direct my actions?" the youth snorted, displeasure on his face.

Then he looked at the other kneeling girl with a smile and said calmly, "Before you even move, you will already be dead!"

The second girl trembled; the force she had been gathering collapsed and she dared not move an inch.

She understood that their strength paled by comparison to the youth's; otherwise the Tianmu Palace would not have been exterminated and enslaved without resistance.

Despair appeared in her beautiful eyes.

At that moment, a woman who had been maintaining the array was brought before the youth by a black-clad man.

The woman wore very wide clothes and her face was a mess, making it impossible to tell whether she was beautiful, yet her eyes were exceptionally bright and spirited, almost as if they could speak, drawing attention.

"Let go of me, you bastards!" the woman struggled, but her Transcendent Realm cultivation could not free her from the Saint King Realm black-clad men's restraints.

The youth smiled at her, studying her face and letting his predatory gaze roam over her, making the woman uncomfortable; she grit her teeth and glared at him.

"Good, very good!" the youth laughed. "Finally someone I can take some interest in. Want to know why I picked you out?"

The woman said nothing; the anger in her eyes almost turned tangible.

The youth paid her no mind and said lightly, "Because your companions' foolish betrayal gave you away. Their cultivation is admittedly higher than yours, yet they treated you with such deference. If I'm not mistaken, your status in Tianmu Palace must be considerable—perhaps the Palace Master's daughter?"

His low voice carried to all ears, instantly filling the Tianmu Palace's group of experts with shame and anger; none had imagined that their treatment of the miss had caused her to be singled out by this bastard.

Had they known earlier, how could they have been so careless?
