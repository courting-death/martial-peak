## Chapter 80 — The Unyielding Will

Su Xuanwu squinted his eyes, intently watching Yang Kai as he was being beaten. He said with curiosity, “It seems he is comprehending something.”

“What do you mean?” Su Mu could not see through it.

Su Xuanwu slowly shook his head, offering no further explanation.

In his eyes, although Yang Kai’s current ordeal was brutal, it was clear he was using this battle to grasp something—perhaps a state of mind or a martial technique. Within his trembling body, wrapped in biting cold, a tiny ember of blazing fire was quietly spreading. Once this ember ignited, he would be reborn, ascending to a new level.

If he succeeded, his future achievements would surely be extraordinary! Su Xuanwu had never seen a martial artist so weak in strength able to enter such a profound realm of comprehension. It was nothing short of a miracle.

“Grandfather, if Sister keeps hitting him like this, Senior Brother Yang will surely die,” Su Mu said anxiously.

Su Xuanwu shook his head. “Yan’er knows how to control her strength. There is no murderous intent in her moves; she does not wish to take Yang Kai’s life.”

After saying this, he muttered to himself, “Strange… why would Yan’er strike him so fiercely?”

Even Su Xuanwu, with his years of experience, could not imagine what had happened to provoke such fury from Su Yan.

The howling wind and snow suddenly ceased, and Su Yan’s figure hovered in the air. Yang Kai was thrown directly toward the ground, battered and ragged, his clothes torn, and the exposed skin tinged with a frostbitten bluish-purple.

Near the ground, Yang Kai suddenly rolled, landing steadily. He opened his eyes and looked upward.

Beneath the starry sky, Su Yan in white robes floated like a descending fairy. Behind her hung a full moon, and the night breeze stirred her flowing garments.

Her ethereal and noble aura inspired a spontaneous sense of humility.

Crackling sounds echoed as frost rapidly spread over Yang Kai’s body. Soon, a massive block of ice encased him completely.

The ice was sharply faceted and crystal clear. Through it, every strand of Yang Kai’s hair was visible, even his expression frozen rigid on his face.

Su Yan said nothing, only casting a deep glance at Yang Kai before turning and returning indoors.

Only the breathtaking scene remained, etched into Yang Kai’s vision.

“Guard him closely. When the ice breaks, that will be the day of his success!” Su Xuanwu solemnly instructed Su Mu.

Su Mu’s forehead was slick with sweat. “Grandfather, won’t Senior Brother Yang freeze to death like this?”

Su Xuanwu chuckled. “No, this is his destiny!”

With that, he turned and left.

Only then did Su Mu and the others cautiously approach, repeatedly striking the massive ice block. But it was forged from Su Yan’s condensed cold energy—how could they possibly break it?

“This is bad, Senior Brother Yang was already injured and now frozen inside. His little brother might even rot from the cold. What should we do?” One of them spoke carelessly, only to be shot a sharp look by Su Mu.

“Didn’t you hear Grandfather say this is Senior Brother Yang’s destiny? Don’t touch it recklessly. If we break the ice, we might harm him. We just need to guard him here.”

“Oh,” the group nodded in agreement.

They kept watch until the fifth watch of the night, but the ice remained unmoving. Yang Kai, trapped inside, resembled a living corpse, his breathing faint, his eyes fixed on the spot where Su Yan had disappeared.

After some discussion, Su Mu and the others decided to leave two people to guard the ice while the rest went about their business.

This situation persisted for three full days. Before the small pavilion, an ice sculpture encased a living man, creating a scene as eerie as it was surreal.

Su Mu and the others lost count of their shifts. Each time, two remained to watch, yet no sign of the ice breaking appeared. Their anxiety grew until the corners of their mouths blistered.

During these three days, Yang Kai felt no passage of time. Though his eyes remained open, he saw nothing.

His entire spirit was immersed in comprehension.

He felt the stirring within his bones, the warmth born from his Unyielding Will, and how this faint heat spread through his body, gradually increasing his strength.

The ice block left by Su Yan provided an excellent space for insight. The cold energy within constantly invaded his body, seeping into his meridians.

This cold energy was beyond Yang Kai’s current ability to resist, yet each time he endured it, relying on the marvel of his Indomitable Golden Body.

Hundreds, even thousands, of resistances allowed Yang Kai to unravel the mysteries of the Golden Body and understand why it enhanced his strength.

The tiny ember of heat within him expanded little by little. Today, after grasping the secret of the Indomitable Golden Body, the ember suddenly ignited, and a raging heat surged through his entire body.

Crack!

The sound startled Su Mu and Li Yuntian, who had been standing guard nearby. They quickly turned to look.

The massive ice block was riddled with countless fine cracks, like a dense spiderweb.

“Senior Brother Yang is breaking free!” Su Mu exclaimed with joy.

Sure enough, the ice exploded with a thunderous roar, dissolving into sparkling fragments that vanished into the air.

Yang Kai stood amidst the remnants, blood-stained and battered. His upper body still looked somewhat frail, but his brow was furrowed in deep thought.

Su Mu and Li Yuntian dared not disturb him, waiting quietly.

After a long moment, the worry in Yang Kai’s eyes vanished. He smiled faintly and said, “Then so be it. I shall call this the Unyielding Will!”

The Unyielding Will was what Yang Kai had comprehended during these three days. It was a wondrous martial technique—not for offense, but to strengthen oneself.

It was discovered through his insight into the Indomitable Golden Body and was intimately connected to it.

Only when one was in adversity, with an indomitable will, could this miraculous technique be activated. Once employed, the Indomitable Golden Body would supply energy, temporarily boosting one’s strength.

Though he had inadvertently triggered the Unyielding Will before, a martial technique’s effect is vastly different when its principles are understood versus when they are not.

It could be said that only now had Yang Kai truly mastered this mysterious technique—a unique skill unmatched across the world.

No longer would it trigger involuntarily upon injury or provocation.

Though the gains were immense, Yang Kai felt somewhat unsatisfied, sensing that other secrets still lay hidden within the Indomitable Golden Body. Not having fully unraveled them was a regret.

But time was long, and there was no need to rush, he comforted himself.

Only when Yang Kai moved did Su Mu and Li Yuntian step forward, anxiously asking, “Senior Brother Yang, are you alright?”

“Me? I’m perfectly fine!” Yang Kai flexed his limbs and suddenly realized the injuries he had sustained days ago had completely healed.

“You’d better put on some clothes. If Sister comes back and sees you like this, she might beat you again,” Su Mu said nervously.
