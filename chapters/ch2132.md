## Chapter 2132 — Departure

Not only was Qiu Ran stunned, but Chen Qian also widened her beautiful eyes, covering her red lips with a small hand as she stared at Gao Xueting in shock.

All the Emperor Realm experts were the same, completely dumbfounded.

If even those Emperor Realm experts who could remain calm in the face of a mountain collapsing were shocked, the disciples were naturally even more astonished.

Each one was left speechless, their eyes nearly popping out, and everyone’s gaze was fixed on Gao Xueting.

“Everyone… why are you looking at me like that? Do I have flowers painted on my face?” Gao Xueting asked faintly. Her lips curved into a charming smile, yet her beautiful eyes were filled with icy light.

A strange chill settled over them, as if they had been plunged into an ice cellar, their bodies going cold.

Gulp...

The sound of swallowing echoed one after another.

“Did I see that right... Elder Gao... actually smiled?” someone suddenly exclaimed.

“She really smiled! Heavens, I’ve been a disciple in the Shrine for decades and never once saw Elder Gao smile. To see it today, I could die without regret.”

“This isn’t real, this isn’t real... It’s an illusion, it’s an illusion, it’s an illusion...”

The Dao Origin Realm disciples were in utter chaos, none daring to believe their eyes, all because of Gao Xueting’s smile.

“You all seem to have a lot of opinions about me!” Gao Xueting’s smile remained, but for some reason, it looked stiff. Hearing the disciples’ chatter, she suddenly turned her head to look at them.

None of the disciples dared meet her gaze, quickly looking away for fear of being targeted.

“Sister Gao...” Chen Qian stepped forward, asking worriedly, “Are you alright?”

“What could be wrong?” Gao Xueting replied with a sweet but gritted smile, her eyes fixed on Wen Zishan. “I’m perfectly fine!”

“Oh...” Chen Qian didn’t know what else to say, her heart in turmoil.

Not to mention those Dao Origin Realm disciples—even as an elder who often spent time with Gao Xueting, this was the first time she’d ever seen her smile. And that smile hadn’t faded, making her feel both strange and terrified, shivering involuntarily.

“E-Elder Gao!” Qiu Ran finally couldn’t bear it. Though Gao Xueting’s rare smile ought to be reassuring, that frightful expression was worse than her usual chill. As Deputy Hall Master, he felt obliged to step in with a bit of guidance. After weighing his words, he said softly, “You don’t have to force yourself.”

Gao Xueting turned to him, still smiling, and said, “Force myself? I’m not... What, do you think my smile is ugly, Master Qiu?”

“Not at all!” Qiu Ran was startled, quickly denying it and changing the subject. “The disciples have all assembled. Elder Gao, if you have anything to say to them, please do.”

“What’s left to say?” Gao Xueting glanced at the twenty Dao Origin Realm martial artists and said crisply, “I’ll tell them on the way. Now... let’s depart!”

As she spoke, she opened her lips and spat out a miniature tower-ship. With a hand seal, the ship suddenly grew, stretching over ten zhang in length before coming to a stop.

The ship was sleek and exquisitely crafted, with dragons and phoenixes carved on it. It was clearly much better than the one Yang Kai had obtained before.

After all, it was a Secret Treasure produced by an Emperor Realm expert. This ship must be a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level flying Secret Treasure!

“Everyone, get on!” Gao Xueting said.

None of the Dao Origin Realm martial artists dared hesitate. They all used their movement techniques to leap onto the ship. Yang Kai joined the crowd, found a spot, and sat cross-legged.

After everyone was settled, Gao Xueting’s graceful figure swayed as she came to the deck.

Then, she slowly turned around, her face twisted in a sinister, chilling grin as she stared at Wen Zishan, who had been hiding in the crowd, and said through gritted teeth, “When I get back... I’ll deal with you properly!”

She looked as if she’d suffered some great humiliation, just short of swearing vengeance.

“Safe... travels!” Wen Zishan waved, his body inexplicably trembling.

“Hmph!” Gao Xueting snorted coldly, urged her Origin Qi, and the ship accelerated, flying out of the Qingyang Mountain Range.

Once the tower-ship disappeared from view, a long, unbroken peal of laughter suddenly rang out.

Wen Zishan laughed until tears nearly fell, clutching his stomach and wishing he could roll on the ground to ease his discomfort. Laughing, he said, “Did you all see little Xueting... like that? Hahaha, it was just too funny...”

“What a disgrace!” Qiu Ran looked up to the heavens in exasperation, shook his head sadly, and swept his sleeves as he rode the wind away.

“Hall Master, please have some dignity!” Another Emperor Realm expert couldn’t stand it either, feeling ashamed to be associated with him.

“You’re dead!” Chen Qian looked at Wen Zishan with disdain. “When Sister Gao returns from the Four Seasons Land, just wait for her to deal with you!”

With that, everyone left, leaving Wen Zishan all alone.

Laughing and laughing, he soon found the fun fading. His expression tightened as he straightened up, murmuring with a touch of melancholy, “It feels like I haven’t seen little Xueting’s smile in many years—how nostalgic… Back then she was such a playful, clingy child. How did she grow up to be so cold all of a sudden… Mm, truly, a girl changes eighteen times as she comes of age.”

...

On the ship, everyone was silent.

All twenty Dao Origin Realm martial artists had to quietly circulate their Origin Qi to resist the icy chill coming from ahead.

Gao Xueting stood at the front of the deck the whole time. Ever since departure, she radiated a bone-chilling cold that seemed able to freeze a person’s very soul.

From time to time, Gao Xueting would let out a nervous, low laugh, making everyone’s skin crawl.

In this situation, who would dare provoke Gao Xueting? So no one spoke, not even in whispers. Each one sat quietly, eyes on their nose, nose on their heart...

Qingyang Shrine had twenty spots to enter the Four Seasons Land, originally reserved for the top twenty Dao Origin Realm disciples in the Sect’s martial contest. But after Xue Yi was defeated by Yang Kai, Yang Kai, an outsider, was added.

Of these twenty, seven were women, the rest men.

Yang Kai only knew Xiao Baiyi and Xia Sheng among them; he didn’t know the names of the others.

But he didn’t care to find out. His main goal in going to the Four Seasons Land was to find the Calamity Fruit. As long as he could find this spirit fruit, he wouldn’t let down Qin Chaoyang’s trust.

The ship was indeed a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure, and its flying speed was fast.

They didn’t encounter any obstacles along the way.

After all, with an Emperor Realm expert aboard—especially one in such a foul mood—the killing intent she radiated sent any martial artist who sensed it retreating in fear.

This situation lasted for three whole days!

Three days later, Gao Xueting, who had been standing with her back to everyone at the front of the deck, suddenly turned around.

Noticing this, everyone tensed up, quickly opening their eyes to look at her, nervous deep down.

But after seeing Gao Xueting’s state, everyone couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

At this moment, Gao Xueting had clearly returned to her usual cold and indifferent self. The strange smile on her face had vanished.

Yang Kai heard many people quietly exhale.

“Sure enough, this is the Elder Gao that lets one feel at ease…” Xia Sheng patted his chest, still shaken. “The Elder Gao from before was like a different person—she nearly scared me to death!”

As soon as he said this, Xiao Baiyi realized something was wrong and slapped him across the face.

Xia Sheng was stunned, glaring at Xiao Baiyi. “Xiao Bai, you ambushed me? Shameless! Do you believe I’ll...”

Before he could finish, Xia Sheng involuntarily shivered, stiffly raising his head to see Gao Xueting suddenly appear before him, looking down with a twitching mouth. He weakly said, “Elder Gao, did I say something wrong?”

“Nothing of the sort,” Gao Xueting replied lightly. Then, all of a sudden, she pressed her lips together in a smile and said, “Tell me—was this the look that frightened you so badly?”

Xia Sheng’s face turned green...

Gao Xueting reached out, caught Xia Sheng off guard, seized him and tossed him out like trash—her movements smooth and effortless!

“Elder Gao...” Xia Sheng’s shout echoed from afar, but he quickly became a tiny black dot.

“Alright, the annoying one is gone!” Gao Xueting casually clapped her hands, swept her gaze over everyone, and spoke calmly.

Anyone she looked at immediately lowered their head, avoiding her gaze.

“That idiot!” Xiao Baiyi cursed inwardly, then glanced back to see Xia Sheng chasing after the ship with all his strength. As the Sect’s martial contest champion, his strength was undeniable, and he quickly caught up.

But there was a barrier on the ship. If Gao Xueting didn’t open it, Xia Sheng couldn’t get in, so he clung to the barrier, pleading and shouting.

Gao Xueting ignored him. Annoyed, she waved her hand and silenced the noise.

Many glanced at Xia Sheng with sympathetic eyes, their hearts quietly echoing his misery.

"There is something I need to tell you all." Gao Xueting suddenly spoke.

Everyone held their breath, focusing on her.

“This time, the Four Seasons Land is a bit different from previous years!” Gao Xueting continued. “You should have all received the information about Four Seasons Land before departure, so I won’t repeat it. But this time, there will be Star Seals in Four Seasons Land!”

“Star Seals?” Xiao Baiyi’s expression changed, as if he’d thought of something. “Are they related to the Shattered Star Sea?”

Gao Xueting looked at him approvingly. “That’s right, they’re related to the Shattered Star Sea! A Star Seal is the pass to enter the Shattered Star Sea—those who obtain one may enter when the Shattered Star Sea opens. Therefore… in the Four Seasons Land, you are to do your utmost to seek and secure Star Seals. This is your primary task—and your only task.”
