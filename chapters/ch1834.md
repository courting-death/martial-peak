## Chapter 1834 — Laws Perfected

Yang Yan's expression was mournful and grievous, not feigned; the energy fluctuations radiating from her Spirit Body were also extremely unstable, revealing the turmoil of her mood.

Yang Kai felt a twinge of curiosity — he wondered what exactly her relationship with the owner of the Xuan Realm Pearl was.

"Enough, don't speak of him; after being missing for so long I already assume he's dead. I'll first pull out what that man left in your Sea of Consciousness," Yang Yan said as she sat cross‑legged, her face solemnly composed, fingers forming spirit seals as her bright eyes stared down at the water.

From her fingertips surged a strand of Divine Sense power visible to the naked eye, taking the shape of a spiritual snake and diving into the sea.

Yang Kai stood quietly at one side, watching.

At first the Sea of Consciousness was calm, but after a while the crimson waters, burning like flames, began to stir; at one spot huge bubbles rose.

Yang Kai focused his attention there and discovered a triangular sigil had appeared, vague at first, ethereal and formless.

The snake‑like thing circled that triangular mark without ceasing, and as it swam the sigil grew clearer.

When the mark was fully revealed, Yang Yan changed her seal; the spiritual snake returned and shot back into her body.

Opening her eyes slightly, Yang Yan said, "It's the simplest Soul Pursuit Seal — only that, given your strength, you can't dispel it, not even detect it."

"You can't remove it either?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"I did not remove it," Yang Yan rose slowly.

Yang Kai looked at her thoughtfully. "Playing the long game?"

“Indeed.” Yang Yan let out a cold laugh. “After tens of thousands of years of silence, it seems some of those in the Star Realm have grown restless again. Perfect—this time, I’ll use him as an example. Once I return to the Star Realm, I’ll hang his head high above the Star Gate, and then we’ll see who else dares to descend and covet the Laws of this Star Domain.”

Yang Kai discreetly wiped nonexistent cold sweat from his brow and felt pity for that unfortunate fellow. "What should I do? I'll cooperate."

"There is nothing special you must do; he will seek you out on his own. Do what you wish in the meantime — I will watch over you from the shadows," Yang Yan said, then suddenly extended a finger and a glimmer of profound light entered Yang Kai's Spirit Body. "This is a secret technique to seal the Sea of Consciousness. Study and cultivate it carefully."

Yang Kai bowed solemnly and closed his eyes to contemplate.

He had treasures in his Sea of Consciousness like the Warm Spirit Lotus and the Star Chart. If he ever went to the Star Realm in the future, those would inevitably be discovered by some experts, so that secret art to seal the Sea of Consciousness was indeed something he needed to cultivate.

Seeing him so, Yang Yan said no more. She placed several more restrictions inside Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and then leisurely departed.

One day later Yang Kai opened his eyes, a faint weariness visible on his face.

The set of secret methods Yang Yan had passed down to seal the Sea of Consciousness was extremely profound; contemplating it consumed much Divine Sense, and though he was tired, the gains were great and he looked spirited.

In the Hundred Flowers Pavilion, Yang Yan and Lin Yun'er were nowhere to be found; Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense but could not sense their presence — no one knew where they had gone.

Only Ghost Ancestor sat opposite Yang Kai, his face grave as if lost in thought.

"Elder!" Yang Kai greeted him.

Only then did the Ghost Ancestor come back to his senses. Lifting his head, he looked at Yang Kai and asked in a solemn voice, “Sect Master, that esteemed lady… what exactly is her background? Why was it that before her, this old man was as helpless as a child?”

Ghost Ancestor had truly been shocked.

He had cultivated to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and had thought the world vast and open, but coming to Lingxiao Sect he had been thoroughly flummoxed by Yang Yan and almost lost his confidence.

Though he had gained some benefit, Ghost Ancestor simply could not accept that he was so weak.

"If I told you she was the Starry Sky Emperor, would you believe me?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Ghost Ancestor's mouth dropped open as wide as a watermelon; he stared at Yang Kai, his eyeballs trembling violently.

"Ha ha ha… Elder, weren't you intending to refine a Void King‑Grade Spiritual Pill? Go to Pill Treasure Peak and find my Little Senior Sister — she will help you refine it," Yang Kai laughed heartily and left at ease.

Ghost Ancestor was left behind stunned for a long time.

After a long moment, he slapped the table and exclaimed, “You little brat, how dare you try to fool this old man! A Great Emperor is but a figure of legend—how could one truly appear before the world, let alone be a woman… For someone as shrewd as me to fall for your trick—preposterous! Enough, enough, I’d better focus on alchemy instead!”

Whatever Yang Yan's origin, Ghost Ancestor knew it was beyond his reckoning, but after being put to shame twice by her he no longer dared to be arrogant.

The broad Martial Dao still required ceaseless seeking above and below…

At Tianyi Palace Yang Kai sat cross‑legged, eyes closed.

His Divine Sense had spread out and merged with the entire Dark Star; if he wished he could even sense every rustle on that cultivation star.

It felt as if he and the Cultivation Star had become one, no longer separate.

The previously vague sense of the Laws had become clearer now, and his grasp of the Dark Star had grown much stronger than before.

"Is it because I advanced to the Void King Realm?" Yang Kai pondered. "It should be. The Void King Realm and the Origin Returning Realm are entirely different levels; an increase in strength naturally brings changes. Huh — the force of the Laws seems altered as well…"

He suddenly sensed something unusual and studied it; after a long moment he was slightly startled. "The power of the Laws has become much more complete? Could this also be a result of my promotion? If so, the reason the Dark Star could not produce Void King‑Realm cultivators was that the Laws were imperfect, and at root it may have been caused by the great battle between Yang Yan and the Insect Emperor in the past. My ascension changed that… If the Laws have become perfected, does that mean the Dark Star no longer resists the Void King Realm? Then again, when I returned I felt no rejection from the Dark Star, but I am its Star Lord — that might not count. All right, I'll try it with Grand Elder and see."

With that he quickly located where Ghost Ancestor was.

At present, on the entire Dark Star there were only the two of them at Void King Realm; he was the Star Lord and could not test it himself, so he had to start with Ghost Ancestor.

At this moment, on Pill Treasure Peak, inside the palace, the scent of pills filled the air.

Ghost Ancestor sat cross‑legged on the ground, speaking with measured words about the Dao of martial cultivation and pouring out his experience.

Opposite him, Su Yan sat atop the Ten‑Thousand‑Year Ice Jade platform, emanating an ice‑piercing chill. Her hands were outstretched and naturally rested on her knees as she listened intently.

Beside her, Little Senior Sister listened just as attentively, but her hands never stopped. She continued pulling out Void King‑Grade medicinal herbs, dissolving them and condensing pill liquid.

Endowed with the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, Little Senior Sister refined pills as if eating — it was instinctive to her, so listening to Ghost Ancestor while refining cost her nothing.

From time to time a Spiritual Pill emerged and Xia Ningshang placed it into a prepared jade bottle.

Ghost Ancestor watched in delight, full of energy.

After a while his brow suddenly knit as he glanced around, a look of suspicion on his face.

At that moment he felt watched.

He was instantly alarmed, mistakenly thinking Yang Yan was spying on him — after all, only Yang Yan had the ability to hide from him so completely.

Not daring to slacken, he became even more focused in explaining the many difficulties of cultivation, a bead of sweat slowly appearing on his brow.

Fortunately that feeling of being watched faded after a while, and Ghost Ancestor breathed a deep sigh of relief.

“It truly isn’t rejecting him anymore.” In Tianyi Palace, joy lit up Yang Kai’s face. He had just tried channeling the power of the Heavenly Laws onto the Ghost Ancestor and discovered that the world no longer repelled his existence—this realization filled him with delight.

The Laws becoming perfected was a historic breakthrough for the Dark Star.

That meant the celestial Laws would no longer suppress the Star's cultivators; they would no longer prevent the Dark Star's practitioners from breaking through to the Void King Realm, nor would they cause phenomena like what Qian Tong had previously encountered, being rejected by the Laws and struck by heavenly thunder and earthly fire.

In the future the Dark Star could not only produce Void King‑Realm experts, but also allow such experts to remain for long periods.

This would save the trouble of sending Origin Returning Realm peak cultivators to other stars to breakthrough.

It seemed he had to send word to Qingmu Star, letting Ye Xijun and Qian Tong and the others know the good news.

Although the Dark Star's Laws had become perfected because of his breakthrough, the Xuan Realm Pearl world's heavenly Laws were still incomplete, which left Yang Kai helpless; incomplete Laws meant one could not breakthrough inside.

But after all those were remnants left by the previous Star Domain guardian, and Yang Kai could not yet perceive the whole.

In the following six months Yang Kai remained on the Dark Star and did not leave.

He had only recently advanced to the Void King Realm; although because his Incarnation had inadvertently refined the entire Floating Continent his realm had momentarily risen to a peak of a Stage, he still needed to carefully consolidate.

In those six months, besides strengthening his realm, Yang Kai cultivated the secret art to seal the Sea of Consciousness.

After half a year, he had clearly made some progress. His entire Sea of Consciousness was now enveloped by an invisible power that resonated with the restriction Yang Yan had placed. With his current cultivation, it was likely that no one in the entire Star Domain could invade his Sea of Consciousness.

Thus the secrets within his Sea of Consciousness could sleep safely.

One day he was accompanying his parents on the peak where they lived to fulfill filial duty, the family enjoying simple happiness together.

Su Yan and Xia Ningshang were also there; the two women had been in seclusion recently and had gained something, their qi ebbing and flowing, clearly on the verge of a breakthrough.

So Yang Kai had taken them out to relax; breakthroughs could not be rushed — one should let them come naturally.

His son was a dragon among men, his two daughters‑in‑law were beauties each with their own merits; Fourth Master Yang and Dong Suzhu felt their lives had been fulfilled, and Dong Suzhu kept urging Yang Kai to marry soon, making the two Senior Sisters both expectant and bashful.

Yang Kai's brow twitched as he sent out his Divine Sense; a moment later his expression changed slightly. "Father, Mother, wait a moment — I'll be right back," he said.

He shot Su Yan and Xia Ningshang a glance and the two Senior Sisters nodded in understanding.

Then Yang Kai's figure flickered and he vanished from sight.
