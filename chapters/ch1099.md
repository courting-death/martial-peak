## Chapter 1099 — Wu Yi's Rage

The warship flew beneath the clouds of Dark Star for a long while before finally descending slowly and landing on a huge plaza.

Waiting on the plaza were those who had received the news; standing by a window, Wu Yi saw familiar faces waving and calling out from below and couldn't help but leap with joy: "It's Uncle Hao An and the others!"

Yu Feng grinned broadly. "Our efforts on this trip count for something — Senior Hao An will naturally come to greet us. Miss, there'll be no small rewards when we return, right?"

"All you think about is rewards!" Wu Yi shot him a look and laughed softly. "Don't worry, the ores we gathered this time are scarce — you won't miss out on your share."

At her words, the nearby gathered fighters erupted in cheers.

With a dull rumble, the warship settled on the plaza and its hatch slowly opened. Wu Yi led the way, Chang Qi close behind, a large group of people marching down from the ship like victorious soldiers returning from battle, laden with honor and triumph, heads held high.

The elderly Hao An hurried forward to meet them, followed by several Haike Family fighters. When he drew near he cupped his hands in salute: "Miss, you've had a hard journey. Everyone, you've all worked hard!"

"It was our duty, Uncle Hao An, no need for thanks." Wu Yi smiled gently.

"Now that you've returned safely, this old man's heart can finally rest," Hao An said with a face full of lingering fear. Everyone knew how dangerous it was to pilot a warship into the Star Domain — Wu Yi had been gone for a year or two, and many who cared for her had suffered sleepless nights; Hao An was among them. He cheerfully urged, "Miss, hurry back to the family. The Family Head and the elders are worried; if they see you safe and sound they'll be overjoyed."

Wu Yi pursed her lips into a smile and shook her head. "No rush — first unload the ores from the ship; we can return afterwards."

Hao An's expression tightened briefly, then he composed himself and forced a smile. "There's no need for you to oversee this, Miss. There will be people to handle it."

Wu Yi thought for a moment where she stood, then nodded. "Very well."

Saying so, she called back to those behind her, "Help carry the ores we've collected back."

"Yes!" Yu Feng and the others shouted in reply.

"No need — we'll do it ourselves." A sudden voice cut through. The instant it sounded, the smile on Wu Yi's face vanished, replaced by sharp vigilance and disgust as her beautiful eyes turned to one side.

From the direction of the voice a group of fighters came rushing over. Leading them was a short young man whose height scarcely reached Yang Kai's chest; though diminutive, he strode with the arrogance of a dragon and tiger. The followers behind him wore expressions of smug triumph, their eyes openly full of contempt.

"Xie Hongwen?" Wu Yi's pupils narrowed; she called out sharply, "What are you doing here?"

"Why can't I be here?" Xie Hongwen chuckled. "This may be your Haike Family's plaza, but it's also in my Yingyue Hall's turf. I come as I please. Ah, Wu Yi, little sister, you've worked hard this trip. I've heard you dove into the Star Domain and collected a lot of rare ore."

"What business is it of yours?" Wu Yi's vigilance spiked.

"How is it not my business?" Xie Hongwen laughed and pointed at the warship. "The ores inside are now Yingyue Hall's. Didn't anyone tell you?"

Wu Yi's face blanched; Yu Feng and the others' faces went grim and furious.

Wu Yi turned to Hao An, expecting an explanation, but Hao An looked ashamed. After stammering for a while he sighed, "Miss, we'll discuss it at home. The Family Head will give you an explanation."

"An explanation?" Wu Yi sneered, and in an instant the reasons behind everything flashed through her. Her burning heart chilled, and she said coldly, "When we went to collect those ores there were over a hundred of us; when we returned there are only half. Does the family know what dangers we faced? Do they know how many waves of Black Rock Beasts attacked us? Do they know we nearly couldn't make it back, that we almost suffered total annihilation? For whom did we risk our lives to mine those ores? Now we return full-laden — why can’t we enjoy the fruits of our own toil? All we get is an ‘explanation’?"

The barrage of questions left Hao An speechless, his shame growing until he seemed to wish for a hole to crawl into.

Wu Yi's fury became unbearable; her delicate body trembled. The fifty-plus fighters behind her shared the same righteous hatred, their gazes at Xie Hongwen burning as if about to spew flames. Everyone's strength surged silently.

Xie Hongwen remained unmoved, his face wearing that nauseating smile as he looked challengingly at Yu Feng and the others, as if hoping they'd make the first move and turn this into a scene.

"Miss, this is the family's decision!" Hao An finally managed to say, his voice earnest and pleading. "Please consider the bigger picture!"

Wu Yi was no naive girl; though she understood the family was forced to make such a decision, she also knew that refusing to compromise now would only bring greater disaster to those behind her. Her clenched fists loosened and her anger turned into resignation. With a heavy sigh she said, "I understand."

"Miss!" Yu Feng growled as if he had more to say.

"Go home! Your rewards won't be small; even if the family doesn't provide, I will give you their due!" Wu Yi glared at him fiercely.

Yu Feng's eyes reddened; he drooped his head in defeat.

A soft clap rang out as Xie Hongwen, who had been watching the show with amusement, burst into laughter. “I’ve long heard that Sister Wu Yi has a remarkable way of commanding her subordinates. Seeing it today, the rumors truly weren’t exaggerated! So many grown men obeying a single young woman’s every word—your brother is impressed!”

“Who’s your sister? And since when are you my brother?” Wu Yi glared at him in disgust. “Xie Hongwen, let me tell you something — this warship's ore is stained with the blood of my Haike Family clansmen. We mined it with our very lives. I hope when you take it back, you don’t have nightmares and that the vengeful spirits don’t come to haunt you!”

Xie Hongwen's expression went cold for a moment, but he quickly smiled again. "Wu Yi, I know you feel wronged, but so what? Blame your family's weakness. One day your family will carry the Xie name and you'll become a woman surnamed Xie. Just wait and see."

With that he laughed loudly, waved his hand and ordered, "Move the ores — anyone who dares stop us will be killed without mercy!"

The fighters behind him surged forward, fierce and threatening, and filed into the warship.

"Let's go back!" Wu Yi refused to watch his indecency. She wore a cold, beautiful face and led dozens of fighters away in another direction.

After a year or two of hardship deep in the Star Domain to mine those ores, they had just returned to Dark Star only to see their haul fall into others' hands — a torment and humiliation to all.

The atmosphere within the group was unbearably tense. Yang Kai could clearly see the bloodshot eyes of those men — a look of madness. He was certain that if Wu Yi had given the order just now, they would have charged at Xie Hongwen without hesitation, ready to die to defend the fruits of their hard labor.

Yang Kai had intended to take his leave when they reached Dark Star and bid Wu Yi farewell, but now was clearly not the time. Leaving without saying goodbye would be awkward, so he reluctantly followed the group forward.

Thinking a moment, he sidled up to Yu Feng and quietly asked, "Does Xie Hongwen hold a grudge against your Miss?"

Yu Feng's anger hadn't cooled; with eyes bloodshot he glanced at Yang Kai and shook his head. "No grudge, he once tried to propose marriage to Miss years ago and was rejected. Since then he's been humiliated and vengeful, always targeting our family."

"Is that guy powerful?"

"Who does he think he is?" Yu Feng scoffed. "If it weren't for Yingyue Hall's protection, I could kill him any time! It's just that his father is an important figure in Yingyue Hall, so he can act wildly. Our Haike Family is only a peripheral force under Yingyue Hall — no one will come to our aid when he's cruel to us... Why are you asking so many questions, kid? Curious fellow. I'm warning you, don't try to steal Wu Yi from me, or I'll beat you so badly your mother won't recognize you!"

Yang Kai was taken aback but laughed scornfully. "Don't worry, I won't steal her. I have many women."

Yu Feng’s eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets as he stared at Yang Kai as though seeing an immortal descended to the mortal world. Looking him up and down, he sneered, “Really now? With that pitiful state of yours, you’ve still got a bunch of women following you? What do you even have to protect them with?”

Yang Kai shrugged and said nothing more.

Yu Feng, as if having discovered a new world, excitedly ran ahead to walk beside Wu Yi, whispering secrets — what he said is unknown.

A moment later Wu Yi turned back to look at Yang Kai; her brows furrowed and her face showed puzzlement.

Yang Kai's face was ashen; he realized Yu Feng had already betrayed him. But after that move, Wu Yi's mood seemed to ease somewhat; her tense expression relaxed and even showed a faint, barely noticeable smile.

The Haike Family manor wasn't far from the plaza where the warship docked — only about fifty li. Before long the group reached the estate.

Wu Yi naturally went with Hao An and Chang Qi to see the family's elders and demand an explanation; the rest flooded into the manor and dispersed, vanishing in no time, destinations unknown.

Only Yu Feng and Yang Kai were left standing there, staring at each other.

Yu Feng scratched his head and mumbled, "Miss told me to entertain you, but I thought and thought and don't know how to — I have no experience in that!"

Yang Kai chuckled, "Do as you please; I'll just wander around."

"Suit yourself. I'm free anyway. Don't go to the inner estate — that's where the family proper lives. You can walk the outer grounds. If you get bored, there's the Tianyun City two hundred li from here you can visit."

"Alright." Yang Kai nodded.
