## Chapter 908 — Is This Thing for Sale or Not?

Enclosed within the sea of blood, the six of them poured out every last skill they had—fighting off the Blood Men formed from coagulated blood while racing forward, desperate to flee this perilous place.

But no matter how they fled, that thick, vivid red still surrounded them on all sides.

The blood sea seemed endless, and it moved as if tracking their steps, ensuring they could never find a way out.

Gradually, Great Lord Lei Long had to stop as well, focusing all his power on dealing with the Blood Men's assaults.

Within a range of several hundred zhang, lightning like flowing strands shot forth and threaded through the blood sea, attempting to break the sea's seal and find an escape route.

Lei Long himself was a Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon, versed in the mysteries of fire and thunder; his prowess and cultivation were extraordinary, yet even he was baffled by the current situation.

The tawny aura around the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shimmered, sometimes swelling, sometimes being corroded away.

The sharp golden qi emanating from Jin Ni likewise dimmed little by little.

Caidie’s seven-colored glow and Li Rong’s pitch-black Demon Yuan surged within the blood sea, but the sea behaved like a bottomless pit, swallowing everyone’s power and leaving no hope of escape.

The Blood Men that emerged from the sea were not strong and their bodies weren’t particularly sturdy; a few Saint-Realm experts could reduce them to blood with minimal effort.

What drove them to despair was that after dissolving into blood, they could coagulate again, rise up, and resume attacking.

The blood mist that seeped in was constantly wearing down the group’s internal strength.

They didn’t know whether this sealing array had been set by the Great Demon God, but it possessed a terrifying destructive power and endurance.

Among the group, Yang Kai’s strength was the lowest, which is precisely why the five Saint-Realm experts kept him in the center, so he didn’t need to worry about his safety for the moment.

While the five struggled to hold the line, he kept watching the energy fluctuations in the blood sea and the condition of the Blood Men.

His Divine Sense quietly spread out; when a Blood Man lunged at Li Rong, the fire of his Divine Sense suddenly burst forth.

The scorching force spread outward—an intent capable of burning all things in the world.

Those who had been chilled to the bone felt heat creep across their skin at the sensing of that intent, a burning sensation welling up; the four yao took a brief respite and glanced at Yang Kai in surprise.

At that moment, the Blood Man that had leapt toward Li Rong began to boil.

Since that Blood Men had been formed from blood with no bones or flesh, the thick, crimson fluid bubbled as if boiling; bubbles formed all over it and it was quickly evaporated clean—leaving nothing behind.

Everyone brightened at once.

“Kid’s got a trick,” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox exclaimed loudly.

It was the first time since being trapped in the blood sea that they had completely annihilated a Blood Man.

“Great Lord, use fire!” Yang Kai hurriedly looked to Lei Long.

Lei Long reacted immediately without prompt, gathering his thunder force and letting searing flames surge from his hulking form.

The charging Blood Men’s advance was greatly hindered; they seemed to dread the searing heat, blood on their surfaces continuously bubbling up, their blurred features contorting in fierce pain as they stopped.

Lei Long roared, and with several ear‑splitting bellows streaks of flame like dragons flickered outward. Coupled with Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, they instantly swept away the Blood Men surrounding them, greatly widening the space in which the group could move.

“This won’t last. Use this chance to think of how to get out!” Lei Long bellowed.

Probing with their minds revealed nothing about the extent of the blood sea; the invading mist had eroded much of their strength, and their energy fluctuations weakened. If they couldn’t evaporate the sea soon, they might die before it was gone.

“Why don’t you and this kid hold the front and burn a path?” suggested the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox.

“Impossible. The blood sea is very strange—seems to move with us. If we can’t shake it off, we’ll never get out.” Lei Long shook his head and pushed his fire power to the extreme, and together he and Yang Kai vaporized vast swathes of blood.

Hearing this, the others were at a loss and felt even more despairing.

“Wait!” Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit as he remembered something.

Seeing his excited expression, Lei Long called out, “Kid, did you find a way out? If you found something, even if it’s a long shot, we should try—better than waiting here to die!”

“I had the same thought,” Yang Kai replied gravely, looking to Li Rong. “What about that Blood Essence Stone?”

Li Rong froze for a moment, then a peculiar light appeared in her beautiful eyes as she understood Yang Kai’s plan.

She hurriedly took out the Blood Essence Stone from her spatial pouch and handed it over.

The Blood Essence Stone was a product from the starry sky; it could draw in blood and transform it into blood qi usable by anyone—an astonishingly wondrous object.

It originally belonged to Zhang Ao of Poxuan Palace, but after Zhang Ao was killed in the snowy mountains, the Blood Essence Stone changed hands.

The last time it had absorbed much blood to heal members of the Ancient Demon Clan, Li Rong had kept it for safekeeping.

Yang Kai’s mind had a flash as he remembered that such an object existed.

“Blood Essence Stone?” Lei Long said low, “Is it the kind from the starry sky?”

Yang Kai grinned. “You know your stuff, Great Lord.”

Lei Long’s expression brightened and he laughed heartily. “So you actually have one—this could save us.”

“Let’s try.” Yang Kai wasted no more words and poured True Yuan continuously into the Blood Essence Stone. The starry product instantly radiated a dazzling light, and an invisible pulling force spread in all directions. Attracted by this force, the Blood Men encircling them recoiled as if confronted with a terrible thing, roaring and contracting back into the blood sea.

But it was already too late—the Blood Essence Stone’s attraction to blood was something the Blood Men couldn’t resist.

One after another, the Blood Men dissolved into thick blood and, like countless spears, surged toward the Blood Essence Stone.

The stone accepted them without refusal, taking in every drop.

In a short while, within ten zhang around their position, not a drop of blood remained; even the blood that had seeped in was sucked dry by the stone.

The massive attraction continued, drawing the churning blood of the sea toward it.

Seeing this, everyone’s hearts calmed and they involuntarily breathed easier.

They knew this meant they had passed the crisis.

As time passed, the blood light from the Blood Essence Stone grew ever brighter; the fist-sized stone appeared as if formed from gathered blood, its dark crimson hue chilling the heart.

The blood qi contained within was vast beyond imagination.

Yang Kai held it and could even feel rhythmic trembling from within, as if he were holding a heartbeat.

An hour later their vision cleared and the blood sea around them thinned considerably.

Another hour passed, and the blood sea finally vanished.

At that moment the Qi and blood power radiating from the Blood Essence Stone had grown so strong that even the two Great Yao Lords were shaken.

Even if they unleashed all their vitality, they probably couldn’t achieve such abundant Qi and blood power.

“This thing’s powerful—where did you find it?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox asked, clearly interested.

Lei Long chuckled, “Don’t even bother guessing. These come from the starry sky and are rare—this is my first time seeing one too.”

Then, regarding Yang Kai, he said thoughtfully, “Kid, your luck’s something else—you actually obtained a Blood Essence Stone.”

“It's so-so,” Yang Kai replied with a wry smile, turning the stone over in his hand and feeling its heartbeat-like throb.

“Will you sell it? I can offer you a high price.” Lei Long asked.

Yang Kai immediately stored the Blood Essence Stone in his Black Book Space and shook his head decisively.

Lei Long rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine—no need to be so guarded. Would I steal your stuff?”

“Lei Long, why would you buy one of these?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox asked, not understanding the stone’s use.

“What do you know!” Lei Long snorted. “After absorbing blood, it can convert into blood qi usable by anyone, capable of reviving the near-dead and—on the battlefield—drawing blood qi to temporarily boost one’s Qi and blood without aftereffects.”

“That powerful?” The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox’s eyes widened and he looked at Yang Kai with interest, offering a forced chuckle.

“Don’t blame me—no matter how you praise it, I’m not selling,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head like a toy top. “I, the Saint Lord, am not short of worldly wealth.”

Saying so, he ignored them, retrieved the Heavenly Journey Palace from his Black Book Space, sensed the direction it wanted to fly, and signaled, “Let’s move on.”

“This kid…” Lei Long was speechless; he took out some pills to recover his lost strength while they hurried on.

As time passed, the light emitted by the Heavenly Journey Palace grew stronger.

Yang Kai felt his heart stir and increasingly believed Meng Wuya might indeed be here.

If Meng Wuya had only left some trace or aura here to trigger the Heavenly Journey Palace, that reaction wouldn’t change with approach.

The fact that it did change with distance meant Meng Wuya himself was likely in this place.

Yang Kai’s heart brimmed with anticipation and his pace quickened.

A few hours later, when the Heavenly Journey Palace’s light brightened, it suddenly unleashed a powerful force, broke free of Yang Kai’s restraint, transformed into a streak of light darting forward, and in an instant disappeared.
