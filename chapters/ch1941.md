## Chapter 1941 — Get Out If You Don't Want to Die

Yang Kai was calm and unafraid, instead breaking into a grin as he said, "Kill me and you'll probably be unable to answer for it!"

"A mere prisoner under custody, what right have you to haggle with me? I'll kill you, and no one will care!" Yan Xiuran spat.

Yang Kai spat a mouthful of blood, then said, "Senior Brother Kou said he would go ask Protector Bian how to deal with us. Tell me, if Protector Bian learns you killed me, what fate will you face?"

At the sound of the name Protector Bian, a deep dread flashed across Yan Xiuran's eyes, and his fury, which had been boiling, was suddenly doused as if with a bucket of cold water.

The gamble had paid off!

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai felt much more at ease.

Judging from the way the few disciples of the Biyu Sect he had encountered behaved, this sect did not seem like a good one; its cultivators were not decent people, and their rules must be extraordinarily strict — once violated, the punishment would be brutal.

That was why Yang Kai had brazenly used the name of the Protector Bian he never met as his banner.

Yan Xiuran was indeed taken aback.

As Yang Kai had said, if he slew Yang Kai before Protector Bian's orders were issued, it would be a grave overstep; should Protector Bian discover it, even if he did not die he would be flayed for it.

So he dared not strike a killing blow.

But since the Treasure-Stealing Serpent had been killed by Yang Kai's bite, he was unlikely to stop there; after a brief hesitation Yan Xiuran snarled and lunged again at Yang Kai, saying, "You talk well, brat. Rest assured, if Protector Bian wants you dead, I will personally send you on your way — but I'll let you cling to life for a few days first!"

Yang Kai curled his lips in contempt.

"But for now... you may be spared death, yet you will not escape a fate worse than death. Your bodily constitution seems anything but ordinary — let's see if you can endure this strike!"

With that he rushed to Yang Kai's side; his fist gathered burning rage and Origin Qi, and he slammed it into Yang Kai's abdomen.

Boom...

Yang Kai felt as if struck by thunder; his whole body bent like a shrimp, convulsing in pain. Even before that, he had spat a mouthful of blood, which sprayed toward Yan Xiuran like a sudden squall.

The latter, unprepared, had his face splattered with the mess.

Provoked time and again by such taunts, he could no longer hold back and almost instinctively lifted a leg, wildly sweeping at Yang Kai's neck.

The next moment Yang Kai was hurled outward, landing on the ground, motionless.

It looked as if he had fainted.

"Lucky for you!" Yan Xiuran snorted coldly, then turned and glared viciously at Liu Qianyun, barking, "Drag him over and come with me!"

Now that the Treasure-Stealing Serpent was dead, even if Yan Xiuran wanted to seize Liu Qianyun's Secret Treasure it would be difficult; he could only lock the two of them in the Bone Prison first and then think of ways to torment them.

Liu Qianyun hurried to Yang Kai's side, reached out to test his pulse, and, after confirming he was still alive, let out a light breath.

After a moment she hoisted Yang Kai up and carried him on her back.

They followed behind Yan Xiuran into a cave beneath the mountain peak; immediately a sinister chill crept over them, making Liu Qianyun instinctively draw in her neck.

Within the mountain's belly, faint, harrowing screams echoed — bone-chilling to the ear.

Yan Xiuran led the way, sneering as he walked, “Once thrown into the Bone Prison, few ever come out alive. If you don’t want to suffer inhuman indignities, hand the Secret Treasures over to me now — I can make them give you a taste of mercy. If you refuse… you’ll learn what it means to be worse than dead!”

Liu Qianyun's face drained of color, her slight body trembling; she bit her bloodless lip and said nothing.

The deeper they went, the darker and damper it became, and a foul stench filled the air, making Liu Qianyun frown.

They descended for what seemed a full thousand zhang before arriving at a place like a dungeon.

The cells were partitioned off by bars that appeared to be fashioned from the bones of demonic beasts, looking exceptionally sturdy.

In the dim cells, blood-red eyes glowed like a pack of beasts, staring intently at Yan Xiuran and the others, which made Liu Qianyun shudder.

"Kill me, kill me, please kill me!" a miserable wail came from somewhere — an absolute longing for death. Liu Qianyun could not imagine what tortures had driven that person to crave only death.

Yet in this place death was clearly a luxury; that voice soon turned into an even more piercing shriek.

Liu Qianyun's cheeks were already deathly pale; sensing that this might be her eventual fate, sorrow welled up inside her.

"Get in!" Yan Xiuran suddenly stopped at a cell, opened the door, and motioned to Liu Qianyun.

Liu Qianyun dared not disobey; carrying Yang Kai on her back, she stepped into that cell.

Yan Xiuran shut the cell door tight, then sneered and patted the bone bars, saying in a sinister tone, "Two newcomers — make sure to entertain them properly."

With that he turned and left.

Meanwhile, the cell that had been silent suddenly lit up with several blood-red eyes.

Liu Qianyun jumped in fright; only then did she notice the cell actually held four people — she had failed to detect them upon first entering.

"Huh? A woman?" a delighted shout rang out; the imprisoned warrior sniffed and clearly caught the faint scent about Liu Qianyun, becoming instantly excited.

"A woman? Hahaha! Brothers, we're in luck!" someone laughed uproariously.

The words spread and caused a commotion in the neighboring cells; countless prisoners crowded to the bars, leering at Liu Qianyun and making lascivious sounds, as if anticipating something.

Liu Qianyun's expression hardened; she moved back to the farthest corner, leaning against the wall and watching the front with wary eyes.

Inside the cell, a hulking man rose slowly to his feet; he was at least two zhang tall, his massive frame exuding an oppressive force. Though his power had been suppressed, a bestial ferocity still emanated from him.

"This woman — I'll take her!" the hulking man said calmly, his voice carrying an irresistible authority.

The other three men hesitated; one of them, with a sycophantic tone, said, "Since First Brother has spoken, we must show some respect. After First Brother has finished, well... heh heh heh."

"Then do as you please afterwards!" First Brother said coldly.

"Thank you, First Brother!" the three men hurriedly said, stepping back with leering smiles, awaiting the show.

The man called First Brother stared at Liu Qianyun until, aided by the dim light, he could finally make out her features; he nodded, "Not bad — a genuine beauty. The sons of the Biyu Sect finally did something right."

"What do you intend to do?" Liu Qianyun asked with a composed face, her phoenix-like eyes flashing as she fixed him with a stare.

She did not panic — here, reason was useless; only strength held sway.

With everyone's power sealed, they could rely only on their bodies; facing that iron-plank physique, Liu Qianyun felt the pressure like a mountain.

"What do I want, don't you know?" First Brother snorted, not taking the slight Liu Qianyun seriously. "If you do not want to suffer, then obediently enjoy yourself!"

"Hahahaha — First Brother's words are entertaining. Little girl, I advise you not to anger First Brother; his skill in the Body Refining Technique is profound. Your frail body cannot match him; if you cannot resist, then just enjoy it — are you afraid First Brother won't satisfy you?" another man jeered.

"Disgusting, filthy!" Liu Qianyun ground her teeth and cursed.

"Hey — calling him that will only stir his beastly lust! Better to keep silent," Yang Kai's voice came from behind.

Liu Qianyun was startled, then overjoyed, crying out, "You're awake?"

“Oh, I wasn't knocked out!” Yang Kai said, springing down from Liu Qianyun's back. He rubbed his forehead and abdomen, baring his teeth in a grimace. “That bastard hit hard—nearly crippled me. Damn him, I'll make him regret it later.”

Liu Qianyun stared at Yang Kai in stunned admiration — his claim of not having been knocked out shocked her.

What kind of freak was this man? An attack like Yan Xiuran's hadn't even rendered him unconscious; how great must his endurance be?

Lost in thought, she even forgot the danger surrounding them.

"Oh? There's a lover?" First Brother stood three zhang away, looking down from above, his narrowed eyes full of contempt and ridicule.

"Heh, friend, you joke. I'm only a friend to this young lady," Yang Kai explained.

First Brother snorted, "Whether you are her friend or her lover, I warn you: get out if you don't want to die!"

"You're arrogant!" Yang Kai looked up at the hulking man, his eyes half-lidded. "In that case, I'll warn you too — get out if you don't want to die!"

The very same words were returned verbatim.

Silence fell over the cell.

The three men lurking in the dark gaped at Yang Kai as if at a corpse; one of them suddenly came to his senses and cried, "Bad — retreat! First Brother's wrath is terrifying when roused!"

The other two shivered and fear showed in their eyes; recalling unpleasant memories, they hurriedly backed to the outermost part of the cell.

First Brother finally let out a cold chuckle, "You're amusing, but... angering me does you no good. I'll give you a chance to live: kneel before me and lick the filth from my shoe clean, and I will spare your life. If not, on this day next year it will be your death anniversary!"
