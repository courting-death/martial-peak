## Chapter 42 — That Day… Ahem… You Touched Her?

Su Mu’s face flushed red as he shot a fierce glare at Yang Kai, then planted himself firmly before him, his cold gaze fixed on Yang Kai. Yet, within that look was a complex mixture—admiration, reluctance, regret, and a hint of relief.

“Give me the stuff.” Suddenly, Su Mu reached back, and Li Yuntian quickly handed over two jars of wine.

Su Mu took them, keeping one for himself and stuffing the other into Yang Kai’s hands without a word. Without hesitation, he tore open the seal and began to gulp down the wine.

Passersby in Lingxiao Pavilion were dumbfounded, staring blankly at Su Mu. What madness had seized him this early in the morning to start drinking here?

Yang Kai smiled faintly and also tore open his jar, drinking deeply.

“Good!” Li Yuntian shouted from behind Su Mu.

“Good!” others cheered in support.

Suddenly, two sharp sounds pierced the air as both Yang Kai’s and Su Mu’s wine jars shattered simultaneously, drenching their robes with spilled wine.

“Drunkenness in broad daylight, disgracing the sect’s reputation! Considering this is your first offense, five Contribution Points will be deducted from each of you. Should there be a next time, severe punishment will follow without mercy!” A Shadow Hall Disciple appeared coldly from the side, his tone icy and ruthless.

“Deduct away!” Yang Kai showed a carefree expression. A month ago, he might have agonized over this, but now, he simply did not care.

If Yang Kai was indifferent, would Su Mu, a second-generation scion, care? He had powerful backing; Contribution Points were worthless to him.

“Zhao Hu, help Senior Brother Yang sweep the ground.” Su Mu waved to Zhao Hu.

“Understood.” Zhao Hu, who had been knocked down by Yang Kai in three moves not long ago, hurried forward and took the broom from Yang Kai’s hands.

“This isn’t right.” Yang Kai glanced at the Shadow Hall Disciple, who merely snorted coldly and turned away.

“Come, to your little room. I have something to tell you.” Su Mu said.

Beside the small hut, Su Mu and Yang Kai squatted on the ground without any pretense, facing a small pond. Behind them, a group bustled energetically, repairing the hole in Yang Kai’s roof.

It seemed that after the events of that day, Su Mu’s group had completely let go of their grudges against Yang Kai. Not only had they let go, but they also wished to befriend him.

“Why did you save us?” After a long silence, Su Mu finally asked.

“Why...” Yang Kai frowned slightly. “You call me Senior Brother, so naturally I must behave like one. That’s probably the reason.”

Of course, the main reason was that Su Mu’s nature was not truly malicious.

Su Mu turned his head and looked deeply at Yang Kai. “Really?”

Yang Kai smiled. “What do you think?”

Su Mu fell silent, feeling somewhat awkward. After a moment, he said, “Fine, if you consider us your juniors, then we will regard you as our Senior Brother. The past was my fault for being short-sighted. I apologize, Senior Brother.”

“I never minded.” Yang Kai replied.

They exchanged a glance and burst into hearty laughter.

A single laugh could erase all grudges—that was the essence of their reconciliation.

With the enmity set aside, Su Mu no longer felt awkward or restrained. He sincerely treated Yang Kai as his Senior Brother. After some lighthearted chatter, Su Mu suddenly licked his lips, his face flushing red as he stammered, “Senior Brother, I want to ask you something.”

“What?” Yang Kai looked at him curiously.

“That day… ahem… did you touch her?”

“Touch what?” Yang Kai did not understand.

“That thing.”

“Which thing?”

Su Mu frowned in frustration, then bit his lip and said, “Hu Mei’er…”

As he spoke, he even grabbed at his own chest, a comical gesture.

Yang Kai chuckled silently. Indeed, youthful curiosity was boundless. Su Mu had the audacity to ask such a thing—it was shameless.

“Didn’t you all see it?”

“I didn’t see clearly… Did you really touch her?” Su Mu’s mouth opened wide in astonishment.

“So what if I did?” Yang Kai grinned. “She put my hand there herself. I was just teaching her a lesson.”

Su Mu swallowed hard, eyes full of anticipation. “What did it feel like?”

“Haven’t you tried, Junior Brother?” Yang Kai looked at Su Mu in puzzlement, wondering if this second-generation scion was still an innocent virgin.

Su Mu shook his head vigorously like a rattle-drum, suspiciously asking, “Senior Brother, you’ve tried before?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned thoughtful. A faint smile crossed his lips as he recalled a face both teasing and joyful. He sighed softly, “Ah, those past events are best left unspoken.”

Su Mu was stunned, catching the implication. He curled his lips and said, “You must be bluffing. You joined the sect three years ago and haven’t socialized since. Where would you have had the chance? If anything, it would have been before then. How old were you three years ago?”

Twelve!

At twelve, that enchantress had dared make a move on him. If she hadn’t been only fifteen and both had not been so naive, who knew what might have happened.

Thinking of that enchantress, Yang Kai felt a pang of melancholy. He wondered how she was faring now.

“But you better be careful, Senior Brother. Hu Mei’er is quite proud. You’ve embarrassed her this time; she won’t let it go easily.” Su Mu warned.

“Is she going to come after me?” Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

Su Mu smiled meaningfully. “Yes, in bed. Just watch, she’ll try every trick to seduce you. She won’t rest until she succeeds. Senior Brother, you have quite the romantic fortune.”

“That kind of person doesn’t interest me.” Yang Kai dismissed the matter lightly and looked at Su Mu. “You said you had something to tell me. Was it this?”

“Of course not.” Su Mu straightened his expression and said, “Senior Brother, you spent a lot of precious Yuan Qi dealing with Cheng Shaofeng and the others. I just want to compensate you.”

“Compensate me?”

“Mm.” Su Mu nodded, then pulled a bottle from his bosom and handed it to Yang Kai. “This is a bottle of Minor Recovery Pills. Take it, and it should help replenish your lost Yuan Qi.”

Yang Kai had heard of Minor Recovery Pills before. Their effect was not strong but gentle, mainly aimed at warriors around the Body Tempering Realm, Stage Seven.

From Stage Seven to Nine of Body Tempering, although warriors generate Yuan Qi and can slowly increase it through martial arts practice, they cannot recover it quickly without reaching the Open Origin Realm. Thus, Yuan Qi is precious. Once lost, it takes great effort to regain. Minor Recovery Pills can significantly reduce the time needed to recover, making them popular and valuable among Stage Seven to Nine Body Tempering warriors. However, they have no effect on warriors above the Open Origin Realm.

Yang Kai’s situation was somewhat different. His cultivation of the True Yang Technique meant he need not worry about his internal Yuan Qi. Even if it were depleted, he still had Yang Liquid. So this bottle of Minor Recovery Pills was of little value to him.

Just as he was about to refuse, Su Mu seemed to see through his thoughts and said seriously, “I don’t want to owe anyone a favor.”

“Alright then, I’ll accept it.” Yang Kai did not bother to be polite.

Su Mu smiled. “Senior Brother, wait here tomorrow. I’ll take you to a good place.”

“What place?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

Su Mu smiled without answering, only telling him to wait and promising he would not be disappointed.
