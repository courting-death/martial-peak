## Chapter 1110 — Qian Tong's Recruitment

Young men like praise and flattery; Qian Tong thought that given his status and cultivation, a few lavish compliments should have made the youth beam with delight.

To his surprise, Yang Kai remained completely unmoved, as if such praise were his due; he showed no hint of modesty, sitting there boldly and motionless.

Qian Tong gave a light cough, his expression unchanged, and continued asking, “May I ask where Nephew Yang is currently employed?”

Yang Kai smiled. From the moment he entered and saw how warmly Qian Tong treated him, Yang Kai had vaguely guessed his intentions; hearing the question now only confirmed that suspicion. Looking at Qian Tong, Yang Kai said, "Elder Qian, if you have something to say, you may speak plainly."

Qian Tong's face grew serious, but his tone remained genial. "Do not take offense, nephew—this old man bears no ill will. A talent like you appearing before me stirs my desire to extend an invitation. If you are willing, I would like to invite you to join my Yingyue Hall. I can guarantee the most abundant cultivation supplies and the finest training environment. With your aptitude, you will surely achieve great things within the Sect!"

He observed that Yang Kai was not one for beating around the bush and was quite straightforward, so he stopped probing and immediately laid out his terms.

Qian Tong was worldly and cunning; he knew that if he opened by trying to recruit the artificer behind Yang Kai it would likely be impossible. Artificers of that caliber are proud and not easily swayed by a few words, so he chose instead to target Yang Kai.

He reasoned that if Yang Kai entered Yingyue Hall, the master behind him would inevitably form some tie with Yingyue Hall whether or not he was directly recruited, and once familiar relations were established a formal invitation would be easy to extend.

It must be said—Qian Tong had thought this through well.

After speaking, he quietly gauged Yang Kai's reaction. To his disappointment, Yang Kai remained indifferent.

He inwardly sighed; no wonder this young man associated with an Origin-Grade artificer—the constant exposure had raised the youth's standards. Whether or not Yang Kai was the master's disciple was unknown, but his eye for quality was clearly high; Qian Tong's hollow promises did not tempt him. Very well—time for a stronger bait.

"Moreover, our Yingyue Hall's main hall houses a Divine Stone of wondrous use. Anyone who touches it will be guided into a peculiar world where the mind can be purified and elevated; it greatly aids in breaking through martial bottlenecks. Many of our disciples, when stalled in their cultivations, request meditative retreats by that stone. But only those who have made significant contributions to the Sect may enjoy that privilege. If you are willing to join Yingyue Hall, I will vouch for you and arrange for you to sit by the Divine Stone to gain insight—before long you should be able to breakthrough to the Saint King Realm."

Having said that, Qian Tong stared at Yang Kai with burning eyes. He was certain these terms would be irresistible.

After all, Yang Kai's cultivation was teetering at the brink of a breakthrough; with such an opportunity before him, anyone would seize it.

But soon Qian Tong's expression changed—Yang Kai still showed no stirring. He was stunned. Perhaps the youth did not know the value of the Divine Stone. Just as he prepared to elaborate on its wonders, Yang Kai waved his hand, growing impatient: "Elder Qian, your kindness is appreciated, but I'm used to freedom and idleness—I have no intention of joining any force, so I must refuse your offer. Let's keep to business and skip the rest."

Qian Tong's face twitched; after a moment he forced out a dry chuckle. "Very well—business it is. Old man talks too much; Nephew Yang, please forgive me."

Although his recruitment failed this time, Qian Tong was patient and not easily disheartened; he believed that with enough sincerity he would succeed one day.

The two sat and immediately began discussing business.

Seven Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures, for a total price of fifty-nine thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals! Qian Tong named the price without hesitation, and Yang Kai accepted it just as straightforwardly.

In no time at all the deal was done.

"I also want to buy some ore material." Yang Kai took out a list from his Spatial Ring.

Qian Tong's eyes brightened; the disappointment in his heart vanished. He shouted to the attendant who had stood guard outside the door. The attendant immediately entered and asked respectfully, "Elder Qian, any orders?"

“Here’s a list from Nephew Yang. Help him select the ores he needs, and also take out fifty-nine thousand pieces of Upper-Level Saint Crystals from the storeroom.”

"Yes!" The attendant took the list.

Yang Kai told him, "Deduct the cost of the ore from those Saint Crystals. Take whatever is necessary and report the total to me later."

"At the most favorable price, understood?" Qian Tong added solemnly.

Sometimes one must voice goodwill so others can hear it.

"Understood." The attendant nodded and left at once.

After he left, Qian Tong smiled and looked at Yang Kai. "Nephew Yang, you are a frequent patron—will that satisfy you?"

"It will." Yang Kai smiled and nodded. Whatever schemes Qian Tong had, the previous trades had not shortchanged him, so he was satisfied. "Elder Qian, I will wait here; attend to your affairs."

Qian Tong smiled and didn't press further, speaking kindly, "Very well, but remember—if you ever have Secret Treasures to sell again, give us first priority."

"I will."

Only then did Qian Tong take his leave.

Yang Kai waited in that inner chamber for about half an hour before the attendant led him into another secure room piled with all manner of rare ores and countless Saint Crystals.

Having already received Qian Tong’s instructions, the attendant naturally didn’t dare show the slightest negligence toward Yang Kai. With great respect, he said, “These ores are exactly what you requested, honored guest. The total comes to seventeen thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Since you’re a regular customer, I’ve given you a twenty percent discount, making it thirteen thousand six hundred. After deducting the cost of the ores, the remaining forty-five thousand four hundred Saint Crystals are all here. Would you like me to count them for you?”

"No need." Yang Kai shook his head, inwardly surprised at the ore prices.

The last time he bought ore it was only a little over three thousand Saint Crystals; this time it was several times that amount—no wonder Yang Yan said he'd take a heavy hit.

He trusted the attendant; the shop wouldn't pull tricks, and besides Qian Tong was still after the artificer behind him.

Releasing his Divine Sense, he gathered the ores and Saint Crystals into his Spatial Ring, leaving only one hundred Saint Crystals untouched.

The attendant beamed with gratitude, respectfully seeing Yang Kai out. Neither mentioned the one hundred Saint Crystals.

On the third floor of the market, Qian Tong watched Yang Kai's figure disappear from sight and frowned; he did not know how to bring Yang Kai into Yingyue Hall. He had tried twice today and failed. This young man had unknown tastes—if only he knew them it would be easier. He couldn't send someone to tail him either; the matter troubled him.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Come in!" Qian Tong sat back down.

The attendant entered and reported immediately, "Elder, when that man left he left one hundred Saint Crystals for your subordinate."

"Oh?" Qian Tong looked surprised. "Did you accept them?"

"Yes, I did not refuse. He did not state his intention outright, but I knew he left them for me. Elder, if you think it improper I can return them now." He watched Qian Tong carefully, afraid the elder would be angered.

Qian Tong waved him off. "Don't! If he left them, accept them graciously. This young man likes straightforward gestures—if you were to refuse out of false modesty, he might not be pleased. Next time he comes to buy ore, give him a little extra, and quietly let him know—understood?"

"Understood."

"By the way, what ore did he buy this time? Same as before?"

The attendant shook his head at once. "He bought seventeen thousand worth of ore in Upper-Level Saint Crystals; per your instruction I gave him twenty percent off, so I charged him..."

"Seventeen thousand?" Qian Tong's face changed, as if he realized something, and he hurriedly asked, "Were they Origin-Grade ores?"

"Yes."

Qian Tong's expression shifted and then he burst into loud laughter. "Excellent, excellent—so it is, so it is..."

He grew excited and paced the room repeatedly. The attendant was bewildered; he had never seen the elder so joyful since the time the elder had broken through the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

After a moment, Qian Tong produced a clean white jade piece, poured his Divine Sense into it, and tossed it to the attendant. "Send the word: in Tianyun City, all managers of Yingyue Hall's shops must remember this man's face. If he comes to any shop, receive him wholeheartedly; don't make it too obvious, but give him whatever discounts you can. If anyone foolishly offends him, I'll make them regret being born into this world!"

At the last threat Qian Tong's aura chilled. The attendant nervously took the jade and examined it; within it was an imprint of Yang Kai's appearance—clearly Qian Tong had used his Divine Sense to seal it.

Holding the jade, he immediately went out to notify every Yingyue Hall manager in Tianyun City, without daring delay.

After the attendant left, Qian Tong swept the seven Secret Treasures on the table into his Spatial Ring, then hurried off to Master Gelin's residence.

He intended to tell Master Gelin that matters were indeed as he had suspected: Yang Kai truly had an Origin-Grade artificer behind him.

They had suspected before and knew the first Secret Treasure Yang Kai brought had been crafted by an Origin-Grade artificer, but they could not be certain such an artificer actually existed; perhaps that Treasure had been obtained by chance.
