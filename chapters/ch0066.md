## Chapter 66 — Please Bestow Your Instruction

Seeing Li Yuntian and the others kneel to the ground, Wei Zhuang’s face grew even more triumphant as he laughed heartily, “Merely kneeling does not show true sincerity!”

Li Yuntian and the others’ faces turned ashen. Gritting their teeth, they prostrated themselves with their heads pressed to the earth, their voices filled with boundless solemnity, “Senior Brother Wei, please show mercy!”

Wei Zhuang’s eyes narrowed, his smile fading. The righteous loyalty of Li Yuntian and his companions stirred a rare emotion within him.

“Wei Zhuang!” Su Mu swallowed a mouthful of blood, “Between us, there shall be no peace!”

“Just as I intended!” Wei Zhuang clasped his hands together and suddenly struck Su Mu’s chest with brutal force.

With a thunderous sound, Su Mu spat a mouthful of fresh blood and immediately fainted from the pain.

“Young Master Su!” Li Yuntian and the others roared in fury, utterly shocked that Wei Zhuang would break his word so openly before so many witnesses.

“Leave not a single one alive!” Wei Zhuang snarled viciously as he rose from Su Mu’s body and delivered a merciless kick, as if dispatching a dead dog.

The Lingxiao Pavilion disciples who had confronted Li Yuntian and his group sneered coldly and surged forward, positioning themselves before Li Yuntian’s group and demanding a challenge!

Li Yuntian and his companions were filled with rage, unsure how to vent it, but the opponents had just handed them the opportunity—how could they refuse?

This was an open declaration of a group fight, though each side had fixed opponents to face.

Wei Zhuang sneered, looking at Li Yuntian and the others with scorn, “Whoever dares disobey, beat them to death! If anyone dies, it’s on me!”

He made it clear he intended to teach this group who followed Su Mu a harsh lesson, to show them the consequences of choosing the wrong side.

Because Yang Kai was close to Li Yuntian and the others, he too caught the attention of one of Wei Zhuang’s subordinates. The man darted in front of him, only announcing his name before launching an attack without waiting for Yang Kai’s reaction.

Yang Kai delivered a thunderous kick to the man’s abdomen, forcing him to crouch down immediately.

He deserved his misfortune; his cultivation was barely at Body Tempering Realm, the stage far below the standard to challenge Yang Kai. Yet he had brought this upon himself.

Weaving through the chaotic battlefield, Yang Kai steadily advanced toward Su Mu.

“Hm?” Wei Zhuang narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Yang Kai with a flicker of doubt.

He knew exactly how many subordinates Su Mu had and who they were, but Yang Kai was unfamiliar to him, leaving Wei Zhuang uncertain of his identity.

Yang Kai remained silent, his face cold as he approached Su Mu and reached out to test his breath. Finding Su Mu merely unconscious, he felt somewhat relieved.

“Who are you?” Wei Zhuang immediately showed displeasure. He and Su Mu were at odds, and this man dared to examine Su Mu’s condition right before his eyes, clearly showing no respect.

Yang Kai stood upright and quietly faced Wei Zhuang.

“I asked who you are,” Wei Zhuang raised his chin, his tone stern and severe.

“I am Trial Disciple Yang Kai, please bestow your instruction!” Yang Kai cupped his fist toward Wei Zhuang, observing the customary challenge etiquette among Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.

“Yang Kai?” Wei Zhuang was momentarily stunned, then realization dawned, “You are the Yang Kai who has been making waves these days?”

“I dare not claim such, but if there is no other Yang Kai in the sect, then that must be me.”

“Ridiculous! A mere Trial Disciple dares to challenge me, the Young Master! Do you have the qualifications?” Wei Zhuang sneered.

“The sect’s rules state that disciples may challenge each other as long as their cultivation difference is less than three stages.”

“I am Open Origin Realm, third stage. What are you?” Wei Zhuang looked down on him. Trial Disciples, by definition, had not yet broken through to Open Origin Realm. Without that breakthrough, they were certainly more than three stages below him.

“I am also Open Origin Realm, third stage,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

A chorus of surprised murmurs arose.

“Impossible, Yang Kai is already Open Origin Realm, third stage?”

“Wasn’t he only at Body Tempering Realm, third stage, after three years? Did he misspeak? Or did I misremember?”

“Strange, when Yang Kai challenged me not long ago, he was only at Body Tempering Realm, eighth stage. How did he reach this level in less than a month?”

Questions and doubts flew thick.

Wei Zhuang eyed Yang Kai suspiciously, as if weighing whether he was telling the truth. If he truly had reached Open Origin Realm, why was he still a Trial Disciple?

Little did he know that Yang Kai had only just broken through the previous night, leaping directly from Body Tempering Realm, ninth stage, to this level.

“Now I have the qualification to challenge you, correct?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, a fierce light flickering within.

“If you truly possess that strength, then yes, you have the qualification,” Wei Zhuang nodded, sneering, “If you are not afraid to court death!”

Yang Kai’s voice was cold, “I hope you are not afraid to die either!”

“Arrogant beyond measure!” Wei Zhuang’s fury flared. He thought to himself that clad in his defensive treasure, even a peak Open Origin Realm warrior could not break through his defense, making him virtually invincible. How could a mere Open Origin Realm, third stage disciple defeat him?

“Come, I’ll let you throw a punch and see!” Wei Zhuang arrogantly beckoned Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not hesitate. He charged forward and struck a punch directly into Wei Zhuang’s chest.

Blazing True Yang Primordial Qi surged forth, yet it failed to harm Wei Zhuang in the slightest. Instead, Yang Kai’s body trembled, staggering back several steps. Looking down, he saw his fist glowing a deep red—clearly, his own qi had rebounded and injured him.

“Haha! Overestimating yourself!” Wei Zhuang’s pride swelled. But before he could finish, his expression suddenly changed. Yang Kai’s eyes had turned red, and a fierce wave of qi radiated from him, burning hot.

There was no trace of retreat or fear in those eyes, only an unbearable excitement. They resembled the gaze of a ferocious beast, spotting prey it was eager to devour.

Without warning, Wei Zhuang’s heart skipped a beat as Yang Kai lunged forward with a savage grin. A drop of Yang Liquid quietly appeared at his fingertip, shaping into a thin, blood-red blade as delicate as a cicada’s wing.

The crimson light flashed, accompanied by a faint slicing sound as Yang Kai and Wei Zhuang’s figures crossed paths.

Wei Zhuang felt a chill in his abdomen. Looking down, his heart sank to the depths as he screamed hoarsely, “My Xiuyun Chainmail!”

This close-fitting Xiuyun Chainmail was a Common-Grade, Middle-Level defensive treasure. Though not high in rank, it was perfectly suited for a warrior of his realm. The Grand Elder had obtained it from an unknown source and bestowed it upon him, explicitly stating that Open Origin Realm warriors generally could not break through its defense unless wielding a weapon of immense destructive power.

Yet now, this treasure he had pinned his hopes on was cut open in a single exchange by a mere Open Origin Realm, third stage Trial Disciple.

What weapon had he just used? Could that blood-red weapon also be a treasure? And of a rank higher than the Xiuyun Chainmail? Otherwise, how could it have such a shocking effect?
