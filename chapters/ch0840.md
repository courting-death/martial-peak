## Chapter 840 — The Kid Shows Promise

If Yan Zhi had ever been to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, or had seen the Saint Lord's methods, he would have recognized those two martial skills at once.

The Nether Heaven Lock and the Heaven-Slaying Spear.

Each one was a divine technique.

The former could not only bind the flesh but could ensnare the soul as well, while the Heaven-Slaying Spear carried devastating power unmatched by ordinary weapons.

Yan Zhi had no idea how dangerous they were; after a Nether Heaven Lock grazed his body, his Divine Sense immediately grew heavy, his reactions dulled, and the ground beneath him clung like a quagmire.

Chains and spears whirled through the air, closing in from every direction until there was no escape.

Yan Zhi twisted and dodged, but he could not break the encirclement. Panic rising, he realized the shrunk golden dragon had already closed in, spraying a gout of searing energy right at his face. Yan Zhi cried out and pushed his True Yuan to defend; his bones cracked and popped under the pressure, as if they could not endure the crushing force, and then suddenly burst.

The golden dragon thrust both wicked claws forward, taking advantage of Yan Zhi's faltering defense to gouge into his chest and tear savagely to either side.

Yan Zhi's eyes were about to burst with fury as the reek of death descended upon him. Knowing there was no escape, he gritted his teeth and roared, "You won't get off easy either!"

His True Yuan erupted in full, breaking into countless close-range strikes that battered the dragon's body.

It was as if he had drained himself dry to release that one blow; after, Yan Zhi cackled with a feral grin, his body collapsing like a deflated hide, wasting away rapidly.

Blood that glinted with gold sprayed in all directions, and the dragon's roar rolled out, deafening anyone nearby.

Splatter—

Yan Zhi was ripped cleanly in two; blood and entrails scattered everywhere. The sight was horrific.

Hearing the dragon's roar, the other warriors looked up and beheld that ghastly scene.

"The sect master is dead?" The fighters from Youhan Grotto-Heaven stared numb at the falling blood and flesh, stunned and unable to accept such an outcome.

An hour earlier Yan Zhi had been high-spirited, leading them to attack Dragon-Phoenix Palace, boasting he would seize the one who had inherited the Dragon Emperor's legacy and bring them back to raise and glorify Youhan Grotto-Heaven.

No one expected that an hour later he would be torn in half by a suddenly appearing golden dragon.

A powerhouse who had reached the Saint Realm—dead just like that!

On Tongxuan Continent there weren't many experts of that caliber; each had cultivated for at least a hundred or two hundred years to reach such a height. They possessed astounding techniques and escape arts, so deaths of Saint Realm experts were rare.

At least among the forces of Dragon-Phoenix Palace and Youhan Grotto-Heaven, incidents like this were unheard of.

Yet now that very scene unfolded plainly before their eyes.

One of Youhan Grotto-Heaven's only two Saint Realm masters was dead, while the other was gasping from having an arm torn off by Dragon-Phoenix Palace's lord. The warriors of Youhan Grotto-Heaven lost their fighting spirit in an instant and no longer pressed the attack.

Another dragon cry echoed through the air. The ten-odd zhang-long golden dragon howled to the sky, seemingly venting the pain of its wounds while also putting on a display of dominance.

Bai Jingchu's face went pale; who would dare continue to fight Chen Zhou?

Although Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi were both at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, Yan Zhi had clearly been the stronger of the two. If Yan Zhi couldn't stand up to that dragon, Bai Jingchu certainly lacked the ability.

"Retreat!" Bai Jingchu shouted angrily and withdrew.

"Do you think our Dragon-Phoenix Palace is a place you can come and leave at will?" Chen Zhou sneered, striking down as Bai Jingchu fled.

Blood sprayed; Bai Jingchu disappeared, leaving only half an arm that exploded into a mist of gore in midair.

Chen Zhou stood where he was, breathing hard, and did not pursue.

He had suffered severe wounds earlier and had been forcing himself to fight because the might of the Dragon Emperor manifested; now he had reached the end of his strength.

The Youhan Grotto-Heaven fighters, seeing Bai Jingchu flee, panicked and scattered like stray dogs. Dragon-Phoenix Palace's people pursued, and the gap between them grew.

Only then did Chen Zhou have time to glance at the golden giant that signified the Dragon Emperor's identity; his expression was solemn and full of reverence.

But Chen Zhou soon noticed something odd: after tearing Yan Zhi apart the golden dragon had remained motionless, its dragon eyes betraying a contemplative expression, as if savoring the fight and drawing insight from it.

Chen Zhou shook his head and assumed it was his imagination.

After a long while the golden dragon moved again, condensing into a streak of gold and shooting toward Sun Yu before vanishing behind him.

At the same time, the Milky Way barrier that had stretched between Sun Yu and Ling Jian was withdrawn.

Chen Zhou straightened his face and, gathering what energy he had left, flew toward Sun Yu. Before he could speak, Sun Yu respectfully saluted and said, "Palace Master!"

Ling Jian hurriedly returned the salute as well.

Chen Zhou chuckled hoarsely, "No need for such formality. Now that you are the Dragon Emperor of our palace, it should be I who pay respects to you — your humility flatters me."

Sun Yu grew crimson with embarrassment, scratching his head and stammering, unsure what to say.

His own people knew their affairs. Sun Yu had only shown up briefly earlier; the killing of Yan Zhi was entirely thanks to Senior Yang, and Sun Yu had nothing to do with it.

Moreover, Senior Yang had let his secret treasure keep watch over him during the battle.

Chen Zhou smiled as he looked at Sun Yu; the more he saw, the more he liked him, mistaking the Dragon Emperor's reserved manner for true modesty, which pleased him.

"Thank you, Your Majesty the Dragon Emperor, for saving my wife's life. If you hadn't come in time, Tingyi would have—" Chen Zhou said, face still pale with fear; if not for that silver leaf wrapping Yu Tingyi, Yan Zhi would surely have killed her.

To Chen Zhou, Yu Tingyi was his lifelong companion, someone he valued above his own life.

Sun Yu's saving of Yu Tingyi filled Chen Zhou with deep gratitude.

"It's nothing, it's nothing..." Sun Yu waved his hand repeatedly, feeling awkward and embarrassed.

Seeing him so bashful, Chen Zhou laughed and instructed, "The Dragon Emperor has just been through a great battle and must be exhausted. Elder Ling, see the Dragon Emperor back to the palace to rest; we'll handle the aftermath here."

"Yes!" Ling Jian responded respectfully and escorted Sun Yu back toward Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

As they flew, Sun Yu kept glancing around, his expression uneasy.

Suddenly Ling Jian could not contain his laughter: "Heh heh, heh heh heh..."

"Master, why are you laughing?" Sun Yu asked, puzzled.

"Kid, you've got promise... a Saint Realm expert got killed just like that. I thought we were done for this time," Ling Jian said, laughing freely; he was not as ceremonious toward Sun Yu as Chen Zhou had been — after all, Sun Yu was his disciple from childhood.

"Master... let's not talk about that for now," Sun Yu blushed.

"Alright, not talking, not talking," Ling Jian quickly agreed, then sobered and said, "But the Dragon Emperor inheritance is truly formidable. You're only at the Seventh Stage of Divine Roaming and yet you can kill a Saint Realm expert. If you reach the Saint Realm, will you not be unrivaled? Then our Dragon-Phoenix Palace will be the strongest force in the world, and your master can share the glory."

Ling Jian spoke to himself with excitement, his face radiant as he imagined a glorious future unfolding in Sun Yu's hands.

Sun Yu kept his head bowed in silence as he followed his master back to the sect.

Inside Dragon-Phoenix Palace the mood was tense and flurried; most of the palace's masters had gone out to meet the enemy, leaving only weaker warriors behind. When Sun Yu and Ling Jian returned, they were swarmed with questions.

The disciples had even forgotten to ask when Sun Yu had come back from Dragon Valley.

Ling Jian, playing the elder, dismissed those who had come to pry and told them only that the sect had won, one Saint Realm of Youhan Grotto-Heaven had been killed and the other had lost an arm.

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace disciples snorted; none believed Ling Jian's words.

Although their strength was limited, they knew Youhan Grotto-Heaven was somewhat stronger than their own sect. With two Saint Realm masters on the other side and only one here, how could this be the result?

Ling Jian said no more and took Sun Yu back to where he lived to settle him.

After Ling Jian left, Sun Yu finally let out a quiet breath; his tense nerves loosened and he looked around, whispering, "Senior, Senior Yang..."

"Don't call out — I've been with you the whole time," a familiar voice suddenly said beside him.

Sun Yu turned and found Yang Kai sitting on his bed; he had no idea when Yang Kai had come in and frowned at his uncanny appearance.

He rose hurriedly and bowed respectfully, "Thank you for saving me, Senior. I won't forget this. I will repay you in full!"

Yang Kai waved a hand weakly and said, "Just don't reveal that I was here."

Sun Yu recoiled in surprise and then noticed Yang Kai was covered in wounds; his clothes were stained with dark blood and he clutched his lower belly. A faint chill seeped from the wound, freezing the blood as it flowed.

What puzzled Sun Yu more was that the blood Yang Kai bled carried a faint golden radiance.

"Senior, you're injured?" Sun Yu asked with concern.

"It's nothing," Yang Kai shook his head. "I'll recover after a while. It's not a serious wound."

"How did you get hurt?" Sun Yu was confused — during the fight he had not seen Yang Kai make a move. Only the golden dragon had fought Yan Zhi, and although the dragon was wounded, what did that have to do with Yang Kai?

Moreover, the wound in Yang Kai's lower belly matched exactly the position of the injury on the golden dragon.

Sun Yu clearly saw that Yan Zhi's hand, crystallized into ice, had been driven into that same spot on the dragon.
