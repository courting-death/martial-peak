## Chapter 101 — Blatant Provocation

A long, piercing roar echoed forth as Yang Kai’s figure surged wildly like a bloodthirsty beast, his howl soaring straight into the heavens, reverberating endlessly within the valley.

“Come and fight! Scum of the Blood Battle Gang!”

This was a signal of challenge, a brazen provocation!

“I am right here, waiting for you!”

He knew full well that lingering any longer would bring trouble. After all, Nu Lang had already sent a similar signal with his roar before. Though the valley spanned dozens of li in all directions, in the dead of night, those men would surely have heard and were now rushing over.

The safest course of action now was to flee. After three consecutive battles, having slain five opponents, Yang Kai’s spirit and strength were heavily drained, and he bore many wounds. How could he face the Blood Battle Gang head-on again?

Leaving to recover and then striking at the opportune moment was undoubtedly the correct choice.

Yet Yang Kai could not leave. Nor would he! For at this moment, his vigor and spirit had soared to their peak. To depart now would surely awaken a cowardly thought within his heart. Without the support of his indomitable spirit, what use was he? Without it, he was merely a martial artist at the Fourth Stage of the Open Origin Realm.

Better to exhaust the remaining strength in pursuit of the enemy! Yang Kai intended to use his peak momentum to deliver a grand surprise to the Blood Battle Gang disciples who dared come here.

Of course, all this depended on Xia Ningshang’s deduction being correct.

The Blood Battle Gang was no mere petty faction like Fengyu Tower. Most of their members were experts at the Separation and Union Realm. Under normal circumstances, such warriors could easily consign Yang Kai to death. But now, sealed by the Nine Yin Eight Locks Formation, how much of their true strength remained was uncertain.

Moments after Yang Kai’s roar, Xia Ningshang suddenly opened her eyes wide, the tension and regret that had weighed on her heart finally easing.

He’s not dead! He’s still alive!

Tears nearly welled in Xia Ningshang’s eyes.

She had been deeply worried for Yang Kai’s safety, fearing he would never return and leave her alone here.

His strength was so low, and the enemy so numerous—how could he possibly withstand them?

Since Yang Kai’s departure, Xia Ningshang had blamed herself bitterly. She should have fought to keep him here, never letting him leave. But even now, her own condition was poor, and if Yang Kai was determined to go, she could not stop him.

Because she had come to this place, she had dragged him into this great peril. Xia Ningshang’s heart was heavy with guilt. The pure-hearted girl took all the blame upon herself, not realizing that whether Fengyu Tower or the Blood Battle Gang, it was all because of Yang Kai that they had come here.

If one were to name the true culprit, it was Yang Kai.

Yet now Xia Ningshang was somewhat relieved. Her junior brother was still safe. Moreover, his voice carried an unyielding fighting spirit, a signal that inspired hope.

Though she did not know what he was facing, Xia Ningshang felt the only thing she could do was to recover quickly and go out to aid him, to rescue him!

On the other side of the valley, Wen Feichen and Long Hui, who was acting as his protector, also heard Yang Kai’s roar clearly as they worked to dispel the Yin energy chains within Wen Feichen’s body.

At the sound, Wen Feichen frowned deeply, his mind disrupted, and suddenly he spat a mouthful of fresh blood.

“That bastard!” Wen Feichen roared in fury. At such a critical moment, his concentration was broken by that voice, causing internal injury.

“Master Wen, how goes the dispelling?” Long Hui asked with feigned concern.

Wen Feichen shook his head slowly. “No good. This is beyond my knowledge. I don’t even know whose disciple that woman is, to have set such a wondrous formation.”

The three Yin energy chains not only blocked the flow of Yuan Qi through his meridians but also locked his dantian, reducing his strength to barely the Third Stage of the Qi Movement Realm. After the recent exertion, his power had dropped even further.

Wen Feichen’s rage was boundless. He wished he could seize Yang Kai and that woman and kill them a hundred times over! A mighty expert at the Fifth Stage of the True Yuan Realm, yet to be toyed with by two juniors like this—when had he ever suffered such humiliation?

“Master Wen, do not worry. That brat dared to reveal his location. I believe he is dead by now,” Long Hui said with a confident expression, a cold sneer curling his lips.

Wen Feichen said nothing, for he had discerned the meaning within Yang Kai’s roar. It was not the cry of one at the end of his rope, but a roar of unstoppable momentum and fierce battle intent.

Yet, what arrogance for a mere Fourth Stage Open Origin Realm warrior!

Though Wen Feichen felt something was amiss, he did not take it to heart, believing Yang Kai was a trapped beast fighting desperately, doomed to die.

Within the valley, various factions nursed different thoughts, but outside the valley, an elderly man with white hair suddenly appeared, flying swiftly.

His aura was deep and concealed, making it impossible to gauge his true strength, yet his speed was astonishing, covering over a hundred zhang in the blink of an eye.

The old man’s face was filled with worry and urgency as he looked up at the sky, full of regret.

“This is bad, bad… I won’t make it in time. My little aunt, please do not activate the formation prematurely,” he muttered as he hurried along.

This old man was none other than Meng Wuya, the shopkeeper of the Contribution Hall.

Meng Wuya felt utterly ashamed. That night, he had earnestly advised his disciple not to come to this place where the Nine Yin energies converged. After all, ascending to the True Yuan Realm did not necessarily require refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. Xia Ningshang had obediently agreed.

In good spirits, Meng Wuya enjoyed the small dishes and fine wine Xia Ningshang had prepared. While eating and drinking, he spoke ill of Yang Kai, hoping to keep his disciple away from him.

Meng Wuya had seen that his disciple cared for Yang Kai—not out of love, but out of protection. Yet this was a dangerous sign, and Meng Wuya wished to nip it in the bud.

Over the years, his disciple had been obedient and pure-hearted, treasured like a precious gem, but too innocent to understand the treacheries of the world.

Meng Wuya worried: what if Yang Kai had ill intentions and seduced his disciple? At such a youthful and tender age, once feelings took root, matters would become complicated.

Thus, with a scheming heart and a thick skin, Meng Wuya shamelessly disparaged Yang Kai, blaming him for all manner of vices and evils, relentlessly smearing his reputation.

Finally, with a solemn expression, he warned Xia Ningshang, “Disciple, keep your distance from such a man. Keep far away!”
