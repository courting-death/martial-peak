## Chapter 1245 — Subjugation

Yang Kai felt a shock deep in his heart; he discovered that this refining furnace actually contained a fierce, concentrated fir spiritual Qi, so intense that for a time he couldn't freeze it.

When the wave of heat surged, he didn't dare move an inch. His intention had already been exposed, and this Artifact Spirit was no fool—if he left the side of the refining furnace, it would be that much harder to rush in again.

Staring at the towering blaze, Yang Kai's expression grew solemn. He stretched out both hands once more and seized at the void, splitting his hands apart.

A pitch-black rift twice the size of the previous spatial tear opened, hanging directly before Yang Kai.

The heat poured in at that moment, all rushing headlong into the rift and being exiled to some unknown place in the void, leaving not a single bit to harm Yang Kai.

But the rift looked somewhat unstable. Although Yang Kai's understanding of spatial laws had improved greatly since before, he had not reached mastery; forcibly tearing such a rift to use against an enemy was already a strain. The pure fire Spiritual Qi carried by the Artifact Spirit's blast struck it and the rift immediately began to falter, as if it might collapse and vanish at any moment.

Yang Kai's face darkened. He planted a hand on the rift to hold it open, doing his utmost to keep it steady and buy time, while his other hand pressed against the refining furnace, furiously pouring his Saint Yuan into it.

In an instant his Saint Yuan poured out like a breached dam, raging away, and the pitch-black Cold Flame on the surface of the refining furnace thickened, forming ever larger sheets of black ice.

The Artifact Spirit had at first shown delight when the rift began to wobble, but seeing Yang Kai stake everything as if to freeze the furnace no matter the cost, it panicked. More scorching waves blasted from its mouth, as if it intended to fight Yang Kai to the death.

It seemed to understand: after this battle, either it would be frozen or Yang Kai would be destroyed—there was no holding back.

The struggle in the stone chamber locked into a stalemate. The Artifact Spirit's heat-waves sprayed out ceaselessly, making its area blisteringly hot. But in front of Yang Kai an unstable spatial rift swallowed and exiled every hot blast. Behind him the refining furnace emitted cracking sounds as layer after layer of black thin ice spread outward. From outside inward, from top to bottom. The pace was not slow.

As time went on the rift grew more and more ephemeral, more and more unstable.

Finally, under one savage press of the Artifact Spirit's heat-waves, the rift suddenly collapsed, exposing Yang Kai standing behind it.

The Artifact Spirit's small eyes lit with ecstatic delight; without that strange rift to swallow its heat, it was certain it could blast Yang Kai to death in a single inhalation.

Cruelty and savagery rolled across its face. It opened its maw and a ball of crimson flame rapidly coalesced within; overwhelming Spiritual Qi surged out, rippling through the chamber and making everything tremble.

Just as it was about to unleash that world-shattering blow, an odd smile flashed across Yang Kai's usually stern face. He glanced at the Artifact Spirit and then laughed heartily.

At the sound of his laughter, the great refining furnace suddenly clicked and cracked, and was wholly sealed within pitch-black ice—so tight that not even a thread of Spiritual Qi could leak out.

The Artifact Spirit froze, then seemed struck by thunder. Its giant form lost strength and plummeted from the heights; before it hit the ground the enormous Spiritual Qi it had gathered backlashed and exploded, with a bang that blew its entire skull apart.

Yet this did not end the Artifact Spirit. It was not a corporeal body and was born versed in fire laws; that backblast could not truly destroy it.

Even so, its enormous form shrank swiftly. When it hit the ground it returned to the size Yang Kai had first seen; the newly formed skull was dimmed and it staggered to its feet, looking weak and listless.

It stood there silently, looking at Yang Kai with both hate and fear, its little eyes spinning—no one could tell what it was thinking.

Suddenly it spread its wings and became a streak of fire, rushing toward the refining furnace.

It wanted to return to the vessel that had given it birth.

Yang Kai would not allow that. After so much cunning and effort to wrest the upper hand, if he could not subdue the Artifact Spirit now, all his toil would be for naught.

Pitch-black Demonic Flame welled from Yang Kai in clusters, hovering before him. They looked like unremarkable black fireballs of strange color, but under his Divine Sense command they radiated an astonishing chill.

Watching the red flash charge in, Yang Kai snapped a finger and flicked one of the black fireballs; it flew forth with cold and met the red glare head-on.

Whether from slow recovery or true Yuan Qi injury, the red light of the Artifact Spirit did not dodge and was struck squarely by the Cold Flame.

With a boom the cold and heat collided, a fierce wave rolling out. The Artifact Spirit's form reappeared, tumbling through the air and was hurled against the cave wall; the red light around it went noticeably dimmer.

It staggered to its feet and, stubborn as ever, reformed into red light and charged again.

Yang Kai snorted and commanded another Cold Flame to meet it.

Boom, boom, boom...

Inside the stone chamber the Artifact Spirit suffered near-cruel torment. Each time the Cold Flame struck it grew dimmer; after seven or eight impacts it could barely maintain its form. Its wings shrank, and the three long feathers on its tail disappeared.

Its own vessel was frozen, and having just suffered backlash from the world’s Yuan Qi, the once-mighty and overbearing Artifact Spirit, now agitated and disordered, could no longer contend with Yang Kai—reduced instead to a mere punching bag taking blow after blow.

Yet the thing was tenacious—despite so many Cold Flame strikes it would not disperse and retained its sentience. Yang Kai was secretly astonished and all the more determined to subdue it.

Had he not struck at the root by attacking the refining furnace, with the Artifact Spirit's apparent power and intelligence he might well have been helpless. Since the vessel lay where it did, Yang Kai knew it would be foolish not to take action.

After being sent flying once again, the Artifact Spirit stubbornly struggled to its feet, letting out a low, mournful cry—like a cuckoo weeping blood—its sound unbearably desolate.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, expression neither pleased nor angry, and watched it indifferently. When he judged it enough he spoke: “Since you have intelligence, let's negotiate. I don't intend to slay you; I can even spare your life, but you must submit to me.”

The Artifact Spirit emitted a cry, its little eyes fixed on Yang Kai, full of fury.

Yang Kai gave a light chuckle. “You'd better think carefully. I don't absolutely need to take you— I can also eliminate you, erase your existence so you vanish from this world. You weren't born easily; only you know the hardship and time it cost. How about you obey my terms?”

“Of course, submitting has benefits. As far as I know, an Artifact Spirit like you should have strong growth potential. If you come with me I might be able to find things that greatly aid your growth.” Yang Kai knew the value of both carrot and stick; such tactics rarely failed with sentient beings—especially an Artifact Spirit.

At first the Artifact Spirit seemed unmoved, but when Yang Kai mentioned those last words its little eyes twitched. It cocked its head and began to consider gains and losses, looking almost comical.

Seeing a chance, Yang Kai pressed his advantage. “You've been here tens of thousands of years. The Earth-Lung Fire Pool gave birth to you; it likely has little left to offer your growth. If you don't come with me you'll be trapped here forever—someone else might break in next time, and they won't be as reasonable as I am.”

After saying this Yang Kai's expression turned cold. “I've said my piece. Whether you die or submit is your choice. I'm not patient and time is short. If you haven't decided by the time I rise, you need not answer.”

Saying so, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged beside the refining furnace. Having pressed it step by step to this point, he believed it should be enough—now, all that remained was to wait for the Artifact Spirit to make its choice.

The Artifact Spirit stood in the chamber's corner, eyes fixed on Yang Kai, then on the refining furnace frozen by black Cold Flame behind him. Its gaze flickered with a disturbingly human mix of fear and greed.

The chamber fell silent. Yang Kai did not hurry it. After all the suffering it had endured and with its Yuan Qi badly hurt, it dared not rashly attempt another charge and simply remained where it was.

Half a day passed. After that, Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked at the Artifact Spirit coldly, then rose.

Before Yang Kai could speak the Artifact Spirit suddenly gave a clear call.

Though he could not understand its words, Yang Kai guessed most of the meaning and nodded. “I keep my word. If you follow me I will do whatever I can to help your growth and evolution. Oh—and I forgot to mention—you won't be the only thing under me to awaken intelligence. There is a Divine Tree as well, though it is currently evolving and dormant. You will meet it later; speak with it and you'll see what kind of person I am.”

The Artifact Spirit called once more, and this cry carried a trace of meekness.

Yang Kai grinned and inclined his head. “Fine. If you are willing, lower your Divine Sense defenses. I want to put a small seal on you first. Don't worry, it won't harm you—it's just a precaution.”

The Artifact Spirit hesitated long enough before reluctantly lowering its Divine Sense defenses.

Yang Kai immediately unleashed his Divine Sense and infiltrated its mind, using a few minor techniques.
