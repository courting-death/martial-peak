## Chapter 1804 — How Could This Be

Lü Guichen, who had snatched back a life, felt his whole body go limp; sweat broke out all over him, and the wind that blew felt icy-cold against his skin.

Yang Kai coldly fixed his gaze on Lü Guichen and said, "If you dare lie to me, I'll make it so that even if you want to die, you won't be able to." "Now speak — what exactly is the secret of this continent?"

Lü Guichen's face went deathly pale; he swallowed with a wet gulp and looked at Yang Kai pleadingly. "Could you let those two demonic beasts retreat first... please?"

Two pairs of bloodshot eyes stared at him, and his heart pounded wildly; that feeling of hanging between life and death was truly unbearable.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and issued an order in his mind; the Tail-Crested Snake and the Star-Emperor Turtle immediately reverted into Golden Blood Threads and flew back toward Yang Kai.

Lü Guichen wiped the cold sweat from his brow, glanced at Yang Kai and saw him looking at him with impatience, and hurriedly said, "I'll tell you the secret — can you guarantee you won't kill me?"

"Your life isn't as valuable as you think. Sparing you or killing you is a thought away for me; it depends on how valuable your secret is!"

"Very valuable!" Lü Guichen's body shuddered. "I... ahem, I can stake my life on it — you will definitely be interested in this secret."

"Enough nonsense—keep babbling and you're dead."

"Y-yes..." Lü Guichen trembled and hurried on, "If I tell you that this continent gave birth to its own Origin power, would you believe me?"

"Origin?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened and a terrifying light flashed in them. He asked in a low voice, "How do you know that?"

"I've stayed here for decades." Lü Guichen forced a bitter smile. "One day a few years ago I was secluded in cultivation when I suddenly felt the continent's spiritual qi moving oddly; from under the ground came a vague Divine Sense signal. I thought some strange treasure had appeared, so I sent out my Divine Sense to investigate. But the moment I released my Divine Sense it was drawn in by that power. I saw a dazzling light — it felt like a newborn infant curiously contacting me — but when I tried to look closely I was pushed back. I didn't know what it was at the time. Later, after thinking it over, I felt it should be the continent's Origin, though I couldn't be absolutely certain."

He rushed through the story at high speed, then looked at Yang Kai anxiously.

"Origin! Ha! It looks like it really is the Origin." Yang Kai laughed heartily.

Years ago, when he had roamed the void with his Divine Sense on the Floating Continent, he had inadvertently delved into the deep earth beneath it. There he had indeed seen a mass of glowing energy — vast and terrifying — which he had not understood.

At that time his strength had been insufficient and he had been powerless against that energy, but he had been cautious. He had attached a strand of his own Divine Sense to that energy.

It was precisely thanks to that one strand that Yang Kai could accurately locate the Floating Continent and return to this place.

Hearing Lü Guichen's words now, Yang Kai immediately confirmed that it was without doubt the Origin!

If the Floating Continent was a small star, then what Lü Guichen and he had seen back then was the Stellar Origin of that star.

Only back then the Stellar Origin Yang Kai had seen was still in the process of growing and had not fully formed, whereas what Lü Guichen had seen was a freshly birthed Stellar Origin.

If left unchecked, this Floating Continent truly had the chance, in time, to transform into a genuine Cultivation Star.

"Young hero, I..." Lü Guichen watched Yang Kai's expression and did not know how he planned to deal with him; he asked nervously.

"Stay where you are and don't move. If you act without permission, you're as good as dead." After saying this Yang Kai sensed the position of the Divine Sense Thread he had left decades ago. He blurred and prepared to leave, but quickly returned and tossed Lü Guichen a ring. "Pack up all the things you've collected over the years."

With that he had already vanished.

Lü Guichen stood in place holding the long-unseen Spatial Ring, his eyes wide as he stared at the spot where Yang Kai had disappeared. It took him a long moment to come back to his senses; he wiped his brow and still showed signs of lingering fright.

He had no idea how Yang Kai had just left; the gap between them was immeasurable. It was laughable that he had earlier thought that if he fought to the death he could at least wound Yang Kai.

If he had actually done that, he would long ago have been torn to pieces.

After standing stunned for a long time, Lü Guichen drooped and flew off in a certain direction to pack the good things he had gathered these years into the ring.

Heaven-and-earth treasures were indeed wonderful, but one needed to stay alive to enjoy them. Now that Yang Kai’s fist was bigger than his, how could he dare show the slightest resistance?

Deep beneath the earth, Yang Kai had exerted great effort to break his way down.

This place should be at least ten thousand li or so below the surface, and here there was an empty cavernous space.

At the very center of that space floated a mass of glowing energy, emitting a soft radiance.

It was the very mass Yang Kai had seen decades ago.

But now it seemed a bit smaller and more condensed than before. When Yang Kai arrived, the Origin gave off a strong repulsive force, attempting to push him out of the space.

Yang Kai stood calmly in place, utterly unmoved no matter how powerful the repulsion became.

Fixing his gaze on the glowing mass, Yang Kai's expression brightened with joy: "It truly is the Origin."

He was the Star Lord of Dark Star and had refined Dark Star's Stellar Origin; in this matter he naturally had a degree of authority.

Although the Floating Continent's Origin differed greatly from Dark Star's, it was unquestionably Origin power; the force contained within it was terrifying and beyond mortal resistance.

"Ha! It even absorbed the strand of Divine Sense I left behind — doesn't that mean it's mine?" Yang Kai watched for a moment and could not help but become excited.

Somehow the strand of Divine Sense he had left there years ago had been fused into the Origin as it was born and grew.

In other words, the Origin already bore his own mark!

No wonder the Origin seemed so terrifying yet could not shake him — now he understood.

In the next instant Yang Kai's body trembled with excitement.

Since the Origin bore his mark, refining it should be very easy; if he refined it, would he not become the master of this Floating Continent?

He was already the lord of Dark Star; if he became the lord of this continent as well, he would be... the master of two stars!

Such a thing had not occurred in the Star Domain for countless millennia.

Even experts at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm could not refine the Stellar Origin of two Cultivation Stars.

The thought thrilled Yang Kai beyond measure. He truly felt the benefits of being a Star Lord: a Star Lord's fate was tied to their Cultivation Star — when the star flourished the lord grew strong; when the star waned the lord diminished.

The Floating Continent was a newly born, small-scale Cultivation Star with limitless potential; if he could refine its Origin, he would benefit immeasurably as it grew.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai could no longer suppress the swelling excitement in his heart.

He released his Divine Sense and tried to communicate with the Origin, but it gave no response.

After a moment Yang Kai resigned himself to it.

The Origin had only just been born; like a newborn it had no awareness yet.

"I'll refine it first and talk later," Yang Kai murmured, sat cross-legged, formed hand seals and closed his eyes. In the next instant a pure soul power spread from his body.

A visible spirit-power manifested and took the form of Yang Kai.

This was Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

To refine a Stellar Origin one had to send forth the soul and merge it with the Origin; therefore refining a Stellar Origin was extremely dangerous — one misstep and one could be annihilated.

Experts at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm would never attempt this without absolute certainty, which was why Star Lords were so rare in the Star Domain.

Across endless ages, many invincible Third Stage Void King experts had died in the process of refining Stellar Origins.

If the Floating Continent's Origin had not just been born and were not weak, and if it had not fused with his Divine Sense Thread and thus already borne his mark, Yang Kai would not have dared be so arrogant.

This was unlike the time he refined Dark Star's Origin, when Yang Yan assisted him and there had been no danger; this time he had to rely on himself.

Fortunately Yang Kai had considerable confidence because he possessed the Star Refining Technique.

The Star Refining Technique had been taken out from the Imperial Garden and was a secret art specifically for refining Stellar Origins; Little Senior Sister had used this technique to become the Star Lord of Tongxuan Continent.

His Spirit Body flashed and plunged into the Origin; the process met no resistance, and Yang Kai felt as if he were wrapped in warm water, supremely comfortable.

This made him jubilant; because his mark was present, the Origin did not reject his spirit.

It seemed the matter would go very smoothly, Yang Kai thought.

He quietly operated the Star Refining Technique and began refining the Origin's power.

Time passed bit by bit and the glowing Origin began to destabilize and fade as a profound aura surged out.

The whole process proceeded unimaginably smoothly, and when the Spirit Body and the Origin reached a certain resonance, Yang Kai's hand seals shifted and he began to draw the Origin's power into his body.

Once that mass of Origin was absorbed into his body he could complete the refinement and become the Star Lord of this continent!

But at that moment another force suddenly erupted from within Yang Kai; it was far more terrifying than the Floating Continent's Origin.

Disturbed by this force, the previously docile Origin became chaotic and no longer obeyed Yang Kai's control.

"No!" Yang Kai shouted, snapping his eyes open as his hand seals shifted and his Spirit Body returned to his physical shell.

With a woeful sound he spat a mouthful of blood; his chest churned and his face was as pale as paper.

He drew several harsh breaths to suppress the Saint Yuan and his Qi and blood that were tossing about within him.

Staring at the Origin before him, Yang Kai frowned tightly and murmured, "How could this be?"
