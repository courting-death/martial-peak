## Chapter 1891 — I Will Remember You for a Lifetime

Among the women Yang Kai had known in his earlier years, the one with the most outstanding aptitude was without a doubt Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang.

After all, her constitution was special, possessing the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, giving her advantages few could rival and an endlessly promising future.

Next came the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo; that seductive woman also had an unusual constitution, though it carried slight flaws and was not as advantageous as Xia Ningshang's.

And the Lingxiao Pavilion's Senior Sister Su Yan ranked third.

That was an innate shortcoming, not that Su Yan's aptitude was truly unfit for attainment.

But now it seemed the three women were all of peerless talent, indistinguishable in rank.

As for Xia Ningshang, there was no need to say more: after attaining the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body she even refined the primal Origin of the Tongxuan Continent and rose to become its sovereign. Her fate was bound to the continent itself — its honor and disgrace were one with hers.

Any Star Lord's prospects were extraordinarily bright.

Shan Qingluo had absorbed the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, which not only filled the deficiencies of her constitution but raised her aptitude to another level. The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was no ordinary being; although not a Divine Spirit, in antiquity it had the strength to contend with Divine Spirits and had once been a hegemonic presence — not to be underestimated.

As for Su Yan, she bore the Ice Phoenix's Origin and had cultivated the Ice-Heart Technique in Ice Heart Valley. She later formed an Ice-Crystal Yu Body, entered the Fateful Cold Pool, and obtained the Profound Frost Divine Sword left by Bing Yun, the sect's founding patriarch; in terms of aptitude and potential she was in no way inferior to the other two.

The best proof was that all three women's cultivations were now at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

Shan Qingluo had already begun preparations to assault the Void King Realm over on Di Chen; Yang Kai believed Su Yan and Xia Ningshang within the Lingxiao Sect would certainly not be idle.

Now that Dark Star was free from the suppression of heavenly laws, provided preparations were sufficient, the two women were bound to be able to advance smoothly to the Void King Realm.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai revealed a faint smile.

He suddenly realized the women close to him seemed to possess roughly the same level of strength and aptitude, even including Xue Yue...

He simply did not know who would be stronger if they fought.

At that thought Yang Kai shuddered and quickly shook his head, driving the shocking notion from his mind. If those four fought, Yang Kai reckoned he would have to avoid their sharp edges and run as far as possible.

Since Shan Qingluo was at the critical moment of breaking into the Void King Realm, Yang Kai naturally would not disturb her; instead he watched silently for a while, and after confirming her progress was smooth he retracted his Divine Sense.

Just as Yang Kai planned to settle down and recuperate, his brow lifted and he glanced toward the door; the next moment a smile appeared on his face.

There seemed to be some commotion outside the door.

Yang Kai waved his hand and the door opened.

A girlish cry rang out, and a figure came stumbling into the room.

Bang... the door was shut again.

The newcomer looked somewhat wary, glancing about; upon seeing Yang Kai watching her with a smile, she couldn't help but snort in annoyance.

"If you're coming, come in — what are you skulking around outside for?" Yang Kai laughed hoarsely, rose and beckoned the woman opposite, then came to the table and poured her a cup of water.

The visitor turned out to be Biluo, the maid who had always accompanied Shan Qingluo.

Biluo had followed Shan Qingluo since the days in Piaoxiang City within the Cangyun Evil Land; after passing through that altar into Di Chen Star she remained at Shan Qingluo's side, and the last time had even followed Shan Qingluo into the Imperial Garden for training.

Yang Kai had a deep impression of this woman who disliked men and had a special fondness only for women...

"Who's skulking?" Biluo snorted, her phoenix-like eyes glaring at Yang Kai as if she could kill him. "You're the annoying one — since you recognized me, why didn't you call me over? Opening the door all of a sudden to scare me?"

"Mm, my mistake. Sit, have some tea." Yang Kai would not be foolish enough to trade words with her and simply gestured.

Biluo flounced into her seat, lifted the teacup and drained it at one gulp, then sat there in silence.

Yang Kai waited a moment, unsure why she had come; just as he prepared to ask plainly, Biluo suddenly looked up, a peculiar light shining in her beautiful eyes as she stared brightly at him and, somewhat excited, said: "I heard that big bear said you've already reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm?"

"Big bear..." Yang Kai showed a strange expression, but the image of Yu Xiong, that shameless brother-in-law, immediately flashed through his mind and he smiled and nodded: "Yes."

"No wonder you look much more robust than before." Biluo casually reached out her slender jade hand and patted Yang Kai's shoulder, wearing a pleased expression. "The Queen really did not misjudge people — the young man has great promise."

She put on an air of supreme calm, making a great show of it.

Yang Kai smiled faintly.

With his current identity and cultivation, apart from a few ancient monsters who refused to die, probably only Biluo would dare speak to him like that.

Yang Kai was not angry; instead he felt somewhat pleased. After all, they had all come from the Zhongdu world and shared a natural sense of familiarity.

"Keep working hard — a man should have great strength, otherwise how will he protect the Queen later?"

"Yes, yes," Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, showing an attentive look.

Biluo narrowed her eyes at him; a gleam flashed within as if she were very satisfied with his performance.

But Yang Kai keenly noticed that beneath Biluo's seemingly happy face there was a hint of disappointment.

After a moment's thought Yang Kai understood why Biluo felt that way. He smiled and said, "You're not bad yourself; you're already at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm."

Biluo's aptitude wasn't particularly impressive. In the Zhongdu world she might be judged as upper‑middle, but across the whole Star Domain her talent would barely stretch to an average ranking.

However, after following Shan Qingluo through the altar to Di Chen Star she had encountered the remains of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider; when Shan Qingluo absorbed the spider's primordial power Biluo also benefited a little, and with material support from the Red Moon Domain she was able to achieve her current Origin Returning Realm accomplishment.

Otherwise she would at most be a Saint King Realm cultivator, perhaps only at the first or second level.

"First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — what's that?" Biluo said with a self-mocking laugh. "The Queen is about to break into the Void King Realm... I don't know how long I can keep following her."

Sure enough.

Hearing her speak so despondently, Yang Kai immediately knew his guess had been correct: Biluo was clearly upset by the widening gap between her and Shan Qingluo.

Though her devotion to Shan Qingluo was extraordinary, if the strength gap grew too large, trailing behind Shan Qingluo would only become a burden.

Just like the last time at the Blood Prison Trial, she lacked the ability to accompany Shan Qingluo at her side.

Given her loyalty, she would not want Shan Qingluo to worry on her account. If the gap continued to widen she might quietly leave one day.

Having grasped this, Yang Kai already had a plan and smiled slightly: "Are there no suitable human cultivation methods and secrets on Di Chen Star?"

Biluo nodded: "You're right — this is a yao star. The Queen carries the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider origin and is half-yao, so cultivating yao supreme classics is fine, but I cannot find anything suitable for myself. Although the Red Moon Palace has some human methods and secrets, their level isn't high; I tried the most powerful ones and the results were unsatisfactory."

Biluo looked annoyed.

"I have something here," Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

Biluo immediately looked up at him, her beautiful eyes lighting with startling brilliance, and without ceremony reached out: "Quick, give it to me, quick — I'll remember you for a lifetime."

Yang Kai felt an instant mental blank, thinking that sounded somewhat off.

Biluo seemed to sense her abruptness, stuck out her tongue bashfully, and said coyly, "If it's convenient, could you teach me? I'll remember your kindness for a lifetime and never speak ill of you in front of the Queen again."

"You still speak ill of me in front of Qingluo!" Yang Kai exploded in anger.

Biluo sneered: "The Queen has all her attention fixed on you; whatever I say she just brushes off with a smile..."

"What did you tell her?" Yang Kai asked, feeling a little guilty.

"Everything — I tell the Queen everything," Biluo said innocently, wearing an utterly guileless look.

"Including that time in the attic..."

"Don't mention that — it's the shame of my life!" Biluo glared at Yang Kai in embarrassed anger, her face bright red; as she spoke she couldn't help but stick out her tongue and lick the corner of her mouth, as if something had been left there...

"Ah, youthful recklessness!" Yang Kai sighed deeply.

Biluo became visibly restless; if she hadn't been hoping Yang Kai would hand her a suitable human cultivation method she would have stormed out long ago. Every time she recalled that incident she wanted to crawl into a hole and never show her face again.

Although decades had passed, even to this day she could clearly recall that peculiar taste...

"Enough — let us not mention it anymore; let us pretend it never happened," Yang Kai waved his hand.

Biluo shrank back in her chair and nodded vigorously, her ear roots burning hot and her face flushed crimson.

"Let me see which of the Five Elements your body belongs to!" Yang Kai said, and without asking he reached out, flicked two fingers, and placed them on Biluo's fair wrist.

Biluo did not move, permitting Yang Kai to examine her.

A moment later Yang Kai spoke: "Hmm... your Five Elements are dominated by Fire, which is not surprising."

Biluo's brash and impatient temperament indeed matched a fire attribute.

"I had been practicing fire-based methods before; cultivating fire attributes seems to progress faster than others," Biluo said.

"That is natural — every body differs. Depending on the predominance of the Five Elements, an individual's affinity for different energies in the world is distinct. With Fire as your dominant element you should pursue fire-type methods. I'll see if I have anything suitable for you."

Having said that, Yang Kai began rummaging through his Spatial Ring.

Biluo waited expectantly, not daring to make a sound.
