## Chapter 1702 — Ghost Isle

Yang Kai sprang up in a rush; with a single flash of his figure he moved straight from Xiaguang Island to that sector of the sea where the incident had occurred. He hovered silently in midair, brow knotted, his Divine Sense frantically spreading out as he sought the true cause of those beings' disappearance.

The strange manifestation that had appeared over this sea left him, the lord of Dark Star, both puzzled and stunned.

He stood there in the air, not missing a single detail, yet he still could not find any trace or clue.

The heavens and earth around were filled with an eerie atmosphere that made the hair on one’s arms stand on end.

At one moment Yang Kai's face shifted slightly and he turned his head to stare in a direction.

Over there, an island shrouded in shadow had materialized in a strange way; it was vague and indistinct, like the moon on water or a flower in mist, impossible to see clearly. No matter how Yang Kai concentrated his Divine Sense, he could not grasp its outline.

It seemed as if it did not truly exist, its distance wavering, yet it exuded an inexplicable aura.

A pitch-black mouth opened up behind Yang Kai without a sound; by the time he noticed it, it was already too late. That black maw gaped like the open jaws of a ferocious beast and swallowed him whole.

Then he vanished.

A gale swept in, sending ripples across the sea, and within a radius of tens of thousands of li there was no longer any sign of life.

…

Yang Kai reappeared on a stretch of beach; the dampness and briny tang of a typical coastline filled the air. Before he could make sense of what had happened, the sounds of fighting and slaughter reached his ears, and some of the voices sounded familiar.

Following the sounds, Yang Kai discovered that many of the human and Sea Race experts who had vanished in his earlier sensing were on this very beach.

Pang Zhen, Shang Ao and Qian Mo were all among them.

Their situation was grim; they were being besieged by a group of warriors whose origins were unknown.

Although Sea Hall and Sea God Palace did not always see eye to eye and had friction each year, they at least knew each other’s foundations. Now that they had suddenly fallen into this plight, they naturally set aside past grudges and fought together.

The attackers were not many, only about three or four dozen.

Even so, the powerhouses of Sea Hall and Sea God Palace were steadily forced to retreat! Had those mysterious assailants not shown mercy, Pang Zhen, Shang Ao, and the others would likely have suffered devastating losses.

Yang Kai found it odd—he noticed that none of these fighters were displaying any sign of using Saint Yuan; instead, they relied entirely on their physical strength in combat.

It was not just those unknown warriors; Pang Zhen, Shang Ao and the others were the same.

Shang Ao was tall and burly, a Sea Race member whose bodily constitution was naturally powerful, so even when surrounded by four or five enemies he could barely hold them off and would not be quickly defeated.

Pang Zhen fared worse. By combat ability he was not far behind Shang Ao, but without access to Saint Yuan his fighting prowess plunged; he was hard-pressed and kept crying out in pain.

The same was true for the other human cultivators — lacking the Sea Race’s innate physical strength, they were outmatched not only by the Sea Race’s men, but even by women like Qian Mo.

Yang Kai considered this and tried to draw upon his Saint Yuan, only to find that his Saint Yuan did not move at all—this strange place had a power that imprisoned Saint Yuan!

The discovery sent a chill through his heart.

He tried to use his Divine Sense and found it could only extend outward about fifty zhang from his body.

What kind of place was this? Why did it impose such powerful restrictions on Saint Yuan and Divine Sense? Yang Kai could not fathom it.

Two fellows nearby saw that Yang Kai was young and, snickering, moved to encircle and attack him from both sides.

Yang Kai had not yet grasped the full situation here and did not wish to draw too much attention, so while he parried those two he secretly scrutinized his surroundings.

In terms of sheer physical strength, Yang Kai could be considered among the very top. The Life Jade Nectar he had taken from the Imperial Garden was no small thing; his body contained a fair amount of Golden Blood, and combined with his practice of the Undying Five Elements Sword, if it came down to a contest of physical might alone, he could go toe-to-toe with experts of the Void King Realm without fear.

He was now certain: this was not Dark Star, or rather, this place had already slipped out of Dark Star’s control.

Even his connection to Dark Star had been severed; he could not rely on the Star Lord’s conveniences. This was absolutely an independent, sealed space!

The battle raged on; both sides fought fiercely. One after another human or Sea Race warriors were captured, bound and hauled aside, yet Shang Ao and Pang Zhen and the others still fought desperately and had wounded many of their foes.

A lanky, emaciated man stood watching at the side. Seeing his subordinates unable to resolve the fight for so long, he grew restless and sneered, “Once you enter Ghost Isle, heaven and man are parted. You’d better not resist—come along obediently to meet the island’s master. If you behave, the island’s master will not trouble you.”

“Ghost Isle?” Pang Zhen, Shang Ao and Qian Mo all cried out in alarm, the color draining from their faces.

Even Yang Kai was vastly shocked.

This place was Ghost Isle? He could hardly believe it.

He had long heard the name of Ghost Isle. On Dark Star there had originally been three great forbidden places: one was Flowing Flame Sandland, another the Imperial Garden, and the third was Ghost Isle.

Flowing Flame Sandland need not be explained; it opened only once every few hundred years to the younger generations of the major powers for training, and it was impossible to enter at ordinary times.

The Imperial Garden was equally renowned—it was the Starry Sky Emperor’s private garden, famous far and wide. The last time it opened the Star Domain’s heroes had congregated there and many gained great benefit.

Ghost Isle, however, was entirely different from the other two — while the first two were places where one could temper themselves and gain benefits, Ghost Isle was a land of absolute death!

Rumor had it Ghost Isle existed on the Wuyou Sea, but no one had truly seen it. Anyone who had seen it vanished without a trace and never returned, as if they had been erased from the world.

Many warriors on Dark Star doubted Ghost Isle’s existence because no one could produce evidence to prove it.

Ghost Isle existed only in legend.

Yet now this lanky man said this place was Ghost Isle. How could Pang Zhen, Shang Ao and the others not be shaken? They had long dwelt in the deep sea and were familiar with its tales; at the mere mention of those three words each grew pale.

If this truly was Ghost Isle, then the legends were true, and they could never return to the Wuyou Sea. They would be trapped for life in this ghostly place where Saint Yuan could not be used and Divine Sense was suppressed!

To obey the summons of some unknown island master was intolerable to any expert.

“Indeed, this is Ghost Isle!” The lanky man was satisfied with their reaction. When he had first fallen here himself he had reacted the same way; he'd lost track of how long it had been.

Shang Ao and Pang Zhen exchanged a look and both roared in unison, “As if we’d believe you!”

“Hmph, incorrigible fools!” The lanky man snorted coldly, not wishing to waste time, and took a step forward. A conspicuous aura radiated from his body.

He casually swept his hand and several human and Sea Race experts who had been blocking the way were pulverized into paste, offering no defense at all.

He did not use Saint Yuan; he relied solely on brute physical power!

Shang Ao’s eyes narrowed and his face turned grave; he could tell this lanky man was strong. That gaunt frame could erupt with inconceivable force.

The lanky man only took a few steps and reached Shang Ao’s side.

He intended to make an example of Shang Ao, who appeared the strongest among them.

Without any special flourish he simply swung a punch at Shang Ao’s face; the blow made the air itself split and hum.

Shang Ao let out a low roar, his burly body rooted to the spot like a stake. Clenching his fists, he crossed his arms before him in defense.

Boom…

The lanky man’s fist crashed into Shang Ao’s arms; the sound of bones breaking rang out as Shang Ao’s huge body was flung like a paper kite with its strings cut, tumbling far and landing heavily.

When he managed to force himself to his feet, his mouth and nose gushed blood and his face looked grisly; he wavered and collapsed onto his back.

The crowd gasped, all showing expressions of horror.

The human and Sea Race experts who were resisting ceased their actions.

That this lanky man could knock Shang Ao senseless with a single blow made killing them all seem too easy. Even Pang Zhen, after a few shifts in expression, signaled to Sea Hall’s warriors to give up resisting.

Before absolute force, resistance was meaningless and only increased casualties.

Seeing this, the lanky man smiled in satisfaction and laughed aloud, “Those who know the times are heroes. You did well. Rest assured, I am not looking to slaughter you all—Ghost Isle has not had newcomers in a long time; your arrival just replenishes the population here. The island master does not allow indiscriminate killing. Of course, that depends on whether you obey. Perhaps before long we may even become companions. Stay here a while and you will learn what Ghost Isle is like.”

He laughed happily.

The faces of the human and Sea Race experts were grim.

Yang Kai’s brow knit; his expression shifted several times and he made a decision.

He would not let this lanky man control him! Whether or not this was Ghost Isle, he had to hold the initiative in his own hands.

With that thought he feinted and slipped out of the battle ring, then dashed outward.

The move finally drew the lanky man’s attention. His face darkened and he snorted, “Ungrateful wretch—kill him!”

Yang Kai’s action had clearly angered him; the last command was directed at his two subordinates.

The two obeyed and gave chase after Yang Kai without hesitation.

The Sea Race did not know Yang Kai and assumed him a disciple of Sea Hall, so they only glanced at his retreating back and paid him no further heed. Pang Zhen, however, was astonished, wondering how Yang Kai could be here.

But he could barely secure his own safety now and had no thought to care for Yang Kai; he stood there with a wan, defeated look.
