## Chapter 2190 — Refining

“Whoever dares to move, I’ll kill them!” Wuchang suddenly shouted, his face fierce as he swept his gaze around.

Killing intent spread, thick and almost tangible.

Those few who had been itching to act instantly fell silent! They clearly felt that if they acted rashly, they would be killed in the very next moment…

The aura of death was so dense it was suffocating, making their lips dry and bodies cold…

Just then, Yang Kai’s eyes snapped open, divine light flashing within them. With a low shout, he declared, “Open the furnace!”

As he spoke, he pointed forward, and the Ink Jade Cauldron appeared before him.

The Ink Jade Cauldron was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill furnace. It had originally been purchased at an auction in Fenglin City by Han Leng, a disgraced disciple of Star God Palace. However, after Han Leng’s unexpected death, it ultimately fell into Yang Kai’s hands.

Such a pill cauldron was a rare treasure, especially for alchemists. Above it, only Imperial-Grade pill cauldrons were better.

But how could an Imperial-Grade pill cauldron be so easily obtained? Usually, Imperial-Grade pill cauldrons were even rarer and more precious than Imperial Treasures.

As the Ink Jade Cauldron opened, a fragrance different from the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus instantly spread out.

Smelling this scent and seeing the cauldron, many people’s expressions changed, and their confidence in Yang Kai immediately increased.

Because such a cauldron was not something ordinary alchemists could possess. Only Dao Origin-Grade alchemists were qualified to use it, and the medicinal fragrance drifting from within proved it had refined countless Spiritual Medicines.

All of this indirectly confirmed that Yang Kai was indeed a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist!

As the cauldron opened, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged, and a scorching, formless Divine Sense Fire instantly poured into the cauldron. The Ink Jade Cauldron began to hum and vibrate in the blink of an eye.

“Liu Yan!” Yang Kai called out again, flipping his hand. A stream of light shot from his palm.

A clear cry echoed. Under everyone’s gaze, the illusory figure of a strange Fire Bird flashed and dove into the cauldron.

“Artifact Spirit!” Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes lit up, and she couldn’t help but exclaim softly.

In that instant, although she hadn’t seen Liu Yan’s true form, she instinctively sensed that the stream of light was extraordinary. Combined with what she saw, she immediately deduced it was definitely a fire-type Artifact Spirit!

A Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill cauldron, a fire-type Artifact Spirit…

The combination of the two was the dream of most alchemists under the heavens. With their help, refining any Spiritual Pill would yield twice the result for half the effort.

Lan Xun couldn’t help but smile, “If nothing unexpected happens, Brother Yang really can refine the Supreme Mystic Pill. Everyone, just wait and see.”

Hearing this, many people’s spirits lifted, their faces full of anticipation.

On the other side, Yang Kai was already solemnly taking out the ingredients for refining the Supreme Mystic Pill.

He methodically tossed various rare ingredients into the cauldron, his hands forming seals, Divine Sense Fire surging and rolling as he carved spirit arrays inside the cauldron.

With his movements, the heat inside the cauldron seemed to fluctuate unpredictably.

Alchemy required a calm mind; impatience was the greatest taboo. The most important thing was control over the heat and the timing of adding ingredients…

This was not something that could be mastered overnight, but required long experience and the guidance of teachers.

In the path of alchemy, Yang Kai had never had anyone to guide him.

Yet he seemed to have an extraordinary talent and aptitude for this domain. In his early years, he relied on the True Alchemy Formula left by the Great Demon God to explore the path himself. Later, in Yang Yan’s Imperial Garden, he obtained the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy. After coming to the Star Realm, he acquired a jade slip left by Gongsun Mu…

His alchemy combined the strengths of three schools, along with his own insights and innovations.

He was not like Xia Ningshang, who had a special physique and treated alchemy as easily as eating or breathing, but Yang Kai had his own unique sense for it.

When to add which ingredient and when to control the heat—these things seemed engraved in his mind from birth, instinctual.

If one had to trace it, it was undoubtedly thanks to the Great Dao Pill Tone he triggered when refining a Spiritual Pill!

That Great Dao Pill Tone was the sound of the Heavenly Dao.

The Heavenly Dao imparted this knowledge to him, elevating his alchemy skills.

Even so, this time Yang Kai was going all out, not daring to be the least bit careless.

There was only one Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. If he failed, there would be nothing left, and he would surely face the wrath of everyone present…

He wasn’t afraid of these martial artists; he only feared wasting the Spiritual Medicine for nothing.

Under immense pressure, he was in the best state he’d ever been.

Gurgle gurgle…

As time passed, bubbling sounds like boiling water came from the cauldron. It was a sign the medicinal liquid was boiling, and a complex yet delightful fragrance filled the world, making everyone feel refreshed.

Looking over, Yang Kai’s movements weren’t fast, but every gesture exuded steadiness, giving everyone more confidence in his refining.

Especially as he used one hand to control the heat with Origin Qi and the other to form seals and carve spirit arrays in the cauldron, many watched in awe.

An outsider might only see the excitement, but only an expert could truly appreciate the skill involved.

Although nearly ninety-nine percent of the cultivators here had never refined a Spiritual Pill themselves, it was like the old saying: even if you’ve never eaten pork, you’ve at least seen a pig run. 

Yang Kai’s repeated and ever-changing manipulation of the spirit arrays left everyone utterly baffled, yet filled them with admiration.

Such exquisite control was not something ordinary people could achieve; it was surely the result of accumulated practice.

“Senior Brother, do you think Junior Brother Yang can succeed?” Nearby, Murong Xiaoxiao softly asked Xiao Baiyi.

“No one can say until the result is out,” Xiao Baiyi replied. After speaking, he glanced at her and said, “Why, are you worried he’ll be beaten up if he fails?”

Murong Xiaoxiao nodded, “Given the current situation, if Junior Brother Yang really fails, he probably won’t be able to escape… He may not be a disciple of our Shrine, but he did come with us. Senior Brother, you don’t want anything to happen to him either, right?”

“He brought it on himself.” Xiao Baiyi snorted coldly. “I still don’t understand why he’s making trouble for himself.”

Indeed, if Yang Kai hadn’t stepped forward and claimed to be a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist, no one would have forced him. But he insisted on admitting it in public and took on the task of refining the Supreme Mystic Pill.

If he succeeded in this task and the Supreme Mystic Pill was truly refined, it was doubtful he would gain much benefit. Judging by the current situation, once the pill was formed, it would inevitably spark a fierce struggle among the gathered experts. Who would care about the alchemist who refined it? If he dared refuse to hand over the Spiritual Pill, he would be beaten within an inch of his life…

But if he failed, there was only one outcome—Yang Kai would be hunted down by everyone!

The more one thought about it, the more it seemed like a fool’s errand.

So Xiao Baiyi never understood why Yang Kai was doing this.

Was it just because alchemists loved rare Spiritual Medicines? It was said that alchemists were an eccentric bunch. Usually, when others asked them to refine pills, they were indifferent, but if there was a Spiritual Medicine they were interested in, they might even come to you and beg to refine it for free.

The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus was undoubtedly one of the world’s most precious Spiritual Medicines, unique in all existence! With one in the world, there could never be a second.

If Yang Kai insisted on refining the Supreme Mystic Pill for this reason, it made sense.

But… Xiao Baiyi didn’t think Yang Kai was that stubborn. He had no reason to risk himself just for a moment’s interest.

Or… did he have the ability to escape under the eyes of so many experts?

As this thought arose, Xiao Baiyi couldn’t help but sneer, thinking he was overthinking it.

Admittedly, Yang Kai was indeed strong, but he was just one person. How could he escape under so many eyes? Wuchang alone was enough to pin him down.

As the two spoke, Yang Kai made another move.

All nineteen auxiliary ingredients had been thrown into the Ink Jade Cauldron and turned into medicinal liquid.

At that moment, he suddenly stood up, strode to the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, and, with fingers like blades, sliced at the base of the flower.

The now-mature Spiritual Medicine was instantly picked by Yang Kai.

A section of root about half a foot long was left behind…

In an instant, everyone’s eyes turned to the root, greed flashing across their faces.

Although they didn’t know why Yang Kai hadn’t picked the entire Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, this section of root was undoubtedly precious. Even if not refined into a pill, swallowing it would likely have miraculous effects.

Under everyone’s gaze, milky white sap oozed from the tip of the root, pure as milk, making mouths water.

Not only ordinary martial artists, but even Wuchang, Xia Sheng, and the others stared. However, they didn’t act rashly; they looked to Yang Kai for an explanation.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai hurried back to the cauldron, carefully controlling the heat. When the time was right, he put the freshly picked Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus into the cauldron.

Just a few simple actions left his forehead beaded with sweat, as if facing a great enemy.

The moment the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus entered the cauldron, he immediately changed his seals to stabilize the situation inside.

The whooshing sounds continued. Yang Kai secretly rejoiced that before starting this refinement, he had summoned Liu Yan, even at the risk of exposing her.

The difficulty of refining the Supreme Mystic Pill was beyond his imagination. If not for Liu Yan’s help, he might not have been able to hold out!
