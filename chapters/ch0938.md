## Chapter 938 — The Altar

Inside the Enchantress Queen's palace, the Lightning Shadow King arrogantly tilted his head back, wearing an expression of defiance as if prepared to die rather than submit.

Yang Kai gave him a cold glance and waved his hand. "Get lost. I'm not interested in killing you."

The Shadow King looked at Yang Kai in surprised disbelief, clearly not expecting to be spared.

Over the years he had hidden his name and lived like a beggar to avoid trouble from the experts in Zhongdu; now that he had fallen into Yang Kai's hands, did he actually still stand a chance at escape?

"Haven't you heard me? Get out!" Yang Kai barked.

Gritting his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead, the Shadow King felt humiliated—he was, after all, a Shadow King, and had endured scorn and disgrace to survive—yet this young man treated him with contempt, shouting at him as if he were nothing, and that stoked a furious resentment in his heart.

He took on the posture of someone ready to fight Yang Kai to the death.

In the end he forced himself to calm down and coldly said, "Before Shan Qingluo left, she went to the Spider Mother's Nest. She seemed to find something there. If you're looking for her, that place might hold some clues."

With that he vanished like lightning.

"The Spider Mother's Nest..." Yang Kai murmured. He recalled the place clearly; long ago it had been home to a Seventh-Tier demonic beast that could communicate with humans by spirit— the Spider Mother.

It was also the only Seventh-Tier demonic beast in the entire world.

Shan Qingluo's Poison Widow constitution came from it, and the emotional venom sealed within her had been resolved by the Spider Mother's Inner Core.

"Young Master Yang..." Yunli called softly. "Are you going to look for Her Majesty?"

"I'll go see. She might not still be there—no, she likely left long ago."

"Oh. Then please be careful on your way, Young Master Yang." Yunli and the two others, Ruoyu and Ruoqing, inclined their heads slightly and did not press him to stay.

Yang Kai glanced at them and suddenly asked, "Your mistress is gone—why are you still here?"

Yunli smiled faintly, a trace of disappointment in her voice. "Where else would we go? Staying here at least gives us a place to live. If we go elsewhere, with our looks and our lack of strength, you know what we'd face out in the world."

The three women—one grown and two younger—were all attractive but lacked much power. Without the protection of this place, they would only become playthings for men.

"I'll take you with me. Will you come?" Yang Kai asked on impulse.

Yunli's eyes brightened. She exchanged a look with Ruoyu and Ruoqing and the three nodded together. "Yes. If one day Young Master Yang reunites with Her Majesty, we can continue serving her."

"Then pack up; I'll be back as soon as I can. Ask the others in the palace if they want to go too—I remember there were two more maids, right?" Yang Kai instructed, and Yunli hurried to obey.

Half an hour later, at the Spider Mother's Nest.

Yang Kai hovered in midair, looking down at the enormous spider statue below.

He had never wondered how such a colossal spider statue had come to be; returning after a decade and more, he suddenly felt something was off.

There had once been countless giant spiders here, and the Spider Mother had lived among them, but they were still demonic beasts—how could they have possibly constructed such a statue?

The statue looked ancient and weathered; Yang Kai guessed it must be at least several thousand, perhaps tens of thousands, of years old.

Now the Spider Mother's Nest was utterly lifeless; after the Spider Mother's death, the giant spiders that had lived here had vanished, and when Yang Kai arrived there wasn't a single living creature to be seen.

He dropped down and approached the statue, entering through the giant spider's mouth.

Inside the statue was a vast chamber coated with viscous webbing; a thick layer of dust lay on the floor—no one had been here in years.

As Yang Kai scanned the chamber, his expression flickered. In one direction he spotted something that resembled an altar, its grooves and ridges forming a strange array, and within that array there were patches of dark material.

At a glance he recognized that the dark patches were the remnants of blood congealed and dried.

The altar was small—big enough for two or three people to stand upon. Yang Kai focused and could clearly see two different sets of shoe prints, tracks that, stained with blood, would never be erased.

Had Shan Qingluo and Biluo left those prints?

Yang Kai couldn't be sure, but he felt a faint trace of void energy emanating from the altar—thin, yet impossible to hide from his perception.

The altar was damaged, riddled with countless cracks. When Yang Kai reached out to touch it, it could not bear even that and collapsed into pieces.

Staring at the scene before him, Yang Kai's thoughts churned.

With the strange array on the altar and the lingering aura of void force, it was easy to deduce that a Void Passage had once appeared here.

If those two bloodstained shoe prints did indeed belong to Shan Qingluo and Biluo, then they must have passed through the Void Passage and left this world.

Where would they have gone?

When she had separated from that enchantress, Shan Qingluo had only been at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—such power was insignificant on the Tongxuan Continent.

He searched a while longer but found no useful clues, so he left the statue and pressed his palm into the void.

Heaven-Covering Palm!

A massive palm imprint descended from the sky and struck the spider statue; rock tumbled, the statue shattered, and dust burst up as it was buried beneath the earth forever.

Yang Kai's mood was tangled and complex.

On this trip out of Zhongdu he had only visited two places and tried to bring two groups of people to the Tongxuan Continent. He had not expected that Xiao Fusheng of Yao Wang Valley had already passed away; Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan had willingly remained to guard his ancestral tomb; and Shan Qingluo of Piaoxiang City had vanished without a trace.

None of the things he had planned had been accomplished.

Helpless, he returned to the palace in Piaoxiang City. Yunli and the maids were ready; aside from Ruoyu and Ruoqing, there were indeed two other maids remaining in the palace. Yang Kai took them all and flew toward Zhongdu.

Half a day later, he returned to the Yang Family.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive with five beauties, Li Rong and Han Fei's expressions instantly turned odd.

Yang Kai had no patience to explain; he only told Fourth Master Yang to make arrangements for Yunli and the others. Until Shan Qingluo reappeared, these five women would remain at the Yang household as maids.

Fourth Master Yang agreed at once.

"Yang Kai!"

"Cousin!"

Two voices called from nearby. Yang Kai turned and saw the Dong siblings, Dong Qinghan and Dong Qingyan, running toward him.

Fatty Dong no longer appeared fat—he had lost dozens of pounds and now looked tall, powerful, and imposing.

Dong Qingyan had come into her own, tall and graceful, her figure pleasing to the eye.

Yang Kai brightened and grinned.

When he had returned a few days ago he had met many old friends but hadn't seen anyone from the Dong family; only now did the cousins appear before him.

Dong Qingyan rushed up, her eyes appraising Yang Kai, and with a smile she said, "Cousin, it's been over ten years—you've become much more handsome."

"Flatterer." Yang Kai was delighted. Dong Qingyan chuckled slyly and extended her small hand. "So, cousin, do you have any gifts?"

Yang Kai was taken aback.

Dong Fatty looked on with glee, his face full of schadenfreude.

"Here, take this." Yang Kai casually took out a crystal stone and handed it to Dong Qingyan, adopting a serious tone. "Treasure it. It contains vast energy that can be directly absorbed and converted into True Yuan. Whether for recovery or cultivation, it will be of great benefit."

Dong Qingyan's eyes shone as she clutched the crystal stone and praised it repeatedly. "It's so clear and beautiful, like a huge gem—you're really giving this to me?"

“Since when has there ever been reason to take back what’s already been given?”

"Thank you, cousin!" Dong Qingyan was ecstatic and carefully placed the crystal stone in her pouch with a satisfied look.

Li Rong and Han Fei stood nearby, pitying the girl for being so easily fooled by Yang Kai, yet too embarrassed to call him out on the truth that the crystal stone wasn't truly valuable; they shook their heads and smiled wryly.

"Little sister, go play to the side; I have something to discuss with Yang Kai." Dong Qinghan gave Dong Qingyan a signal.

"All this secrecy—there must be something interesting going on," Dong Qingyan sniffed and darted away.

Left alone, Dong Qinghan lowered his voice and asked, "I've heard you're taking the Yang family to a place called the Tongxuan Continent."

"Yes. How will the Dong family arrange things? My parents should have sent word to you."

"It was precisely upon receiving notice from my aunt and uncle that I rushed over. The Dong family is packing up and intends to follow your household's lead." Dong Qinghan's expression grew serious as he asked, "But is this plan reliable?"

"If it weren't reliable, would I have the whole family follow me? I'm not that reckless." Yang Kai arched an eyebrow.

"That's true, but... suddenly leaving home to go to an unknown land makes people uneasy."

“You’ll get used to it in time.” Yang Kai offered comfort. “When I first went over there, I was just as confused. But that side holds more wonders and more opportunities—it’s a place made for the young.”

"Ha!" Dong Qinghan laughed. "I only asked casually, but since Qiu Yimeng has chosen to go with you, this matter can't be bad. Honestly, I trust Miss Qiu's judgment."

Yang Kai was speechless.

"When will your family set out?"

"As soon as possible. The journey is long; even on the fastest route it'll take three to four months, and any delays will only make it longer."

"Three to four months?" Dong Qinghan's face changed.

"The Tongxuan Continent is vast beyond your imagination. You don't need to come to Zhongdu to join us—send word home to finish packing and head to Lingxiao Pavilion; we'll pass by there on our way."

"Understood." Dong Qinghan nodded solemnly. "I'll arrange it now."
