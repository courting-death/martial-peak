## Chapter 1232 — Transaction

"A million... hehe." Li Younan chuckled lightly, feigning indifference, and looked at Fang Tianzhong. "Brother Fang thinks this Red Candle Fruit meat is only worth a million? If that is truly the case, then I, Li, will take my leave!"

"Five million!" Fang Tianzhong's expression did not change, yet the price he offered instantly multiplied fivefold.

Li Younan's lifted step halted, revealing a trace of excitement.

This time, although his Medicine Pill Sect had failed to snatch a Red Candle Fruit, if each of the forces that obtained one paid him five million, the haul from this trip would still be considerable.

Moreover, once a Red Candle Fruit had been cut open, its meat's value was not quite so miraculous.

So he hesitated for a moment, weighing whether he should continue to raise the bid.

As he pondered, over at Liuli Sect, Yin Sudie suddenly cast her beautiful eyes toward Daiyuan; her red lips twitched a few times, as if she were sending a whispered transmission to Daiyuan.

Daiyuan's fine brows knitted and a hint of displeasure appeared on her face, but she sent a transmission back.

The next moment, joy lit up Yin Sudie's alluring features; she giggled, "Senior Brothers, continue your deliberations, Little Sister will take her leave first."

Saying so, she led several Liuli Sect elites and departed swiftly.

The crowd was stunned, for just now Yin Sudie had, by means of that ribbon-like Secret Treasure in her hand, dramatically snatched a slice of the fruit meat—yet she seemed ready to leave before securing any preservation method.

But soon, everyone relaxed.

Among everyone present, when it came to mastery of the Dao of Medicine, none could compare to Li Younan, the elite disciple of the Medicine Pill Sect — except perhaps Daiyuan. It seemed Yin Sudie had learned something from Daiyuan, which explained why she had so decisively chosen to withdraw.

Bearing a precious treasure, Yin Sudie naturally did not wish to linger in this den of trouble.

For a while, several people shot burning glances at Daiyuan, as if hoping to learn from her how to properly preserve the Red Candle Fruit's medicinal efficacy.

Seeing this, Li Younan realized that if he didn’t agree now, he’d lose his share of the five million altogether. Earlier, in his frustration, he had forgotten about Daiyuan’s presence — though she hailed from Liuli Sect, for certain special reasons she had long devoted herself to the study of the Dao of Medicine. She must surely also know the method to preserve the Red Candle Fruit. Regretting his oversight, he hastily nodded to Fang Tianzhong and said, “Very well, five million it is — I’ll go along with Brother Fang’s proposal!”

Fang Tianzhong gave a slight nod, showing no sign of regret. Li Younan quickly transmitted a few words; after a brief thought, Fang Tianzhong silently led the Leitai Sect members and departed at once.

Elsewhere, Qu Changfeng and that burly yet imposing man hesitated for a moment, transmitted a few words to Li Younan as well, and then each, clearly satisfied, took their leave.

"Let's go too," Wei Guchang grinned; he too had obtained a slice of Red Candle Fruit meat. Although Yingyue Hall had sent very few people this time—only he and Xuan'er—luck could not be resisted. He had expected nothing, yet when that Star Emperor Sect disciple cut open the Red Candle Fruit a slice flew to him and he collected it at once. It had been as simple and effortless as could be, an utterly staggering stroke of luck compared to others who had fought tooth and nail.

It seemed the streak of bad luck that had dogged him since entering the Third Layer of Flowing Flame Sandland had suddenly vanished.

And since Daiyuan and Xuan'er were close, Daiyuan would not be stingy in sharing preservation methods; thus he need not strike any deal with Li Younan.

"Brother Wei, wait!" Li Younan cried, seeing him about to leave.

"What is it, Brother Li? Have you something to say?" Wei Guchang halted, turned abruptly, his face cold as latent power gathered around him, ready to act.

Seeing his hostile stance, Li Younan immediately realized he had been misunderstood and waved his hands repeatedly: "Brother Wei, you needn't be so tense. Though you and I have not crossed paths much, I am not a treacherous man—this you should know."

Hearing this, Wei Guchang’s guarded expression eased slightly. He gave a small nod and said, “Brother Li’s character, I am naturally well aware of. It’s just… hehe, this isn’t a place we should linger in for long.”

As he spoke he glanced around, and the many martial artists who had gained nothing from this scramble for the Red Candle Fruit were staring at Wei Guchang, considering whether to seize him now and detain him.

Seeing this, Li Younan raised his voice: "Everyone, stay calm. If it were an intact Red Candle Fruit it would be worth fighting over, but now the fruit has been cut into several parts and Brother Wei only has one slice; how much efficacy it holds is unknown. You wouldn't want to invite a powerful enemy over such an uncertain thing, would you?"

Li Younan had unexpectedly spoken for Wei Guchang, pulling him out of the vortex of trouble, which left Wei with an oddly unsettled expression.

"Brother Li, I have but one question—can a cut Red Candle Fruit possess medicinal effects capable of allowing Origin Returning Realm experts to break through their shackles?" asked a young man in white, frowning; embroidered on his white robe's chest was a white cloud.

This was the sect emblem of Piaomiao Hall.

"Brother Tang asks well," Li Younan nodded. "But I cannot answer that. Even of the Red Candle Fruit I have only heard rumors; this is the first time I've seen one with my own eyes. I believe even my master could not give a definite answer. The Red Candle Fruit's effects might enable Origin Returning Realm experts to break through their shackles—it's only a possibility. Now that it's been divided into parts, that possibility... Brother Tang should understand without my saying."

The Piaomiao Hall youth surnamed Tang frowned, pondered, then nodded, "I understand. I take my leave!"

With that he immediately led Piaomiao Hall's disciples away.

Witnessing that Tang Yongyi of Piaomiao Hall had no further designs on the Red Candle Fruit, the warriors of the other forces privately sighed and one by one departed.

Soon the valley held only the Medicine Pill Sect and Yingyue Hall.

Wei Guchang regarded Li Younan with an ambiguous smile. He had said nothing all along, but that smile was full of meaning; he did not believe Li had helped him for no reason—obviously Li had some design. But Li said nothing, and Wei was not foolish enough to ask.

"Now, Brother Wei, may we speak properly?" Li Younan asked with a touch of self-satisfaction, as if proud to have dismissed everyone with a few words.

"If Brother Li has business, speak plainly," Wei Guchang nodded.

"I wish to ask whether Brother Wei intends to sell that slice of Red Candle Fruit meat?" Li Younan stopped skirting the issue and asked outright.

"Sell it?" Wei Guchang's eyelids narrowed. "Brother Li wishes to buy?"

"Precisely," Li Younan said seriously, nodding.

Wei Guchang chuckled, "Did you not just say, Brother Li, that this slice's value is far less than before? Why would you buy such a thing?"

Li Younan shook his head and said solemnly, "Even if the Red Candle Fruit meat's value is much diminished, it is still an unprecedented spirit fruit that appears once in ten thousand years. Our Medicine Pill Sect dedicates itself to all manner of Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines and to the refinement of Pills. With such an opportunity before us, if I do nothing I would surely be rebuked by our elders upon return. Buying it back might allow our elders to study it and possibly make great breakthroughs in pill refinement. Moreover, if Brother Wei is willing to sell that slice to me, I can guarantee to represent Medicine Pill Sect in providing Yingyue Hall adequate compensation, and I can promise—on behalf of our five elders—that they will refine five Pills for you free of charge!"

Wei Guchang had originally been dismissive, but upon hearing the final term his expression changed immediately and he could no longer voice a refusal.

After all, the Red Candle Fruit's effects were only rumor; no one knew its true worth—it might be worthless once cut. Yet the chance to have Medicine Pill Sect's five elders personally refine Pills was extremely rare.

In recent years those five elders seldom intervened; whenever they did, other forces paid enormous sums to secure their services.

Faced with that comparison, Wei Guchang found himself hard-pressed to decide.

But soon he said, "Brother Li, even if I do not say it, you must know this is not a decision I can make alone. If you truly wish Medicine Pill Sect to purchase this slice from me, wait until we exit Flowing Flame Sandland and have Medicine Pill Sect's elders come to Yingyue Hall to negotiate; whatever you and I say here will count for little."

"I am of course aware," Li Younan replied. Seeing that Wei did not refuse outright and that there was room for negotiation, he brightened and said, "Then let this matter wait until Flowing Flame Sandland closes and our elders can discuss it."

"That would be best," Wei Guchang agreed, nodding. "If Brother Li has nothing else to say, I will take my leave."

"Please, Brother Wei," Li Younan smiled warmly and did not stop him.

Once the valley was empty, Li Younan's expression grew grave as he looked toward a spot in the valley where a shriveled corpse lay, as if it had been dead for untold years.

It was the junior brother he had earlier sent to stealthily collect the Red Candle Base, yet now the junior brother had met some unknown foul hand and died a pitiable death; even his Spatial Ring had vanished.

Li Younan's face turned dark; without mentioning the junior brother he stamped his foot and ordered, "Go—return to the Sect!"

"Ah? Senior Brother Li, are we leaving now? There are still two to three months before Flowing Flame Sandland closes," one of the women cried in surprise.

"No need to stay. The Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area has been ransacked countless times by those people, and the Third Layer is fraught with danger—any good items have likely already been taken. We must hurry back and report the matter of the Red Candle Fruit, see if we can seize the initiative so our Senior Uncles might visit those forces early to negotiate purchasing the Red Candle Fruit meat."

"Oh."

Li Younan sneered lightly, "Even if they seize the Red Candle Fruit meat, in the end they'll likely have to come to our Medicine Pill Sect. Apart from us, others know little of such things and surely won't dare to use it rashly, so we still hold the initiative."

Hearing him, those Medicine Pill Sect disciples who had gained nothing were stunned; the previous dejection and gloom vanished and they all broke into smiles, as if suddenly realizing the great value of their sect's existence.
