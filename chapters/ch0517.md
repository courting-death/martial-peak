## Chapter 517 — Failed?

The warriors from Yang Kai’s residence were about to set out under Qiu Yimeng’s lead when Di Mo suddenly appeared beside her, frowning as he said, “No need to leave. The Young Master seems to have returned.”

“Returned?” Qiu Yimeng immediately exhaled in relief. Since Yang Kai and Ying Jiu had left, she had been on pins and needles, fearing some accident had befallen them. Now hearing Di Mo’s words, she let down her guard and urgently asked, “Where is he now?”

Di Mo’s expression turned cold as he secretly probed for some time before solemnly replying, “He has come back, but it seems he has no intention of returning to the residence. He is heading southeast.”

“Southeast…” Qiu Yimeng muttered, her expression shifting. “That is the location of Yang Zhao’s residence!”

“Who offended the Young Master so? He is very angry now!” Di Mo took a deep breath. “I will go escort him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a streak of blood light and vanished.

Qiu Yimeng’s face instantly flushed, not daring to hesitate, she hurriedly led the residence’s experts out.

At the same time, Meng Wuya, who was meditating in a room, slowly opened his eyes, furrowing his brow. His gaze fixed on Yang Kai’s location as he muttered, “What the hell is that brat doing? Such a dense murderous aura.”

Speaking, he quickly stood up, opened the door, and stared toward the horizon. The sky was covered with dark clouds, not a trace of sunlight visible. It seemed the entire War City had fallen into darkness. The rolling black clouds, like cotton drenched in ink, pressed heavily upon everyone’s hearts.

With a slight sigh, Meng Wuya took several steps and floated several hundred zhang away.

At Fengshen Hall, the eight Divine Roamings seated atop the high platform also withdrew from the small world of intertwined Divine Sense, exchanging glances. Their cloudy old eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

Daoist Qiu pondered for a moment before saying, “Brother Yang, it seems your young one is showing signs of Entering Demonic State.”

Yang Liting remained indifferent, closing his eyes without a word.

The fat old man chuckled, “You won’t care? Letting him continue like this could very well lead him to enter the demonic path.”

Only then did Yang Liting open his eyes, saying coldly, “One’s path is one’s own. I have no leisure to concern myself with his life or death.”

“What if he truly changes his nature and turns into a heretic?” Kang Family’s Divine Roaming Master frowned. A young man with such a dense Sinister Yin Aura would inevitably be influenced at heart, plunging into the path of evil and becoming a ruthless fiend who would kill even his own kin.

“In that case, I will personally deal with him. Kang brother, there’s no need for your worry,” Yang Liting responded coldly.

The other seven no longer tried to persuade him and shook their heads silently. They secretly felt that although the Yang Family was strong, such dominance would not last long. Their familial bonds were too weak. If a similar situation happened within their own families, they would never stand idly by. They would have dispatched forces long ago to retrieve their wayward disciples and disciplined them to suppress the evil factors within.

Moreover, that brat was exceptionally talented and might become a future star of the Yang Family. Yet Yang Liting was willing to let him be and ignore him.

The seven found this hard to comprehend.

But since it was another’s family affair, and since they all lived long lives and had indifferent hearts, they did not bother. Some even felt a perverse pleasure in watching such scenes unfold.

The Yang Family had held the title of “Number One of Zhongdu” for a long time, yet if matters continued on this course, they would lose out to the other Seven Great Families within a century.

It was laughable that what was obvious to the Seven Great Families was missed by the Yang Family themselves.

***

At Yang Zhao’s residence.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu slunk back like lost dogs, their hurried voices rousing Yang Zhao from bed.

He promptly rose and looked outside.

“Second Young Master, what happened?” Ye Xinrou twisted her waist like a water snake, her snow-white skin exposed to the air. Her two slim legs were wrapped around Yang Zhao’s waist. Her eyes shimmered drowsily and her cheeks flushed with excitement.

“Something’s wrong. I think I heard Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s voices,” Yang Zhao frowned.

“They’ve returned?” Ye Xinrou smiled radiantly, adding a venal charm to her beauty. “Then they must bring you good news.”

Yang Zhao chuckled softly, reaching out to pinch Ye Xinrou’s full and firm chest, causing waves of flesh to ripple impressively.

His rough action drew a coquettish cry from Ye Xinrou, who glared at him playfully.

“Let’s hope so!” Yang Zhao also silently hoped. This operation had been conducted without anyone noticing. He had great trust in Kang Zhan, Qiu Ziru, and the others. These past few days he had been waiting for news, unable to focus on cultivation, so he had sprawled with Ye Xinrou in intimacy, easing his anxiety and the torment of waiting.

With his character, there was no way he could reveal such leisure and openness in broad daylight. While beauty was tempting, he valued his power and control far more.

As long as he could defeat Yang Kai in the Succession War, his eldest brother Yang Wei would pose no threat, and he would easily win the ultimate victory.

“If it’s good news, we can wait a moment longer to hear it,” Ye Xinrou said seductively, wrapping her jade arm around Yang Zhao’s neck, pulling him down in a bid to detain him a while longer.

“Don’t be silly. If the news is indeed good, I’ll reward you tonight!” Yang Zhao’s eyes sparkled with hope, showing no hint of lechery, only endless anticipation.

Although feeling somewhat disappointed, Ye Xinrou no longer persisted. Against Yang Zhao’s type, her body’s little tricks were hardly decisive.

“Then I’ll help you get dressed.” Ye Xinrou obediently sat up, retrieving their disheveled clothes from the bed and dressing Yang Zhao.

Just after putting on the first garment, Yang Zhao’s expression suddenly changed and Ye Xinrou stopped mid-motion. Both had just heard the urgent and almost despairing, frantic shouts of Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

Immediately, they realized something was wrong.

If the two had truly returned with good news for Yang Zhao, they would not behave so.

“Second Young Master! Second Young Master!” Footsteps and shouts echoed outside the door from Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

Yang Zhao’s expression turned grim. He swiftly stepped outside, opened the door, and glanced at the two, his face turning ashen.

Both looked worse for wear, bearing many scars, their complexions pale. The True Yuan flowing within them was barely perceptible. They resembled lost dogs pursued home.

Ye Xinrou cried out in shock, quickly retreating under the covers to hide her pristine body and prevent exposure, listening carefully.

“What happened?” Yang Zhao took a deep breath, trying to calm his rising emotions and asked in a deep voice.

From their appearance and expressions, he already suspected much, but dared not believe his suspicions true.

“Second Young Master...” Nan Sheng pressed his dry, colorless lips but could say no more.

Yang Zhao immediately turned his gaze to Xiang Chu, who appeared embarrassed and resentful.

“Failed?” Yang Zhao asked coldly, a blade-like chill at the corner of his mouth.

Nan Sheng remained silent, face flushed. Xiang Chu forced himself to speak, “I’m sorry to disappoint the Second Young Master.”

Yang Zhao staggered slightly, staring at them in disbelief. Though he had a vague suspicion, upon confirmation, he still found it hard to accept.

He had mobilized so many, arranged an impeccable formation and unrivaled strength—how could they still fail?

“Explain the reason!” Yang Zhao’s expression sharply chilled as he shouted.

“Ying Jiu has already reached Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage!” Xiang Chu ground out. None had expected this. Ying Jiu at Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage was already headache-inducing enough to make Yang Zhao summon two Divine Roaming Peak masters to counter him. Now he had ascended to the Ninth Stage?

Blood Servants at Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage could most likely only be countered by equal Blood Servants or those beyond Divine Roaming Realm.

Hearing this, Yang Zhao was stunned but somewhat eased. Faulty intelligence clearly accounted for most of the operation’s failure.

“Anything else? Even if Ying Jiu reached Ninth Stage, you shouldn’t have failed. I gave you enough people to hold back the Ascended Ying Jiu,” Yang Zhao said coldly, gathering his wits.

“Ying Jiu was indeed restrained...” Xiang Chu’s face turned bitter as he recalled their ordeal, shivering all over, “But Yang Kai has two Mystery-Grade secret treasures...”

He briefly recounted the previous encounter.

Yang Zhao grew increasingly cold inside, realizing just how terrifying his Ninth Brother was.

“Where are Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru? Why have only you two returned?” Yang Zhao suddenly refocused and asked.

“Young Master Kang was pierced through the right chest by a sword from Yang Kai. He was severely injured and should still be recovering.”

“What?” Yang Zhao’s eyes widened. Ye Xinrou, lying on the bed, screamed and covered her mouth, her eyes filled with strange light.

Kang Zhan being pierced in the chest by Yang Kai... this news was explosive.

Never before had any young scion of the Eight Great Families been so severely wounded during a Succession War. Historical records spoke only of minor injuries, easily healed in a few days.

But this time, the Kang Family’s future heir was stabbed!

The news stunned Yang Zhao and Ye Xinrou. They hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so audacious.

“What about Qiu Ziru?”

“Unknown. We separated on the way back and don’t know his whereabouts.”

“Good, good, good!” Yang Zhao suddenly laughed loudly, laughter rolling like thunder. Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng felt suffocated with humiliation, wishing to disappear underground.

“You are impressive! To be so thoroughly beaten by my Ninth Brother! You all are truly talented scions from prestigious families, usually arrogant and boastful. Now you are like lost dogs! You brought so many people and yet couldn’t capture just my Ninth Brother. What good are you?”

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng were scolded relentlessly. Though indignant, they dared not retort.
