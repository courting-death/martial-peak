## Chapter 1113 — A Few More Drops

"Yang Flame..." Yang Kai held Yang Flame tightly, his Divine Sense sweeping over her; after a moment's inspection he calmed down — things were not as he had feared. She bore no signs of injury, but she had clearly been terribly frightened, her spirit now somewhat unstable.

Gently patting her back, Yang Flame painfully lifted her head to look at Yang Kai; her face went even paler, she staggered to one side and began to heave, retching as if trying to vomit her entrails out.

Yang Kai looked at her with a strange expression.

After a long moment, Yang Flame whispered, "Yang Kai, I'm a little dizzy..."

She had barely finished speaking before she went rigid and collapsed.

Really? Yang Kai could only laugh and cry at the same time. He hurried forward to support her, finding that she had indeed fainted; her face remained deathly pale, and her soft, boneless body was icy cold.

Yang Kai sighed, shook his head, and lifted Yang Flame in his arms by the waist, heading toward the cave.

The cave had not been badly damaged — the fight here had been too brief — and the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags Yang Kai had set up were still in place. Back in the stone chamber, Yang Kai laid Yang Flame on the bed and covered her with a quilt, looking at her unconscious face with a mix of pity and amusement.

Yang Kai had been ready to drive that Xu Tianze to his doom, but with Yang Flame in this condition he couldn't conveniently leave; he had to stay and keep watch.

He had not been on Dark Star for long and had been keeping to himself; now he had somehow attracted trouble. He naturally didn't want to let anyone go, but even if Xu Tianze returned with reinforcements he was not afraid.

According to Wu Yi, there were no Void King Realm experts on Dark Star; the Haike Family's finest were only at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Xu Tianze clearly wasn't from a major power and likely couldn't find any decent masters to back him.

Yang Flame slept for several days straight. Whatever nightmare she was having, she would occasionally cry out in terror; each time Yang Kai had to soothe her for a while before she could calm down.

On the third day, Yang Flame finally came back to consciousness.

Yang Kai sat at the bedside watching her; after a short exchange of glances Yang Flame turned her head away in embarrassment, her cheeks flushing.

"Eat something first." Yang Kai tossed a parcel toward her.

Seemingly catching the scent of fruit and clearly in need of replenishment, Yang Flame immediately climbed up, unwrapped the parcel, and when she saw the yellow-orange fruits inside she beamed and began to eat. Her pallor gradually flushed back into her cheeks.

Seeing her color return, Yang Kai asked curiously, "You've never seen a dead person?"

The reason Yang Flame had fainted was not physical injury but fright — she had been terror-stricken by the gruesome sight of those who died before her. Yang Kai had long known she was timid, but he hadn't realized it was to this degree; just a few unrelated deaths put her out for three days. If she had witnessed a truly blood-soaked battlefield, would she even survive?

Yang Kai also understood that everyone had a first time. Although his own first killing had not left him as broken as Yang Flame, his emotions had still surged violently; his endurance, however, was far greater than hers, and his psychological resolve was not something she could match.

Yang Kai's one question ruined the moment: Yang Flame, who had been eating with relish, instantly put down the fruit and covered her mouth.

"You didn't, did you?" Yang Kai was astonished. He thought: it's already been three days, and there are still aftereffects? How on earth had this girl survived in this chaotic world? With her timid nature, Yang Kai felt it was a miracle she had made it this far.

Yang Flame held a bitter expression and didn't answer, only waving at Yang Kai and taking deep, rapid breaths until she gradually steadied.

"I've seen dead people before, but never such a disgusting way to die..." Yang Flame looked at Yang Kai with lingering dread. Those people had been burned alive; what she couldn't endure most was the charred smell that filled her nostrils.

She had never known that roasted human flesh smelled like that.

"Alright, next time I kill someone, you should close your eyes," Yang Kai sighed.

"There will be a next time?" Yang Flame's face soured.

"Maybe!" Yang Kai nodded. "Enough of that — keep eating."

"Oh." Yang Flame nodded, picked up the fruit and ate; after a moment she asked curiously, "Where did these come from? They seem to calm the mind and restore strength."

"Given by someone else." Yang Kai didn't say who. Although these fruits were rare, they weren't especially valuable — otherwise Qian Tong wouldn't have been so generous.

"By the way, did you buy back the ores?" Yang Flame asked.

"I bought them, but rest for a few more days — wait until you're fully recovered before you begin forging." Yang Kai wasn't comfortable having her refine an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure in her current state. Forging and alchemy required a calm mind; any outside interference could cause irreparable loss.

"Okay."

Yang Flame rested several more days before taking a large amount of precious ore from Yang Kai and entering seclusion to refine. She seemed to have forgotten the earlier events.

The woman was simple-minded; timid as a mouse, yet such a person lived lightly because she didn't fret over many things and was easily contented.

With Yang Flame monopolizing his stone chamber and the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags, Yang Kai left the cave and found a nearby quiet spot to sit cross-legged, looking at the misty mountains and feeling pleased with the changes here.

Several months had passed since he set up the formations in these mountains, and the gathering of Spiritual Qi was beginning to show results. The drifting mist at the mountain top grew denser, indicating the local Spiritual Qi was gradually strengthening.

Yang Kai wasn't in the cave, but his Divine Sense remained over there constantly, in case something happened to Yang Flame or Xu Tianze came back with people to disturb her forging.

Yang Flame was now forging the Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure Yang Kai had requested; at such a critical time he wouldn't allow any accidents.

Days passed by uneventfully.

One day, while Yang Kai was meditating, a voice suddenly rang in his mind: "I have recovered."

Hearing that, Yang Kai was overjoyed; he immediately realized the Divine Tree had awakened.

The last time on Rainfall Star, to dispel the Profound Yin Moon Water poison in Xue Yue, Yang Kai had leaned on the Divine Tree's power, which had consumed it greatly and sent it into slumber. Now, after several years, the Divine Tree had finally awakened.

"How do you feel?" Yang Kai instantly sent his thoughts.

"Not bad. But you don't seem to have changed much — did I sleep for a short time?" the Divine Tree asked doubtfully. When Yang Kai had borrowed its power he had been at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, and he remained at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm now; his cultivation had not advanced much, which didn't match Yang Kai's potential.

"Several years have passed; I can't say exactly how many."

"Then how did you..."

"There were some accidents." Yang Kai chuckled and recounted what had happened in the Body Tempering Divine Pool. He hid nothing from the Divine Tree, which had its own consciousness; he had brought forth its awareness, and it relied on him greatly. Though it was a tree, it had become something of a companion at his side.

Yang Kai still remembered his promise to it: to find a suitable place for it to take root and recuperate.

But over the years he had been running about with little stability, passing through many places without finding the right spot. The Divine Tree had never pushed him, which made Yang Kai feel ashamed.

"Oh? You mean that though your realm hasn't changed much, you've gained a wondrous Golden Blood?" the Divine Tree sounded curious about the Golden Blood.

"Want to try?"

"Yes!"

Yang Kai squeezed out a drop of Golden Blood and poured it into the Demon God's Secret Codex, which the Divine Tree absorbed.

A moment later Yang Kai's expression shifted to surprise.

Though he couldn't tell exactly what change had occurred when the Divine Tree absorbed his drop of Golden Blood, a faint but solid bond formed between them, firmer than before; communication between them grew much easier.

Yang Kai sank into his mind, even able to feel the Divine Tree's delight and excitement; its broad leaves trembled as if greatly nourished, and its spirit sent back an immensely satisfied message.

After a long, long while the Divine Tree gave a prolonged, contented sigh and said excitedly, "The life force contained in your Golden Blood is enormous, and it seems to lack the previous limitations of Yang Liquid. This Golden Blood can be absorbed by Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects of any attribute, enhancing their vitality and greatly shortening their growth cycles."

The old Yang Liquid could only be used on Yang-attribute Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine, but Golden Blood was different — it had no attribute restrictions because the Qi-and-blood power and life force within it could be absorbed by any Spiritual Herb or Spiritual Medicine.

The Divine Tree produced dozens of tiny fruits; Yang Kai had eaten these long ago. They contained abundant Yang-attribute energy.

These small fruits had grown afterward and were extremely slow in development — after so many years they were only grape-sized. But once the Divine Tree absorbed a drop of Golden Blood, the fruits visibly grew until they reached walnut size and then stopped.

"Interesting," Yang Kai laughed. "It seems cultivating Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine might be a good choice in the future."

He had been exploring the uses of Golden Blood. A previous drop had traveled into the Starry Sky and still roamed within the Star Domain; Yang Kai could always probe the area near that Golden Blood through his mind. Now he had discovered Golden Blood greatly aided the growth of Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine — a delightful surprise.

"If it helps you, then let me give you a few more drops!" Yang Kai said, generous and unhesitating, squeezing out several more drops of Golden Blood into the Demon God's Secret Codex.

The Divine Tree had no time to refuse. Though it was a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object with its own intelligence and knew how precious such Golden Blood was, since Yang Kai had produced it he could not let it go to waste — it greedily absorbed every drop.
