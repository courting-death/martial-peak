## Chapter 2254 — You’re Too Noisy

“Piercing the Sun Gate, frost descends from the Ninth Heaven!” The middle-aged man was decisive—seeing there was no room for retreat, he struck without hesitation. A snow-white longsword appeared in his hand, and as sword intent rippled out, a chill swept down from the sky. That cold seemed to seep into the very soul, threatening to freeze one’s spirit solid.

The people from the Eight Directions Sect all changed expressions and retreated at once, clearly aware of the extraordinary power of this move.

Qin Chaoyang hurriedly shielded Qin Yu, tapping his foot to float back more than ten zhang. The Qin Family’s guards and servants also scattered instantly, afraid of being caught in the crossfire.

As the sword intent rose and sword qi appeared, the middle-aged man’s wrist trembled, his body wrapped in sword light as he shot straight at Yang Kai. Wherever he passed, the air itself froze into ice.

“Hahahaha!” Yang Kai stood his ground, grinning fiercely. He looked at his opponent’s aggressive charge with utter contempt, showing no intention of dodging.

Seeing this arrogance, the middle-aged man’s heart skipped a beat. A vague sense of dread crept over him, as if something terrifying was about to happen.

“You dare act so wildly in front of me?” Yang Kai’s fierce grin turned cold. With a step, his figure blurred, and when he reappeared, he was already in front of the middle-aged man, extending a single finger forward.

At the tip of that finger, a flash of golden light appeared—the purest, most concentrated Origin Qi.

Clang…

A soft sound rang out. The middle-aged man’s face changed dramatically as he hovered in midair, staring in horror as his full-powered strike was stopped by a single finger.

What made him despair was that the opponent’s bare finger was tougher than a Secret Treasure and remained completely unscathed. Instead, the force from that fingertip bent his own sword.

His mind wavered. With a tremor of the sword, the icy profound intent instantly melted away.

“How is this possible?” the middle-aged man cried out, his eyes nearly popping out.

He kept probing Yang Kai’s cultivation with his Divine Sense, confirming that the other was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, a level lower than himself. But the power coming from the other side was absolutely not something a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator should possess.

This world-shattering strength left him completely rattled. He realized he had kicked an iron plate this time.

“If you want to impress me, call Luo Yuan out. You’re not enough!” As Yang Kai spoke, he snorted, and the Origin Qi at his fingertip surged, golden light bursting forth as he pushed forward.

“You know Junior Brother Luo?” The middle-aged man shuddered, staring at Yang Kai in shock. A strange look flashed in his eyes, and he suddenly exclaimed, “You’re Yang Kai! You’re that Yang Kai from the Four Seasons Land!”

It seemed he had remembered something, and he cried out in alarm.

As soon as he finished, the golden light engulfed him. The middle-aged man screamed and crashed to the ground, smashing a pit into the earth in utter disgrace.

“Yang Kai?”

“That Yang Kai from the Four Seasons Land?”

“That’s right. It’s him, definitely him. No wonder he looked so familiar!”

Below, the disciples of the Eight Directions Sect all cried out in panic, each one flustered.

Only now did they finally recognize Yang Kai. Back in the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had threatened everyone with the Supreme Mystic Pill, trying to trade it for useful items. These people had watched from afar.

At that time, Luo Yuan was right beside Yang Kai, so they hadn’t dared get too close. That’s why they hadn’t recognized him at first today.

It wasn’t until the middle-aged man had a flash of insight that they realized Yang Kai’s identity.

In an instant, cold sweat poured down their faces, turning them pale.

Though they had never fought Yang Kai, they knew what had happened in the Four Seasons Land.

Even powerhouses like Wuchang and Luo Yuan couldn’t do anything to Yang Kai—so what chance did the rest of them have?

The last opening of the Four Seasons Land had produced two rising stars. One was Luo Yuan of the Eight Directions Sect, who had fought Wuchang of Tianwu Sacred Land to a standstill, proving his strength.

The other was Yang Kai.

With only the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he was also a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist, able to refine the Supreme Mystic Pill, and had played all the experts in the Four Seasons Land in the palm of his hand.

Now, the fame of these two rising stars was not far behind Xia Sheng, Wuchang, and Xiao Chen.

That was why, in Fenglin City, other families had disciples from two or three sects staying with them, but the Qin Family only had the Eight Directions Sect.

With Luo Yuan's fame, what sect disciples would dare provoke such a baleful star? He did not even fear Wuchang—so in all the world, aside from experts of the Emperor Realm, who could possibly make him afraid?

“Cough, cough…” The middle-aged man from the Eight Directions Sect, forced back by Yang Kai, was injured but not seriously. He quickly stood up, looking at Yang Kai with deep fear, and forced a smile as he cupped his fists. “So it’s Master Yang. I was blind before—please don’t take offense!”

His cultivation was higher and he was older than Yang Kai, so calling him ‘lord’ would be a loss of face, and ‘brother’ wouldn’t suit Yang Kai either. So he called him ‘Master’ instead, which was fitting for a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist.

“What?” Qin Chaoyang was stunned, staring at the middle-aged man in disbelief. How could this arrogant fellow suddenly become so respectful, even calling Yang Kai ‘Master’…

Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes flickered with a strange light, as if deep in thought.

“What’s there to take offense at…” Yang Kai grinned.

The middle-aged man was overjoyed. “Master Yang is magnanimous…”

But Yang Kai’s tone suddenly turned cold. “There’s no point arguing with the dead.”

The smile on the middle-aged man’s face froze. A chill ran from his head to his heels, as if he’d fallen into an ice cellar. He quickly said, “Master Yang, it’s true that my Junior Brother Lin was at fault today…”

“Of course he was!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“But I beg Master Yang, since my Junior Brother Lin has already been taught a lesson, please give him a chance to change.” He pleaded earnestly.

“A life for a life. I only knocked him out—does that count as punishment?” Yang Kai sneered, mocking, “Is someone else’s life so cheap to you?”

Seeing Yang Kai unmoved, the middle-aged man broke out in a sweat, not knowing if it was from anxiety or pain. He gritted his teeth and said, “Let me tell you, Junior Brother Lin Yun… is the nephew of our Sect’s Vice Sect Master, Lin Rui!”

He brought up Lin Rui, hoping Yang Kai would hesitate and give him some face.

But Yang Kai just sneered arrogantly, “Who the hell is Lin Rui? What’s that got to do with me?!”

The middle-aged man’s face turned pale. He realized there was no way to resolve things peacefully today.

“Either way, someone’s dying today. If not you, then that unconscious guy.” Yang Kai flicked his wrist, and the Myriad Sword appeared, its boundless Emperor Intent spreading instantly. The unique Imperial Aura and sword energy rippled out like a stone thrown into a calm lake, spreading in all directions.

He pointed the broad Myriad Sword at the middle-aged man. “Pick one yourself!” he said, the corner of his mouth lifting in a mocking smile. “Or do you want to die in his place? He’s the Vice Sect Master’s nephew—if you die for him, maybe the Vice Sect Master will take good care of your family!”

“Th-this… I…” The middle-aged man stumbled backward, stammering, his eyes trembling as he stared at the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand. He had never seen an Imperial Treasure before, but he could feel the sword’s extraordinary power. He could also see the killing intent in Yang Kai’s eyes, thick as substance.

But… although Lin Yun’s status in the Eight Directions Sect was high, how could he agree to die in his place?

“If you won’t choose, then I’ll decide.” Yang Kai snorted, then looked at Qin Chaoyang. “Patriarch Qin, they killed one of your clan. If I use the Qin Family’s Secret Treasure to kill him, it counts as your own revenge, doesn’t it?”

“Yes!” Qin Chaoyang shouted, “I’ll trouble you, Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. As he was about to strike with the Myriad Sword, his expression changed. He looked up at the sky and said, “Since you’re here, show yourself. Why sneak around?”

“Someone else?” Qin Chaoyang’s face changed as he looked in that direction, but saw nothing, his face full of suspicion.

At that moment, the void rippled, and two figures suddenly appeared like ghosts.

One was a young man, cold and indifferent, as if nothing in the world concerned him. The other was a petite, adorable girl with a round face, quietly standing behind the young man. Her beautiful eyes never left his tall figure, as if in her world nothing existed but him.

“It’s him!” Qin Chaoyang’s face darkened.

He naturally recognized them—both were disciples of the Eight Directions Sect. They had come to the Qin Family with the middle-aged man and Lin Yun, and the others from the Eight Directions Sect all followed this young man’s lead.

Since moving into the Qin Family, this young man had never left his room, reportedly training hard without a moment’s rest.

Qin Chaoyang also knew this was Luo Yuan, the rising star who had shone alongside Yang Kai in the Four Seasons Land.

As for the round-faced girl, she seemed to be the daughter of the Eight Directions Sect Master, harboring deep affection for Luo Yuan. She had always stayed by his side, guarding the courtyard where he secluded himself, never leaving even half a step. Yet, like falling flowers yearning for a flowing stream that feels nothing in return, it was clear from the way things stood that Luo Yuan paid her no mind at all.

“Junior Brother Luo, Young Miss!” The middle-aged man was overjoyed to see them appear, but soon his face turned fearful as if he remembered something.

Luo Yuan glanced at him indifferently, frowning. “You’re too noisy.”

At these words, all the Eight Directions Sect disciples fell silent, their faces turning pale, as if they were terrified of Luo Yuan.
