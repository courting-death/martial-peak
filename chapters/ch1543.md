## Chapter 1543 — Force Tyrant Body

Turning his head to take in his surroundings, Tianyi Palace was exactly as it had always been.

Although Yang Kai had been missing for three years, as the chamber of the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect no one would come to disturb it; Ye Xijun only had people clean the place daily so that not a speck of dust could settle.

After glancing about for a moment, Yang Kai gave a slight inward nod and was about to go rest when his expression suddenly changed and he barked, "Who!"

As he spoke, his Divine Sense power erupted with a roar and struck toward a certain point in the void.

At that instant he abruptly felt as if someone were spying on him.

He struck without the slightest mercy.

The void twisted as the attack—an assault carrying Yang Kai's enormous Divine Sense power—and even a warrior of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not take it head-on.

But the warped space smoothed out the next moment, as if an invisible hand had brushed it flat.

Yang Kai's attack had no effect.

This discovery changed his expression; a brilliant light flashed in his eyes.

A visible, inexplicable mass of energy leisurely tumbled out from that spot, twisting and shifting, appearing eerie and unfathomable.

"Divine Sense Manifestation!" Yang Kai lowly barked. Shocked, he also relaxed some of his vigilance, for from that visible Divine Sense power he perceived a trace of familiarity.

No sooner had he finished speaking than that Divine Sense power suddenly took the shape of a human figure.

Though somewhat insubstantial, it wore a black robe that nearly hid its head and face, revealing only a pair of eyes bright as stars and an exquisitely graceful figure.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he fixed his gaze on the figure, his emotions stirred.

The other party stared back, motionless. Their expression was placid as a deep well, betraying no joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure.

After a long while Yang Kai drew a deep breath and asked in a low voice, "Are you Yang Yan... or the Starry Sky Emperor?"

The figure manifested by Divine Sense was an exact likeness of Yang Yan. It was clearly the Divine Sense of the one sleeping on the Sixth Stage of Flowing Flame Sandland, but Yang Kai could not be sure whether this was the Yang Yan who had once lived beside him day and night, or that Starry Sky Emperor that existed only in legend!

If it was the former, everything would be easy to handle.

If it was the latter, Yang Kai would have to be extremely careful.

At Yang Kai's question the figure frowned slightly and said, "Both, I suppose!"

"Is that so..." Yang Kai replied faintly. "It seems you two have already begun to merge."

"Indeed, but it will still take some years to complete thoroughly."

"Then how should I address you?"

“Whether it’s the one you know, or the so-called Great Emperor you speak of—they are both called Yang Yan,” the figure replied.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. “Then why aren’t you sleeping in the pavilion? What brings your Divine Sense here?”

"I sensed that you brought back an interesting thing, so I came to take a look," Yang Yan said with a faint smile.

"An interesting thing?" Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

"This..." Yang Yan said as she reached out and made a casual gesture toward Yang Kai. Though the motion appeared utterly casual, with that move Yang Kai suddenly felt something within his body being drawn out.

It was so fast that he did not even have a moment to form the thought of resisting.

A flash of radiance passed, and a pearl had already appeared in Yang Yan's hand.

"Xuan Realm Pearl!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he stared at the seemingly unremarkable pearl.

"Indeed, the Xuan Realm Pearl!" Yang Yan nodded slightly. Then she closed her beautiful eyes as if sensing something; after a moment she opened them and said softly, "Just as I thought—you truly can refine it."

Yang Kai excelled in Spatial Force, and Yang Yan was aware of this.

To refine a Xuan Realm Pearl, the most basic requirement is an understanding of spatial power, so in the tens of thousands of years at Star Emperor Mountain no sect leader had been able to refine one. It was only in Qi Tianche's generation, by a stroke of fortune, that the secret of the Xuan Realm Pearl was uncovered.

In the end, it worked out in Yang Kai's favor.

"You even expanded the space to a radius of a hundred li; given your current cultivation, that is truly remarkable," Yang Yan said, apparently astonished and full of praise.

Yang Kai frowned and pondered for a moment before speaking, "I know this pearl was yours. I refined it in order to leave it; if you want to take it back I will not stop you. But could you lend it to me for a time? I need it to contain some people."

"Lend it to you?" Yang Yan glanced at Yang Kai and smiled faintly. "Why would I lend it? You've imprinted your life's trace on the Xuan Realm Pearl; it is already yours. I will not take it back."

Saying this, Yang Yan reached out and tossed the Xuan Realm Pearl back to him.

Yang Kai caught it and looked at her with suspicion.

Although he still hadn’t figured out exactly what grade of Secret Treasure the Xuan Realm Pearl was, since it was an Imperial Treasure, it clearly held great significance even for an existence like a Great Emperor. He never intended to claim the Xuan Realm Pearl as his own—he merely wished to use it to bring his friends and family from the Tongxuan Continent over.

Without the Xuan Realm Pearl, he truly could not have brought so many people across at once.

"You are mistaken about one thing," Yang Yan said gently.

"What?"

"This Xuan Realm Pearl is not actually owned by me."

"Huh?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"Strictly speaking, I never refined this Xuan Realm Pearl; I only kept it," Yang Yan's soul-body drifted down from the void and stood before Yang Kai like a real person. "It actually belongs to a friend of mine."

"Your friend?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

Yang Yan's true body was the Starry Sky Emperor—if the Emperor had a friend, would that not imply someone also of Emperor-level existence?

"Yes, a friend of mine!" Yang Yan nodded. "My friend shares a trait with you—can you guess what it is?"

Yang Kai fell into thought; after a moment his eyes brightened and he whispered, "They cultivate Spatial Force?"

“Indeed!” Yang Yan looked at Yang Kai with approval. “He, like you, also cultivated Spatial Force—but his mastery of it had reached the pinnacle. This Xuan Realm Pearl was forged by him using the spatial laws he comprehended, refining an entire realm into its form. Although my strength is not inferior to his, I have little attainment in Spatial Force, so the Xuan Realm Pearl holds little use for me, and I cannot fully expand the space within it. You, however, are different. You’ve delved deeply into the study of Spatial Force—given time, you may well reach the same heights he once did.”

Yang Kai's face twitched.

It was not because of Yang Yan's high praise that he flinched, but because of the origin of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

To think it was a cultivator of the same level as a Great Emperor who refined an entire realm to create it!

That revelation was staggering.

Yang Kai had never seen a Void King Realm expert in action, but by his estimates a Void King Realm expert absolutely would not possess such ability.

The Emperor truly was a being beyond the Void King Realm!

Above the Void King Realm there were indeed deeper, subtler levels of the Martial Dao. Truly, there was no end to it.

"The previous Yang Yan knew you. We are somewhat fated; since the Xuan Realm Pearl bears your life's imprint, then it is yours. Expand it well—perhaps one day you will discover something within it," Yang Yan said with a faint, inscrutable smile.

Yang Kai felt his heart stir; a bright light flashed in his eyes.

There was meaning behind Yang Yan's words—could it be that the Xuan Realm Pearl contained some hidden secret?

Yang Kai did not press further; he knew that even if he asked now he likely would not get an answer. After a moment's thought he said, "Your friend..."

"I do not know where he is either. I have not seen him in over a hundred thousand years. Perhaps he wanders the world, incarnated among the masses; perhaps he has perished—who can say?"

"Understood," Yang Kai nodded.

Expanding the space within the Xuan Realm Pearl would greatly benefit his cultivation of Spatial Force; even without Yang Yan's words he would not become lax.

Now that he had a vague notion that more mysteries lay within the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai would spare no effort.

“Mm. By the way, I’ll be setting out on a long voyage in a few days. You’ll be safe resting within that pavilion—I’ll have people watch over it carefully,” Yang Kai suddenly recalled.

Yang Yan opened her mouth as if to say something but paused, then said lightly, "The Star Domain harbors many dangers—may your journey be smooth."

After saying that, her figure suddenly vanished.

As suddenly as she had arrived, she left just as abruptly.

Yang Kai frowned and stood where he was; after a long while he calmed himself, sat cross-legged on the bed, and began to meditate and regulate his breath.

...

The next day, in the Hundred Flowers Residence.

Yang Kai sought out Ye Xijun and asked her about Lin Yun'er's condition.

Three years of living together had indeed allowed Ye Xijun to study Lin Yun'er's body, and she had some vague understanding.

"Yun'er—she has a special constitution."

"So it is!" Yang Kai said as if he had long suspected as much.

There are always some special people in this world who, from birth, possess advantages others can scarcely match—advantages manifest in their bodies.

For example, Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang's The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body was born with innate alchemical talent and required no training; refining pills is itself cultivation, and the more pills she refines the stronger she becomes.

Shan Qingluo's Poison Widow constitution is supremely venomous; once she becomes enamored, anyone who touches her will die instantly.

Xue Yue's Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body causes her Yin essence to greatly bolster others' strength, with no drawbacks.

The effects of special constitutions vary, but all are extremely rare—hardly ever seen among ordinary people.

Lin Yun'er is so young yet possesses such unfathomable power; after much consideration Yang Kai could think of only one explanation.

She has a special constitution.

The answer Ye Xijun gave matched his conjecture.

"Then what exactly is her constitution?" Yang Kai turned to glance at the little girl beside him, nibbling on fruit, and hurriedly asked.

"I have consulted many tomes on this matter. If I am not mistaken, she should possess the Force Tyrant Body!" Ye Xijun said in a grave voice.

"Force Tyrant Body!" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Those with this constitution are born with divine strength, and as they age and their cultivation rises their power will only grow. They are the blessed of heaven; when they reach a certain maturity, relying on sheer physical might alone they can contend with and decisively overpower warriors of the same rank!"

Astonishment flashed across Yang Kai's eyes.

"However..." Ye Xijun suddenly furrowed her brow and looked at Lin Yun'er with deep concern.

"However what?" Yang Kai looked up at her.

“But those born with this constitution possess power so overwhelming that even their own bodies cannot bear it. Because of this, they are often unable to exert their full strength in battle. Yun’er is still young, and her cultivation isn’t high, so this flaw isn’t obvious yet — but once she truly grows stronger, that same power will become her greatest restraint.”
