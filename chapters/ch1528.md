## Chapter 1528 — The Fragmented Small Xuan Realm

Although the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip was of no shabby quality, it still fell short of the Dragon Bone sword.

The forging of the Dragon Bone sword took a true dragon's bone, was aided by a Dragon Pearl, and carried a strand of dragon soul; it could be said to be made from the finest materials. No matter how formidable the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip was, it simply could not compare to the Dragon Bone sword.

Only, due to Yang Kai's cultivation limitations, the Dragon Bone sword could not yet unleash its full might.

Still, this longsword could devour the essence of flesh and blood and grow on its own; its power would only increase with time.

Yang Kai placed great hopes upon it; if it could not contend with even the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip, that would truly be laughable.

Though his relied‑upon Secret Treasure was suppressed, Fang Peng did not lose heart; in fights between martial artists a secret treasure was a major factor, but the secret techniques one wielded and the realm one had cultivated to were equally decisive.

He prided himself on being two Stages above Yang Kai and on the many years he had spent cultivating, so even if he fell behind in the secret‑treasure clash he felt no inclination to back down.

The long whip continued to lash and arc, always striking from extremely crafty angles; its timing was exquisite, preventing the Fire Bird and the Jade‑Green Giant Dragon from ever closing in.

Even Yang Kai's Space Blade could be snatched aside by that whip.

For a time, battles across Lingjue Peak raged like a furnace; each place was a fight of life and death, each utterly perilous.

Only Leng Qing stood apart, watching from afar as his eyes glittered.

He did not observe the clash between Ye Xijun and Qi Tianche — that sort of duel was above him; even witnessing it would yield little insight.

He watched the contest between Yang Kai and Fang Peng!

As an elite of the younger generation of Star Emperor Mountain, Leng Qing had pride; that pride was plain from how he once disregarded Qu Changfeng in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Yet he dared not belittle Yang Kai.

Ever since their chance meeting at the Fourth Layer in the Flowing Flame Sandland, he had regarded Yang Kai as an opponent of equal calibre, and had longed for the day he might cross blades with such a man, to kill him or be killed by him.

But now Leng Qing discovered that this potential rival in strength was in fact more than a mere notch above him.

He fought someone like Fang Peng and did not fall behind; he even relied on outside forces to completely suppress Fang Peng's momentum.

Leng Qing felt a chill and was moved.

He had never imagined that anyone with the cultivation of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could reach such a level! He considered himself a genius, true — but was Fang Peng any less so?

The man had become a sect master, standing out among tens of thousands of martial artists across the whole sect. Commanding the Leitai Sect, his genius could not be slight.

Yet such a figure could not gain the upper hand at all against Yang Kai. Every stratagem he used was nullified without trace!

Were the roles reversed, facing Fang Peng, Leng Qing feared he might not even last the time it took a stick of incense to burn halfway!

In that instant Leng Qing felt somewhat dejected, somewhat lost, but mostly thrilled!

He had found a target, someone to pursue. The realization made his blood stir for no reason. Clenching his fists, he fixed his gaze unblinkingly on Yang Kai’s every move, silently cheering for each strike and counterattack. Even the slightest, most casual motion from Yang Kai was enough to make his eyes light up.

“Fang Peng, if you had fled sooner you might have lived, but since you chose to come to Star Emperor Mountain, you have no way out.” Yang Kai wielded the Dragon Bone sword and, together with the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, pressed the attack on Fang Peng, laughing aloud.

Fang Peng's expression was cold; he said nothing.

It was not that he did not wish to retort — only that he was losing ground and had no mind for words with Yang Kai.

After this brutal clash, Fang Peng realized that by his own strength alone he could not kill Yang Kai, yet it would not be easy for Yang Kai to slay him either.

He could only pin his hopes on Qi Tianche.

He believed Qi Tianche must still have reserves; otherwise he would not have shown such boundless confidence earlier.

Thinking this, Fang Peng cast a glance at the other battlefield and found that side embroiled in chaos as well, though different from his — there the two fought evenly, neither gaining advantage.

The discovery struck him like a blow; he felt oddly betrayed.

If Qi Tianche could not handle Ye Xijun, then what of himself?

Qi Tianche's methods were crafty; he could certainly escape — something Fang Peng could not do. In the presence of one who mastered spatial force, flight was a laughable act.

As he thought this, Fang Peng's eyelids suddenly tightened.

He noticed Qi Tianche on that battlefield feint one move, freeing himself from Ye Xijun, then transform into a long rainbow and streak toward Fang Peng!

Hanging in midair, one hand reached down and grabbed hard!

Yang Kai, whose movements were normally so nimble, suddenly felt an inexplicable resistance under that grasp — his motion halted involuntarily.

Fang Peng was elated; he immediately understood Qi Tianche's scheme: a diversion in one place to strike in another, pretending a life‑and‑death duel with Ye Xijun while his real target had always been Yang Kai.

If they could seize Yang Kai, Ye Xijun's strength would be useless.

In a flash Fang Peng saw through Qi Tianche's plan; now he and Qi Tianche rose or fell together, bound like grasshoppers on the same rope. He did not want the other to fail at the last moment, so he hurriedly used secret techniques to delay Yang Kai and distract his attention.

“You think joining forces will be enough?” Yang Kai’s eyes were cold and sharp. “Won’t shed tears until you see your coffin, huh? Catch me first, then talk!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai slashed forward and a spatial rift immediately formed.

“Spatial Force is indeed wondrous, but with me here your move is useless!” Qi Tianche laughed, flicked his finger, and a bead was flung out.

The bead looked utterly ordinary, without any energy fluctuations, but upon its appearance Ye Xijun's face changed drastically and she cried out in alarm: “You actually refined it — Sect Master, dodge!”

Yang Kai's heart jolted.

Although he did not know the bead's mysteries, anything that could shock Ye Xijun so grievously was surely no trivial matter.

He would not tarry; he stepped into the spatial rift, intending to flee.

To his horror, the bead exploded at that very moment, and a strange profound intent swept out. Under the influence of that intent, the spatial rift he had torn open vanished as though smoothed by an invisible hand.

It was as if an unseen giant had brushed it flat.

Yang Kai's foot found only air.

The next moment the surroundings shifted and changed.

When Yang Kai came to his senses he found himself already inside another space.

Looking around, the space was extremely cramped, scarcely more than thirty zhang in diameter, yet within that small space everything was verdant and green.

Yang Kai's eyes widened in surprise; he could not tell what place this was.

What baffled him further was how this space was clearly incomplete: plants at the edges were only half‑grown, and their other halves could not be seen.

The space seemed as if it had been cut out from somewhere else.

Not far ahead, Qi Tianche smiled at him, Fang Peng wore a puzzled look as he looked about, and Ye Xijun was nowhere to be seen.

The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit circled anxiously overhead; it had been dragged in too. The Dragon Bone sword, Dripping Jade, was left outside. Yang Kai tried to reach it with his mind but could not — the lack of connection made his heart sink.

After a while Fang Peng frowned and asked, “Brother Tianche, what is this place?”

He was clearly in the dark and did not know what Qi Tianche intended.

“Small Xuan Realm!” Qi Tianche chuckled.

“Small Xuan Realm?” Fang Peng's eyes widened; he nearly thought he had misheard. Yang Kai's face darkened as he glared at Qi Tianche.

“Brother Fang, have you never seen such a small Small Xuan Realm?” Qi Tianche asked.

“Indeed.” Fang Peng nodded honestly. “I’ve entered several Small Xuan Realms before, but no matter how small they were, none have ever been this tiny.”

He was more puzzled as to why the three of them had suddenly arrived in this Small Xuan Realm.

Small Xuan Realms are usually accessed via Void Passages; only through a Void Passage can one step into a Small Xuan Realm, yet before this Qi Tianche had only tossed out a bead, and when it burst the three of them were here.

Could this Small Xuan Realm be related to that bead? Fang Peng frowned.

Yang Kai was equally astonished.

When he had been on the Tongxuan Continent he had entered a few Small Xuan Realms, but since setting foot in the Star Domain he had never seen such a peculiar place — he had not expected to see one again today.

“You are Sect Master Yang, are you not?” Qi Tianche looked at Yang Kai with an easy smile and leisurely mien. “I am Qi Tianche; I hold the position of the Mountain Master of Star Emperor Mountain.”

“Qi Mountain Master's name is renowned like thunder; I have long heard of you.” Yang Kai grinned, showing little fear. “But I will ask you plainly, senior: why have you brought me to this place? Could it be to coerce my Great Elder?”

“You err, Sect Master Yang.” Qi Tianche slowly shook his head. “I did not bring you here to deal with Senior Sister Ye. I only wish to make friends with you.”

“Heh…” Yang Kai laughed, rubbing his nose. “You must be joking, senior.”

Qi Tianche shook his head solemnly and said, “I truly mean it; it is not a jest.”

“But I do not wish to be friends with you!” Yang Kai sneered.

Qi Tianche smiled awkwardly. “If Sect Master Yang says so, then I will not force the matter. I only wished to consult you on something.”

“Consult me?” Yang Kai looked surprised.

“Indeed!” Qi Tianche nodded earnestly.

“On what? Schemes to seize power and betray one's master? If that is what you seek, I can tell you nothing — you have long mastered those arts.” Yang Kai taunted Qi Tianche.

Qi Tianche showed no anger; he smiled and said, “Of course not such petty matters. What I wish to ask about is Spatial Force!”

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.
