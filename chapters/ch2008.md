## Chapter 2008 — Do You Want the Dao Origin Fruit?

The Earth Vein could not be moved; once displaced its root would be broken and it could not endure, so the only way to obtain a fine Earth Vein was to seize another's territory.

However, there were always exceptions.

Some Earth Veins had lain underground for ages and, due to special circumstances, their energies condensed until they coalesced into a peculiar existence: the Earth Vein Pearl.

One Earth Vein Pearl was equivalent to an entire Earth Vein, containing all the energy a single Earth Vein should possess.

Earth Vein Pearls were extremely rare.

Yang Kai had roamed his home Star Domain for so many years and had only once seen one in the Purple Star Treasure Vault, which he had eventually placed beneath the herb garden of the Small Xuan Realm to keep the Spiritual Qi rich and nurture Spiritual Herb medicines.

Yet now, the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat had actually collected fully four of them from underground.

Overjoyed, Yang Kai hurriedly retrieved them and examined them carefully in his hand.

He soon discovered these four Earth Vein Pearls were of a higher grade than the one he had taken from the Purple Star Treasure Vault—in both total stored energy and purity they were far superior to that single Purple Star pearl.

If the pearl from the Purple Star Treasure Vault could be considered Lower-Level, then these four were at least Middle-Level, and the largest among them should be an Upper-Level!

The density of Spiritual Qi they emitted left Yang Kai marveling.

That so many Earth Vein Pearls had grown beneath the canyon filled Yang Kai with both surprise and delight.

But upon careful thought, Yang Kai felt it was only natural.

Without these pearls, how else could the local Spiritual Qi be so concentrated? Heavy Earth was precious, but it could not produce such intense Spiritual Qi; only Earth Vein Pearls could.

Furthermore, the presence of Heavy Earth might very well have been the root cause for the pearls' formation.

That natural gravity field was terrifying; the surrounding Spiritual Qi naturally sank to the valley floor, gathering, condensing and compressing underground for years and years until Earth Vein pearls were produced.

The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had stood for an extremely long time, and the age of this ancient battlefield could not be determined. Over countless years, Spiritual Qi attracted by the gravity field had formed these pearls, which was a reasonable explanation.

Yang Kai only needed a moment's thought to nearly deduce the truth of the matter.

Although these Earth Vein Pearls were not as valuable as the Heavy Earth, they were still precious. Even placed in a large Sect, they would be enough to raise the concentration of Spiritual Qi within by a whole rank.

With a flick of his wrist Yang Kai sent them down beneath the herb garden of the Small Xuan Realm.

Together with the pearl he already had, five Earth Vein Pearls plus all that Heavy Earth made the Small Xuan Realm's herb garden arguably the finest among the Star Realm.

Yang Kai was almost impatient to plant some Spiritual Herb medicines and see the result.

Half a day later, Yang Kai sighed and abandoned the plan to continue searching.

The benefits underground seemed to have been entirely taken; without the Heavy Earth and Earth Vein Pearls the canyon floor reverted to the common environment—Spiritual Qi thinned to the extreme and it was unsuitable to stay long.

Only then did he beckon to the little beast, channel his power, and soar upward.

Without the tug of the natural gravity field he rose from the canyon effortlessly.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat continued to guide the way ahead, searching for Mo Xiaoqi, and Yang Kai followed behind without haste.

……

Three days later, passing over a small hill, Yang Kai suddenly glanced down with a knowing look, smiled coldly, halted, and called out, “Friend, are you coming out of your own accord, or shall I force you?”

There was no response below, only the rustle of wind through leaves.

“Stubborn fool!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, raised his palm, and shot forth a Golden Blood Thread toward a certain spot below.

At that moment a streak of blue light flashed up from below to meet the Golden Blood Thread.

Bang— the Golden Blood Thread was deflected back, and on the spot that had been empty sat a middle-aged man cross-legged, his face pale, staring at Yang Kai with hatred and murderous intent in his eyes.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

With his sight he could immediately tell the man was gravely wounded, not by a simple injury but to his very roots.

This situation was completely different from what he had earlier supposed.

He had thought the man was hiding to ambush him, not that he was concealing himself here to recuperate and had been forced to reveal his position by Yang Kai's attack.

For a moment Yang Kai felt a touch embarrassed.

But he was straightforward—seeing the mistake he quickly cupped his fist and said, “Apologies, this seems to be a misunderstanding; please do not take offense. You should continue your recuperation; I will take my leave.”

“Friend, were you not coming to take my life? If you're going to do it, then do it—why the crocodile tears and false mercy?”

What Yang Kai did not expect was that, after his explanation, the middle-aged man did not relax but instead bellowed angrily, as if they truly had some mortal hatred.

Yang Kai frowned. “You’ve misunderstood me. I don’t even know you — why would I take your life?”

The matter was ultimately caused by his momentary blunder, so the man remained hostile; Yang Kai paid it no mind, and produced a jade vial which he tossed toward him, saying, “This is a vial of Healing Pills that should ease your condition.”

Saying that, he immediately left.

The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment, and only then seemed to realize Yang Kai had not meant to harm him—otherwise Yang Kai could have killed him while he was weak. He reached out, took the vial, opened it, and inhaled; confirming it to be a healing medicine, his expression wavered.

Seeing Yang Kai about to leave, the man finally made up his mind and called out in a strained voice, “Wait!”

Yang Kai stopped, glanced back, and sighed, “What else do you want? I did destroy your hiding spot, but you can move elsewhere; I gave you Healing Pills, so let's call it even—do not take advantage.”

The middle-aged man did not grow angry; instead he smiled mysteriously and said in a low voice, “I did not summon you to say that.”

“Then what do you want?” Yang Kai's patience frayed.

“Do you want the Dao Origin Fruit?” the man asked, fixing Yang Kai with his gaze.

“What?” Yang Kai’s face grew serious and he turned, flashing to the man’s side in a few moves, his gaze sweeping the man’s Spatial Ring. “Did you say Dao Origin Fruit?”

“Exactly—friend did not mishear; I did say Dao Origin Fruit,” the man nodded.

“You obtained a Dao Origin Fruit?” Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment.

The man nodded again and said calmly, “The Tianwu Sacred Land placed three Dao Origin Fruits into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, and I, Zhang, was fortunate to acquire one.”

Before Yang Kai could ask where it was, the man surnamed Zhang smiled slightly, “You need not scheme; even if you killed me you would not get that Dao Origin Fruit—I hid it in a safe place before I began to heal.”

“Why would I kill you?” Yang Kai coughed lightly.

“One cannot say,” Zhang chuckled. “You do not look like a great villain—otherwise you would not have left so casually just now—but when such a precious thing as a Dao Origin Fruit appears, who can guarantee you would not attempt murder to seize it?”

“You speak reasonably.” Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

A common warrior might resist killing for treasure, but in the face of an exceedingly rare Spiritual Object like a Dao Origin Fruit, whether one would stay true to oneself was another matter.

“But… you called me back and told me about the Dao Origin Fruit—what do you intend?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

“Naturally, I intend to give you the Dao Origin Fruit,” Zhang said solemnly.

“Are you joking?” Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance, unconvinced.

Zhang shook his head. “A dying man speaks truth; why would I joke about this?”

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. “I don't think you're about to die right away.”

Zhang smiled wryly. “I burned through eighty percent of my Essence-Blood to flee; even if I survive, my cultivation will plunge. Besides, I am poisoned—my Sea of Consciousness has been contaminated.”

Yang Kai's face changed; he extended his Divine Sense and probed him thoroughly, confirming Zhang was not lying.

Zhang was outwardly strong but hollow inside, clinging to the last thread of life—perhaps he had used some pill to hold on.

With wounds like that, even without interference he would not live beyond two days.

Yang Kai sighed, “If it were only bodily poison I might help, but with your Divine Sense contaminated… I am powerless.”

Zhang said lightly, “I have prepared myself; you need not worry.” He chuckled.

“We are strangers; your life or death is none of my concern. But you called me back claiming you would give me a Dao Origin Fruit—where is the catch?” Yang Kai asked.

“You are indeed clever.” Zhang's smile faded. “Time is short, I'll be frank.”

Yang Kai nodded and prepared to listen.

“I will tell you where the Dao Origin Fruit is; after you take it and at any future time when you refine it into a pill you must give one Dao Origin Pill to Zhang family's descendants,” Zhang said. “I am Zhang Gaoxuan, head of the Zhang family of Fenglin City. The Zhangs are not a great clan, but we have existed here for centuries—many know of us. After you take the Dao Origin Fruit and refine it, if refinement fails there is no dispute; if it succeeds you will obtain at least three Dao Origin Pills—give one to my descendants, the rest are yours.”
