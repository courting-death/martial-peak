## Chapter 1133 — As You Wish

The Haike Family and the Xu Family had always been roughly equal in strength, but Xu Zhishen was already dead, and the most feared Hundred Mountains Painting had been lost; in terms of power the Xu Family now ought to be somewhat weaker than the Haike Family.

If that Yang Kai could kill a few more of the Xu Family's Saint King Realm cultivators, perhaps the Haike Family could round them up and completely swallow the Xu Family's influence!

At the thought of this, many felt their hearts heat up, silently admiring that the Family Head truly was a Family Head — his sight reached farther than theirs; they had only thought to use the Hundred Mountains Painting to trade favors with the Xu Family, who would have noticed this opportunity to strike at the roots?

Ian paid no heed to what they were thinking and said calmly, “Is short-term profit all you can see?”

“The Family Head means that……” Everyone looked at Ian with suspicion.

Ian sighed. “Why is our Haike Family only an outer force of Yingyue Hall? Because we're not strong enough, because we lack powerful experts. If we had one Origin Returning Realm cultivator, I believe Yingyue Hall would reconsider our status!”

Many of the Guest Elders frowned, unsure what Ian was driving at, but Chang Qi's expression shifted and he began to ponder thoughtfully.

“Suppose we recruit this Yang Kai into the family. With his talent, couldn't he be raised to the Origin Returning Realm?”

“Ah? The Family Head still wants to recruit him? But that brat is too arrogant!” Warren cried, shaking his head. “A troublemaker like that would be hard to recruit.”

“Indeed, Family Head, and he's only First Stage of the Saint King Realm right now; to reach the Origin Returning Realm might take decades, and who knows what the world will be like in decades?” Ba Qingyan spoke up, nursing the humiliation Yang Kai had repeatedly inflicted on him; although he knew he wasn't Yang Kai's match, he couldn't swallow that pride and had no mind to recruit him.

Ian shook his head and said in a low voice, “By Qingyan's reckoning, that Yang Kai is sure to die this time, but he'll drag several of the Xu Family down with him. We only need to act at the crucial moment and save Yang Kai. If that brat is sensible, he'll serve us. He surrenders to our clan, and with him in our hands, won't the Hundred Mountains Painting become the Haike Family's?”

Everyone's eyes lit up at once.

Chang Qi, who had not spoken, thought for a moment and asked, “Family Head, what if he refuses to surrender?”

Ian sneered. “He'll surrender. When faced with life and death, I think he'll make the wise choice.”

“But Family Head, wouldn't that offend the Xu Family?” Ba Qingyan asked anxiously.

“The Xu Family?” Ian's eyes flashed with disdain. “And what if we offend them? After today, there will be no Xu Family.”

Hearing that, the Guest Elders instantly understood Ian's intention and sucked in cold air.

The Family Head didn't merely plan to curry favor with Yang Kai at his moment of crisis; by recruiting him he intended to use the opportunity to destroy the Xu Family's elite! The Family Head coveted Yang Kai, coveted the Hundred Mountains Painting, and had his sights on those persons of the Xu Family.

For a moment, many broke into sweat yet felt exhilarated.

“As long as that boy is willing to submit, I’m willing to exhaust the clan’s wealth to purchase Pills for him. With his aptitude, as long as he has enough Pills, I believe that within ten years he’ll be able to advance to the Origin Returning Realm!” As Ian spoke, it was as though a splendid vision unfolded before his eyes; his spirits soared, and he seemed to grow decades younger in that moment. “Once he reaches the Origin Returning Realm, the status of my Haike Family will rise with the tide—we’ll be able to enter the inner circle of Yingyue Hall. By then, would we have any reason to fear lacking rewards?”

The others murmured.

They knew well that recklessly piling up cultivation with Pills could possibly lift a Saint King Realm into the Origin Returning Realm in ten years, but that cultivation would be messy and impure; a genius could be turned into a mediocrity.

But what did that matter to them? Yang Kai was an outsider, the one Wu Yi had found in the Starry Sky. Even if he were ruined, he wasn't of the Haike Family; ruined or not, as long as he could bring profit to the clan, the cost would be worth it.

“The Family Head is far-sighted; we admire you!” Ba Qingyan bowed. He truly admired his Family Head's scheme — it was like killing three birds with one stone: preserve the clan's reputation, swallow the Xu Family, and recruit Yang Kai. Ten years later the clan's path would be smooth and they'd no longer have to struggle at the bottom.

The elders and Guest Elders rushed to praise the Family Head's brilliance, but only Chang Qi and Hao An, who had both met Yang Kai, exchanged a glance and sighed softly.

Elsewhere, the Xu Family's strong men, led by Xu Zhikun, had already arrived dozens of zhang from the cave. The moment they stepped into the area covered by the formation set by Yang Flame, their brows knit.

Unaccountably, a sense of unease rose in their hearts; they looked around but found nothing amiss.

“Family Head, that is the one who killed Third Elder!” A Saint King Realm cultivator came to Xu Zhikun's side and pointed at Yang Kai from afar.

Xu Zhikun's eyes hardened, murderous intent spilling forth. His Divine Sense swept over and he frowned. “Didn't you say he was only Third Stage of the Saint Realm? Why is he First Stage of the Saint King Realm?”

“Ah?” The man who had spoken earlier gasped. “But that day……”

“Trash! You can't even tell others' cultivations—what use are you?” Xu Zhikun scolded, but felt somewhat reassured.

He had received a report from an expert in the clan saying a Third Stage of the Saint Realm youth had slain Xu Zhishen and seized the Hundred Mountains Painting; he hadn't dared believe it. But now he found that the youth was clearly First Stage of the Saint King Realm and felt much calmer.

Because the Haike Family had planned to use Yang Kai's conflict with the Xu Family to their advantage, they hadn't revealed Yang Kai's breakthrough or the blow that injured Ba Qingyan; they wanted the Xu Family to suffer more. Xu Zhikun naturally thought the intelligence he'd received was mistaken.

Although that youth might have advanced in recent days, the likelihood was still very low.

A Third Stage of the Saint Realm killing a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm was something Xu Zhikun couldn't accept; but if Yang Kai was First Stage of the Saint King Realm, it was more plausible — even fights across ranks need some baseline.

He instinctively felt that the fighters from his clan who had fled must have been scared and hadn't noticed Yang Kai concealing his cultivation.

“You're the bastard who wounded my nephew Tian Ze and killed my Third Brother Zhishen, Yang Kai?” Xu Zhikun barked. “Who gave you the gall to kill my Xu Family Elder?”

With a roar from Xu Zhikun, the dozens of fighters behind Wu Yi all changed expression, drew their Secret Treasures, and took up a wary stance as if a great enemy had arrived. Even Wu Yi and Yu Feng's Saint Yuan surged, ready to strike.

Yang Kai stepped forward with a cold sneer. “You're the Family Head of the Xu Family?”

“Indeed, I am!”

“I didn't come looking for you, but you've delivered yourselves. Fine — since you're here, don't leave.”

The fighter who had been speaking to Xu Zhikun trembled and took a few steps back.

He still clearly remembered that when Xu Zhishen had last come here the youth had spoken the same words; Xu Zhishen had died, and that sentence sounded like the call of death, stirring in him an instinctive fear. If the Family Head and Guest Elders hadn't been present, he would have fled at once.

Noticing his unease, Xu Zhikun shot him a cold glare and shouted through gritted teeth, “Insolent junior, don’t be so arrogant! Hand over my Xu Family’s Hundred Mountains Painting and cripple your own Dantian, and this old man might spare your life. Otherwise, don’t blame me for bullying the young with my seniority!”

Xu Zhikun wished he could tear Yang Kai into thousands of pieces—how could he possibly let him die so easily? He intended to torment the young man slowly, to console the spirit of his useless son in the afterlife.

“Spare me the rubbish. If you want to fight, then fight — I don't have time to dally!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Fine, fine!” Xu Zhikun, enraged, laughed fiercely and shouted, “As you wish!”

With that, he spread his wings like a roc in flight and charged at Yang Kai with staggering momentum. Dozens of the Xu Family's elders and Guest Elders, all Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, surged up behind him, clearly intending to overwhelm Yang Kai with thunderous force.

Regardless of Yang Kai's rank, since he had killed Xu Zhishen his combat ability couldn't be dismissed. Xu Zhikun wouldn't underestimate him and had resolved to swarm him, denying Yang Kai any chance to resist.

The Haike Family watchers nearly popped their eyes out at the sight of the Xu Family surging forward.

“Have they no shame?” Warren shouted. Just moments ago, Xu Zhikun had claimed he wouldn’t bully the young with his seniority—yet in the blink of an eye, not only was he doing exactly that, he was even using numbers to overwhelm the few. The Xu Family’s shamelessness truly knew no bounds.

“At this rate that brat hasn't a chance. Family Head, what should we do?” Huang Juan frowned, clearly not optimistic about Yang Kai.

Ian's face shifted. To be honest, he hadn't expected the Xu Family's fury to be so violent, rushing in all at once. Even if he led people over now it would likely be too late. He sighed lightly, as if consoling himself: “If Yang Kai truly can't escape, he won't be worth recruiting. Still… let's go take a look. Maybe he won't die so soon.”

No sooner had he said that than everyone from the Haike Family froze, expressions of disbelief on their faces.

They had noticed that when the dozen or so Third Stage of the Saint King Realm Xu Family members stormed forward, Yang Kai didn't move an inch and merely wore a cold sneer.

The next moment, a mist suddenly swelled across a thousand zhang around the cave entrance, blotting out everything. The figures of the Xu Family dozen and Yang Kai all vanished.

Dozens of Divine Senses from the Haike Family probed toward the spot at almost the same time but could not penetrate the mist; they couldn't detect anything within!

“A formation?” Ian gasped, his body trembling. The other Guest Elders' scalps prickled and their eyes glazed.

Formations weren't terrifying — what was terrifying was a formation that even Divine Sense couldn't pierce. Whoever set up such a formation must be unfathomably accomplished.

There's actually a formation master here?
