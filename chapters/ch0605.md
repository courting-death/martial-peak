## Chapter 605 — Return to Zhongdu

At Fenghuan Tower, Yang Kai closed his eyes to recuperate, drawing in the energy left behind after the Spider Mother’s death to bolster his own strength and deepen his comprehension of the Heavenly and Martial Dao.

A bewitching fragrance wafted to his nostrils. Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and was astonished to find the little girl Bilo half-kneeling before him, her beautiful eyes shining with an odd light as she surveyed him with curiosity.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai asked warily. This little girl had always borne hostility toward him; now, suddenly adopting a posture of worship, she made him feel ill at ease.

“I just realized—you’re amazing.” Bilo chattered excitedly. “How on earth did you kill the Spider Mother by yourself? That thing was a Seventh-Tier demonic beast! My master even said that even if she struck with full force she probably couldn’t do anything to it. The Thunder Beast King only cooperated with the Spider Mother—he never tamed it. Tell me—what method did you use that let you even take back its demonic core?”

It seemed that after Yang Kai had rescued Shan Qingluo, whatever grudge Bilo had held against him vanished at once.

Yang Kai frowned and did not answer her question, instead asking, “How is your master now?”

“Everything’s fine. The Poison Widow’s constitution remains, but it seems the toxins in her body have been dispelled.” Bilo pursed her lips into a coquettish smile—her allure striking to behold. Having lived with Shan Qingluo for years and cultivated charms, she had picked up a certain seductiveness; though she could not match Shan Qingluo, she was no ordinary woman. “Master is now vigorously attempting to breakthrough her bottleneck. Once she emerges from seclusion, her strength will likely advance further.”

“That’s good.” Yang Kai relaxed. “My matter with her is also, shall we say, settled.”

After a moment’s thought he said, “Well, since she’s in seclusion I won’t wait for her. I must hurry back to Zhongdu; when she emerges you can tell her for me.”

“You can’t leave!” Bilo suddenly lunged forward and gripped one of Yang Kai’s arms tightly.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise. “Why should I stay? There’s nothing for me here anymore.”

“In any case don’t go. When Master comes out, the first person she’ll want to see will definitely be you! If you leave, she’ll be heartbroken.”

“Don’t be so tiresome.” Yang Kai felt a headache coming on.

Bilo rolled her eyes for a moment before bursting into a coquettish laugh. “If you don’t leave, I’ll show you something nice.”

“What?”

Bilo’s cheeks flushed. Suddenly she set her face with resolve and rose; her slight frame trembled and her garments dissolved into tatters. A perfect, snow-white form was instantly bared before Yang Kai’s eyes, gleaming like exquisite jade, stirring the heart.

Her snow-white, elastic breasts stood proud and steady, dazzling the eyes; a flat, firm abdomen without a hint of excess flesh, and a private place likened to a lush meadow that invited endless fancy; her long, straight limbs were graceful, modestly pressed together yet could not hide that intoxicating fragrance.

She stood naked before Yang Kai, her curves beguiling enough to set any man’s blood racing, exquisite as a work of art and stirring in him a vicious impulse to ravage her.

Her pretty face was flushed crimson; the white, tender skin of her throat glowed red. She bit her ruby lips lightly, scarcely daring to meet Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Pretty?” Bilo’s voice was a whisper.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered; a flash of astonishment crossed his features, and the impatience he had shown before was replaced, for an instant, by a burning lust.

Yet it was only a moment. His gaze cleared and an odd smile tugged at his mouth. “Aren’t you into women? This doesn’t seem right—what the hell are you trying to do to me?”

Bilo blushed and hesitated. “Oh… men aren’t bad either. I can take both—can't I?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Alright, alright.” Bilo suddenly puckered her mouth. “Master said she can’t attend to you in her current state, so she asked me to take her place—to ease your solitude these days and also to thank you for what you did for her. When Master comes out she will personally see to you.”

Her coyness gone, she then boldly shoved Yang Kai down, straddled him with abandon and giggled, tapping her red lips with nimble fingers in a thoroughly wanton display. “How do you want it? Today you can do whatever you like.”

Yang Kai reached up, lifted her from his body, snatched the quilt from the bed and covered her, then got down from the bed without a word.

“You…” Bilo was dumbstruck, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment.

The last time he had lodged at Fenghuan Tower, even when she did not wish it, he had forced her to eat something; now she had deliberately tempted him and he remained unmoved—how could this be?

Is he still a man?

“Not in the mood.” Yang Kai shook his head lightly.

Su Yan had been taken by Meng Wuya to a foreign land; her situation was unknown, and Yang Kai had far too many matters to attend to. He simply had no mind for dalliance—especially with this Bilo, whose tastes were strange and could not be reasoned with. If she got attached to him, he feared she would be like a clingy snot-worm that he couldn't shake off.

“Demoness…” Yang Kai murmured.

Shan Qingluo’s voice rang swiftly inside his mind: “You little bastard, when did you become so proper?”

Her Divine Sense had been watching this place all along; how could Yang Kai not perceive it?

“I’ve always been proper,” Yang Kai snorted.

Shan Qingluo giggled, clearly unconvinced.

After a while she sighed softly, “You’re leaving, aren’t you?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded gently.

“Go, then. When I come out, I will seek you.”

“You probably won’t be able to find me. The place I’m going to is not in this world.”

“A higher realm?” Shan Qingluo asked.

“You knew about it?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Yang Bai mentioned some things, though not much. Besides… you bear my Soul Pursuit Seal. Even if you go to the ends of heaven and earth I will still find you.” Shan Qingluo smiled with pride.

Yang Kai grinned broadly. “If you can find me, then try. Take care of yourself while I’m gone!”

Saying that, he glanced at Bilo slumped on the bed, flicked a thread of energy into a long whip and lashed it across her pert behind.

Bilo gave a coquettish cry and her face immediately flushed; she looked extremely excited.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, leapt through the window and, in a moment, vanished from sight.

Bilo rose slowly, her body wrapped in the sheet, leaning by the window to watch the direction of Yang Kai’s departure, murmuring, “Master, is it proper to just let him go like that?”

“You tried to entice him and could not even keep him for a moment. He surely has greater matters on his mind. That little bastard appears lecherous, yet a woman’s body is but a mere seasoning to him. A fleshly body alone cannot bind him. He cares for me, but the weight of that care is light; when I become weighty enough in his heart, only then will he throw caution to the wind for me.”

“Love and affection are such trouble.” Bilo snorted.

“Hmm—he seems to have left something behind for you. Go and see for yourself.” Shan Qingluo instructed, then withdrew her Divine Sense and returned to seclusion.

Bilo froze at those words; she turned and found a water-nang by the bedside, taking it up in a daze, her heart filled with puzzlement.

………

Zhongdu.

The vast city of Zhongdu still lay half in ruins. Though cultivators from all the great powers had hastened here from thousands of li away because of the rich Spiritual Qi lingering in the city to aid reconstruction, the work would take at least a decade or so before Zhongdu could hope to regain a shred of its former appearance.

The strong of the Eight Great Families had mobilized in force, all participating in the reconstruction.

The eight young family heads, aided by the elder generation of powerhouses, directed and commanded the efforts, and everything proceeded in orderly fashion.

Qiu Yimeng was busy as well, a square of silk tied about her head, looking like a striking village lass.

“Family Head, you needn’t do the labor yourself. Just stand aside and watch—oh dear, if that delicate skin of yours were injured, what would we do?” an elderly Qiu family matron admonished the industrious Qiu Yimeng.

Qiu Yimeng smiled and shook her head. “It’s fine. I’m bored anyway—if I don’t do something, strange thoughts start popping into my head.”

“The Family Head is thinking about that Yang family brat again, isn’t she?” the matron snorted and sighed, “Too young to die, heaven envies talent.”

“Granny!” Qiu Yimeng pretended to scold, firmly declaring, “He’s not dead.”

The matron mouthed something, wishing to console but unsure how to phrase it.

It had been more than half a year since the Yang family’s youngster went missing. If he were truly alive, he should have appeared by now.

Nine out of ten people believed he was dead.

Only the young members of Yang Kai’s household steadfastly believed Yang Kai still lived, though they did not know which corner of the world he had drifted to.

Youth is a blessing—you can believe in someone without reservation. The matron sighed.

Suddenly a crisp eagle cry rang from the sky, laced with a hint of excitement. Hearing it, Qiu Yimeng snapped her head upward to see the Golden Feather Eagle that had been circling overhead suddenly streak outward from Zhongdu, turning into a beam of golden light and quickly vanishing.

Naturally the search for Yang Kai relied on the strength of the Yang family’s Golden Feather Eagles.

But over a dozen Golden Feather Eagles had searched for half a year with no result.

Only the Golden Feather Eagle from Yang Kai’s manor had continued circling above Zhongdu since his disappearance—until today, when it suddenly acted differently.

“What’s with that eagle?” the Qiu family matron asked in mild bewilderment.

Qiu Yimeng froze, her eyes brightening. Excitement came to her face. “He’s back! He’s back!”

As she spoke she lurched and dashed off toward the direction the Golden Feather Eagle had flown.

“Could he really be alive?” the matron exclaimed, stunned. She spread her Divine Sense but detected no extraordinary trace.

Thirty li away, Yang Kai squinted at the streak of golden light racing from Zhongdu and chuckled as he moved to meet it.
