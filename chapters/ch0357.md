## Chapter 357 — Battle of the Demonized

The heatwave surged, and Yang Kai's True Yang Yuan Qi had already been unleashed to its utmost limit. He displayed all the techniques he had mastered without any reservations, yet he still could not fend off the simultaneous attacks from the two Divine Roaming Realm experts.

With a loud crash, Yang Kai was struck in the chest by both Divine Roaming Realm experts at the same time, causing his complexion to pale slightly. He flew backward, crashing against a tree, splitting the tree, which was as thick as a bowl, in two before barely landing upright.

"Good!" Xie Rong watched anxiously, unable to help but shout out, as if taking credit for Yang Kai's injuries.

The experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard descended, standing a dozen zhang away from Yang Kai with solemn expressions, gazing at him intently.

Although Yang Kai had suffered injuries from their attacks, both knew deep down that such wounds meant nothing to him. The purity and strength of the True Yuan within this young man were astonishing, enough to withstand and mitigate eighty percent of their assault.

Regardless, both were satisfied with the outcome.

Two Divine Roaming Realm experts were teaming up to bully a True Yuan Realm cultivator; if they still couldn't win, their faces would be utterly lost.

"You brat, be a bit more arrogant, let this old man see!" one of the experts from Leiguang said with a gloomy face.

The expert from Feihong Courtyard also coldly glared at Yang Kai, saying, "You have killed so many disciples from our two sects. Today, I will make you pay with blood for your debt!"

"Heh heh heh..." Yang Kai slowly stood up. Although he looked somewhat miserable and isolated, he still grinned ferociously, wiping the blood that had spilled from the corner of his mouth, raising his gaze to meet the two Divine Roaming Realm experts with blazing battle intent in his eyes.

"Divine Roaming Realm. Quite extraordinary indeed!" Yang Kai's voice was low but steady.

The two opponents frowned slightly, unsure why he still appeared so at ease and fearless at this moment.

With a cold expression, the expert from Leiguang said, "Brat, despite your killing of so many disciples, we do not wish to take your life! If you voluntarily abandon your cultivation, we can spare you from death!"

Yang Kai grinned widely. "If you kill me, then Xiang Chu will have nothing to use against you, right?"

The eyes of the two Divine Roaming Realm experts narrowed simultaneously, secretly astonished at how keen Yang Kai's insight was.

Yang Kai had killed so many of their people; if they had the authority, would they spare his life? However, Xiang Chu ordered them to severely injure Yang Kai, but he must not be killed! Keeping Yang Kai alive held significant value.

Both sects wished to curry favor with the Xiang Family; why would they go against Xiang Chu's orders? He was the next head of the Xiang Family, and having a good relationship with him would greatly benefit both Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard.

Hearing Yang Kai's words, the expert from Leiguang coldly snorted, "The heavens have a way of preserving life, and this matter has nothing to do with Young Master Xiang!"

The Feihong Courtyard expert likewise rebuked, "Why aren’t you making your move? Do you need this old man to cripple you?"

"Alright, alright, alright!" Yang Kai nodded heavily, showing most of his white fangs, casting a sidelong glance at the two, "You're willing to be Xiang Chu's dogs; that’s your own misfortune!"

"You little beast, you truly don’t know the limits of heaven and earth!" the expert from Leiguang seethed with anger.

"You really think that two Divine Roaming Realm experts at the second stage can take me down?" Yang Kai's expression suddenly turned cold, raising a hand slowly. As he did, the blazing energy that had surrounded him vanished without a trace.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts sensed something was amiss and exchanged urgent glances, no longer willing to delay, they charged forward.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, lightly pressing his middle finger against his brow while murmuring softly.

His gentle voice contained a magical power, resonating like a clear drumbeat between heaven and earth.

"Enter Demonic State!"

Boom...

The entire world seemed to shudder. The ground trembled, the sky spun, and an unparalleled demonic aura spread explosively outward.

This aura of evil was so pure and powerful that it sent a chill deep into everyone’s hearts. The cruelty hidden within each heart seemed to be drawn out by this aura, and various evil thoughts surged forth.

Clouds swirled and the world became haunting; in that moment, Yang Kai seemed to undergo some transformation.

Before the two experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard could reach him, their expressions dramatically changed as they shrieked and were sent flying backward simultaneously.

Step, step, step…

After retreating a dozen steps, the two experts steadied themselves, gazing at Yang Kai with sheer horror.

This young man appeared to be no different from before, almost identical, yet the aura emanating from him was completely transformed, and the vitality and blood within him were vastly enhanced compared to before.

If the previous Yang Kai made them feel troubled, the current Yang Kai now made them sense a deadly danger!

A fatal danger!

Both were Divine Roaming Realm experts, and their perceptions were sharp. Although they didn’t understand how a single True Yuan Realm sixth-stage martial artist could undergo such a drastic change in an instant, their instincts were screaming that if they engaged him now, they might very well die!

Beasts possess their own instincts and insights!

So too did experts, more acutely than beasts.

The moment this thought struck them, both were taken aback. Why would a mere sixth-stage True Yuan Realm martial artist give them such an unsettling feeling?

Moreover, this demonic aura, even the six evil kings of Cangyun Evil Land likely did not emit such a terrifying killing intent.

Before they could calm their minds, a series of cracking sounds echoed forth.

Looking closely, they saw that centered on Yang Kai's position, an observable layer of icy cold aura rapidly extended outward. This aura froze the ground instantly.

In the span of a few breaths, the ground within dozens of zhang had transformed into frozen earth.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts retreated uncontrollably, their faces pale with fear.

This cold was unlike ordinary ice; it seemed capable of freezing their True Yuan. They dared not approach carelessly.

The young disciples were all trembling violently, staring in horror at everything unfolding.

Experiencing the second entry into the Demon was just as exquisite. Yang Kai shook his neck and arms, producing a sound akin to rattling beans.

Aside from his face, Yang Kai's body was now covered in intricate black patterns; these patterns were deep and complex, presenting a mysterious order unseen by others.

"You brat, you are indeed from Cangyun Evil Land!" the expert from Leiguang seemed to have discovered a secret and shouted in fright and excitement.

"Call me whatever you want!" Yang Kai was soaring with confidence, slowly raising a hand and targeting the positions of the two Divine Roaming Realm experts. Suddenly, he pressed down.

Nothing visibly appeared, yet as the two were pressed, they felt the weight of a mountain crashing down from above. Under this pressure, both felt as if all their power was enveloped, their True Yuan no longer ran as swiftly, and their movements slowed considerably.

"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."

The sound of slicing air rang out. The two looked ahead, their souls nearly escaping in shock as fear washed over them. Yang Kai launched black, ink-like attacks that flew towards them with terrifying speed.

These attacks resembled live bloodthirsty serpents in mid-air, suddenly snapping their vicious jaws open. They twisted and curled, revealing sharp fangs, moving at incredible velocity.

"Crack, crack..."

Wherever these attacks passed, the fierce winds plowed the ground, carving visible trenches, sending dirt flying everywhere, and creating chaos.

The ferocious attacks bore a cold and sharp energy, unbreakable, almost sweeping forward like a force of nature.

The two were already in shock and terror, their faces turning pale as they awkwardly dodged.

"Can you avoid this?" Yang Kai laughed wildly, gesturing, and all the demonic energy unleashed from his body scattered to either side, chasing after the two.

Moreover, the White Tiger Divine Ox Seal was once again summoned, revealing two ink-like beast souls. Instead of attacking the two Divine Roaming Realm experts, they charged towards the young disciples scattered nearby.

These two beast souls seemed considerably stronger than the previous two. They maneuvered and leapt, almost instantaneously reaching a dazed disciple from Feihong Courtyard.

This young disciple was merely at the eighth stage of the Separation and Union Realm and had not yet recovered from the shock before being torn apart by the beast soul, unable to even let out a scream.

"Run, run! If I cannot kill you, I will slaughter all your disciples!" Yang Kai shouted coldly.

Hearing this, the young disciples were rendered dumbfounded, a chill creeping down their spines.

"Despicable and shameless!" The expressions of the experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard changed drastically, cursing loudly.

As the two beast souls charged toward another young disciple, the two could no longer afford to avoid the issue. They struck out simultaneously, streaks of luminous light rushing towards the two beast souls to finally save that disciple.

"Not running anymore?" Yang Kai had been waiting for this moment. With a cruel smile, clusters of black light erupted from his body once more, transforming into sharp attacks that bombarded the two.

The experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard could no longer evade; attacks came from all directions. In their haste, they activated their True Yuan and took out their treasures to shield themselves, and the next moment they were engulfed by darkness.

Thunderous sounds rumbled from within that darkness.

Everyone's gaze was tense, staring at the source of the darkness, unsure what kind of fate awaited the two who were enveloped within.

Whoosh...

The darkness abruptly shattered, and two figures fell from the air, one after the other. Both looked disheveled and on the verge of collapse, appearing severely injured.

Not only that, but both of their eyes were bloodshot, flickering with all manner of evil light, their bodies cloaked in a faint black aura.

Those black lights were the purest demonic energy, infused with the power that Yang Kai had refined. A mere touch could kill ordinary people!

Yang Kai could ignore this evil, but others could not.

At this moment, the two were already affected in spirit by the demonic energy, tempted by the darker sides within their hearts. If they did not resolve this demonic energy in time, they would inevitably fall into Qi Deviation, losing their wits.

But how could one cleanse such demonic energy easily? Figures like Ling Taixu were also severely wounded by demonic energy and were unable to resolve it; how much less so for the two from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard?

From a certain perspective, the evil demonic energy Yang Kai possessed was even purer than that of the Evil Lord.

"You are truly vicious!" The expert from Leiguang glared hatefully at Yang Kai, murmuring curses.

"I already said, the price for offending me is one you cannot bear!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, his expression frigid.
