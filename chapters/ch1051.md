## Chapter 1051 — Branch

The Star Shuttle wove and leapt through the Starry Sky. With a peerless beauty like Xue Yue riding beside him, Yang Kai found not an ounce of tedium on the journey; instead, he surprisingly enjoyed every moment of it.

Xue Yue seemed to be experiencing an altogether different life.

All this time, she had maintained the identity of Xue Yue, the Third Young Master, presenting herself to others as a man.

She had lived like this for countless years. Only a handful within the Hengluo Commerce Guild knew her true sex; she could never reveal her real face to the world.

This chance occurrence allowed her to let down all her disguises and behave toward Yang Kai as her feminine side, and because of the Soul Chain, she felt little suspicion of Yang Kai, finding the man warm and seemingly an important part of her life.

Her mood brightened; her already breathtaking looks shone with even greater radiance, intoxicatingly beautiful, her fair face constantly rippling with bewitching charm.

Time passed; after more than a month weaving through the Starry Sky together, they finally arrived at a vividly colored star — Rainfall Star!

Yang Kai had thought the star was named for its gentle, continuous rains, but seeing it in the Starry Sky made clear that Rainfall Star was nothing like he had imagined.

The star was not large, only about a third the size of Shuiyue Star, yet it pulsed with overflowing vitality; its multicolored lights bathed the whole planet, draping it in a dreamlike hue.

A nearby massive sun’s radiance struck it and refracted into those myriad colors, making Rainfall Star resemble an even more enchanting fairyland.

Xue Yue’s beautiful eyes betrayed a trace of intoxication as she gazed at Rainfall Star in a daze.

Even Yang Kai could not help but marvel at the star’s beauty.

“When my strength is sufficient, I will become the Star Lord of Rainfall Star and bring this star under my control!” Xue Yue exclaimed, setting herself a grand ambition.

“You’ll have to work very hard for that; at the very least you must be able to defeat the current Star Lord!” Yang Kai laughed, taking it as the kind of youthful fancy a girl might entertain.

Xue Yue’s eyes suddenly curved into crescent moons; she covered her mouth and laughed softly, “Rainfall Star has no Star Lord. I know you’re from a lower-grade continent, but don’t act like you understand everything.”

“No Star Lord?” Yang Kai was taken aback. “Why no Star Lord? Doesn’t your guild have experts?”

He knew that people of Star Lord rank were usually Void King Realm experts; though not numerous, each great power typically had at least a few.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild was fairly renowned in the Star Domain; it seemed impossible they would have no Void King Realm experts.

“Of course our guild has hidden experts. Their strength would be enough to serve as Star Lord for Rainfall Star. But it’s not simply about being strong — to become the Star Lord of a cultivation star you must imprint your life into the star’s Stellar Origin. That process carries tremendous danger; even Void King Realm cultivators can meet disaster, being devoured by the Stellar Origin’s backlash and losing their lives.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed.

Xue Yue continued patiently: “Void King Realm experts are scarce. Some prefer seclusion rather than risking fusing with a Stellar Origin. Moreover, once you become the Star Lord of a cultivation star, you have effectively entrusted your life to that star. If the cultivation star undergoes a cataclysm or is destroyed, the Star Lord will surely perish. In the past this has happened — Star Lords perished due to the destruction of their cultivation stars.”

“Like you and me, mutually doomed?” Yang Kai cried.

“More or less. But that kind of entanglement is one-sided, so there are cultivation stars in the Star Domain without Star Lords; Rainfall Star is one of them.”

“And you still want to become the Star Lord?” Yang Kai gave him a strange look.

Xue Yue smiled, “Though there are many inconveniences, becoming a Star Lord also brings enormous benefits. Otherwise why would any experts choose to become Star Lords of cultivation stars? Every choice has pros and cons; it depends on the person.”

She seemed surprisingly unconcerned about it. Yang Kai felt the same and couldn't help recalling the Floating Continent where he had once suffered misfortune.

Back then, when the Ghost Ancestor forced him to search for a way out, his Divine Sense Threads had accidentally broken into the depths of the Floating Continent, where he felt an exceedingly surging energy.

That energy had nourished his Divine Sense Threads, making the strands that were on the verge of drying suddenly full and strong.

That mass of energy resembled a Stellar Origin. Unfortunately, even after covertly asking the Ghost Ancestor around in circles, he couldn’t learn anything definitive.

Speaking with Xue Yue now, he was faintly more convinced that it had indeed been a Stellar Origin.

“Do you know how to fuse with a Stellar Origin?” Yang Kai asked.

“What are you asking that for?” Xue Yue looked at him in surprise.

“Just wondering.” Yang Kai shrugged, feigning indifference.

Xue Yue’s expression grew suspicious; clearly she did not fully trust him, but she nevertheless revealed what information she knew.

She felt that even if she didn’t say anything, Yang Kai would sooner or later figure it out, so there was no harm in speaking.

Yang Kai quietly stored her words in his heart, keeping his face calm, intending to return to the Floating Continent when he had time to verify his guess.

If that energy truly was a Stellar Origin, he could try to fuse with it — success would bring tremendous gain.

While they were talking, the two had already passed through thick cloud layers and arrived above Rainfall Star.

“Let’s go over there!” Xue Yue pointed to the patch where Spiritual Qi was most concentrated. “Our guild’s branch is set up that way!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and silently steered the shuttle toward that direction.

After a few hours, a chain of rolling mountains came into view, and within them countless palaces stood silently.

In the center of the mountains lay a fairly large plaza, where warships constantly flew in and out, ferrying goods.

Most of those ships bore the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s insignia, though some came from other great powers, using the place to transfer or purchase supplies.

Yang Kai, having seen such things before, calmly followed Xue Yue’s directions through the mountains.

She seemed to have been here before and was very familiar with the terrain. Following her lead, they soon arrived at a grand hall.

Xue Yue lightly leaped down from the Star Shuttle, waved to Yang Kai, and strode straight into the hall.

At the entrance stood several guards dressed in imposing armor, holding silver spears, their expressions solemn.

When they saw Xue Yue, the guards’ eyes brightened; they involuntarily straightened and acted sturdy and reliable.

A slight curve lifted Xue Yue’s mouth — she seemed very pleased by the scene.

She had never had the chance before to conquer unfamiliar men with her feminine side; the guards’ behavior greatly catered to her vanity.

“Miss, please stop. May I ask your business?” one guard stepped forward and blocked Xue Yue, adopting an officious manner.

“I wish to see Branch Chief Halika!” Xue Yue flipped a small token in her hand and produced a badge. The guard stared, then his face went solemn as he exclaimed, “So it is a Lady from the main star!”

At the sight of the token, he had immediately changed how he addressed Xue Yue and no longer dared to show off any masculine swagger, because that badge was the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s highest token, reserved only for the honored Lords and Ladies of the main star.

Such status was clearly well beyond what a lowly guard could aspire to.

“Branch Chief Halika has been waiting a long time. Please enter, Lady!” He quickly stepped aside to make way.

Xue Yue nodded with satisfaction, signaled to Yang Kai, and they entered together.

The guards maintained their usual solemn countenances, mixed with respect for Xue Yue and a touch of puzzlement — they couldn’t understand why Yang Kai was following such a noble Lady. The boy’s cultivation seemed little different from theirs; he could only be a guard, yet this Lady treated him with surprising ease.

What kind of damned luck had this kid walked into? To have such fortune and follow behind a Lady so splendidly?

The guards muttered resentfully in their hearts; they had personally seen Yang Kai and Xue Yue arrive together on the same shuttle, looking intimate, and they envied him for it.

Just as Yang Kai and Xue Yue stepped into the hall, angry rebukes sounded from within. Not long after, several warriors came rushing out, their faces smeared with dust and each more disheveled than the last.

Xue Yue pursed her lips and smiled, explaining softly, “The branch chief here has always had a bad temper and often scolds and strikes his subordinates, so he’s very unpopular. Don’t speak up later, or you might get him riled.”

“I know—I won’t say anything.” Yang Kai nodded. He had come mainly to accompany Xue Yue and didn’t intend to meddle.

“Who are you people? Don’t you know it’s a bad habit to gossip behind others’ backs?” a cold snort came from inside, sounding displeased.

Xue Yue couldn’t help but stick out her tongue, then her entire demeanor shifted; she strode in with decisive force.

Yang Kai followed closely.

Inside sat an old man in purple robes upon a chair, looking at them coldly.

His bearing was awe-inspiring; heavy as a mountain, he sat like a peak, and an invisible aura and pressure rolled out from him toward the surroundings.

Yang Kai had only walked a few steps when his feet felt as if loaded with ten thousand pounds, almost unable to move. Xue Yue’s light steps seemed to thicken; her brows tightened as she struggled to move her delicate frame.

Because of Xue Yue’s earlier words, Branch Chief Halika clearly disliked them and sought to embarrass them on purpose, deliberately making things difficult for them.
