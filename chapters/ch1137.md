## Chapter 1137 — Concession and Sharing

Huang Juan, though not young, had preserved her looks with skill; now she seemed no more than in her thirties, at the height of her allure. Her figure was excellent: her twin peaks full and proud, hips rounded and perky, legs long and straight, waist slim and graceful. Her skin was fair with a healthy flush, dewy and alluring—such a beauty naturally stirred the hearts of those guards.

"Eldest Brothers, I'm from the Haike Family; I have urgent matters to report to City Lord Fei Zhi Tu." Huang Juan forced a smile, inwardly cursing Ian a string of vicious names.

Ian had deliberately sent her to deliver the letter; he clearly relied on her being a woman, thinking it easier and more polite for a woman to deal with the City Lord.

But she hadn't even entered the lord's mansion before a few guards, each only of the Saint Realm, gathered to gawk. Huang Juan felt both furious and helpless. Elsewhere, with her Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation she could have killed these men without exertion, but this was the City Lord's mansion, Yingyue Hall territory—unless she wished to die, she could not act.

"Haike Family?" One guard with a horse‑long face and ugly features repeated in a sneering tone, shaking his head. "Never heard of them. Have any of you heard of them?"

Another guard immediately explained, “It’s a small outer family affiliated with the Sect.”

"An outer branch family, huh." The horse‑faced man nodded lightly. "No wonder I've never heard of them. What business do these outer branch family people have coming here?"

He looked arrogant, utterly dismissive of the Haike Family, which made Huang Juan grit her teeth. She could only keep smiling and say, "Eldest Brothers, I truly have urgent matters to report to City Lord Fei Zhi Tu. Please do me the favor of passing the word."

The horse‑faced guard snorted coldly. "The Lord is beset with affairs, handling state matters daily—what time would he have for people like you? Go back where you came from."

There were countless outer branch families under Yingyue Hall. These peripheral forces were incredibly weak; though the guards were only of the Saint Realm, they long considered themselves disciples of Yingyue Hall and looked down on others. So even though Huang Juan's cultivation exceeded theirs, they paid her no mind.

Hearing that horse‑faced guard, Huang Juan bit her lip and suddenly put on a load of coquettish charm, flashing him a seductive smile and beckoning, "Eldest Brother, could you step closer and speak with me?"

She'd worked outside long enough to be adept at dealing with people; she well knew that it was easier to meet the small devils than the big devil—how to curry favor with the powerful and handle the petty.

"Oh?" The horse‑faced guard leered and chuckled lewdly. "Does the lass have something she can't say in public?"

He smirked and swaggered toward Huang Juan, nodding and wagging his head as he came.

When he arrived beside her, Huang Juan slipped some Saint Crystals from her Spatial Ring and quietly pressed them into his hand, speaking softly, "Guard brother, please do me a favor."

The horse‑faced guard didn't even bother to look—he tucked the Saint Crystals into his Spatial Ring, then suddenly grabbed Huang Juan's tender hand and began to rub it with force. As if he'd never seen a woman before, his face showed lascivious intent and he murmured low, "Lass, it isn't that I don't want to help… it's just that the Lord truly has no time…"

Huang Juan shivered at his touch, gooseflesh breaking out all over; she wanted nothing more than to tear the bastard limb from limb. She forced down her fury and produced even more Saint Crystals, handing them over while pleading, "Please, just go in and report it. Whether the Lord receives me or not, I won't complain."

Once he had received more Saint Crystals, the horse‑faced guard showed a satisfied look and squeezed her hand again before smiling, "Fine. Since you're here and it's not easy for you, I'll pass the message. But don't get your hopes up; the Lord is truly very busy."

"I know, I know—thank you, Eldest Brother." Huang Juan breathed a private sigh of relief; she was truly afraid that the brute would continue taking liberties.

Seeing that horse‑faced guard enter the City Lord's mansion, Huang Juan stood outside and waited anxiously.

After a short while he came back out, and the evil look on his face made Huang Juan's heart sink; she knew things had gone badly and hurried up to ask, "What did the Lord say?"

Having had his fill, the guard wasn't angry but said, "He refused to see you, and he even scolded me."

"Ah…" Huang Juan sighed deeply, a flood of helplessness swelling within her. She had no family in this world and had always relied on her own grit to train. She had advanced to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and a decade or so ago had entered the Haike Family as a Guest Elder. She had hoped to use the Haike Family as a stepping stone toward Yingyue Hall, dreaming of the day she might join them. Now she realized the Haike Family meant nothing to Yingyue Hall; as a mere Guest Elder she couldn't even obtain a single audience with the City Lord.

Deep in her heart she cursed Ian, who had sent her to the lord's mansion, a thousand times.

Back at the Haike Family some elders had had designs on her; she came here and was taken advantage of. Weak in strength and without backing, life in this world was truly hard.

She suddenly felt despondent, wondering whether she should leave the Haike Family. The clan afforded no future; staying would only waste her years.

"Lass, why don't you wait outside a few days and I'll find a chance to pass the message again?" The horse‑faced guard, evidently not sated, grinned lecherously and asked.

"No need." Huang Juan's expression turned cold and she turned away.

"Ungrateful!" the horse‑faced guard sneered.

After returning to the Haike Family, Huang Juan was fiercely scolded by Ian when he learned she had failed to complete even such a simple task. Only then did Ian prepare the gifts and personally set out for Tianyun City.

Huang Juan felt utterly wronged, her disappointment in the Haike Family deepening.

...

Yang Kai came out of his stone chamber and immediately heard commotion—loud and fierce. Curious, he walked toward the noise and soon arrived at a huge stone hall.

This stone chamber was likely one that Yang Yan later had the Stone Puppet carve out, meant as a place for many people to gather and discuss matters. At this moment, nearly twenty people were assembled inside. Some of them had reddened eyes, some were filled with righteous anger, and others were shouting and clamoring.

Yu Feng was the most outrageous, standing atop a stone table, gesturing grandly and spitting insults at one after another of the warriors; his slanders sprayed on both men and women alike.

Yang Kai frowned, feeling displeased.

He had first assumed these followers of Wu Yi were arguing over an unequal distribution of supplies; if so, Yang Kai wouldn't want them in his cave—people who wouldn't share with their own for trivial gains would only cause instability. But after listening for a while he realized the matter was different.

It was still about distribution of supplies, but not the Saint Crystals or the Secret Treasure; it concerned pills.

Those ten King Transformation Pills that could raise a warrior to the Saint King Realm!

They weren’t quarreling because they couldn’t obtain the King Transformation Pill—it turned out they were arguing over who should give it up.

It had been three days and they still had no reasonable distribution plan. Wu Yi stood within the hall, her pretty face full of helplessness but also of secret satisfaction.

"Damn it, Liu Ping, I remember you broke into the Third Stage of the Saint Realm nine years ago, right? You're already at the pinnacle—why won't you take a King Transformation Pill? Is it because you're snubbing the miss? Snub the miss and you're snubbing me, Yu Feng—don't blame me for thrashing you!"

Liu Ping grinned and replied earnestly, "Yu Feng, I'm nearly sixty years old. My talent is poor—if I took the King Transformation Pill it would likely go to waste and I wouldn't break through. Rather than waste it on me, give it to Ge Wusheng; his aptitude is far better and he's also at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. If he gets it, he can surely breakthrough."

The man in the blue robe, Ge Wusheng, immediately shook his head. "I don't want it. Give me two more years and I'll break through on my own; there's no need to waste a King Transformation Pill. Yu Feng, give it to Xiao Ya."

A young married woman, delicate and pretty, hurriedly waved her hand, "I don't want it either. I can rely on myself to breakthrough."

Veins bulged on Yu Feng's forehead—he seemed about to curse, but held his tongue and turned to Wu Yi with a pleading look, "Miss, I can't handle this. These idiots all refuse it—how am I supposed to decide?"

Wu Yi sighed and was about to speak when Yang Kai appeared at the doorway with a smile and quickly stepped forward.

“These people are truly remarkable,” Yang Kai said with heartfelt admiration. For so many years, he had struggled alone in the outside world, long accustomed to deception and scheming, to people dying for wealth and birds for food, to those who wore righteous faces while stabbing others in the back. The King Transformation Pill could help one reach the Saint King Realm—it could at least save a cultivator a year or two of bitter cultivation—yet none of these qualified martial artists wanted it for themselves; all of them only thought of letting others use it. Such humility and harmony were things Yang Kai had not seen in a long time, and they warmed his heart.

"You flatter me, Eldest Brother Yang," Wu Yi blushed. "They're just a bunch of unworldly people. Ten King Transformation Pills and they've been bickering for three days and still can't decide. Have we bothered you, Eldest Brother?"

Having witnessed Yang Kai’s abilities, Wu Yi’s way of addressing him had changed. Moreover, after the experience of leaving her family, she had grown noticeably more mature.

"You didn't bother me. The formation Yang Yan set up is good—I'd only just come out when I heard the noise." Yang Kai smiled and asked curiously, "Are King Transformation Pills hard to get?"

Wu Yi nodded. “The King Transformation Pill is a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level pill—it’s quite expensive. A single pill costs at least two thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, something most people could never afford. But the price isn’t the main issue—it’s that you simply can’t buy it. Many people need this kind of pill, yet few can refine it. On Dark Star, our alchemy and artifact refining are far behind those of the outside world. The most skilled artifact refiners and alchemists we have are only at the Origin-Grade Lower-Level.”
