## Chapter 821 — Long Time No See

The lake’s surface rippled with light. The water was crystal clear, and a few plump fish could be seen swimming freely within.

By the lakeshore stood a man, smiling as he looked at Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu, who had come with Liu Gui. He raised a hand in greeting. “You two—long time no see.”

Ruan Xinyu and Yun Xuan didn’t answer; for a moment, they stared as if stunned.

Yang Kai shook his head helplessly and strode toward them.

When he came near, Liu Gui—the one who had led the way—hurriedly saluted, fawning and obsequious. “Saint Lord, this little one had no eyes to recognize Mount Tai. Please don’t hold it against me.”

“It’s fine,” Yang Kai said with a shake of his head.

Liu Gui let out a breath and said respectfully, “My lord, I’ve brought these two ladies to you.”

“Well done.” Yang Kai patted the young man—whose Soul Imprint he had bound using the Supreme Heaven Draw—making him both flattered and flustered. “As I should, as I should,” Liu Gui said quickly.

After a beat of hesitation, Liu Gui asked, stammering, “My lord, I mean you no harm. Could you return, um, that Soul Imprint to me first? Rest assured, I—Liu Gui—will never reveal a word about you. If I do, may thunder strike me dead.”

Seeing his solemn oath, Yang Kai chuckled. “I can’t agree to that for now. But I won’t harm you—as long as you behave.”

“How would I dare disobey?” Liu Gui said bitterly. The last time, before Yang Kai left the Nine Peaks for the Beast Sea Great Forest, he and some companions tried to intercept him. Not only did they fail, Yang Kai captured him, and now he had to work for the man. If the Hall Master ever found out, even nine lives wouldn’t be enough.

Thinking of that, Liu Gui felt more wretched than swallowing bitter gall.

“Those who behave get benefits.” Reading his mood, Yang Kai tossed him a bottle of pills.

Liu Gui snatched it up, quick as a flash. He popped the cork and sniffed, then cried out in delight, “Spirit‑Grade pills?”

“Do the job well and there’ll be plenty more,” Yang Kai said approvingly.

“Yes, yes—thank you, Saint Lord!” Liu Gui said, eyes brimming with gratitude.

He was a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator with a low station in War Soul Hall and little regard day‑to‑day. Pills for cultivation were issued per head; at most, he got two or three Mystery‑Grade pills a month. Yet for a trivial errand for Yang Kai, he had been given a whole bottle of Spirit‑Grade pills.

It was like a pie from the heavens, leaving Liu Gui dizzy with joy. He hardly cared that Yang Kai held his Soul Imprint and controlled his life and death.

Inwardly, he felt that following this Saint Lord would surely lead to boundless prospects.

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai was satisfied. A grasping, fair‑weather sort like this could be made to risk his life for a little sweetness.

With a flick of his hand, he dispelled the restriction Ruan Xinyu had placed on Liu Gui, then waved. “You can go. You’re not needed here.”

“Yes, Saint Lord. If there’s ever anywhere you can use me, please do command it,” Liu Gui said earnestly.

“There’ll be that chance,” Yang Kai said with a nod and a smile.

Only then did Liu Gui turn to leave. Before he went, he shot Yun Xuan a look filled with envy and muttered, “Miss, you’re truly blessed.”

He seemed to think that having some connection with the new Saint Lord was like marrying up.

Yun Xuan flushed, and Ruan Xinyu glared at him. “Big mouth!”

Liu Gui let out a dry chuckle and hurried away.

After he left, Yang Kai smiled at the two women before him. “It’s been years, and you’re both as graceful and captivating as ever.”

“Sweet talker!” Ruan Xinyu scoffed. “You bastard—if you weren’t dead, why didn’t you send Yun Xuan a word? You made her grieve for you for so long.”

“Xinyu…” Yun Xuan breathed, biting her lip. She stared at Yang Kai without blinking, and the man who had tugged at her heartstrings suddenly seemed so tall that she could only look up at him from afar.

When she first met him, his cultivation had been lower than hers. He dressed like a bumpkin, as if he had just walked out of some deep forest.

Yet after a few years, he had become the new Saint Lord of Nine Heavens Sacred Land, and his cultivation far outstripped her own.

Now, while she was at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, he had already reached the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm…

At that rate, even decades of hard work might not narrow the gap.

Standing before him, Yun Xuan couldn’t help feeling ashamed and inferior, a bitter taste filling her heart.

Noticing Yun Xuan’s strangeness, Yang Kai frowned, unsure what she was thinking. He gave a strained smile. “Don’t tell me you can’t recognize me anymore?”

“I’d know you even if you were ashes,” Yun Xuan said with a forced smile.

“Then why look at me like a stranger?” Yang Kai pinched his nose. “If you’re angry that I didn’t let you know I was safe, I apologize. I’ve truly been too busy these years—and some things, I really didn’t want others to know.”

“Hah, I knew you were a heartless man,” Ruan Xinyu fumed. “You wanted to toy with someone and run, not take responsibility.”

“What responsibility? That incident was an accident, okay?” Yang Kai said, beyond awkward.

He really hadn’t thought much about Yun Xuan these years. He did feel guilty toward her, but he hadn’t put her on the same level as his Little Senior Sister or Su Yan.

If not for the Enchantress’s Divine Sense poison back then, that awkward incident never would have happened.

“So you really won’t admit it. I misjudged you,” Ruan Xinyu said with utter disdain, eyes full of scorn.

Yang Kai could only shake his head.

Yun Xuan had remained silent until now. She finally let out a long breath and smiled faintly. “Xinyu, drop it. There’s no meaning in harping on this. Some things and some people—having once had them is enough. There’s no need to cling.”

“You really can let go,” Ruan Xinyu said, surprised as she looked at Yun Xuan.

“But you—why did you have a War Soul Hall disciple bring us here? Why does he obey your orders?” Yun Xuan asked, puzzled.

“Oh. We had a little conflict half a month ago. I did something to him then, so I can communicate with him via Divine Sense. I saw you today and had him bring you over.” Yang Kai added, “Did your Duao Alliance get dragged into this too?”

“Mm.” Yun Xuan nodded. “The previous Saintess of your Sacred Land went to our territory and killed some low‑ranking disciples. Then Zhang Ao of Poxuan Palace invited my father over to demand an explanation from Nine Heavens Sacred Land. He came—but they clearly had no intention of reconciling with you. They wanted to start a fight from the outset.”

“They dragged you over just to pad their numbers,” Yang Kai said with a cold laugh.

“That’s how it seems. In fact, many forces experienced the same thing as our alliance. Before we came, two small forces wanted to leave, and Zhang Ao and the others wiped them out.”

Yang Kai’s eyelids lowered. “They truly dared to go that far.”

“After this, I don’t think anyone else will dare leave. And Zhang Ao and the others spoke with such certainty—saying that next time they attack, they’ll flatten your Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Can you… hold them off?”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “If we really fight, it will only end in ruin for both sides. The Sacred Land won’t have it easy, and neither will you.”

“Then what do you plan to do? You should leave quickly. Staying there is too dangerous.”

“Don’t worry. I have my own countermeasures. But you mustn’t get involved,” Yang Kai said solemnly. “If you do, your Duao Alliance will suffer heavy losses.”

“What do you mean?” Yun Xuan asked, startled.

“It’s hard to explain now. Just persuade your father when you return and have him take your people away quickly. Something big will happen here soon.”

Yun Xuan frowned and nodded slightly. She chose to trust him without further explanation.

Off to the side, Ruan Xinyu gave a little snort. “Aren’t you a bit too confident? Your barrier is decent, and you have a few experts, but from what I know, the helpers Zhang Ao gathered include twice as many Saint Realm experts as you.”

“So what?” Yang Kai sneered. “If they dare stay, they’ll pay the price.”

“I just don’t get you,” Ruan Xinyu said, slowly shaking her head. “How did someone like you become the new Saint Lord of Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

“Everyone has their fortunes,” Yang Kai chuckled. “I’d rather not be any ‘Saint Lord’ at all.”

Ruan Xinyu curled her lip, clearly unconvinced. In her eyes, any man getting such a chance would be giddy with joy—who would be as dismissive as Yang Kai claimed?

This brat was clearly taking advantage and still playing coy! Ruan Xinyu looked down on him all the more, certain his rapid rise owed entirely to Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s cultivation.

If Nine Heavens Sacred Land had trained her, she could have reached such heights too.

“Anything else you want to say?” Yun Xuan asked, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai blinked, then shook his head. “No.”

“Then we’ll head back. Being out too long will arouse suspicion.” Yun Xuan’s expression grew complicated as she glanced at Yang Kai. “In any case, thank you for the warning. I’ll speak with my father. And… be careful. I know you’re stronger now and your status is different, but one person’s power is limited. If you run into something you can’t handle, don’t be stubborn.”

“Mm. I’ll remember,” Yang Kai said with a solemn nod.

“We’ll be going then. If we get through this crisis, you’re welcome to visit Duao City anytime.” With a small smile, Yun Xuan left alongside Ruan Xinyu.

Standing there watching their silhouettes fade, Yang Kai’s mood surged. He hadn’t expected the woman to leave so cleanly, without a trace of lingering attachment.

He had been mulling over how to soothe her mood—but apparently, there was no need.
