## Chapter 2082 — Ambush

Ghost-Hand Shentu — who in Fenglin City did not know of him? Qin Chaoyang had long mixed among the Dao Origin Realm experts here, and he had crossed paths with Shentu several times; because of differing stances they had come to blows twice.

Though Shentu’s deeds were despicable, Qin Chaoyang could not deny his strength; he considered him a major enemy. In those two clashes he had only managed to gain a slight advantage, utterly unable to deliver a decisive blow to Shentu, who had arrogantly fled in the end.

But from what Qin Yu said, Yang Kai had actually been able to grievously wound Shentu at the moment he was ascending to the Dao Origin Realm!

In other words, at that time Yang Kai was not yet at the Dao Origin Realm — he had only been at the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Qin Chaoyang could not even imagine what kind of power a person would need to injure Shentu under those circumstances.

Did that not mean that Yang Kai at that time was far beyond anything Qin Chaoyang could contend with?

Now that Yang Kai had already advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, his cultivation had leapt an entire great tier; his strength now was likely to have multiplied many times over!

Thinking of this, Qin Chaoyang suddenly felt his breathing grow heavy, realizing that though he had tried to overestimate Yang Kai’s abilities before, he had still underestimated him.

“And Shentu?” Qin Chaoyang asked urgently.

Shentu also had some old grievances with the Qin Family; if they could find his whereabouts while he was injured and recuperating, perhaps they could cut him down and eliminate the future threat.

Qin Yu forced a smile. “I was just about to tell Patriarch — Shentu is dead!”

“Dead?” Qin Chaoyang narrowed his eyes. “Didn’t you just say he’d only been severely wounded? How did he then die?”

"At that time, Lord Yang... as he was ascending, had another Dao Origin Realm expert hidden in the shadows as his guardian. When Shentu was grievously wounded and fell back, that person killed him with a single strike! Sadly... I couldn't make out what that guardian looked like or how great his true strength might have been."

“Oh?” Qin Chaoyang’s face lit with interest. “You mean Young Brother Yang has another hidden expert behind him?”

Qin Yu nodded, excited. “Patriarch, this person is a wandering martial artist — if we could recruit him into the Qin Family, our strength would surely grow. Besides, he has an even greater master behind him; befriending him would benefit the Qin Family!”

A flicker crossed Qin Chaoyang’s eyes. “I understand what you mean, but this matter must wait until after we resolve the current crisis.”

“I know, Patriarch, but keep him in mind. We must not offend this person.” Qin Yu solemnly warned, an unusual light flashing in her eyes as she added in a low voice, “Perhaps the revival of the Qin Family will hinge upon this person.”

Hearing that, Qin Chaoyang brightened. “Yu’er, did you see anything else?”

Qin Yu shook her head. “My Destiny Eye can only see that this person bears immense fortune and opportunities; his future is definitely not in Fenglin City.”

Qin Chaoyang’s expression moved. “With you saying that, I’m reassured.”

After they spoke, the two looked outward, but all beyond was pitch-black and nothing could be seen. Only that rolling Demonic Qi churned and gathered in one direction; from the black miasma came continuous howls of demonic beasts, chilling to the bone.

“Where did all these ghostly things come from?”

Outside the city, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed. He had not noticed while inside the walls, but once he stepped into the boundless darkness he found the demonic beasts hidden within the Demonic Qi to be endless — beyond counting.

He felt like a single point of light in the pitch black, drawing countless monsters to swarm and attack.

Under the suppression of spatial laws, the space around him thickened; any demon that entered within twenty zhang of him, regardless of cultivation, faltered and became clumsy in its movement.

Under the flashing golden light, all the monsters were sliced into pieces by Golden Blood Threads.

Even though Yang Kai fought with heroic invincibility, the monsters relentlessly hurled themselves at him, and before long the ground beneath his feet had become a mountain of corpses.

With Origin Qi protecting his body, he could resist the Demonic Qi’s corrosion, yet from the crackling sounds it was clear the Demonic Qi’s corrosive power was also great — long exposure in such an environment took a considerable toll on Yang Kai.

“Come out!”

After slaughtering for a time, Yang Kai tightened his brow and called. The Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal appeared together, flanking him on left and right.

Once the two Blood Beasts appeared, they obeyed Yang Kai’s commands.

The Yao Worm Matriarch’s two pincers wielded the Purple-Green Twin Swords, sending forth bi-colored radiance and an icy profound intent; in an instant the sky chilled within a hundred zhang, snowflakes fell and swept across the bodies of the monsters, slicing them in twain amid their wails.

The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal tore at the air, spewing spheres of flame and purple lightning; though not as powerful as the Yao Worm Matriarch, it could hold its own.

Hissssss…

The blood-light aura on the two Blood Beasts nearly congealed into substance, emitting a faint golden-red glow that repelled the pervasive Demonic Qi.

For a time, the situation stabilized.

With no bystanders about, Yang Kai relaxed his movements; spatial power swirled around him and various spatial secret arts alternated, and with the two Blood Beasts’ cooperation the countless demons could not approach within three zhang of him!

This was also due to the generally low level of martial artists near Fenglin City; although the Demonic Qi had empowered the monsters somewhat, they were far from formidable.

Otherwise Yang Kai could not have handled things here so deftly.

After a long, fierce struggle, Yang Kai grew intoxicated with killing and paid no heed to his own depletion; Moon Blades flew outward, each clearing a neat channel.

Just then the Yao Worm Matriarch seemed to sense something; with the twin swords crossing, a surge of icy Law Power shot off in a certain direction.

From that direction, a shadowy figure that had been sneaking closer was suddenly revealed.

This person looked different from the other monsters; a violent aura issued from him, and he was shrouded in a deep Demonic Qi. Whatever secret art he used had hidden him from Yang Kai’s perception until now.

If not for the Yao Worm Matriarch’s detection, Yang Kai would have realized only when the man was right beside him.

“A Jiang Family person?” Yang Kai reacted with remarkable swiftness; the instant the Yao Worm Matriarch struck he had turned his gaze that way and saw that the man was indeed an elder of the Jiang Family, the same one he had clashed with above the mine pit.

Yang Kai did not know his name.

This Jiang Family elder had previously been at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and now he seemed even stronger; the energy waves from his body reached Dao Origin Realm levels, yet strangely he still remained at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

Yang Kai’s heart stirred; he immediately understood this must be the work of the Demonic Qi.

Once corrupted by Demonic Qi, one’s reason might be stripped away, but their power would often be greatly magnified.

This Jiang Family elder, once turned into a demonic human, naturally grew stronger; yet Demonic Qi could not truly transform him into a Dao Origin Realm martial artist — it only amassed Origin Qi within him without changing its quality.

"Courting death!" Yang Kai spat. He loathed the Jiang Family—the very architects of Fenglin City's disaster—with a hatred that ran deep. If they hadn't recklessly ransacked that mine pit, he would never have been dragged into this calamity.

He could very well be safely secluded in his cave right now, peacefully cultivating.

Sensing Yang Kai’s murderous intent, the Yao Worm Matriarch did not hesitate and swung its twin swords; two differently hued radiances crossed and sliced through the Jiang Family elder’s body.

The sound of flesh being torn rang out.

Though the Jiang Family elder’s strength had been raised somewhat by the Demonic Qi, how could he stand against the Yao Worm Matriarch?

After the radiance passed, the Jiang Family elder’s body tore into four pieces.

Before dying he had shown no fear; instead he howled as if mad.

"Whoosh…" At that moment another figure suddenly emerged beside Yang Kai, wielding a long sword that had turned completely black and exuded a pitch-black aura; with a tremor the sword stabbed at the back of Yang Kai’s head.

The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal opened its jaws and spat a fireball the size of a basin toward him.

The man did not dodge; the fireball struck him squarely, dispersing the black Demonic Qi on his body, and a scorched smell arose.

But after taking the blow head-on, his long sword nevertheless pierced Yang Kai’s skull.

“Hahaha!” After landing the blow he laughed wildly, his laughter deranged and imbued with unimaginable malignance.

“Brother Chuhe, you seem very pleased!”

A calm voice inexplicably came from behind him.

The demonic human turned in alarm, and to his surprise the target he had thought to have killed — Yang Kai — had somehow already appeared behind him, looking at him with derisive mockery.

The body before him that had supposedly been pierced in the head slowly dissipated; it had been a phantom.

Seeing him look over, Yang Kai snorted. “Brother Chuhe, why are you laughing so happily? Say it and make me happy too.”

Earlier the Jiang Family elder had concealed himself and nearly succeeded in a sneak attack; Yang Kai would not be so careless. He had detected Jiang Chuhe’s move instantly, and with his skill, evading such a sneak attack was easy.

Now Jiang Chuhe gave off an aura a notch stronger than the Jiang Family elder; it seemed he simply could not break through the Dao Origin Realm barrier and therefore could not wield Law Power, yet in other respects he possessed what only Dao Origin Realm experts had.

Being mocked by Yang Kai, Jiang Chuhe snapped and his expression turned savage; surging Demonic Qi boiled out of him, his once black and crimson eyes turned even darker as if they could suck in a person’s soul.
