## Chapter 193 — Overseas Secrets

Gradually, more and more cracks appeared on the stone door, and it seemed on the verge of being shattered.

But suddenly, a clear and crisp eagle cry echoed from afar.

The faces of the people attacking the stone door changed dramatically.

“It’s that giant eagle!” one person shouted in terror. “It’s the giant eagle that tore apart the Grand Elder!”

They could not help but panic. Previously, under the leadership of Huo Xianglan, they had explored the Hidden Island and had gained quite a bit. A few days ago, they had unexpectedly discovered a nest on a sheer cliff, which contained an undeveloped chick.

Though not fully grown, it was extraordinarily beautiful, clearly a high-grade monster.

Huo Xianglan, delighted at the find, flew up to catch the chick, intending to raise it. Little did she know that this would bring about tremendous trouble. Less than half a day after capturing the chick, its parents, two enormous and terrifying giant eagles with at least sixth-tier strength, came looking for it.

Although Huo Xianglan was a master of the Divine Roaming Realm, she could barely handle one giant eagle. Faced with two, furious at her for taking their offspring, they attacked together. Huo Xianglan lasted less than half an hour before being torn apart.

At that time, Yu Xiuping and the others were so frightened that their souls nearly fled, hiding in the woods and daring not to show themselves, let alone come to her aid. After the giant eagles ripped Huo Xianglan apart, they circled in the sky for a long time before slowly departing.

Originally, Yu Xiuping and the others thought they had escaped a calamity, but they never expected that these beasts would hold such a grudge, ultimately finding their trail today.

With the cry of the eagle, cold sweat broke out on Yu Xiuping and the others. Moments later, another eagle cry echoed from afar, responding to the first. Looking out, they saw two black dots rapidly approaching from the east and west.

“Quick, break this stone door!” Yu Xiuping shouted in panic. “Otherwise, we’ll all die!”

They were utterly incapable of dealing with two sixth-tier monsters with their True Essence Realm strength. Once captured, it would be a dead end.

There was no need for Yu Xiuping to remind them; the remaining few were already using all their strength to attack the stone door. Although the cracks on the door increased, it still stood firm, blocking their escape.

As the giant eagles rapidly approached, one True Essence Realm master could no longer bear the pressure of impending death and hurriedly fled downwards.

“Come back! Junior Brother Zhang, come back!” Yu Xiuping shouted. “If we put in a bit more effort, we can break this stone door and hide inside! Where can you escape to now?”

But Junior Brother Zhang had no intention of staying. With a gust of wind at his feet, he ran desperately downwards.

The others, already seeing little hope, were further discouraged by Junior Brother Zhang’s retreat. One person hurriedly said, “Let’s run! This stone door won’t open anytime soon. If we escape now, we might have a chance!”

Saying this, he also hurriedly fled downwards.

With already insufficient manpower, losing two people made their situation even more hopeless.

The others stomped their feet in frustration and quickly scattered, each fleeing for their lives.

Yang Kai had hidden himself thoroughly, not daring to move.

He cautiously raised his eyes to observe, and soon saw the silhouettes of two giant eagles appearing in the sky. Even from several hundred zhang away, these giant eagles looked extraordinary and imposing. If they were to come closer, Yang Kai estimated they would be at least seven or eight zhang long.

With their sharp eagle eyes fixed on the fleeing Yunxia group below, one dove down towards them.

Before long, a piercing scream echoed in the distance, reaching Yang Kai’s ears and sending a chill down his spine. It also struck fear into the hearts of the Yunxia warriors.

They knew that another person had fallen victim to the giant eagle.

Almost simultaneously with the first scream, another cry of despair rang out.

The second person was killed by the giant eagle.

In front of these sixth-tier sky overlords, True Essence Realm masters were as fragile as newborns, with no power to resist at all.

Yang Kai did not dare to make any rash moves, lying in place for a whole day. Only after confirming that the two giant eagles and the Yunxia people had disappeared did he finally crawl out from his hiding place.

His face was filled with lingering fear!

Fortunately, he hadn’t relied on the Wings of Yang Flame to fly around recklessly. Otherwise, encountering those two giant eagles would likely have spelled disaster.

Furrowing his brows, he approached the stone door, gazing at the fragmented cracks. He circulated his Yuan Qi and struck out with a punch.

The stone door shook, the cracks becoming denser, and the hazy aura rising from it was not as brilliant as before, instead giving off a feeling of impending exhaustion.

Noticing this, Yang Kai’s spirits lifted. He unleashed punch after punch fiercely against the stone door.

However, after delivering several hundred punches, the stone door remained as it was, showing no signs of breaking. “Strange!” Yang Kai frowned tightly.

After thinking for a moment, he called out in his heart. After a long wait, a buzzing sound came, revealing the group of Heaven-Devouring Insects that had been following him.

These insects had been trailing not far behind, waiting for any danger, at which point Yang Kai would summon them for assistance. However, he hadn’t needed to do so along the way.

He summoned a few large insects, instructing them to spray mist at the stone door, hoping to see if the strange mist could corrode it.

The large insects were obedient, following the command to the stone door, and opened their mouths to spray out streams of white mist.

With a sizzling sound, the stone door was indeed corroded a bit.

Seeing this, Yang Kai nodded, urging the large insects to continue spraying while he sat down to recover.

After about less than an hour, Yang Kai suddenly heard a loud crashing sound. He opened his eyes to see that the stone door had shattered, revealing a dark opening.

Yang Kai did not rashly enter but let the group of insects fly in first to scout the situation.

After waiting outside for half a day, the group of insects returned safely.

Confirming that there was no danger inside, Yang Kai stepped in. Once inside, he ordered the insects to guard the entrance and had the large insects spray out a layer of mist to block the entrance.

With these insects and the mist in place, Yang Kai believed that even if the few Yunxia people escaped the pursuit of the giant eagles and returned here, they would not be able to enter.

As he walked deeper inside, he found that this cave was not a straight path but wound downwards. Not far in, Yang Kai felt a sense of comfort, as if the energy of heaven and earth in this cave was extremely rich.

The deeper he went, the stronger this feeling became.

After descending several hundred zhang, Yang Kai estimated he had reached the bottom of the solitary peak, finally seeing the end of the path.

Below was a vast and spacious area, with glimmers of light dotting the stone walls, giving it a somewhat magnificent appearance.

On either side of the path were rows of stone shelves, divided into many layers, each layer holding various items.

Yang Kai strolled over, coming to the front of a stone shelf, and used the faint light to glance at the topmost layer.

“Tai Yi Sect?” Yang Kai stared at the three large characters carved on the stone shelf, his expression momentarily stunned. He had heard of this sect; it was the only transcendent force overseas that could rival the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. With countless disciples and many experts, it was renowned.

What connection did this sect have to this place?

On the layer of the stone shelf marked with the Tai Yi Sect, Yang Kai saw a treasure seal. He reached out to pick it up; it was not light, indicating it was carved from a precious material. This treasure seal could even be considered a secret treasure in itself.

Upon inspection, Yang Kai was astonished to find the words “Tai Yi” at the bottom of the treasure seal.

This was indeed a precious item of the Tai Yi Sect! But how did it end up here?

With a hint of confusion, Yang Kai looked at the next layer of the stone shelf.

This layer also had characters carved on it, and surprisingly, it was another major sect he had heard of.

“Gu Yun Island!”

Although this sect was not as powerful as the Tai Yi Sect, it was still a first-rate force overseas. On this layer of the stone shelf was a cultivation technique.

Yang Kai flipped through it casually and felt that this cultivation technique was somewhat extraordinary, likely not low in rank, at least a Heaven-Grade technique. However, since he was already cultivating the True Yang Technique and also had the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique, he had no need for it, so he casually set it down.

Looking further down, Yang Kai’s expression grew increasingly strange.

Every layer of this stone shelf was engraved with the name of a major sect, and each layer held various items. Some were martial skills or techniques, some were secret treasures, and others were tokens, all sorts of peculiarities.

These sects were all first and second-rate forces overseas, with at least a dozen in total. A third-rate force like Yunxia Sect had no qualification to appear on these shelves.

If he was not mistaken, the items on these shelves truly belonged to those sects. But why were they all gathered here?

As he continued to look, Yang Kai suddenly recalled something.

That was a strange tale he had heard in a teahouse in Haicheng.

It was said that three hundred years ago, there was a person who sought out various large and small sects overseas, wanting to join them as a disciple. Unfortunately, his aptitude was quite poor, and he was rejected and driven out of each sect. Some disciples even mocked him and fought him. His perseverance was commendable, as he visited every sect overseas but still found no success.

In despair, this person became somewhat hopeless and hated those sects for refusing to take him in, vowing to find a path to cultivation.

This matter was originally just a small event; those renowned major sects rejected countless aspiring disciples every year, and he was just one among them.

However, thirty years later, a major incident occurred overseas. The seal of the Tai Yi Sect’s master was lost, stolen by some thief who infiltrated the sect.

Following that, news spread among the major sects overseas that various treasures had been lost. Some of these items were quite valuable, while others were not necessarily so, but each held special significance for those sects. In an instant, the major sects were thrown into chaos, fearing that the thief would target their treasures. Yet, no matter how they guarded against it, they could not escape the fate of being stolen! 

That elusive thief could always take their well-guarded items under the most unlikely circumstances!
