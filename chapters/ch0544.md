## Chapter 544 — Unexpected Troops

The sons and daughters of the Seven Great Families gathered together. Ye Xinrou sat at the head and spoke with clarity and precise reasoning, causing many to view her in a new light.

This woman wasn’t just good at acting coquettish, the crowd thought to themselves.

When she sat in that lofty position, she adjusted her mindset swiftly and made comments befitting her status.

Her words were both reasonable and heartfelt, naturally drawing everyone’s attention as they looked toward her.

“Surprise forces?” Gao Rangfeng couldn’t help but ask, “What exactly do you mean by that?”

Ye Xinrou smiled. “Whatever the Young Master wouldn’t anticipate — that is the surprise force.”

Gao Rangfeng frowned. Ye Xinrou’s teasing tone made him uncomfortable. He said in a low voice, “Be more specific.”

Ye Xinrou chuckled quietly and cast her gaze toward Qiu Yimeng. Her beautiful eyes sharpened for a fleeting moment. “Sister Qiu is the greatest unexpected troop for the Young Master.”

Qiu Yimeng suddenly lifted her head, glaring fiercely at Ye Xinrou.

Huo Xingchen let out a sly, wicked laugh from the side.

The others had strange expressions. They all suddenly understood Ye Xinrou’s intention.

“Sister Qiu has always been at the Young Master’s estate, working closely with him. She is regarded by the Young Master as a right hand and fully understands the affairs in his residence. No one knows it better than her. Moreover, she only left Yang Kai’s estate this morning. No matter what, the Young Master wouldn’t expect her to become his enemy and lead troops to attack him within a day, right?”

“Ye Xinrou, you’d better consider carefully what you’re saying,” Huo Xingchen stared at her maliciously, his eyes flashing with cold light.

Ye Xinrou sneered, “What do you mean, Young Master Huo? Of course, I know very well what I’m saying, but your attitude... Are you feeling disgruntled with me?”

Huo Xingchen sneered.

“Don’t forget, I now represent the Second Young Master! If you don’t accept me, then you don’t accept the Second Young Master. I have the authority to ask you to leave this estate. A single bad apple can ruin the whole pot; the Second Young Master’s estate cannot have any troublemakers.” Ye Xinrou stabbed barbs with her words, filled with biting sarcasm.

Huo Xingchen’s expression shifted. He wanted to storm off in anger, but remembering the old master’s threat before his departure, he could only suppress his restless urge.

His lips moved, uttering curses silently.

Ye Xinrou smiled again and said in a soft tone, “Actually, Little Sister has many considerations behind her proposal. What I said before was only one point.”

“What other considerations?” Gao Rangfeng asked, sensing that after a succession war, Ye Xinrou’s growth was incredible. She was no longer as naive or weak-willed, likely influenced by her time beside the Second Young Master.

“From the last time the Young Master killed Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu, it’s clear that he values his friends deeply. Sister Qiu is also a friend of his. Knowing his character, I don’t think he would bear to harm Sister Qiu.”

“That’s a good point,” Kang Zhan nodded lightly, finding Ye Xinrou’s analysis reasonable.

Last time, Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu were ruthlessly pursued and executed by Yang Kai after injuring a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Even hiding in Yang Zhao’s estate didn’t save them from death.

Qiu Yimeng had spent a long time working with Yang Kai, standing by him through hardships. She also made enormous contributions to Yang Kai’s estate. Considering Yang Kai’s personality, it would be strange if he harmed her.

“So, perhaps if Sister Qiu takes the lead and brings a few people over casually, they could defeat the Young Master without a single drop of blood spilled,” Ye Xinrou smiled faintly as she looked at Qiu Yimeng. “What do you think, Sister Qiu?”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression was cold as she looked at him from a distance and replied steadily, “You are overthinking. Although Yang Kai values friendship, he is also an extremely selfish man. When friendship conflicts with his interests, he will choose to protect himself.”

Ye Xinrou looked surprised. “Sister Qiu really understands the Young Master well. I think this matter will indeed require your involvement. How can we know if it can work without trying?”

She said this with a disdainful gaze, as if refusing to give up until Qiu Yimeng agreed.

“Very well,” Qiu Yimeng suddenly smiled. “Since you say so, I will listen this once and see whether I can capture Yang Kai with my methods.”

“Sister, you truly are a heroine among women—so straightforward.”

“Thank you for looking out for me, Little Sister. You shall hold the merit for this mission.” Qiu Yimeng smiled gently.

Ye Xinrou smiled softly as well. “Why talk about such things? Not long ago, I was also cared for by you. Haha, I will remember this for the rest of my life.”

Suddenly, the side hall turned grim and ominous.

Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, and others couldn’t help but shiver.

They didn’t know exactly what those two women were discussing, but it was clear that something had happened between them days ago.

Some days ago, Ye Xinrou had stealthily sneaked into Yang Kai’s estate to seduce him but was caught by Yang Kai, who tore off her clothes. Left alone in the side hall, she was then guarded by several sentries placed by Qiu Yimeng.

Naked, Ye Xinrou was imprisoned for three whole days.

Only after the third day did Qiu Yimeng order a maid to deliver a set of clothes.

Ye Xinrou would never forget such a humiliating disgrace. So when the Seven Great Families allied together, the very first thing she did was find fault with Qiu Yimeng. Though it could be called personal revenge, her excuses and tactics were clever enough that even Qiu Yimeng could not refute them, effectively letting Ye Xinrou lead Qiu Yimeng by the nose.

“Then let it be so. Sister will be the unexpected troop who takes the lead. I hope you win decisively.”

“Thank you for your kind words.”

“No time to lose; let’s set off now,” Ye Xinrou said.

“Now?” Everyone was surprised, not expecting her to be so eager.

“Speed is essential in battle. Acting under cover of night might yield twice the results with half the effort,” Ye Xinrou smiled faintly.

“Reasonable. Then I shall depart,” Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly and stood to walk outside.

“Qiu Yimeng...” Huo Xingchen stood and called out sternly, but she did not look back as she slowly shook her head while walking away.

After Qiu Yimeng left, Huo Xingchen turned and gazed coldly at Ye Xinrou. “You little wretch, if anything happens to Qiu Yimeng, just wait to be sold to the cheapest brothel. Then anyone can savor your beauty. Within three to five months, you’ll become rotting, worthless flesh rejected even by wild dogs!”

A cold gleam flashed in Ye Xinrou’s eyes, but surprisingly she did not get angry. Instead, she chuckled softly. “Young Master Huo, you worry unnecessarily. How could anything happen to Sister Qiu? Do you really think the Young Master would harm her? Apparently, the Young Master has already entered the Demonic State and forsaken all ties.”

After a pause, she added, “Since you are so worried, why not follow and see? It’s just in case.”

Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng both nodded silently, feeling Ye Xinrou’s decision was right.

No one believed Qiu Yimeng alone could defeat Yang Kai. No matter how sentimental Yang Kai was, he was not a fool who would surrender easily.

If they followed, and a fight broke out, they could come to assist.

As they spoke, everyone stood and headed outside together.

Under the bright moon and sparse stars, the entire War City was bathed in silver light.

Within Yang Kai’s estate, the cultivators calmed down after the shock of Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen’s departure.

The estate now had a great advantage. Even without Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen, everyone believed that Yang Kai would surely triumph in the succession war.

They only worried slightly about Yang Kai’s earlier mention that he might oppose the Eight Great Families.

After all, these were young men eager to avoid conflict with the Eight Great Families, because it concerned not only personal interests but also the weighty affairs of the sects and clans behind them.

Late into the night, the estate was silent.

Yang Kai, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes, which gleamed brightly.

He quickly stood and went outside.

As soon as he opened the door, the sound of fluttering clothes came from inside. Moments later, Ying Jiu, Earth Demon, and Tang Yuxian appeared before him.

“Young Master...” Tang Yuxian called out.

“I know,” Yang Kai said coldly. “Wake everyone up.”

Tang Yuxian hurriedly released her Divine Sense, covering the entire estate. Sensing the summons contained within, everyone inside quickly gathered.

A sigh came from the side. There, a faint figure slowly appeared. Shui Ling, with pale blue hair, suddenly materialized.

Ying Jiu narrowed his eyes. Even now, he deeply dreaded this elusive little girl.

Though so young, she had reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, and her constitution was special. In a one-on-one fight, Ying Jiu was certain she could not defeat him, even if he used his Blood Fury Technique, but he couldn’t detain her either.

“It seems Qiu Yimeng led these people here,” Shui Ling sighed softly. “It’s a pity; I got along quite well with her. Yang Kai, how could it come to this between you?”

“I don’t know. Don’t ask me,” Yang Kai said irritably.

Shui Ling had already recognized the arrivals’ identities—how could Yang Kai not?

Leading the group was none other than Qiu Yimeng, who had only left this morning.

With her were more than twenty experts above the Sixth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Except for Qiu Yimeng’s calm aura, the others radiated murderous intent, clearly aiming to harm the estate.

Yang Kai didn’t think Qiu Yimeng would act so rashly. After so much time together, he understood her character well. Still, the fact remained—she had brought people here.

“Let’s go see,” Yang Kai snorted coldly and led the way outside.

Ying Jiu, Tang Yuxian, and Earth Demon followed quickly.

Soon, they reached outside the estate. The cultivators inside rushed out swiftly and in orderly fashion, gathering around Yang Kai.
