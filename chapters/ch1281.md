## Chapter 1281 — Get Down From There

Good point — here’s the revised version with subjects kept completely clear:

Yang Kai gazed at the burly man who had flown up before him, the latter’s towering and muscular figure fully revealed. Yang Kai’s own expression remained calm, yet a hint of puzzlement flickered across his face.

This burly man was, of course, the cultivator surnamed Hou whom Yin Sudie had brought along. What puzzled Yang Kai was why the man had rushed over so hastily on his own, while Yin Sudie and the other cultivator were still behind, chatting and laughing as they approached at an unhurried pace.

Hou sized Yang Kai up and down. When he sensed that the aura fluctuations coming from Yang Kai were indeed only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, the corner of his mouth curled in disdain. Then, turning his gaze toward Yang Yan, he couldn’t help but show a trace of surprise.

He hadn't expected that the woman wrapped in black robes would also be unusually beautiful, and that after he blocked them, neither the man nor the woman before him showed much panic—on the contrary, each was calmer than the last.

What truly baffled Hou was that he couldn't discern Yang Yan's real cultivation. When his divine sense swept over her, her body seemed as if it did not exist; his probe passed right through with nothing to detect.

This made the burly man stiffen, and he instinctively took Yang Yan to be a fighter even stronger than Yang Kai.

Hou was mainly here for Yang Kai and naturally had little interest in Yang Yan. After a brief probe he withdrew his gaze and fixed his cold eyes on Yang Kai with hostile intent.

“Friend!” Yang Kai stepped forward and cupped his hands, saying, “You blocked me and my Senior Sister—what's the matter?”

“Matter? Heh heh…” The burly man chuckled low. “Your surname's Yang?”

“Correct.”

“You just came out from the Taiqing Mountain Range?”

“Yes!”

“Then it's got to be you. I'm Hou and I'm looking for you, kid!” The man's face turned cold. He barked, “Daring to set your sights on Glazed Mountain and even tampering with the Glazed Mountain's warding—I'll see where you think you can run this time!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai was genuinely startled; he instinctively feared his misdeeds had been exposed. But then he thought it over and felt something was off—if they'd truly been exposed, more than just three Saint King Realm fighters would be chasing him; Liuli Sect would have dispatched several high-rank elders to be sure.

Since it hadn't been exposed, why was this man speaking so confidently?

Yang Kai had no idea. Hou had only believed Yin Sudie's words and therefore took them at face value.

A quick thought later, Yang Kai gave a light laugh. “Friend, you're joking. I went to the Taiqing Mountain Range only at the invitation of your sect's Daiyuan to be a guest for a few days. How could I possibly be scheming against Glazed Mountain?”

“Daiyuan?” The Hou-family man froze, then asked in bewilderment, “You know Daiyuan? She actually invited you as a guest?”

His face looked utterly incredulous, as if he'd heard something impossible to believe.

“I wouldn't lie about something like that. You can return to Qianhuan Peak in the Taiqing Mountains and ask Miss Daiyuan. Then you'll know.”

“Ask Daiyuan…” A flicker of hesitation showed on the burly man's face, but he waved his hand and said unreasonably, “Kid, don't spout nonsense. Regardless of what you say, you won't get away this time—I've been entrusted to capture you first, and whether you've done anything or not is not my concern. I'm only responsible for apprehending you!”

Hearing that, Yang Kai couldn't help but grin. “So you're deliberately looking for trouble?”

“Hmph!” The burly man snorted. “So what if I am?”

As his words fell, a blinding light suddenly burst forth from Hou's hands. A fierce surge of energy erupted from within his body as his figure shot upward, leaping straight into the air. In the next instant, like an eagle diving through the skies, he swooped down—both hands sweeping forward, his right palm turning a metallic, cold hue as he pressed it directly toward the top of Yang Kai’s head.

In an instant, the air within a hundred zhang around Yang Kai seemed to freeze; as the palm pressed down it felt as though the whole sky were collapsing, the condensed aura making breathing difficult and the body heavy as a mountain. Yang Yan, standing behind Yang Kai, let out a muffled groan and trembled slightly.

But she only flashed with a radiant light and acted as if nothing had happened, immediately stepping back to appear a hundred zhang away and beyond the coverage of the burly man's move.

Hou let out a soft “oh” of surprise—he hadn't expected Yang Yan to be so formidable. Though he didn't know what had produced that radiance, he was certain it was a fairly powerful Secret Treasure.

Yet seeing her rely on the strength of a Secret Treasure, he didn’t take her seriously. After only a brief hesitation, the force in his palm grew heavier as he continued pressing down toward Yang Kai, roaring, “Get down!”

He intended to fell Yang Kai in one blow so that Yin Sudie and the others following could behold his might.

It was a rare chance to show off; how could Hou miss it?

When the palm was about ten zhang away from Yang Kai, a cold smile lifted the corner of Yang Kai's mouth. He stood his ground and watched the opponent's ferocity and arrogance with utter indifference.

From the first strike he could tell this fellow hoped to rely on his powerful physique and abundant Saint Yuan to settle the matter. If another Second Stage Saint King like him had taken the blow, they'd surely be flustered, but Yang Kai did not regard him at all.

That suffocating aura that could compress an ordinary warrior's flesh into pulp bore down on Yang Kai, yet it failed to affect him in the least. With a casual wave, the oppressive field nearby seemed to be tugged by an unseen force; it grew unstable and then shattered like an invisible mirror.

The omnipresent weighty sensation abruptly vanished.

At the same time, Yang Kai, who had been trapped in the palm, blurred and in an instant disappeared without a trace.

Hou's face went pale—he had never expected a Second Stage Saint King to break free from the aura control he'd unleashed and then vanish, as if they had been erased from the world without a hint of presence.

Panic rising, Hou realized he'd bitten off more than he could chew. While searching for Yang Kai's whereabouts, he suddenly felt a rotating force descend from above; an extremely dangerous aura pressed down from the sky.

“Not good!” he muttered, looking up sharply. He saw Yang Kai, who had disappeared, suddenly vault above him, looming down with the same high posture. Yang Kai's gaze was icy, like a dragon soaring the heavens and peering down at ants, chilling him to the bone. Yang Kai raised a palm that seemed to fall gently, yet the handprint expanded without limit until it obscured the entire sky, filling the man with a sense there was nowhere to evade.

Hou dared not delay; he hurriedly concentrated a hundred and twenty percent of his power, lifting both palms to bear the sky while a flash of light rippled over his body. Layers of metallic sheen resembling armor guarded him.

At the same time, from the center of his forehead a pitch-black light shot forth, spinning like a sharp cone and slicing the air with a hissing sound toward the sky-blocking palm impression.

After all, the man surnamed Hou was an Elite Disciple of Liuli Sect; even as the situation turned, he could still perform so many moves in an instant—quite impressive.

Yet his heart raced and he felt no safety at all.

Under his anxious gaze, the pitch-black cone struck the giant palm first. When the palm came down, the cone's spinning force vanished and its light dimmed, revealing its true form.

It turned out to be an offensive Secret Treasure shaped like a spinning top. The moment it came into contact with the Heaven-Covering Palm, it was slapped aside, its spiritual light greatly dimmed as though its sentience had been shattered.

Then the Heaven-Covering Palm struck Hou unabated. His layered metallic armor cracked inch by inch like a spiderweb and collapsed in less than one breath's time.

Gritting his teeth, Hou roared and poured all his Saint Yuan into his arms, suddenly thrusting out countless phantom fists to meet the descending palm imprint.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and unleashed his Saint Yuan again; the Heaven-Covering Palm's force increased threefold.

The endless phantom fists rushed into the palm as if into the sea—no splash, no trace; they were swallowed and vanished.

Hou's face drained of color. Though the clash lasted only three breaths, he realized he was no match for the man Yin Sudie sought.

Knowing this in his heart, Hou's face nonetheless showed stubborn defiance, growing ever more savage.

Before he could do anything further, the Heaven-Covering Palm had already struck him.

With a tremendous boom, his body crashed heavily downward, gouging a large pit in the ground, yet the Heaven-Covering Palm did not dissipate but relentlessly pursued.

The earth trembled and a colossal palm print spread out over a hundred zhang. At the very center, the man surnamed Hou knelt on one knee, hands propped out and his body convulsing.

His thick arms were streaked with blood and horribly injured; his garments were torn, exposing his hulking torso, but now his arms were twisted into unnatural angles—clearly maimed.

Even so, he fixed his gaze on the descending Yang Kai with eyes full of both terror and murderous resentment.

A trace of surprise flickered across Yang Kai's face; he hadn't expected this burly man to endure a Heaven-Covering Palm and not be felled. It seemed the man's physical constitution was no mere show; his body must indeed be exceptionally robust.

Meeting those vengeful eyes, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, lightly descended in front of the burly man, and then placed one foot on the man's shoulder with a grin that was exceedingly dangerous.

The burly man's face went white. Though he knew what Yang Kai intended, his internally injured organs made the slightest movement agonizing; he could neither resist nor move, so despite understanding, he was helpless to prevent what came next.
