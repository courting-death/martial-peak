## Chapter 241 — Courting Death?

Zi Mo and Leng Shan were left dumbfounded as they watched Yang Kai. Two fiery red Demonic Beasts continuously erupted from his side, only to be crushed moments later. Occasionally, a faint light would shoot out, leaving them utterly perplexed about what he was doing.

However, both of them were elites from their respective sects and had some discerning ability. They could naturally tell that Yang Kai was practicing a mysterious martial skill they had never heard of before.

Yet… to practice so recklessly, how much Primordial Qi would he have to squander?

“How many times do you think he can use such a martial skill with his Primordial Qi?” Zi Mo could not help but sidle up to Leng Shan, whispering her question.

“At most five times, and his Primordial Qi will be completely exhausted!” Leng Shan estimated.

This time, Zi Mo did not refute her and slightly nodded, clearly agreeing with Leng Shan's viewpoint.

Both women could sense the massive consumption of Primordial Qi from the fluctuations emanating from Yang Kai. This indicated that the martial skill was certainly of a high grade. The higher the grade of the martial skill, the greater its power, but the more Primordial Qi it consumed. Even if they were to use it, they could only manage ten times at most.

Yang Kai's Realm was not high, so naturally, he could not sustain it for long.

“What’s wrong? Do you have any thoughts?” Leng Shan turned to glance at Zi Mo, her tone suggestive.

Zi Mo was startled, patting her chest as she said, “Don’t say such things. Even if he truly exhausts his Primordial Qi, with just a thought, he could put us to death. We’d best be obedient; having our souls controlled is no joke. Look, it’s the fifth time now.”

As she spoke, Yang Kai unleashed the Beast Soul Technique once more, but this time, he still failed to fuse the techniques. The White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal each displayed their might, and the two beast souls manifested.

Yang Kai remained calm and composed, dispersing them. He focused on feeling the intricacies of this martial skill, recalling the moments of successful fusion and that unique sensation.

Zi Mo smiled sweetly, reaching into her bosom to pull out a vial.

“What are you doing?” Zi Mo looked at her in surprise.

“Going to please him,” Zi Mo shook the vial, “This is a pill from our Tianlang Kingdom that restores Primordial Qi. You should have some too, right? He needs to recover right now; this opportunity is not to be missed.”

“Despicable, shameless. Unashamedly seeking glory through humiliation!” Leng Shan scolded with a stern face.

“Hehe… don’t say that,” Zi Mo giggled, covering her mouth. “If it comes to it, when he needs to recover next time, I’ll let you have the chance. We can take turns.”

“Hmph!” Leng Shan snorted lightly. Her hostility had diminished significantly. While she certainly could not seduce Yang Kai, it was still acceptable to send some pills to gain his favor at the right moment.

Now that their lives were in his hands, self-preservation was the priority. Otherwise, if Zi Mo, that wretched girl, seized the opportunity, her future days would indeed be difficult.

“I’m going…” Zi Mo said as she stood up, but before she could take a step, they suddenly heard two more beast roars from Yang Kai's side.

“Is he going to use it again?” Zi Mo was utterly shocked, and Leng Shan was equally astonished.

“Surely he must be exhausted by now?” Zi Mo muttered, a captivating smile appearing on her face as she took a step forward.

But at that moment, Yang Kai shattered the two beast souls once more. In an astonishing turn, he unleashed the Beast Soul Technique again.

Success!

The White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal fused perfectly, transforming into a beam of faint light that shot out. If there were a Demonic Beast ahead, it would surely be struck by the Slave Beast Seal and subsequently controlled.

Seizing the moment, Yang Kai continuously waved his hands, casting the Beast Soul Technique in rapid succession.

In one breath, he executed it four times: two failures and two successes. Yang Kai vaguely felt that he had found that sensation again, yet he still lacked proficiency.

Zi Mo's step retreated quietly, and together with Leng Shan, they gaped with their mouths agape, staring foolishly at Yang Kai.

His endurance had completely surpassed their expectations and imaginations.

An entire day had passed. Yang Kai was still practicing the Beast Soul Technique.

Zi Mo and Leng Shan were utterly numb, their hearts filled with lamentation.

How much Primordial Qi did this man have stored within him? How could he support such reckless casting?

Could it be that this martial skill consumed very little Primordial Qi?

Without mentioning the shock of the two women, Yang Kai himself was also taken aback.

The Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian had actually decreased by more than twenty drops! Currently, there were no Yang attribute pills available to replenish the Yang Liquid, so he needed to conserve what was left in his Dantian. Otherwise, once it was exhausted, he would have no way to suppress the evil energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body.

However, casting the Beast Soul Technique indeed consumed too much Primordial Qi.

Not only the Beast Soul Technique, but also the Triple Flame Yang Explosion, Wings of Yang Flame, and Star Mark—all required a vast amount of Primordial Qi for support. Any martial artist at the Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm would not be able to use these techniques too frequently.

He could no longer use Yang Liquid to practice the Beast Soul Technique.

After frowning in contemplation for a long while, Yang Kai's eyes suddenly lit up.

He had three energy reservoirs within his body. The star map space was dedicated to the Star Mark martial skill, and the Yang Liquid in his Dantian could no longer be squandered, but the energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body could be utilized.

The energy stored within the Golden Body was immense, almost beyond estimation. Typically, he could only extract it when using Unyielding Will. Now, could he find a way to use the energy within the Golden Body to cast martial skills?

If he could achieve that, his endurance would rise to a new level, and he would no longer need to worry about the quantity of Yang Liquid.

As this thought surged forth, Yang Kai became excited. The techniques he practiced did not necessarily require Yang attribute Primordial Qi; they were compatible with all attributes of Primordial Qi.

Taking a deep breath, he forced the remaining True Yang Primordial Qi in his meridians into his Dantian, completely clearing all his meridians.

His mind immersed in the Golden Body, he connected with it, striving to extract energy from within.

Gradually, the Golden Body responded slightly, and a small amount of energy surged forth, flooding into his meridians.

A faint sense of brutality and bloodlust rose from his heart.

This was the characteristic of the energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body—an evil energy! It was entirely different from the pure and Yang True Yang Primordial Qi, a completely opposing existence.

As the energy from the Golden Body poured in, Yang Kai was gradually enveloped by a black aura, and a frenzy, cruelty, and violent evil aura spread out, causing unease in the hearts of those who sensed it.

Zi Mo and Leng Shan, watching from a distance, felt their hearts race.

“Courting death!” Zi Mo exclaimed in surprise.

“He really has gone mad!” Leng Shan also shot up, gazing at Yang Kai from afar.

The two women suddenly exchanged glances, seeing the excitement and joy in each other's eyes.

In their view, Yang Kai was clearly experiencing chaos within his Primordial Qi due to the excessive practice of that mysterious martial skill, leading to a restless mind, and now he could no longer control himself, resulting in the current situation.

They did not care about Yang Kai’s life or death, but his current predicament presented a glimmer of hope for the two women.

If he truly went mad, the lightest outcome would be the burning of his meridians, rendering him completely useless; the heaviest would be instant death, with his soul scattering.

Regardless of which outcome Yang Kai faced, it was what Zi Mo and Leng Shan wished to see.

It would be best if he died! The two women silently prayed in their hearts, their beautiful faces filled with delight and anticipation.

If Yang Kai truly died due to going mad, the mark imprinted in their minds would naturally dissipate, allowing them to regain their freedom.

The two women’s eyes were glued to Yang Kai, their breaths growing increasingly uneven, their expressions tense. As the black aura surrounding Yang Kai thickened, the violent and bloodthirsty aura intensified.

“After going mad, his mind will be unclear, and he’ll recognize no one. What if he accidentally detonates the mark in our Divine Sense?” Leng Shan suddenly thought of a very real problem.

Yang Kai was certainly devoid of consciousness now and would not be thinking. Although the possibility of that happening was low, it was still something to guard against.

If Yang Kai did that, they would die unjustly.

Zi Mo’s expression changed, her face paling. She licked her crimson lips and looked deeply at Leng Shan, “What do you want to do?”

“Stir the pot!” Leng Shan bit her lip, suggesting with a trembling voice.

Zi Mo frowned slightly, contemplating the gains and losses as well as the chances of success. After a long while, she finally nodded slightly, “Alright, but let’s wait a bit longer. I don’t know if he still has any consciousness left. If the situation worsens… we’ll act.”

The last sentence was spoken with determination, clearly indicating her resolve.

Leng Shan secretly nodded, biting her teeth tightly, her gaze fixed on Yang Kai.

She had more to consider than Zi Mo. After all, even if they killed Yang Kai and removed the mark from their minds, Zi Mo still had dozens of Demonic Beasts to enslave, while Leng Shan was all alone, so she naturally had to carefully plot her way out.

From the two women’s observations, Yang Kai’s signs of “going mad” indeed grew increasingly severe. The black aura around him thickened to the point where his figure was almost completely obscured, only a rough outline visible. Even from dozens of zhang away, they could still clearly feel the evil aura permeating from that black mist.

After waiting for a full incense stick’s worth of time, Zi Mo finally said, “It seems he has completely fallen into the Realm of going mad, and there’s truly no way to escape.”

“Shall we go?” Leng Shan glanced at Zi Mo.

Zi Mo gritted her teeth and nodded slightly.

The two women took a deep breath and slowly approached Yang Kai, gathering their True Essence quietly, remaining vigilant about Yang Kai’s movements.

Fifty zhang, forty zhang, thirty zhang…

As they drew closer, their heartbeats became uncontrollably intense. Their lives and freedom were at stake; how could they remain indifferent?

Twenty zhang, ten zhang…

As long as they closed in another five zhang, the two women could strike together and instantly take Yang Kai’s life. Killing him would break the mark in their minds.

It was as if they could see freedom waving at them. Whether it was Zi Mo or Leng Shan, a blush and anxious anticipation involuntarily appeared on their beautiful faces.

Five zhang…

Just as the two women steeled their hearts, preparing to strike without hesitation, a pair of crimson eyes suddenly opened within the black mist.

Those eyes seemed to be filled with mysterious power, piercing through the hearts of Zi Mo and Leng Shan.

Both women involuntarily halted their steps, trembling all over, their delicate bodies quaking.

From those eyes, they saw all kinds of evil, yet even so, there remained a hint of calmness and mockery within them.
