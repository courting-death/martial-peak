## Chapter 2495: Mortal and Heaven Devouring Reunited


Previously, in that Origin Sea, countless cultivators fought fiercely to seize the Origin Power. No one knew how many perished; all those who died fell into the Origin Sea and vanished without a trace.

Unexpectedly, they all ended up being swallowed and brought here.

The jade slip was also gone. When he was swallowed into this place, Yang Kai felt the jade slip in his hand suddenly shatter, transforming into a strange energy that lingered around him, seemingly protecting him.

Once he entered this place, that energy also completely dissipated.

It seemed the jade slip’s purpose was to guarantee entry here. Without it, Yang Kai had no idea what would have happened to him after being swallowed.

Before dying, Wu Mengchuan desperately tried to destroy the jade slip, clearly not wanting it to fall into someone else’s hands and allow them to enter this place. Just what secret is hidden here?

And what was that old man’s purpose in coming here?

Yang Kai’s expression was filled with suspicion as he looked around, but found nothing. Even when he released his Divine Sense, he couldn’t sense the old man’s presence.

After pondering for a moment, his gaze shifted to the blood pooling on the ground, and he sped off in the direction it was flowing.

No matter what this place was or what secrets it held, the direction of the blood’s flow was likely where the source lay.

This bizarre world seemed vast. Yang Kai walked for more than an hour, yet the scenery around him never changed in the slightest. If not for his extraordinary willpower, he might have thought he was just treading in place.

After an hour, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed as he looked up in a certain direction.

He heard some explosive sounds from over there. Looking over, he could faintly see flashes of light, and occasionally, powerful energy fluctuations would ripple from that direction.

Someone was fighting over there!

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed in surprise. He had only seen the old man enter this place, so if there really was a fight happening, one of them had to be that old fellow. But who was the other?

Judging by the fluctuations, the opponent’s strength was extraordinary. Yang Kai didn’t know the old man’s true abilities, but he was certain that ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators were no match for him.

Anyone who could fight him so fiercely was no ordinary person.

There are actually other experts in this damned place?

Yang Kai grew even more confused. Driven by curiosity, he sped up, using the Nothingness secret technique to conceal his presence as he approached.

The closer he got, the more obvious the aftershocks of battle became.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai hid behind a small hill, peering ahead. What he saw made his face change dramatically, his mind reeling in shock.

The old man was indeed there, standing in the void, his clothes fluttering and black hair flying. His back exuded a sense of indifference and ancientness, a true air of transcendence and detachment.

Not far in front of him, the skeleton he had seen through the black hole before was sitting cross-legged. But now, unlike before, some flesh had grown on the bones—bright red, absorbing the blood flowing from all around, constantly wriggling and multiplying.

It seemed all the blood in this world was converging on that skeleton.

At this moment, there wasn’t much flesh on the skeleton, as if it had only just begun to grow, not even covering all the bones. This only made the skeleton look even more terrifying.

The skeleton formed a mysterious hand seal, and a shocking devouring force emanated from its white bones, continuously swallowing the surrounding blood.

Each time this happened, the old man would unleash a ferocious attack, cutting off the flow of blood and preventing the skeleton from devouring it.

The powerful shockwaves struck the skeleton, but it didn’t budge an inch.

Who knew how long this stalemate had lasted? The old man tirelessly unleashed his power, evaporating and dispersing large swathes of converging blood.

But there was simply too much blood in this world. Even though the old man never stopped, more and more blood kept converging from all directions, trying to pour into the skeleton.

Yang Kai forced down his shock, his face turning a little pale.

Because he could actually sense a trace of life from that skeleton. Though faint, like a candle in a storm that could go out at any moment, it was undeniably the breath of life.

In other words, that skeleton was alive!

No one could say for sure which Great Emperor had left behind this skeleton, but based on all the clues Yang Kai had gathered, he guessed it was almost certainly the remains of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Legend had it that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was utterly destroyed, body and Divine Soul alike, in the battle of the Great Emperors tens of thousands of years ago—dead beyond any doubt. But now, it seemed that legend was wrong.

If this really was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s skeleton, then he hadn’t died, but had merely fallen into some kind of slumber. The blood gathering here might be the key to his awakening!

Suddenly, Yang Kai remembered something Wu Mengchuan had said during their life-and-death battle.

He’d said that someone like his ancestor could never die so easily!

It seemed Wu Mengchuan truly knew some of the secrets behind all this. As a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, it wasn’t so strange that he would know his ancestor still lingered in the world of the living.

He even knew his ancestor was hiding here, waiting for the right moment, and planned to use the jade slip to enter. Unfortunately, he was killed by Yang Kai before he could do so, and tried to destroy the jade slip with his dying breath…

Thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind. He was almost certain that skeleton was indeed the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. If the blood here really did gather and let him regrow his flesh, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor might be resurrected!

Back then, in order to kill him, four Great Emperors lost their lives here. If the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor were to be resurrected, the entire Star Realm would be plunged into grave peril.

At this thought, cold sweat broke out all over Yang Kai.

Just then, a strange aura suddenly rippled out from over there. At first it was faint, but as time passed, it grew stronger, like a slumbering dragon slowly awakening.

The old man standing in the void clearly sensed it too. His expression turned serious, and his hands moved faster, unleashing all sorts of incredible and powerful secret techniques that thundered toward the skeleton.

In an instant, the area where the skeleton was exploded, and even the void seemed about to collapse.

The old man squinted ahead for a long while before finally snorting coldly.

When the dust settled, a wall of blood-red light had appeared at some point, thick and covered in countless cracks, blocking the skeleton. The previous attack had been completely stopped by this wall, not harming the skeleton at all.

Suddenly, a sharp gaze shot out from behind the wall of blood-red light, as if crossing from ancient times, making the world turn icy cold.

“You’re awake!” the old man said with a snort.

The skeleton glared with not-yet-formed eyes, faint ghostly flames flickering in its sockets. It stared at the old man for a while, then its jaws opened and a chilling voice rang out: “Duan Hongchen?”

The old man threw his head back and laughed wildly, his voice unrestrained and free. “That’s right, it’s me, Wu Kuang! I’m surprised you still remember me after sleeping for so many years!”

The skeleton said coldly, “How could this Lord forget your wretched face? What rotten luck, the first thing I see after waking up is you!”

Duan Hongchen smiled faintly. “Disappointed? Who did you want to see? Tell me, I can disguise myself as him. You know, my disguise skills are unmatched in the world.”

The skeleton was indifferent, silent for a while before saying, “How long has this Lord been asleep?”

Duan Hongchen’s expression turned solemn. “It’s been tens of thousands of years. I don’t remember exactly how long.”

The skeleton sighed. “It really has been a long time.”

The man and the skeleton chatted like old friends reuniting after many years, with not a hint of tension in the air.

But Yang Kai, hiding on the distant hill, was in utter turmoil!

The old man called the skeleton Wu Kuang, which meant he really was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor! The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor hadn’t died, but had used some mysterious secret technique to slumber in this strange space for tens of thousands of years, waiting for the moment to revive.

If this news got out, the entire Star Realm would be in an uproar.

What shocked Yang Kai even more was the old man’s name.

Duan Hongchen!

Yang Kai had never heard this name, but he had heard another title.

The Mortal Great Emperor!

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, Wu Kuang, knew the old man, which meant they were people of the same era and status. The only one who could match the name Duan Hongchen was that Great Emperor.

Was he really the Mortal Great Emperor?

Yang Kai was so shocked he could barely breathe. Earlier, the old man had said that next time he saw Wen Zishan, he’d have Hall Master Wen expel Yang Kai from his sect. Yang Kai had even joked about it.

Who would have thought that joke would come true.

If the old man really was the Mortal Great Emperor, it made sense. The Mortal Great Emperor was said to be unrestrained and playful, and everything about the old man’s behavior matched that reputation.

That’s probably why Yao Si had obediently left, even showing deference—he must have known the old man’s true identity.

But what was going on with his cultivation?

The Mortal Great Emperor’s strength was supposed to be unrivaled. How could he only be at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm?

Not only was Yang Kai puzzled by this, Wu Kuang was also curious.

“Why has your cultivation fallen so drastically?”

“I severed my own cultivation,” Duan Hongchen replied with a faint smile, unconcerned.

“Severed your own cultivation!” Wu Kuang’s eyes flashed with sharp light. “You were actually willing to do that?”

“A wolf is never caught without paying a price.”

Wu Kuang seemed to understand. “Did you sever your cultivation just to find me and enter this place?”

Duan Hongchen nodded. “Of course. You might not know, but after you died, the barrier here became fragile. Emperor Realm cultivators couldn’t enter anymore, so this was the only way.”
