## Chapter 2587 — Acting on Orders

The battle near the Blood Gate was raging fiercely, drawing so much attention that the commotion quickly alerted the Yao Kings on the outer perimeter. Curious, they all rushed over to investigate, wanting to see what exactly was happening there.

In just a short moment, more than a dozen Yao Kings had gathered five li away. When they finally saw the faces of the enemies fighting the Eight Envoys, each one was utterly shocked.

“The Stone Spirit Race! How could they be here?”

“Impossible! We’ve set up defenses all around the perimeter. There’s no way they could just appear out of thin air!”

“Did they come from underground?”

“What are they trying to do? Are they planning to force their way into the Blood Gate?”

…

The Yao Kings clamored noisily for a while, then their expressions suddenly changed. Although they themselves had secretly thought about breaking into the Blood Gate more than once, they never had the guts to actually do it. Now, seeing the Stone Spirit Race appear out of nowhere and clash with the Eight Envoys, they felt both admiration and anger.

They admired their courage—so bold, unafraid of being blamed by the Four Saint Venerables afterward. But they were also angry, knowing that these troublemakers would surely get everyone else punished as well.

With this thought, the many Yao Kings exchanged glances and prepared to rush in to help.

Everyone in the Ancient Land knew how troublesome the Stone Spirit Race was. The Eight Envoys were powerful, but even they might not be able to handle the entire Stone Spirit Race.

Only by joining forces could they hope to suppress the Stone Spirit Race’s arrogance in one fell swoop.

“Envoys, don’t panic! We’re here to lend you a hand!” one Yao King shouted, surging forward wrapped in Yao Qi.

The burly Saint Envoy, who was locked in fierce combat with Shi Yi, narrowed his eyes and shouted in a deep voice, “No one come over!”

The charging Yao Kings immediately halted, their faces full of suspicion. In the Ancient Land, the strength of the Thirty-Two Yao Kings and the Eight Saint Envoys was about equal, but in terms of status, the Envoys were a cut above. After all, they were the confidants of the Four Saint Venerables, always at their side, acting as their spokesmen.

In most cases, their words were as good as the Saint Venerables’ orders.

So, with the burly Saint Envoy’s command, none of the Yao Kings dared disobey, though all were filled with doubt, not understanding his intentions.

“Continue guarding the perimeter. Prevent anyone from providing support. If anyone dares trespass again, kill without mercy!” The burly Saint Envoy kept a wary eye on Shi Yi’s earth-shattering attacks as he issued his low command.

“Yes!” the many Yao Kings responded, though their expressions were all quite strange.

They were all yao experts who had cultivated for countless years. Their minds were sharp and meticulous, and they could tell that something was off about the burly Saint Envoy’s order.

Normally, everyone should join forces to quickly resolve the Stone Spirit Race problem. After all, the Blood Gate was of utmost importance and could not be taken lightly. Yet now, the Saint Envoy insisted they keep guarding the perimeter, clearly not wanting them to interfere in the battle.

With just the Eight Saint Envoys, there was no way they could do anything to the Stone Spirit Race.

They exchanged glances, each feeling a bit uneasy. Was this the Envoys’ own idea, or an order from the Saint Venerables?

If it was the Saint Venerables’ order, it was possible. After all, the Saint Venerables had always wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Race, but those Stone Spirits were as stubborn as rocks in a latrine—filthy and unyielding. The Saint Venerables had tried many times without success. Maybe this time was an opportunity. Still, no matter how much the Envoys wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Race, they wouldn’t risk the Blood Gate, would they?

“Hm? There’s a human over there. What’s he doing?” A Yao King suddenly noticed something, pointing in the direction of Yang Kai and asking with wide eyes.

The other Yao Kings all looked over, and after watching for a moment, their faces changed dramatically.

“That human is breaking the Blood Gate’s seal!”

“What? Outrageous! What are the Eight Envoys thinking, just watching him break the seal and doing nothing? If the Saint Venerables find out, this will be a disaster!”

“This is bad! The Eight Envoys are all tied up by the Stone Spirits, so that human is acting without restraint.”

“What should we do?”

“Why panic? Maybe… the Eight Envoys are letting him do it on purpose,” a shrewd-looking Yao King suddenly said, his eyes flashing.

Another Yao King turned to look at him, saying coolly, “Hu Li, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want!”

The Yao King called Hu Li chuckled, “I was just speaking casually. Brothers, take it as you will.”

But some things can’t just be brushed off. The burly Saint Envoy’s earlier refusal to let them approach the battlefield had already made the Yao Kings suspicious. Now, with Hu Li’s reminder, their hearts trembled—they vaguely felt this might be the truth.

In an instant, every Yao King felt their scalp tingle and their bodies go cold.

The Eight Saint Envoys… are they rebelling against the Saint Venerables? If so, the entire Ancient Land would be thrown into chaos.

With this idea in mind, the Yao Kings looked again at the fierce battle. They quickly noticed something odd: at first glance, the fight seemed intense, with the Eight Envoys and the Stone Spirit Race going all out, showing no mercy.

But after all that fighting, no one was injured—not even a scratch.

This was clearly strange.

Hu Li’s eyes darted as he glanced in another direction, exclaiming, “Where are the Four Saint Venerables? Why are they nowhere to be seen?”

He didn’t spot the figures he expected over there.

Immediately, a Yao King replied, “I heard the Four Saint Venerables received a message earlier and left in a hurry. No one knows where they went.”

“Received a message!” A trace of surprise flashed in Hu Li’s eyes. “What message could be more important than the Blood Gate, making all Four Saint Venerables rush off?”

“I have no idea,” the Yao King replied, shaking his head.

“Interesting. Lure the tiger away from the mountain, take advantage of the gap, burn the boats… Does the Stone Spirit Race really have this kind of cunning?” Hu Li laughed softly.

Though he didn’t speak loudly, all the other Yao Kings heard him clearly. By now, none of them could deny that something fishy was going on at the Blood Gate.

Their feelings grew complicated—both anxious and worried.

They were anxious because, after all this time, that human still hadn’t made any progress breaking the seal. He was completely useless.

But they were worried that… if the Four Saint Venerables returned, the battle at the Blood Gate would end quickly. The Stone Spirit Race was formidable, but before the Four Saint Venerables, they were still lacking. Once the fight ended, the Blood Gate’s seal would never be broken.

“What should we do now?” the Yao King who spoke earlier sidled up to Hu Li and asked in a low voice.

The other Yao Kings all looked over as well, clearly waiting for his lead.

There was no helping it—among all the Yao Kings, Hu Li was the cleverest. No matter how complicated the situation or how devious the scheme, he could always see through it.

That’s why, even though his cultivation was only at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, he was still one of the Thirty-Two Yao Kings.

In the entire Wild Ancient Land, among the thirty Yao Kings, only Hu Li’s true form was not a Twelfth-Tier peak Demonic Beast. In a one-on-one fight, none of the other Yao Kings would take him seriously, but when it came to scheming, not even the other thirty-one Yao Kings combined could match him.

At such a delicate moment, all the Yao Kings naturally hoped he would come up with an idea.

Hu Li smiled and said breezily, “Why are you all looking at me? I’d like to know what to do, too.”

The Yao King snorted, “Let’s not beat around the bush, Hu Li. We’ve lived and died together in the Ancient Land for so many years. If you have something to say, just say it. No need to be so secretive.”

“That’s right, Hu Li. Now’s not the time for tricks.”

The group of Yao Kings stared at him, clearly refusing to let him off without an answer.

Hu Li spread his hands and said with a wry smile, “You really shouldn’t be asking me about this. It’s pointless!”

At these words, the many Yao Kings all looked displeased, secretly thinking this sly fellow was being far too uncooperative, which was truly infuriating.

Hu Li smiled again, “Didn’t the adults just say it? We’re to guard the perimeter and keep anyone else from approaching. We just follow orders!”

He spoke with a hidden meaning, and the group of Yao Kings all brightened at once.

One Yao King clenched his fist and smacked his palm, exclaiming, “Right! We just need to act on orders. If the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up.”

“Exactly, exactly!”

With things laid bare, the Yao Kings all relaxed, standing there watching the fierce battle in the distance, occasionally pointing and commenting on the fight, completely at ease.

Just as Hu Li said, they were simply following orders and guarding the perimeter. Even if the Saint Venerables blamed them later, they’d have an excuse. Only the Eight Saint Envoys would be punished, and it had nothing to do with them.

But if, before the Saint Venerables returned, that human managed to break the seal…

Then all the Yao Kings and Saint Envoys would rush into the Blood Gate at once—who would care about the Saint Venerables then?

“The Stone Spirit Race’s scheme is so grand—do they really have a chance of success?” Hu Li stood among the Yao Kings, gazing at Yang Kai with a furrowed brow. But as far as he knew, since the Blood Gate’s forbidden ground had appeared, no one had ever managed to break it. Normally, no one could even get close. If not for the recent anomaly, the area within ten li would still be a forbidden zone.

Atop a towering tree, a small head poked out from the dense canopy—it was Zhang Ruoxi, hiding there.

Staring wide-eyed ahead, Ruoxi saw the battle near the Blood Gate and also saw Yang Kai, who was channeling Emperor Yuan to activate his space abilities.

The situation looked extremely dangerous. From time to time, yao secret techniques flew past Yang Kai, barely missing him.

Sie was in trouble.

Anxious, Ruoxi’s delicate body trembled as she prepared to fly over and help.
