## Chapter 686 — Compensation

Watching Yang Kai speak calmly and matter-of-factly, Cang Yan's smile grew ever stranger and more sinister.

This youngster truly suits my temperament!

He killed one of Leiguang's senior elders right in front of their leader and yet showed not the slightest panic.

He has a lot of nerve—what's this kid's background? Cang Yan looked Yang Kai over from head to toe, deep in thought.

The Patriarch had sent him to find someone; he had spent two months on the task and had been full of frustration and anger, but at this moment he suddenly felt those two months had been well spent.

"Kid, if you don't give me an explanation today, don't think you'll be leaving here!" Xia Chengyin growled through clenched teeth.

"What explanation do you want?" Yang Kai smiled. "I've already explained just now."

"That's only your one-sided account—do you expect this Sect Leader to trust you so readily?"

Du Wan frowned slightly, his expression kindly as he asked, "Young friend, is the matter truly as you describe?"

Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

"And the reason? Why would they throw you into the Wind Eye and try to blow your spirit out—what would they gain from that?" Du Wan asked carefully, knowing that if he failed to give Leader Xia an account this time, Xia would not let the matter drop.

Yang Kai hesitated, somewhat unwilling to answer.

This concerned the Coffin-Bearer; if this information were revealed, it would pose great danger to him.

"Rest assured, young friend, if you speak the truth and it is not your fault, I can guarantee to bring you away from here unscathed, and Cang Yan will lend his strength as well," Du Wan said, glancing at Cang Yan as he spoke.

Cang Yan was more direct: "Even if it is your fault, no one will be able to harm you in my presence."

Yang Kai cast him a strange look; he really couldn't understand why this man was so eager to protect him.

After a long moment's thought, Yang Kai gave Xia Chengyin a cold glance. "You're the Leiguang leader, right? If it's confirmed that Duan Hai and Xu Qi intended to harm me, how will Leiguang compensate me?"

"Compensate you?" Xia Chengyin's eyes reddened with fury. "You killed one of my Leiguang elders and you still ask for compensation? Boy, are you mistaken? It is Leiguang that has suffered a loss now."

"He had it coming. If I hadn't been lucky this time, I would have died inside the Wind Eye; killing him was only natural."

Du Wan nodded. "If Duan Hai and Xu Qi did conspire, then their deaths are not regrettable. What do you think, Leader Xia? Young friend Yang was recommended by this old man into your Leiguang Divine Cult; I have a responsibility to protect his interests and safety."

Although Du Wan's tone was calm, anyone could hear that he was displeased.

As a Saint-Grade alchemist, it was rare for him to recommend an up-and-coming talent into Leiguang; to have this happen damages his face and prestige greatly.

Xia Chengyin's anger burned, but he dared not vent it before Elder Du. Hearing Elder Du's words, he nodded and said, "If that's truly the case... then there is no need for outsiders to move—this sect's leader will deal with internal affairs and give Elder Du an account!"

Du Wan nodded with satisfaction and turned his gaze to Yang Kai. "Now, young friend, you can explain the circumstances, yes?"

"I still insist on compensation!" Yang Kai said with a faint smile. "This matter cannot be so casually settled."

"I, as the leader, am giving Elder Du face—who do you think you are? Don't take yourself too seriously!" Xia Chengyin glared at Yang Kai in fury, wishing he could palm the brat into pulp.

"I back you!" Cang Yan nodded emphatically at Yang Kai. "If Leader Xia doesn't compensate you, I'll make Leiguang vanish from this world within a month."

"Uncle, you're so imposing," Mi Na said excitedly, looking at Cang Yan with worship.

Uncle...

Cang Yan's mouth twitched; his expression remained indifferent, trying to look outrageously cool.

Yang Kai grew even more puzzled as he looked at Cang Yan; he couldn't fathom what this powerful man was about, but now was not the time to probe. Yang Kai could feel that this man truly bore him no ill will, which put him somewhat at ease.

"Cang Yan!" Xia Chengyin clenched his fists, True Yuan rippling across his body as he stared coldly at Cang Yan.

"Want to fight? I'll oblige," Cang Yan sneered continuously.

Elder Du, helpless, stepped forward to mediate. "Both of you, calm down. Leader Xia, I also hope that if matters are as this young friend says, you can give him some compensation."

"Elder Du says that too?" Xia Chengyin's gaze turned venomous and his face twitched. After a long hesitation he barked, "Fine, this Sect Leader will agree to this impudent demand, but Elder Du, if it is found that matters are not as he says, don't blame Xia for refusing to show you face."

Du Wan nodded slightly. "Do as you will." Then he looked at Yang Kai: "You may speak."

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, helplessness in his expression, and said, "Those two wanted to collect my Divine Sense!"

Saying that, Yang Kai slightly released his Divine Sense power and explained, "Because I possess the Divine Sense Fire!"

Everyone gaped, hardly daring to believe it.

But feeling the burning aura contained within Yang Kai's Divine Sense power, they had no choice but to accept it.

Elder Du's eyes brightened; his expression grew exhilarated as he stared at Yang Kai as if looking at a world-shocking treasure.

Cang Yan's expression was excited as well; a man of his caliber seldom showed feeling, but upon detecting Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire he nearly lost his composure.

He laughed inwardly—no wonder the Patriarch sent him to find this kid; it turned out the boy was an alchemist with Divine Sense Fire!

Isn't that the same starting point as the famed Tianzang Elder on the continent? Perhaps one day he could reach Tianzang Elder's heights and be revered by the three races of humans, Yao, and Demons!

Divine Sense Fire is an exceedingly rare existence. Even if one or two martial artists possess it, they will not necessarily be skilled in alchemy. It is the combination of both talents that is the true essence.

Xia Chengyin was dumbfounded, staring at Yang Kai with a face full of remorse and regret.

"I told Duan Hai that I couldn't stay in Leiguang forever, and he and Xu Qi developed dark intentions—they wanted to use the Wind Eye's power to blow out my Divine Sense Fire. That's the truth," Yang Kai explained calmly.

Although that wasn't the deepest reason, it was part of why Duan Hai and Xu Qi attacked Yang Kai, so Yang Kai was not lying.

He had been forced into a corner; he could not reveal information about the Coffin-Bearer, so he could only expose his own Divine Sense Fire.

"I see," Elder Du said, nodding slightly. Having sensed the Divine Sense Fire, he believed Yang Kai's words even more. He drew in a deep breath and looked at Xia Chengyin. "Leader Xia, do you have anything else to ask, or do you still not believe this young friend's words?"

"I have nothing more to ask," Xia Chengyin slowly shook his head, all his momentum gone, his gaze complex as he looked at Yang Kai. Further entanglement would only offend Elder Du and Cang Yan—consequences Xia Chengyin could not bear.

Moreover, Yang Kai very likely could become a man with far-reaching influence in the future; to offend him now would likely mean Leiguang would not have peace later.

"That's for the best," Elder Du nodded with satisfaction, then warned solemnly, "Let only those present know of this matter today. If anyone dares to leak it, don't blame this old man for being unkind to them."

"Understood," Cang Yan and Xia Chengyin both nodded heavily.

The Divine Sense Fire is a treasure that invites covetousness; once exposed, it would likely bring countless troubles.

Whoosh...

With a gust of force, Xu Qi's life force was extinguished. Xia Chengyin's eyes flickered as he looked at Yang Kai, who had acted so decisively; though angry, he was helpless.

"Alright, now we can talk about my compensation," Yang Kai said with a grin.

Xia Chengyin's face twitched; despite his displeasure he could only ask, "What compensation do you want? Anything my Divine Cult has, I can agree to, but don't make impossible demands."

"Of course not," Yang Kai chuckled. "I want to go train at the Thunder Eye. I ask Leader Xia to open the gate for me."

At those words, everyone once again stared at him in astonishment.

"Go to the Thunder Eye?" Xia Chengyin could hardly believe it. "You cultivate thunder-based techniques?"

"That's my affair; it's not for Leader Xia to meddle in," Yang Kai shook his head.

"Does the disappearance of the Wind Eye have anything to do with you?" Xia Chengyin asked warily, watching Yang Kai closely.

"Maybe yes, maybe no. I'm not really sure either."

"Then if you go to the Thunder Eye, will the Thunder Eye disappear as well?"

"It shouldn't. Please rest assured on that point, Leader Xia."

Inside the Wind Eye, Yang Kai had driven its power to erupt from within, causing its annihilation; at the time it had been purely an act of revenge. Had he not done so, the Wind Eye would not have vanished—though even if it had remained, its power would have been far weaker than before.

"Leader Xia, you wouldn't want to back out, would you? Because I won't agree to that," Cang Yan said aggressively, glaring at Xia Chengyin.

"The Wind Eye and Thunder Eye are the very foundation of our Divine Cult. Now one has already disappeared and it may be largely related to him; how could I permit him to enter the other? Do you take the leader of this cult for a fool?"

"Whether you like it or not, you must agree!" Cang Yan sneered. With that he seized Yang Kai and darted off.

"Cang Yan, don't bully people so much!" Xia Chengyin roared, immediately giving chase.

Du Wan sighed deeply, helpless; after hesitating a moment, he and Mi Na followed after them.

Cang Yan's speed was incredible. Held in his grasp, Yang Kai could barely open his eyes as the surroundings flashed by; within no more than the time it takes half an incense stick to burn, they had arrived at the location of Leiguang Divine Cult's Thunder Eye.

Many of Leiguang's disciples had gathered there, sitting in meditation to cultivate and experience the mysteries of lightning.

The stronger disciples sat closer to the Thunder Eye; the weaker ones were farther away.

In the void above, a massive vortex of lightning continuously struck downward with crackling sounds, the heavens and earth filled with frenzied lightning energy.

When Cang Yan arrived with Yang Kai, the Leiguang disciples who were meditating all revealed expressions of shock and suspicion and looked up.

"Kid, are you sure you want to go in? That's no joke—there's a real chance your spirit could be completely destroyed," Cang Yan said, staring at the raging Thunder Eye with a look of apprehension.
