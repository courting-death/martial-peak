## Chapter 492 — Hurry Back to Zhongdu

Time passed silently, the sun hid and the moon rose, and Yang Kai was immersed in cultivation, unable to extricate himself for a long time.

Until there was a knock at the door.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, sensing briefly, then waved his hand to summon a gentle breeze. The door opened, and Qiu Yimeng appeared before him.

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked, looking at her.

Young Lady Qiu stepped inside quietly and said softly, "The Yang Family sent someone with the Elder's order commanding... Ninth Young Master Yang Kai to return to Zhongdu immediately!" After speaking, she fixed her gaze on Yang Kai, a complex expression flickering through her beautiful eyes.

She did not know why the Elder Hall summoned Yang Kai back.

Yang Kai's expression showed mild surprise. Tilting his head, he asked, “Why am I the only one summoned back to Zhongdu? What about Eldest Brother, Second Brother, and Seventh Brother?”

“It seems it’s only you,” Qiu Yimeng said, pursing her lips.

“I understand,” Yang Kai slowly rose, his brows knitting.

This family order was interesting. Why call only him back to Zhongdu? The last time the Yang Family sent someone was just a few days ago; it was to convey the message of the treasure war at Po Jing Lake to all the legitimate sons. But now?

“Yang Kai, I don’t know why, but I feel uneasy!” Qiu Yimeng’s voice lowered, her slender jade-like hands nervously twisting and wringing, revealing her inner anxiety and restlessness.

The Yang Family summoned only Yang Kai back to Zhongdu for no obvious reason; there must be some serious matter. But what it was, she did not yet know.

Moreover, the coming and going was also very convenient for others to make a move.

“Since it’s an order from the family, there’s no need to worry about safety on the road,” Yang Kai shook his head calmly. If he were ambushed and defeated on the way to or from Zhongdu, it would be difficult to explain within the family.

“In any case, be careful,” Qiu Yimeng warned, “I’ve already asked Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian to prepare. The two of them will accompany you.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

The family order demanded a swift return to Zhongdu, so Yang Kai could not delay. He immediately set out.

Outside the front gate, Ying Jiu, who had mostly recovered from his injuries, and Tang Yuxian were waiting silently. Ying Jiu, as always, was taciturn, unwilling to utter a needless word. Meanwhile, the mature and alluring Tang Yuxian carried a cheerful smile on her face. She called out in a charming voice, “Young Master.”

Returning once more to serve under Yang Kai, both Tang Yuxian and Tu Feng felt genuine joy. Over the past half year, although they had diligently served under Yang Kang, their hearts always longed for the day they could join hands with Yang Kai again and create wonders.

“Your injuries are nearly healed, right?” Yang Kai kindly inquired.

“Thank you, Young Master, I’ve fully recovered,” Tang Yuxian said, her pearly teeth lightly biting her lip, gratitude shining in her beautiful eyes.

After unleashing the Blood Fury Technique in a fierce battle with Ying Jiu, recovery time should have been longer. But under the miraculous effect of the pills given by Yang Kai, she and Ying Jiu both healed in just one or two days.

Though she had already experienced such miracles once before, Tang Yuxian still found it hard to believe.

“Someday when you have time, I’ll have to ask you about the use of soul techniques,” Yang Kai chuckled as he mounted his Treading Cloud Steed.

“I’m always at your service,” Tang Yuxian replied gravely.

Among the many Blood Servants, in terms of soul techniques and Divine Sense cultivation, Tang Yuxian was preeminent. Each Blood Servant had their area of expertise — Qu Gaoyi excelled in rapid bursts, Ying Jiu specialized in stealthy assassination, Tu Feng was a master of direct confrontation, and Tang Yuxian’s achievements in soul cultivation were unmatched within the Blood Servants Hall.

“Hurry there and back, be careful on the way,” Qiu Yimeng whispered as she watched the three mount their steeds.

Yang Kai nodded slightly; three Treading Cloud Steeds sped like lightning, charging toward Zhongdu.

Outside the mansion, the breeze stirred Qiu Yimeng’s dark hair. The sunset cast her long shadow, and her growing unease weighed heavily on her heart.

“Order: All cultivation is to be paused. The people will be split into two groups, taking turns on duty. Should any external enemy attack, kill without mercy! Until Yang Kai returns!”

“Yes!”

Night fell. The vast Zhongdu lay sprawled on the broad expanse of land like a slumbering giant dragon. The starry sky was sprinkled with countless points of light like sand in the Milky Way, adorning the firmament.

The three cloud steeds thundered through the exclusive Yang Family passage at the South Gate.

The guards at the gate hadn’t even had time to ask a question before the trio passed through. Only after they disappeared did the guards come to their senses and gave chase.

“Ninth Young Master, please return to your place!” Tang Yuxian called back sharply, and those few guards immediately stopped, faces stricken with fear.

The Ninth Young Master—Yang Kai.

His reputation was renowned like thunder; none dared offend him. Reluctantly, they retreated to their posts and resumed their night watch.

At Fourth Master Yang’s mansion, Yang Yingfeng and Dong Suzhu, who were cultivating, were startled awake by the sound from the Treading Cloud Steeds. They hurried outside and saw Yang Kai walking in leisurely, following him were Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian.

“Son?” Yang Yingfeng was momentarily stunned, while Dong Suzhu’s eyes welled with tears. She rushed forward and hugged Yang Kai tightly, kissing his forehead as she checked for injuries.

Ever since the succession war began, mother and son hadn’t met. The family forbade Dong Suzhu to visit Yang Kai at the War City.

“Mother…” Yang Kai wished he could crawl into a hole and hide. With Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian behind him, if they saw him like this, how could he still maintain authority before them?

He glanced back and found that neither Yuxian nor Ying Jiu dared meet his eyes; both lowered their gazes, staring at their toes.

After a while, Dong Suzhu finished venting her longing, holding Yang Kai’s hand with tear-filled eyes and a face full of grievance.

“Son, why have you come back?” Fourth Master Yang asked with suspicion.

“The Elder Hall ordered it,” Yang Kai replied with a frown. It seemed Fourth Master Yang knew nothing about this.

“The Elder Hall…” Indeed, Fourth Master Yang seemed completely unaware. Although he was of the Yang Family’s mainline, his standing within the family was not high. Matters of the Elder Hall generally did not concern him.

“Come in and speak first,” Yang Yingfeng took a deep breath of Primordial Qi.

“I’ll prepare something delicious for you,” Dong Suzhu said, waving to Tang Yuxian. “Yuxian, come help.”

“Alright.”

The room was brightly lit.

The three family members gathered around a table while Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian stood solemnly behind Yang Kai, refusing to take a seat no matter how Dong Suzhu enthusiastically invited them.

“Why did the Elder Hall summon you back to Zhongdu? Did they say what it was about?” Fourth Master Yang asked, suddenly deeply concerned when he learned his son was summoned by the Elder Hall.

“No reason was given,” Yang Kai said confusedly. The Elder Hall’s order was urgent, so he had rushed back without hesitation.

Since it was already night, he would have to wait until morning to check with the Elder Hall.

“Do you have an inkling? Did you do something to draw the Elder Hall’s attention?” Fourth Master Yang inquired.

“Dad, you mean ‘that evil demon,’ right?” Yang Kai smiled wryly. “It’s not because of him the Elder Hall summoned me back. I’ve already reached an understanding with Grand Elder Yang Liting about that. The Grand Elder also allowed him to participate in the succession war, but once it’s over, he must immediately leave the battlefield.”

“Has Grand Elder also summoned you?” Fourth Master Yang was visibly moved.

Yang Liting was an ancestor-level figure within the Yang Family, someone even Fourth Master Yang had never personally met. He never expected his son was fortunate enough to be called by such a person.

To Fourth Master Yang, this was a great honor. Yet, when Yang Kai spoke of Yang Liting, his expression grew uneasy. It was unclear what had transpired between them.

“Son, we are all of the Yang Family; it’s best to avoid connections with evil demons to prevent scandal,” Fourth Master Yang admonished earnestly.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, understanding perfectly.

Over the years, the Yang Family had led the charge against the evil martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land. Now that Yang Kai had associated with an evil demon, rumors were inevitable, especially since a powerful demon was also involved in the succession war.

If Yang Kai were to win the position of family heir with that demon’s help, many unpleasant conjectures would arise.

“It’s not about that demon...” Fourth Master Yang lightly tapped the table, “It might be about Ying Jiu lifting the Sealing Yuan Curse.”

He glanced at Ying Jiu, his expression puzzled.

Six Blood Servants were cursed with the Sealing Yuan Curse. Five were trapped, unable to use True Essence, but Ying Jiu was unharmed.

It was a move by Huang Jiuzhou, another Grand Elder in the Yang Family. If this was why Yang Kai was summoned back, the family might want to investigate thoroughly.

“Speculating isn’t helpful; we’ll know tomorrow,” Yang Kai shook his head, unwilling to dwell on it.

“Then rest well tonight. Being summoned by the Elder Hall... it’s never a good thing,” Yang Yingfeng sighed. He had been summoned a few times and was either scolded or punished by family law; the matter left a psychological shadow on him.

Putting aside serious matters, the atmosphere eased. The family chatted and laughed, a warm and peaceful scene that even affected Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian.

It seemed to temporarily free them from the tense, bloody succession war and allowed them a brief moment of peace.

The night passed without incident.

The next day, Yang Kai bid farewell to his parents. With Dong Suzhu’s repeated pleas and reluctant gaze, he hurried off with Tang Yuxian and Ying Jiu to the Elder Hall.

“Ninth Brother!” Nearing the Elder Hall, someone called out.

Yang Kai turned to see Yang Tie standing with hands behind his back, seemingly waiting.

News of Yang Kai’s return via the South Gate had likely spread, so Yang Tie knowing was not surprising.

“Third Brother,” Yang Kai greeted him as he approached. “Do you need something?”

Yang Tie pressed his lips, pondering for a moment before saying, “I just wanted to thank you for avenging the Duanmu Family members.”
