## Chapter 1535 — Keeping Proper Measure

"Shopkeeper, come over." Yang Kai waved at him.

He had been watching with cold eyes and didn't know exactly what had happened, so he wanted to inquire a little—after all, however you count it, this place had some tenuous connection to the Lingxiao Sect.

"Does the guest have any instructions? Want some more food or drink?" The shopkeeper forced a smile as he came up to Yang Kai and asked.

"Food and drink can wait." Yang Kai smiled faintly and cast a suspicious glance toward the stairwell. "Who were those two just now? How come they can sit in this tavern and eat and drink without paying, and even demand you hand over Saint Crystals?"

"This…" The shopkeeper looked stunned, glanced around and saw the other guests drinking and making merry without paying them any mind, then lowered his voice and said, "You must be new to Bibo City, right?"

"That's right." Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

"Then you should leave sooner rather than later. Bibo City is not a place to stay long." The shopkeeper's face grew evasive as he waved his hands.

"Not a place to stay long?" Yang Kai frowned. "Is something going to happen here?"

He looked out over the city—people came and went, it looked flourishing and prosperous, and the situation within the walls seemed calm; there were no obvious signs that anything major was about to happen.

"Heh heh…" The shopkeeper gave a bitter laugh. "Take the old man's advice: if you leave, leave quickly. If you stay here too long, when you want to go you won't be able to."

"What do you mean? Please explain it plainly, shopkeeper." Yang Kai's gaze was sharp. "I heard this place is affiliated with Battle Sky City and ultimately belongs to the Lingxiao Sect. How could anyone dare do anything against this city?"

"I can't say, I can't say. This old man may not have many years left, but I don't want to die this early either—do as you please." The shopkeeper shook his head repeatedly, his face sour, and began to turn away.

"I am of the Lingxiao Sect!" Yang Kai said in a low voice.

"What?" The shopkeeper's face changed color; he stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.

"Don't be so nervous." Yang Kai chuckled. "I'm a disciple of the Lingxiao Sect, sent by the Sect Master to look into things. If you have something to say, speak plainly. I want to know if there's someone so brazen as not to hold the Lingxiao Sect in respect."

"You're of the Lingxiao Sect? You really are of the Lingxiao Sect?" The shopkeeper was excited and yet doubtful; he leaned in and asked in a low, urgent voice.

"Yes! Rest assured, old sir. What you say stays between your mouth and my ears—I won't blab it everywhere." Yang Kai soothed him gently.

The shopkeeper's expression flickered as if he were hesitating about something. After a long moment he bit his lip and sat down opposite Yang Kai.

Yang Kai poured him a cup of wine. The shopkeeper drank it in one gulp; the strong liquor gave him courage, and only then did he begin: "Guest, you don't know. I told you to leave not because someone intends to harm the Lingxiao Sect, nor because Bibo City is about to have some catastrophe—it's simply that this is not a place fit for people to stay."

"Oh? Then please tell me exactly what's going on, I'd be grateful." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"Ah, it's hard to explain in a single breath!" The shopkeeper sighed deeply. "You saw how those two behaved just now."

"Yes. Who are they?"

"From the City Lord's Mansion."

"The City Lord's Mansion?" Yang Kai's surprise was plain.

"Heh heh, you find it strange too, don't you? The City Lord's Mansion should be protecting people like us—so why come to ransack and extort Saint Crystals?" The shopkeeper's tone turned grave. "Because they were here to collect taxes."

Yang Kai frowned.

"Any shop operating in Bibo City must hand over at least seventy percent of its earnings to the City Lord's Mansion; the remaining thirty percent barely covers expenses. Yet those people still find excuses to come and squeeze us dry. A small shop like mine is no match; we can't resist. Not long ago someone in the shop even died." The shopkeeper's complaints, emboldened by the wine, grew more forceful and indignant.

"Is this the City Lord's Mansion's policy?" Yang Kai asked coldly.

"Yes! Otherwise they wouldn't dare act so boldly. Those two were here to collect taxes."

"If taxes here are this heavy, why don't you leave Bibo City and seek a living elsewhere?"

The shopkeeper gave a bitter smile. "Who can leave? No one can leave. If the City Lord's men discover someone trying to flee, they'll be killed without mercy—the heads hung on the city wall are a bloody lesson. Not only are small merchants tied here, all the little families and warriors who live in the city are in the same bind; the gains they win on adventures must also be handed over in large portions. Anyone who resists is targeted—several small families have already been wiped out."

While speaking the shopkeeper glanced cautiously at Yang Kai and asked softly, "Young man, may I be bold to ask—this wasn't an order issued by the Lingxiao Sect, was it?"

"How would the Lingxiao Sect order such a thing?" Yang Kai's face darkened and he snorted coldly. "My Lingxiao Sect would never do this. What about Battle Sky City—are they not in charge?"

"I don't know exactly, but if Battle Sky City ran things they shouldn't be like this. All I know is that ever since Battle Sky City changed hands, taxes there dropped and it drew many people; now it's overcrowded. Many are drawn by the Lingxiao Sect's name and want to join but can't get in, so they go to places connected to the Lingxiao Sect—Bibo City is one of them. Outsiders can't see the hidden darkness beneath Bibo City, but this old man knows it all too well; that's why I urged you to leave. If you linger and get put on their register, when you try to go you'll find you can't."

"Interesting!" Yang Kai let out a cold, mirthless laugh.

"Young man, since you say you were sent by the Sect Master to secretly investigate, hurry back with the news. This old man hopes your Lingxiao Sect will send people to remove the tumor in Bibo City so I can spend my remaining years in peace!" The shopkeeper looked at Yang Kai with hopeful eyes.

"Rest assured, this matter the Lingxiao Sect will not ignore." Yang Kai grinned. "In any case, many came to this place because of the Lingxiao Sect's name—we can't let them be bullied. It would only tarnish our sect's reputation."

"Don't act rashly, young man." The shopkeeper saw the murderous glint in Yang Kai's eyes and was frightened.

"Don't worry, I know my limits." Yang Kai's gaze turned frigid.

If not for this fortunate chance, he wouldn't have known that someone was using the Lingxiao Sect's name to carry out such deeds.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled the girl Fei'er had seemed hesitant to speak about Bibo City when they were returning from the Bibo Plain; now he understood why.

The Lingxiao Sect's rise had been too sudden—its number of disciples was small and its foundation unstable; now was the time to win hearts. Bibo City's situation was smearing the Lingxiao Sect's name, and Yang Kai could not stand by and let that happen.

Just then a commotion arose from the street below: a swell of energy fluctuations followed by cries and screams.

Yang Kai looked toward the source of the noise and a green-clad girl immediately came into view; he made a slight sound of surprise.

“Old sir, keep the money for the wine.” Yang Kai casually tossed down a few pieces of Upper-Level Saint Crystal, grabbed a wine jar, and leapt straight out the window.

In the middle of the street, in front of a general goods shop, three or four young men stood there in a rage, their eyes bloodshot as they glared at the two people opposite them; their Saint Yuan circulated and they remained secretly on guard but dared not act rashly.

Behind those young men a green-clad girl supported an old man who seemed badly injured; his face was pale and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.

Countless people watched from the side.

"Second Uncle, are you all right?" the green-clad girl asked anxiously, worry plain on her pretty face.

"I'm fine." The old man shook his head slowly and rasped out the two words.

"How can you beat people?" The green-clad girl turned and scolded the two who had struck them.

"Beat people?" One burly man sneered and let out a coarse laugh. "So what if we beat someone? This old fellow didn't know his place. I didn't take his life—I showed mercy. You brat should be grateful; yet you dare to scold me. Believe it or not, I'll kill him right now!"

The green girl's face went white; she was young and weak in strength, and under such intimidation she dared not say more for fear they would truly fly into a murderous rage.

"Hmph, the City Lord has decreed that all transaction-earned Saint Crystals must hand over a portion to the City Lord's Mansion. What, old man, are you deaf or blind? You dared to trade with someone in secret; if I hadn't caught you in the act, who knows how bold you'd be!"

"Daring to defy the City Lord's decree—old man, you must be tired of living." Another man sneered.

The old man's face went ashen but he did not dare to utter a single word of rebuttal; though many onlookers gathered, none dared to make a move—only pity showed on their faces as they looked at the old man and the girl.

The heavy taxation in Bibo City had left everyone barely able to keep body and soul together and unable to leave, so when people returned from adventures with gains they often sought out trusted shops to make secret trades, hoping to avoid the crushing taxes.

This sort of thing had become commonplace within Bibo City.

The old man's party had simply been unlucky this time; they were inadvertently discovered by the City Lord's agents and paid dearly for it.

Drawing a deep breath, the old man pressed his palms together and said solemnly, "Sirs, we did not mean to defy the City Lord's decree. We were going to hand over the Saint Crystals after this transaction—we simply hadn't had the chance yet."

"The old coot talks a good game, heh heh, but who knows what he's really thinking?" The burly man clearly didn't believe him.
