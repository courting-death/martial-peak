## Chapter 822 — You Stubborn Old Mule

In the forest, on the way back along the original path, Ruan Xinyu fumed, “You fool. Since you saw him again, why did you leave of your own accord?”

“Isn’t it enough that he’s safe? What more do I need?” Yun Xuan smiled.

“Is that really good?” Ruan Xinyu felt a little sour at heart.

“Very good.” Yun Xuan’s face was easy and calm. “He’s no longer someone I can climb up to. Even if I forced myself to stay by his side, what would it change? I’d only drag him down. Better to part now, so we each can keep a good memory in our hearts—that’s enough.”

“You won’t regret it later?” Ruan Xinyu pressed.

“There’s nothing to regret.”

“Fine, do as you like. It’s your life anyway. Just don’t come crying to me later about missing your chance today.”

“I won’t.” Yun Xuan’s expression turned distant. She glanced back; a sheen of moisture rose in her beautiful eyes. In her heart she understood better than anyone—she was likely just a passerby to that man. If it weren’t so, he would certainly have chased after her.

...

After returning to Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai immediately summoned Xu Hui and the others. At the call, the elders and protectors all arrived.

“Saint Lord, per your command, the disciples are ready. We can set out at any time!” Xu Hui cupped his fist.

Yang Kai nodded. “Come with me.”

No one knew what he intended, but they didn’t ask—only followed behind Yang Kai.

They wove through the Nine Peaks and soon arrived before a massive bluestone. On its face, the words “Sacred Tomb” were carved in sweeping strokes.

The Sacred Tomb was where the Saint Lords of Nine Heavens Sacred Land of all generations lay at rest, with the remains of countless sages interred within. At this place, the elders’ and protectors’ expressions grew solemn.

“You’ve been curious where we will place several thousand disciples. Why aren’t you asking now?” Standing before the stone, Yang Kai chuckled as he looked at them.

Their faces tightened—and they understood at once.

Xu Hui was stunned. “Saint Lord, could it be that the place you spoke of is…”

“Other than here, where do you think I could settle you?” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly. “The Sacred Tomb is the best place.”

“Absolutely not!” Xu Hui’s face changed. “This is where the Saint Lords of past generations sleep. How can we disturb them?”

“When people die, the lamp goes out. There’s nothing that can’t be done,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head.

“The Sacred Land has rules. Aside from the Saint Lord and Saintess, no one else may enter the Sacred Tomb!”

“Rules are dead; people are alive, Great Elder,” Yang Kai persuaded patiently.

“Words are words, but… no. Truly no. If we enter the Sacred Tomb, won’t that be ignoring the rules set by our forebears? How will we have any authority before the disciples in the future?”

“You stubborn old mule…” Yang Kai was both amused and angered. He turned his gaze to the other elders and protectors. “What do you all think?”

Shi Kun wore a pained expression and hurriedly looked away.

Meng Tianfei and Luo Sheng likewise had no intention of speaking.

Cheng Yuetong parted her thin lips, wanting to speak, but held back.

“A bunch of good‑for‑nothings,” Yu Ying snorted, then said gravely, “Saint Lord, though the Great Elder is indeed a bit pedantic and stubborn, on this matter I believe he’s right.”

“You think so too?” Yang Kai looked at the beautiful matron in surprise.

Yu Ying nodded solemnly.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead and turned to the last person. “An Ling’er…”

“Don’t ask me. I’m just a young girl. I don’t know anything,” An Ling’er quickly disavowed any part.

Yang Kai ground his teeth at her. He had counted on her to stand with him, only for the girl to ignore him at the critical moment.

“Truly not possible?” Yang Kai looked back at Xu Hui and asked in a deep voice.

“Anything else is fine—if the Saint Lord orders it, even if you wanted my life, I’d offer it up at once. But this matter…” Xu Hui’s voice rang with iron, his face full of loyal resolve as he remonstrated as if Yang Kai were a muddle‑headed Saint Lord.

“Enough.” Yang Kai cut him off before he could finish. “Then seek your own blessings. In two or three days, Zhang Ao and his crowd will break in. The Great Yao Lord will also bring yao experts charging in. We’ll see who among you is still alive then. Farewell.”

With that, he turned to leave.

Xu Hui, quick of eye and hand, grabbed Yang Kai’s clothes in a death grip and wouldn’t let go. “Where are you going, Saint Lord?” he asked in alarm.

“You can sit here and wait to die. I still have a bright future, so I won’t keep you company. Of course I’m leaving,” Yang Kai said as if it were only natural.

“But if you go, what of the Sacred Land?” Xu Hui grew flustered.

“What’s that to me? I found you a path to survival and you won’t take it—do you want me to be buried with you?” Yang Kai curled his lip in disdain. “Sorry, I’m not that noble.”

“This…” Xu Hui was speechless. He thought, young people are young people—impetuous as a wildfire. He had been a proper Saint Lord a moment ago, and now he’d turned on a heel, indifferent to the Sacred Land.

“Besides,” Yang Kai snorted, “if no one executes a Saint Lord’s decision, what am I staying for? Even if we weather this crisis, in the future I’d be nothing but your puppet.”

“We wouldn’t dare!” Xu Hui said, terrified.

“Then why are you still holding me?”

Xu Hui hurriedly let go, mortified.

“Enough,” Yu Ying chided softly, casting Yang Kai a reproachful look. “A Saint Lord should act like one. What Saint Lord throws a tantrum like this? Look what you’ve forced the Great Elder into.”

With a soft sigh, she looked to Xu Hui. “Great Elder, what do you think…?”

Xu Hui hesitated, weighing and wavering. He secretly watched Yang Kai’s reaction as he pondered. Only after a long moment did he relent. “Since the Saint Lord proposes thus… yet we cannot destroy the rules set by our forebears… let us vote. Besides the Saint Lord, there are seven of us. If the majority agree to enter the Sacred Tomb, then… so be it.”

“That will do,” Yu Ying said with a nod.

“Who opposes entering the Sacred Tomb? Raise your hand,” Yang Kai said as he swept his gaze over them.

The Great Elder raised his hand at once.

The other five elders and the Saintess, An Ling’er, glanced at one another and remained still.

“You…” The Great Elder looked at them in surprised hurt, as if he hadn’t expected no one to share his zeal for upholding ancestral rules.

“Slippery lot…” Yu Ying murmured. She knew that if Yang Kai had asked the question another way, the result would likely have been different.

After all, the new Saint Lord was a young man. Who would want to oppose him at a time like this? If he took it amiss, he might develop a distaste for the Sacred Land and throw down the burden.

No one could bear that responsibility.

“My thanks, Great Elder,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle and a cupped‑fist salute.

Xu Hui could only give a wry smile. “Things are as they are. I’ll say no more. We’ll do as you say, Saint Lord.”

“It’s for your own good. Don’t wear such long faces. If the Saint Lords of past generations knew, they would likely forgive you.”

“Let it be so.”

Borrowing the Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring to open the Sacred Tomb, they entered with Yang Kai. Each face was grave, devotional as if on pilgrimage.

Seeing a Small Xuan Realm the size of a city, with no sun, moon, or stars, no white clouds or blue sky, they all felt a sense of unreality.

“So this is the Sacred Tomb?” Yu Ying murmured, a trace of disappointment flashing in her eyes. What she saw was nothing like what she had imagined.

In her mind, the Sacred Tomb was a peaceful place of green mountains and clear waters, of birdsong and blossoms.

But here, chill miasma coiled; specks of phosphorescence flickered all around; the light was dim. It was ghastly, like a ghost‑haunted realm.

The others looked around with curiosity and surprise. Only the Great Elder, Xu Hui, kept bowing to the four quarters, muttering nonstop, as if afraid they had disturbed the sleep of Saint Lords of generations past.

“The energy is so rich,” Cheng Yuetong breathed. Her full bosom rose and fell in exaggerated waves, and delight lit her eyes.

The Heaven‑and‑Earth Energy among the Nine Peaks was already impressive, but compared with the Sacred Tomb, it paled. No wonder the old Saint Lords loved to cultivate here.

“The environment is a bit poor, but as a place to lie low and recover, it couldn’t be more suitable,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle. “When I first came here, I was startled by how dense the Spiritual Qi was too. I don’t even know where it comes from. Mm. This Small Xuan Realm is much smaller than the usual ones, but it’s more than enough to house all the disciples of the Sacred Land.”

“From the sound of it, you’ve been to other Small Xuan Realms, Saint Lord?” Cheng Yuetong said, eyes alight as she looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

Though Small Xuan Realms were widely known to exist, precious few had actually entered one. The entrances to these mysterious spaces, independent of the continent, were extremely well‑hidden and hard to find.

Yang Kai chuckled and exchanged a glance with An Ling’er—everything understood without words.

“Where are the coffins of the Saint Lords of past generations? Why don’t I see any?” Only now did Xu Hui look around—and what he saw left him dumbfounded. “There should be many coffins here.”

Yang Kai’s face twitched. Testing the waters, he asked, “And how do you know there are coffins here?”

“There should be. Each old Saint Lord forged a coffin for himself to be sent into the Sacred Tomb… And this place is far too tidy. There’s nothing here at all.”

At his words, the others noticed what was off: the Sacred Tomb was smooth and level as if cut by a blade. The ground was covered in dust and powder, yet there were traces left by wild surges of energy.

“Right—and where are the remains of the Saint Lords?” Shi Kun scratched his head as he peered around.

“Perhaps the Sacred Tomb still holds secrets unknown to us… Mm. I didn’t find anything last time either,” Yang Kai said quickly.

If Xu Hui were to learn that, because he had fused a drop of Demon God Golden Blood, Yang Kai had destroyed all the bones and coffins in the Sacred Tomb… who knew what the old man would think.
