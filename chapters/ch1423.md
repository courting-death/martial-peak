## Chapter 1423 — Lingxiao Sect

The vast ruins of the Taixuan Sect had, after tens of thousands of years of silence, at last welcomed their first visitors today.

Thick, almost substantial spiritual qi swirled around their bodies, warming them through and through; it was supremely comfortable. They barely needed to circulate any cultivation techniques — the spiritual qi would willingly seep into their bodies on its own.

Cultivating in such an environment could save several times the effort and time!

Not only did Wu Yi and the others wear excited expressions, even the woman surnamed Ye looked entranced.

On Dark Star, the most concentrated spiritual qi could be found at Star Emperor Mountain; as a former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain, the woman surnamed Ye naturally had a say in this. Yet compared with this place, the spiritual qi of Star Emperor Mountain seemed like a mere trifle — worlds apart.

Beneath Star Emperor Mountain an exceptional earth vein channeled the flow of spiritual qi, but beneath the ruins of the Taixuan Sect there appeared to be not just one superior earth vein; there were several intersecting and crisscrossing.

A flight of white jade steps lay before them, looking immaculate and flawless; even after tens of thousands of years without anyone to sweep them, they were free of dust. Those white jade steps were hewn from the purest jade, their luster smooth and warm, leading straight upward, and by rough count there were at least ten thousand steps.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan walked side by side, their pace steady, feeling the rich spiritual qi as they advanced while releasing divine sense to probe the surroundings.

The woman surnamed Ye followed closely behind; after her came Chang Qi and the others, while the dozens of disciples who had belonged to the Haike Family fell to the rear in groups, whispering excitedly — their spirits high.

Years ago they had followed Wu Yi to leave the Haike Family and join Dragon Lair Mountain. Though it had been a sincere choice, each of them still felt a measure of nostalgia for their original family.

But over the subsequent years they had gained vast quantities of cultivation resources and enjoyed excellent training conditions at Dragon Lair Mountain, gradually developing a sense of belonging and feeling themselves to be part of Dragon Lair Mountain.

Now Dragon Lair Mountain had been leveled to the ground. Though regrettable, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had led them into this new realm, and this place was far superior to Dragon Lair Mountain by countless degrees.

Past events were vivid in their minds. Every cultivator secretly congratulated themselves on the decision they had made years ago. Those who had remained with the Haike Family were probably still struggling for trivial cultivation supplies, while they had nothing to worry about: sitting and cultivating sufficed, Saint Crystals supplied without limit, miraculous spiritual pills available in abundance. Even secret treasures were of excellent quality.

Such treatment was something even the top lineages on Dark Star could not provide, yet they could enjoy it here.

If the Battle Sky Alliance or the Leitai Sect were to come now and invite them to join, they would surely snort in disdain.

What of the Battle Sky Alliance? What of the Leitai Sect? How could they compare to Dragon Lair Mountain?

Step after step fell behind them; after roughly half an hour, Yang Kai and the others finally arrived at the highest tier. Looking up, two towering pillars stretched into the sky on either side. Above those pillars hung a huge plaque, on which three sweeping characters were written.

Taixuan Sect!

The three characters exuded a profound charm that was difficult to fathom; one could not guess whose hand had penned them, but the strength behind them was certainly not weak — it was very likely the work of an expert of the Void King Realm!

A mountain breeze blew over, clear and natural. Gazing through the Taixuan Sect gate into the interior, mountain ranges rose and fell, pavilions filled the ground; it stretched on without end, yet within these grand sect ruins there was not a shred of life.

Yang Kai spread his divine sense, and yet could not cover the whole of the Taixuan Sect.

Such a vast sect could easily accommodate a hundred thousand disciples without feeling crowded, yet now there were fewer than a hundred people who had entered, and for a long time to come, it would remain only these few dozen living and cultivating here.

One person could occupy an entire peak without issue.

"This should still be the front hall," Yang Yan said, her brow slightly furrowed as if sensing something. "Let's split up and explore a bit. It seems there are no obvious restrictions here, but don’t be careless. If you find anything suspicious, don’t go in recklessly — send word to me or Yang Kai."

"Understood." Wu Yi replied, immediately dividing the dozens of cultivators into more than a dozen teams of three to five people, who dispersed in all directions.

Yang Kai, of course, would not idle; he set off alone to explore the Taixuan Sect’s front hall.

He had thought some decent treasures might remain, but was surprised to find nothing of value — only the sprawling ruins of a mighty sect, which left him somewhat disappointed.

After an entire day of searching, Yang Kai had gained nothing.

The disciples from the Haike Family were luckier: some found aged secret treasures, others discovered pills still fit for consumption. One by one they ran over with bright faces to report their finds, wanting to turn them in.

Yang Kai had no use for such things; after a brief inspection he allowed them to keep what they had found.

That decision only spurred the disciples on further; the entire Taixuan Sect front hall was soon filled with their excited comings and goings, entering and exiting palace after palace.

In the blink of an eye, about half a month had passed.

During that half month the group of dozens did nothing but explore the Taixuan Sect ruins, and yet they still did not finish the task.

The place alone contained eighty-one peaks of various sizes; every peak bristled with spiritual qi, rivaling and even surpassing the main headquarters of many sects.

The nine largest peaks, in particular, possessed concentrations of spiritual qi so astonishing they left one in awe.

Though they did not reap many extra rewards, being able to settle in such a location satisfied everyone.

After much deliberation they decided to make the front hall their residence. With so few people and such a vast Taixuan Sect ruin, scattering about would hamper contact between them.

The front hall’s spiritual qi, while not as rich as that of the nine greatest peaks, was nonetheless better than anywhere outside.

Yang Kai took up residence in a magnificent palace that sat atop an Eye of Spiritual Spring; the spiritual qi flowing from the spring was bound by an array and would not leak, making it an ideal place to cultivate.

He was very pleased with this.

However, since everyone had now settled here, they could no longer use the Taixuan Sect name. After all, they would still have to deal with other powers on Dark Star; they could not keep using the names Dragon Lair Mountain or Taixuan Sect forever. Yang Yan, Wu Yi, and the others came to ask Yang Kai’s opinion, and he promptly replaced the Taixuan Sect plaque with one that read Lingxiao Sect!

They did not announce it far and wide, but it was a low-key founding of a sect nonetheless.

Lingxiao Pavilion was the school Yang Kai had come from, so naming this new foothold Lingxiao Sect was only natural. No one objected, nor did they press Yang Kai for the meaning behind the name.

They had already come to regard Yang Kai as a leader; even if his choice of name was poor, they would not complain.

It was the woman surnamed Ye who praised the new sect name lavishly.

After this extended contact, Yang Kai had come to understand the background of the woman surnamed Ye.

Ye Xijun — former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain! A person of great renown. On Dark Star she had once wielded power that reached the heavens. Yet years ago, for reasons unknown, she left Star Emperor Mountain. Everyone had assumed she had perished, unaware that she had been living reclusively in remote mountains all along.

If not for Ge Qi stumbling across Yang Yan this time, she likely would not have revealed herself.

As a former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain, when Ye Xijun left she had taken only two things: a Void King‑grade secret treasure called the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp, and a painted portrait of a figure.

A portrait of the Starry Sky Emperor!

It was an old tradition at Star Emperor Mountain that, although the Emperor slept, one day she would return.

Over the course of tens of thousands of years the ancestral decree had slowly been forgotten and Star Emperor Mountain itself no longer knew whether it truly had any connection to the Starry Sky Emperor, but Ye Xijun remained firmly convinced.

To probe the Emperor’s secret, she had scoured ancient records and found a shocking clue: the Emperor had once been grievously hurt by a powerful enemy and had to use a certain divine technique, falling into a slumber to wait for her wounds to heal.

This matched the hidden truth Yang Yan and Yang Kai had previously spoken of.

Ye Xijun spent decades, even centuries, investigating this matter. During that time she refused to involve herself in Star Emperor Mountain’s affairs, which led to a loss of power and allowed treacherous men to seize control, forcing her to leave.

Her motivation for spending so long seeking the Emperor’s clue was one thing — to rise to the Void King Realm!

Though she was unsure of the Emperor’s exact cultivation, she knew it must be beyond the Void King Realm. If the Emperor could attain such heights tens of thousands of years ago, why couldn’t she?

Learning from others’ successes to forge her own path, Ye Xijun had hoped to discover a route to the Void King Realm, but instead she uncovered that hidden secret.

After leaving Star Emperor Mountain she lived in seclusion, the Emperor’s portrait hung in her cave dwelling; she burned an incense stick morning and evening and bowed three times at dawn and dusk.

Ge Qi was a disciple she had adopted many years before. Though truly his master in name, Ge Qi called her Grandmaster and often visited or consulted her about cultivation problems; he had seen the Emperor’s portrait many times.

Thus, when he encountered Yang Yan in Tianyun City he acted like someone who had seen a ghost, trembling and fearful in demeanor.

The last time he returned to Ye Xijun’s side he recounted what he had seen, and she set out for Dragon Lair Mountain before her wounds had fully healed, arriving right as the crowd attacked Dragon Lair Mountain.

Though there are people who resemble one another, two faces could not be identical. Ye Xijun suspected that the woman called Yang Yan had some connection to the Emperor.

Upon arriving at Dragon Lair Mountain and communicating with Yang Yan via the Transmission Compass, Ye Xijun immediately confirmed her suspicions.

Otherwise, why would she have come to help Dragon Lair Mountain for no reason? Why would she, with top‑tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, follow Yang Yan’s lead so unquestioningly?

If she had any lingering doubts before, these days’ interactions had dispelled them. Only the Emperor could have forged such a warship, and only the Emperor could so easily shatter the Taixuan Sect’s protective array.

She instinctively believed Yang Yan to be the Emperor reborn, not realizing the Emperor’s true body still slumbered in the Imperial Garden.
