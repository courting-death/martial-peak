## Chapter 413 — Offering to Heaven and Ancestors

After the third watch ended, Pang Chi and Mu Nandou knelt inside the Bamboo Segment Gang’s main hall, staring at the two figures behind Yang Kai with expressions of shock.

“Got a problem?” One of the two, looking near death, snorted coldly, and a tremendous Divine Sense suddenly swept forth.

Feeling the immense power contained within this Divine Sense, Pang Chi and Mu Nandou’s faces changed drastically. They suddenly realized that these two seemingly dying men were far from ordinary.

Such an extraordinary Divine Sense alone was enough to wipe out the small forces scattered throughout the Northern District.

Hastily restraining their expressions, they waved their hands anxiously, “No, no disrespect intended!”

“Go,” Yang Kai waved his hand dismissively.

Seeing that the two tower-like men behind Yang Kai made no move, Pang Chi and Mu Nandou were wrapped by a force and vanished from the hall in an instant, leaving only a faint bloodstain scent lingering in the air.

Only after Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu disappeared did Yang Kai smile faintly.

Since these two had pledged their loyalty five days ago, they had remained by his side.

These two Blood Servants were heavily injured and should have been resting to recover, but Yang Kai ignored their physical states, seemingly eager for their deaths. Wherever he went, he brought them along.

During these five days, Yang Kai had not spoken a single word to them, nor had he given any instructions.

Yet what pleased Yang Kai was that he sensed no impatience or dissatisfaction from Qu Gaoyi or Ying Jiu.

Their current strength barely reached thirty percent of their peak, but sweeping through the small forces in Zhongdu was no problem at all.

There was no time to wait. Yang Kai had originally hoped Pang Chi and Mu Nandou would slowly pick off the more vulnerable small forces, but with the succession war imminent, he could no longer delay.

Reluctantly, he deployed his two Blood Servants to assist.

Rising, Yang Kai told another senior of the Bamboo Segment Gang nearby, “Take me to your storeroom.”

“Yes!”

After the Bamboo Segment Gang devoured two small forces and at Yang Kai’s prompting purchased many alchemy and forging materials themselves, all of these were now stored in their warehouse.

Yang Kai made a quick round inside, then emerged with numerous fine items added to his Dark Book Space.

Counting the large batch of materials sent from the Elder Hall five days ago by Yang Zhen, Yang Kai’s stockpile was now considerable.

The Elder Hall’s efficiency was impressive. When Yang Kai exchanged the remainder of his merits for materials, everything had been settled that very night.

Looking at the abundance in the two horse carts, both Yang Kai and his parents were genuinely surprised.

All the materials were Heaven-Grade or above, with a full tenth at Mystery-Grade, split evenly between alchemy and forging!

Fortunately, the Yang Family’s profound foundation enabled this; otherwise, such a bounty would have been impossible.

Yang Yingfeng had never expected that after acquiring two Blood Servants as followers, Yang Kai would still have so many merits left over.

Yang Kai himself had not anticipated this.

The father and son stood dumbstruck for a moment before regaining their composure. All these treasures were safely stored in the Dark Book Space.

“Tell Pang Chi to keep collecting materials. When there’s enough, send them directly to the War City,” Yang Kai instructed, then strode away with his hands behind his back.

The War City! A city built solely by the Yang Family for the succession war, just a hundred li away from Zhongdu.

“Yes!” The Bamboo Segment Gang senior replied gravely.

After Yang Kai left, some felt puzzled. How had he merely walked around the storeroom and come out without apparently taking anything?

Peeking inside nervously, one was immediately terrified — all the materials once there had vanished without a trace.

“Wh-what to do now…”

Three days later, the Yang Family’s Offering to Heaven Platform stood grand and imposing. The ground was level and covered with vibrant red carpets. The platform itself was monumental, with two immense stone pillars rising into the clouds. Carved upon these pillars were vivid images of dragons soaring and phoenixes ascending to the ninth heaven.

The sky was cloudless, clear as polished jade. The wind howled, lifting the blood-red Yang Family banners, their clangorous rustling shouting defiance.

Nearly a thousand Yang Family martial artists, clad uniformly in black battle garments, gathered around the vast Offering to Heaven Platform.

The thousand breaths harmonized as one, their auras blending seamlessly; with every inhale and exhale, it felt as if the very world itself was stirred.

Beneath the platform, eight young direct descendants of the Yang Family, having bathed and changed, stood with solemn expressions in order of seniority, heads bowed, gazing upward toward the platform.

Suddenly, a vigorous shout rang out: “Qiu Shoucheng, head of the Qiu Family, has arrived!”

“The Ye Family head, Ye Kuangren, arrives!”

“The Meng Family head, Meng Xiping, is here!”

...

The rare Yang Family succession war was the grandest event in decades, naturally drawing the attention of Zhongdu and the entire realm. The Seven Great Families all sent their heads personally.

Yang Family disciples escorted these guests to their prepared seats, where they sipped tea and awaited the proceedings.

Within half an hour, all family heads of the Seven Great Families had arrived.

A green light flashed, and the Yang Family Patriarch Yang Yinghao appeared upon the Offering to Heaven Platform, accompanied by several elders whose power surpassed the Divine Roaming Realm.

At the host’s arrival, Qiu Shoucheng and others stood promptly, clasping their fists to offer respects.

Yang Yinghao returned the gesture and loudly proclaimed, “Today is the Yang Family’s day to honor Heaven and our ancestors. I thank all for your attendance. Please be seated.”

Qiu Shoucheng, Ye Kuangren, Meng Xiping, and the others nodded slightly, their eyes gleaming with radiance, then resumed their seats.

Yang Kai’s gaze rested on Yang Yinghao. By seniority, he should be Yang Kai’s eldest uncle, though in truth the age gap with Fourth Master Yang was only a decade or so.

Yet now, Yang Yinghao’s hair had turned white; he was evidently in his twilight years, his face marked deeply with wrinkles.

Before the great battle in Cangyun Evil Land, he had looked very different — a middle-aged man, neither young nor old.

The reason was clear: wounded grievously by the Yinming Ghost King and Destruction Poison King in that battle, upon his return, Yang Yinghao had employed the Yang Family’s Life and Death Reincarnation Technique, expending thirty years of his own lifespan to purge those injuries.

As patriarch, his role was vital; despite knowing the heavy price, he had to ensure his survival.

This was no mere aftereffect of injury, but the immediate stripping away of life.

Hence, Yang Yinghao appeared prematurely aged.

Not knowing how long he might yet live, he anxiously summoned all direct descendants for the succession war.

Yang Zhao and Yang Kang looked upon their father with sorrow.

Yang Yinghao, however, appeared calm as he briefly explained the rules of the succession war.

There were few rules: the Yang Family headquarters would only provide Blood Servants as followers to each direct descendant prince, and these Blood Servants would be severely restricted during the war. Beyond that, no direct assistance would be offered.

Whether by open combat, covert strikes, or cunning strategy, whoever laughed last would win the succession war.

“Have you all made a note?” Yang Yinghao asked the eight standing below. They all nodded in unison.

“Then we begin the Offering to Heaven and Ancestral rites!” Yang Yinghao waved his hand forcefully, his voice deep.

Everything was prepared. In the solemn atmosphere before the platform, fragrant incense curled upwards. A rare sixth-tier Demonic Beast was brought forth, struck down by Yang Yinghao, its blood spilled upon the platform as an offering to Heaven and an ancestral tribute.

The intricate ritual was meticulously performed by the Yang Family’s eight rising heirs under Yang Yinghao’s guidance.

Throughout, the powerful onlookers from the Seven Great Families’ heads glimmered with sharp eyes, carefully observing the eight’s performances, assessing the allies their children chose and the strength of their enemies.

Finally, after venerating all of the Yang Family’s forebears, the solemn ceremony concluded.

“This journey shall be one of life or death. Beware and act cautiously!” Yang Yinghao warned gravely, then gestured, “Depart!”

Eight heavenly Treading Cloud Steeds thundered in, stopping before the eight young disciples who mounted with ease.

The wind ceased. The atmosphere grew tense, even the thousand unified breaths came to a sudden halt.

The eight glanced at each other, then smiled faintly.

Though they were siblings, once outside Zhongdu, they were foes! None would show mercy.

“Eldest brother leads!” Yang Wei declared in a low voice, and with that, his Treading Cloud Steed surged forward like a shooting bolt.

“Follow!” Yang Zhao chuckled lightly.

The eight steeds galloped along the Yang Family’s private passage, kicking up dust as they raced headlong.

“I shall go watch the excitement!” The Kang Family head, Kang Rui, chuckled, enveloping his attendants in pure True Yuan before disappearing like lightning.

“Count me in!” The Gao Family head Gao Mo followed quickly.

“I go as well!” Kang Zheng of the Kang Family was unwilling to be outdone.

In an instant, the entire Seven Great Families had vanished without a trace.

“Rude!” Yang Yinghao snorted coldly, scolding the elders for their departure without even greeting him.

The procession, grand and mighty, surged forth. Below, eight Treading Cloud Steeds galloped; above, seven groups raced through the sky. Soon, they passed beyond the South Gate.

Outside that gate, the scene was even livelier than at the offering platform. Countless forces, large and small, awaited eagerly, knowing that today marked the succession war’s start. They all waited to set forth alongside their chosen Yang Family prince.

The crowd outside the South Gate was dense with heads. Even several li away, people observed secretly.

“Which prince will your Changyang Valley follow this time?” some acquaintances began to greet.

“Of course Sixth Prince Yang Shen.”

“Don’t go there; he’ll surely lose. Join us from Feiyun Manor and follow Second Prince Yang Zhao—he has much more potential than the Sixth Prince.”

“Really?”

“Of course! Come, let me tell you some insider info.” Two linked arms and whispered.

Small third-rate forces like Changyang Valley and Feiyun Manor couldn’t hope to mingle closely with the Yang Family’s direct heirs. Before the war began, they had no chance to meet the princes, so they waited here, picking sides based on personal preference or invitations from friends.
