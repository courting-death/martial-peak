## Chapter 2577 — Elder

“Foolish child, hurry and help our honored guest up. What are you doing?”

A hoarse voice suddenly rang out from ahead. Though powerful, it was gentle and kind, making anyone who heard it feel a sense of warmth.

Xiaoxiao shivered, clearly in awe of the voice’s owner. He bounced back to Yang Kai’s side, grabbed him, and pulled him up, gazing at him with a simple, honest look.

After venting, he finally calmed down.

Yang Kai looked ahead, and what he saw stunned him.

All around the forest, Stone Spirits as tall as a person slowly emerged. A quick count revealed seven or eight, all drawn by the commotion. Their round, curious eyes studied him intently.

The Stone Spirit in the center stood out, not because he was strong or tall—he was actually shorter than the others, not due to height but because his body was hunched.

The first impression this Stone Spirit gave was of age.

His hunched back leaned on a stone cane, and his stone skin was cracked, bearing the marks of countless years. His sharply defined chin sported a tuft of stone spikes like a beard, but his eyes were especially bright, shining with wisdom.

The Stone Spirit Race was not known for their intelligence, yet Yang Kai, meeting the old Stone Spirit’s gaze, was startled to see the reflection of a wise elder shining in those eyes.

Yang Kai grew solemn, realizing this old Stone Spirit must have lived for untold tens of thousands of years. He also understood who he was facing. He cupped his fists and bowed, saying, “Yang Kai greets Elder. Forgive my intrusion, please don’t take offense.”

Zhang Ruoxi, hearing this, knew this was an important figure and quickly bowed in respect.

The elder laughed heartily, his voice full of cheer. “You’re not intruding. Our Stone Spirit Race has been waiting for you for a long time. Today, we finally meet.”

“Waiting for me?” Yang Kai was surprised, but soon remembered something. He glanced at Xiaoxiao beside him, smiled, and patted her shoulder.

He thought it was because of Xiaoxiao that the Stone Spirit elder had been waiting for him.

“Honored guest, you’ve come from afar and must be tired. Please follow me to rest. Our Stone Spirit Race hasn’t had guests in many years.” The elder finished speaking and, without waiting for Yang Kai’s reply, turned and walked deeper into the forest.

Though he looked frail and leaned on a cane, his hunched figure moved swiftly, keeping pace with the other Stone Spirits.

As he left, the remaining Stone Spirits followed closely. Before departing, they cast odd glances at Yang Kai.

Xiaoxiao grabbed Yang Kai’s hand, made a few sounds, and dragged him along.

Yang Kai had no choice but to call Zhang Ruoxi to follow.

After a short walk, they arrived at a place surrounded by towering ancient trees, each so thick it would take ten people to encircle. Beneath each tree was a hollow, seemingly turned into a natural treehouse, with signs of life inside.

Yang Kai looked around curiously, realizing these treehouses must be where the Stone Spirit Race lived.

It made sense—these beings could transform into giants several zhang tall. Ordinary houses couldn’t withstand their antics, so these natural treehouses were the perfect habitat.

The Stone Spirit Race had lived here for countless years, and each treehouse bore the marks of ancient, desolate time.

Upon arrival, the Stone Spirit elder walked straight into a treehouse and disappeared.

Another Stone Spirit approached, placed a hand over his chest in salute, and said, “The elder instructs that our honored guests should rest first. We’ll speak again in the evening.”

Yang Kai glanced at him, wondering if this was the one captured by Xie Wuwei. These Stone Spirits all looked alike; ordinary people couldn’t tell them apart unless they lived with them for a long time.

Mimicking the gesture, Yang Kai politely replied, “Thank you.”

He didn’t know why they had to wait until evening to talk, but he had come to find Xiaoxiao. Now that he’d seen him, his wish was fulfilled. Whether Xiaoxiao left with him or stayed wasn’t his concern.

If Xiaoxiao wanted to leave, that would be best. But if he couldn’t abandon his tribe and chose to stay, Yang Kai wouldn’t force him.

Every living being has its own tribe. Xiaoxiao had found his kin and was no longer alone. Yang Kai was truly happy for him.

“Take good care of our guests,” the Stone Spirit instructed Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao scratched his head and nodded.

The Stone Spirit sighed, turned to leave, seemingly helpless with the childlike Xiaoxiao. But in the whole Stone Spirit Race, only Xiaoxiao was still a child, so his mischievousness couldn’t be helped.

After the Stone Spirit left, Xiaoxiao dragged Yang Kai toward a tree.

Beneath the tree was another treehouse, clearly Xiaoxiao’s home.

Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi followed him inside. Xiaoxiao looked around, then suddenly dashed out, purpose unknown.

Moments later, a shout came from a nearby treehouse: “You little rascal, up to mischief again! Be careful, or I’ll tell the elder to punish you!”

Rumble, rumble.

The ground shook, and soon Xiaoxiao returned, carrying two stone stools on his shoulders. He dropped them on the floor and pointed at them, calling out to Yang Kai.

Ruoxi couldn’t help but laugh, realizing Xiaoxiao must have snatched the stools from another Stone Spirit.

Yang Kai also smiled, exchanged a glance with Ruoxi, shook out his robe, and sat down.

Looking around, Yang Kai found the treehouse spacious but empty, larger than most homes, yet lacking any furniture—not even tables or chairs.

However, a few stone sculptures nearby caught his attention.

The sculptures were rough, clearly made by someone unskilled, but it was still obvious they depicted a man.

From left to right, the sculptures improved, and the last one had distinct facial features.

Ruoxi watched for a while, then exclaimed in surprise, “Sir, is this you?”

Though the sculpture looked nothing like Yang Kai, Zhang Ruoxi still sensed it was modeled after him.

Xiaoxiao bounced over, picked up the best sculpture, and placed it in front of Yang Kai, pointing at himself and then at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stared, his heart stirred, and he praised, “Nicely done. It’s very lifelike.”

Praised, Xiaoxiao jumped three feet high, flipped in the air, then smashed the other sculptures, as if only the one Yang Kai liked mattered and the rest were meaningless.

Xiaoxiao waved his arms and gestured.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, “You learned all this yourself?”

Xiaoxiao nodded vigorously and gestured again.

Yang Kai snorted, “Others just don’t appreciate it. Ignore them.”

Zhang Ruoxi watched quietly, a gentle smile on her face. She found the scene heartwarming. She couldn’t understand Xiaoxiao’s gestures or words, but Yang Kai could, perfectly grasping his meaning.

One man and one Stone Spirit, chatting about trivial matters in the cave, enjoying themselves.

In this remote, ancient forest, the outside world’s chaos seemed like yesterday’s fleeting smoke, unable to disturb this place.

Ruoxi could see that Yang Kai and Xiaoxiao shared a deep bond. She’d never seen Yang Kai so patient; he treated Xiaoxiao like his own child, full of tolerance and kindness.

If only things could stay like this. As long as Sir was willing to remain, she’d gladly stay too, even if it meant living in seclusion.

Laughter echoed from the treehouse as time passed quickly.

Soon, evening arrived and darkness fell.

A Stone Spirit came in, saluted, and said, “Guest, the elder invites you to the banquet.”

Banquet.

Yang Kai was surprised. Though the elder had mentioned speaking in the evening, he hadn’t expected a banquet.

He felt honored, quickly stood up, and said, “The elder is thoughtful. I’ll come right away.”

The Stone Spirit nodded and left.

Xiaoxiao stopped gesturing and pulled Yang Kai outside.

“Xiaoxiao, are there any customs I should know about here?” Yang Kai asked as they walked.

The Stone Spirit Race was a wild tribe, living deep in the Wild Ancient Land. Yang Kai was new here and didn’t want to offend anyone, so he asked to be sure.

But Xiaoxiao just kept shaking his head, saying nothing, acting mysterious, leaving Yang Kai helpless.

Outside the treehouse, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi looked up and were amazed.

“So beautiful!” Ruoxi exclaimed. The Ancient Land’s night was enchanting. Fireflies danced among the ancient trees, streams of light shimmered, and colorful ribbons of spiritual light flew about, making the place seem like a fairyland.

Ruoxi’s eyes sparkled, wishing she could stay here forever and never leave.

Little girls have always been powerless against beautiful things.

Yang Kai had spent many nights in the Wild Ancient Land, but nowhere was as breathtaking as the Stone Spirit Race’s home. He couldn’t help but marvel at nature’s wonders.
