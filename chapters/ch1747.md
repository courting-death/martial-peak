## Chapter 1747 — Twin Shark Island

"Someone wants to come with me? Who?" Yang Kai asked, frowning—he had received no prior notice at all.

Gu Jianxin glanced to one side; Yang Kai followed his line of sight and suddenly saw three familiar faces.

"Young Master Yang!" Yue Xi walked over at a measured pace and halted not far off.

"Eldest Brother Yang." He Zao and He Miao chirped in unison.

Yang Kai glanced toward Gu Jianxin, who shrugged and said with a smile, “I’ve already expelled them from the Sword Alliance. As the Young Alliance Master, I still have at least that much authority.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted.

“Then I asked them what they planned to do next, and they said they wished to follow you. The only question is whether you’re willing to take them in or not,” Gu Jianxin added with a cheerful grin.

"Brother Gu, thank you for your kindness," Yang Kai said seriously.

With his shrewdness, he could see that Gu Jianxin was doing him a favor — after all, on Qingmu Star he was alone. Despite his strength, some matters were inconvenient to handle personally and he had no capable hands to assist him.

If Yue Xi and her two disciples followed him, the situation would change; the tedious chores could be delegated to them, and things he could not appear for could be handled on his behalf.

It would also spare Yue Xi and her two disciples future embarrassment within the Sword Alliance. As Yang Kai had said before, after the Qin Qiyang incident, the three of them would likely find it hard to stand in the Sword Alliance; wherever they went they would bear the charge of ingratitude and be pointed at.

Now that they had been expelled from the Sword Alliance, such problems would no longer arise.

Gu Jianxin had considered things thoroughly — or rather, he had tried hard to leave a good impression on Yang Kai and thus arranged this matter.

Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse such kindness.

He looked up at Yue Xi and her two disciples and solemnly asked, "Are you willing to follow me?"

"As long as the Young Master will take us in, Yue Xi is willing to serve as a handmaid!" Yue Xi quickly replied.

"We’re willing too!" the two sisters answered together.

"Very well — from now on, you shall come with me." Yang Kai nodded.

"Thank you, Young Master!" Yue Xi bowed lightly, her face full of joy.

"Young Brother…" Luo Lan, who had stood to the side the whole time, only spoke now: "As for those Ethereal Crystals you need, I can’t raise many at the moment, but I will gather what I can and have them sent to you after a while, alright?"

"That would be most kind, Elder."

Previously, after Yang Kai chose Twin Shark Island as his territory, he had asked Gu Jianxin and Luo Lan to help procure a large amount of Ethereal Crystals. Those crystals were scarce and Luo Lan could not find many at once. Still, with her promise, Yang Kai would sooner or later obtain some.

Afterwards, Yang Kai brought Yue Xi and her two disciples and summoned his Star Shuttle, leaving Qingmu Palace.

Gu Jianxin and the others stood where they were, watching Yang Kai depart into the distance before finally turning back.

The trip to Twin Shark Island would take half a month even using the Space Array on Qingmu Star.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had the token Luo Lan had given him; with it, the Space Arrays of the major cities all opened to him.

Following the route Luo Lan had set, Yang Kai used one Space Array after another and, in less than half a month, arrived at Twin Shark Island.

Though Twin Shark Island lay remote, it still possessed a Space Array linking it to the outside. When Yang Kai and the others appeared within the array, the warrior in charge of the island immediately stepped forward, looked them over, and then asked out of routine, "What brings you to Twin Shark Island?"

Yang Kai glanced at him and saw the man was only a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; the remaining guards were likewise of low caliber.

From the level of those warriors, one could infer that the island’s combined force was not strong.

He said nothing, instead producing the token Luo Lan had given him and flashing it before the warrior.

"What is this?" the warrior’s eyes widened in bewilderment.

"Don’t recognize it?" Yang Kai frowned. "Hm, never mind. What’s your island master’s name and where is he? Take me to see him."

The warrior, intimidated by Yang Kai’s brusque tone and imposing manner, though ignorant of what the token signified, guessed that Yang Kai must have some backing.

He instantly cast off earlier carelessness and, half-suspicious, answered, "Our island master is Zhu Liang. May I ask where you are from and whether you know the island master?"

Yang Kai did not reply, but Yue Xi snorted coldly: "Is my Young Master’s identity something you can question? Hurry and lead the way!"

While speaking she unconsciously released her own Shi; the warrior’s face changed at once, realizing this man and the three women were beyond his ability to contend with, and he hastily made a serving gesture and led them forward.

This was the benefit of having subordinates: Yue Xi could put on an air of domineering entitlement to elevate Yang Kai’s status and spare him tiresome questioning.

Yang Kai gave Yue Xi an approving look; she pursed her lips and smiled.

The island master Zhu Liang’s strength was not high — only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — and on such an isolated overseas isle it was rare to find powerful warriors.

After Yang Kai showed the token and Luo Lan’s directive, Zhu Liang immediately prostrated himself and addressed Yang Kai as his lord.

To take Twin Shark Island so smoothly pleased Yang Kai greatly.

"Mm, you may remain island master. Continue managing Twin Shark Island as you have before; I will not interfere. If there’s anything you need to report, tell Lady Yue and she will relay it to me."

"Yes!" Sensing Yang Kai’s amenability, Zhu Liang relaxed.

"Island Master Zhu…"

"I am at your service," Zhu Liang hurriedly replied. "The title ‘island master’ is too lofty; you may call me Zhu Liang."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. “Tell me,” he said, “what’s the situation on Twin Shark Island?”

"Yes." Zhu Liang pondered briefly as if organizing his words, then said: "Twin Shark Island covers an area of about one hundred thousand li in circumference; the island’s spiritual qi is decent, but local produce is somewhat lacking. The resident population is about two hundred thousand people and cultivation levels are generally low. Though I am only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, I am considered the island’s expert. Besides me there are three other First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators who serve as deputy island masters and elders. I established an Elder Council to manage Twin Shark Island together with several elders…"

"Fifty thousand li east of Twin Shark Island lies a coastal city connected to our Space Array. To the west and south, at distances ranging from tens to over one million li, there are several other isles with similar conditions; relations between them are peaceful with occasional contact. The greatest danger here is sea beasts — each rampage claims many lives — but with a powerful guardian stationed here, Twin Shark Island should be much safer in the future!"

As he spoke, Zhu Liang discreetly flattered Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression remained composed, neither agreeing nor denying.

Zhu Liang continued: "The greatest output of Twin Shark Island and the nearby isles are sea-beast Inner Cores, and every year many outsiders come to hunt at sea…"

After half an hour of questioning, Yang Kai had a modest understanding of Twin Shark Island’s situation.

Overall, he was satisfied — the place suited the plan he intended to carry out.

He still needed to pick a specific spot here before his plan could be implemented.

Yang Kai decided to investigate personally.

After dismissing Zhu Liang, Yang Kai bade farewell to Yue Xi and her two disciples, then rode the Star Shuttle alone to scout Twin Shark Island’s terrain.

The survey took him eight days as he traversed the entire island.

In the end he chose an area in the southeast near the sea — it had pleasant scenery and, most importantly, a large open ground showing little sign of martial presence.

Yang Kai found Zhu Liang again and had him conscript some warriors from Twin Shark Island to build a temporary palace on that location.

He would not let people toil for nothing and planned to pay them Saint Crystals as reward.

Such a good opportunity — how could Zhu Liang refuse? Even if Yang Kai had not offered Saint Crystals, Zhu Liang would have handled things handsomely, especially since Yang Kai was so reasonable.

With a population of two hundred thousand, a single command from Zhu Liang could easily raise one thousand people to begin building on Yang Kai’s chosen site.

The workers moved with astonishing speed; in barely half a month they completed a magnificent palace covering an area exceeding ten li in circumference.

Zhu Liang even paid out of his own pocket to add some furnishings and decorations to the palace.

Only then did Yang Kai move in there with Yue Xi and the two disciples.

The palace was vast; with only four occupants it felt tranquil and secluded.

Yue Xi and her two disciples did not know why Yang Kai had built such a large palace and did not press him; they obediently followed and served attentively.

That night Yang Kai summoned them to his room.

"Young Master called us—what orders do you have?" Yue Xi asked, puzzled.

"Nothing major, sit down," Yang Kai motioned.

After they were seated he said: "Since you chose to follow me, I will not treat you unfairly. I have a sect called Lingxiao Sect; I am its Sect Master and the main headquarters are on a far-off Cultivation Star. Would you be willing to join Lingxiao Sect?"

The three exchanged glances and, without much thought, all nodded: "Of course we are willing."

"Mm. Then from now on you shall be people of Lingxiao Sect," Yang Kai smiled. "The sect’s headquarters are far away, so you may not have the chance to go for a while, but rest assured I will take you someday. Lingxiao Sect… will not be weak in the future."
