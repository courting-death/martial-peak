## Chapter 1603 — The Thing in the Pouch

It seemed that Zhang Qing and the others were not facing a mere Second-Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator, but a true Void King Realm master…

Around Domain Stone Mountain, everyone’s gazes toward Yang Kai grew grave.

They realized this was an extraordinarily fearsome adversary!

Many of the martial groups closer to Yang Kai unconsciously retreated a little, instinctively putting distance between themselves and Yang Kai, as if avoiding a plague deity.

A mass of purple thunderflame emerged amid the shredded flesh of Zhang Qing; within that thunderflame there was not only the searing heat of fire but the wild fury of lightning—precisely the secret art that powerful cultivators of the Fire Radiance Sect refined.

Last time in the Imperial Garden, the beauty Tan Tinghe of Ice Heart Valley had told Yang Kai that the Fire Radiance Sect possessed a Qiantian Thunderflame, the very foundation of their sect and an Ancestral Treasure, with immeasurable might.

If a cultivator of the Fire Radiance Sect was strong enough, they could borrow the Qiantian Thunderflame’s power to cultivate the secret art Qiantian Thunderfire.

Zhang Qing was clearly qualified.

The moment Zhang Qing’s Qiantian Thunderfire manifested, the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit went into a frenzy and lunged forward like a man on spirits, snapping that Qiantian Thunderfire in its beak and swallowing it into its belly, emitting an extraordinarily satisfied cry.

"Return." Yang Kai called, and the Artifact Spirit instantly transformed into a streak of fire and shot into Yang Kai’s body, disappearing.

Looking around, Yang Kai found those people still dazed by shock, not fully recovered, and many had reflexively avoided meeting his eyes, as if afraid of being seen.

Yang Kai chuckled and said loudly, “Relax—so long as others don’t trouble me, I won’t trouble them. I just want a slightly larger piece of land, that’s all. Everyone else can go about their own business.”

Hearing this, the wary cultivators breathed a sigh of relief and their tense expressions gradually eased.

From Yang Kai’s domineering display, anyone he fixed on would surely fare badly—the six people with Zhang Qing died in an instant. There had been no chance to resist; here the strongest group numbered only nine, and no one felt confident they could withstand Yang Kai’s raging assault and dissipate his overwhelming field of Shi.

"Continue your comprehension; I don’t think anyone will disturb you now," Yang Kai signaled to Qian Tong and Lin Yurao.

The two looked at each other, bewildered, as if scarcely able to believe it.

They had seen Yang Kai act just now and participated without hesitation, never imagining victory would come so easily; they had expected a fierce struggle, perhaps even to die here.

Yet their opponent had offered no resistance.

When they slew them, they clearly felt the opponent’s utter helplessness.

This left the two as if still within a dream even after the fight was over.

"Yang Kai, you seem to have grown a great deal—did you gain much in the Blood Prison?" Qian Tong asked skeptically.

Last time when he accompanied Yang Kai to attack the three giants of Dark Star, Yang Kai had not been so terrifying; Qian Tong had thought Yang Kai had great potential but had not yet come into his own—he had felt their strengths were about the same.

But now he could only look up.

Rising cultivation was only a small part of it; mastery over Shi was Yang Kai’s greatest asset, and Qian Tong suspected Yang Kai had gained much from this Blood Prison excursion.

"It wasn't bad," Yang Kai nodded lightly, offering little explanation.

Qian Tong nodded, drew in his spirit, and was about to sit cross‑legged when he suddenly said, "By the way, about Brother Zhao…"

"You decide," Yang Kai said with a bright smile, sitting cross‑legged.

Qian Tong thought for a moment, walked a short distance, and went over to where the stunned Zhao Tianze stood like an idiot, and spoke quietly with him.

After some time, Zhao Tianze returned with a guilty expression, found a spot, sat cross‑legged, and looked at Yang Kai with a complicated face.

He truly felt ashamed. Earlier he had been selfish and cowardly, not staying to share hardships with Qian Tong and the others; now that the enemies were all felled, he came to cash in on the spoils, and Zhao Tianze was filled with embarrassment.

Had it been something else, he very likely would have refused—one must preserve some dignity.

But the temptation of Domain Stone Mountain was too strong; despite his shame he had forced himself to return and sit down, feeling his face burn hot.

"Brother Zhao, don’t think too much. In that situation anyone who didn’t know Yang Kai’s background would likely make the same choice. You have no need to be embarrassed; as for your character, I am not unaware," Qian Tong comforted.

Zhao Tianze smiled wryly, glanced at Yang Kai, and seeing him remain motionless and say nothing, he sighed deeply and said earnestly, "I am truly grateful!"

He was too ashamed even to speak further.

Qian Tong patted his shoulder and urged him to settle down and focus on comprehension.

Around Domain Stone Mountain, hundreds of cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm had gathered so tightly it was impenetrable, various groups occupying different positions.

Yang Kai and his group occupied the largest space; though there were only four of them, no one dared encroach, and the corpses and blood on the ground testified there had been a fierce battle earlier.

A large empty stretch on both sides of Yang Kai’s small group remained unclaimed and no one dared take it.

From time to time newcomers joined; at first sight of those empty spaces they brightened and moved to take them, but spotting the corpses on the ground their expressions changed and they reluctantly gave up.

Half a day later, Domain Stone Mountain’s surroundings had become two full rings, and the number of cultivators had risen to as many as two hundred, with more still hurrying in from afar.

Conflict became unavoidable.

The larger teams wanted to seize better positions, and the groups who arrived earlier naturally would not yield; at the slightest disagreement they came to blows.

Occasionally someone screamed and died.

The area around Domain Stone Mountain had become a graveyard for Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts; famed strongmen from the various Cultivation Stars fell one after another, the scene exploding with ferocity.

Yet no matter how frequent the fighting, Yang Kai and the others suffered no more provocations.

They occupied a large, excellent position and those around kept well away; anyone with half a mind would understand this small group was not to be trifled with.

Qian Tong, Lin Yurao, and Zhao Tianze were clearly immersed in the wonders emanating from Domain Stone Mountain.

Yang Kai didn’t begin his own comprehension. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground to guard the others, seemingly to ward off any fools who might come looking for trouble. Yet the corners of his mouth curved into a faintly strange smile as his gaze fixed intently on the Domain Stone Mountain before him.

His gaze was as if he were looking at something that already belonged to him!

A day later, many cultivators who were meditating discerned something amiss.

As time passed, the marvelous effects exuded by Domain Stone Mountain seemed to steadily weaken. At first they thought it was hallucination, but upon closer inspection they found it true.

Domain Stone Mountain was indeed slowly losing its potency!

This discovery baffled and puzzled the cultivators; they could not understand why a Domain Stone that had existed for countless years would undergo such a change.

Two days later, more cultivators noticed the matter, and soon everyone knew.

Whispered gossip rose one after another.

"What’s going on? It’s only been a few days, why has Domain Stone Mountain’s effect dropped so much?"

"You feel it too? I thought I was mistaken."

"Could it be that too many people have been comprehending here and they’ve sucked the Domain Stone Mountain dry?"

"Nonsense! Every time Domain Stone Mountain appears it attracts so many people. It has always drawn crowds before without issue—why would this time be different?"

"Could Domain Stone Mountain really be losing its function?"

"Stop arguing and, while it still has some power, hurry and comprehend. Once it’s completely gone this will be a dead mountain."

The strange change at Domain Stone Mountain made every cultivator sense danger, and they strove to comprehend its profundities to gain the greatest benefit.

By the third day, the outer ring of cultivators felt no miraculous intent at all; only those nearer the inner layers of Domain Stone Mountain could gain some harvest.

On the fourth day, even the inner practitioners found it difficult to comprehend anything.

The effect of Domain Stone Mountain seemed to have waned to its lowest point—something that had never happened before. Domain Stone Mountain was a treasure of the Blood Prison and had existed for tens of thousands of years; no one understood the reason behind this.

Only the smile hidden in Yang Kai’s eyes grew ever broader.

Suddenly, from somewhere came a faint cracking sound.

Though slight, the noise caught many people’s attention.

Turning their gaze toward the sound, many cultivators’ eyes trembled.

"A fissure! Domain Stone Mountain is cracking!" someone cried, as if they had discovered something monumental.

"What? A fissure in Domain Stone Mountain? Impossible!" others refused to believe it.

What was Domain Stone Mountain? It was essentially a colossal Domain Stone that had been here for tens of thousands of years—how could it possibly crack?

But the doubters’ voices had barely risen before more fissures appeared across Domain Stone Mountain, tiny cracks like a spiderweb, dense and crisscrossing.

Crackle, crackle…

"Not good, Domain Stone Mountain is going to shatter!"

"It’s breaking apart? Ha! I’ll get rich—just been worrying how to move such a huge thing and now it breaks itself, heaven favors me."

A chorus of shouts immediately rose; all the cultivators rose to their feet with expressions ranging from solemn to elated, each forming different intentions in their hearts.

A tense, knife‑drawn atmosphere spread; many who had coexisted peacefully now eyed every stranger as a competitor.

They all set their sights on Domain Stone Mountain.

"Yang Kai, we…" Qian Tong swallowed and looked toward Domain Stone Mountain with bright eyes.

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed tightly as his Divine Sense spread outward. Suddenly, his expression shifted, and he shouted in a low voice, "Retreat at once!"
