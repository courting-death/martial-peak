## Chapter 2239 — The Seal

Countless millennia have passed, and their names have long since faded into the river of history. The people who now live peaceful lives in this world have no idea that, in ages past, such a soul-stirring battle once took place here.

Only an old man silently guards their graves. Only these graves record the great merits they once achieved, and only here can one recall the sacrifices they made for this world.

“The outcome of that battle, you can see for yourself,” Tian Yan said with a sorrowful expression, gesturing toward the dozens of graves ahead.

Yang Kai grew solemn and deeply bowed to these graves.

Straightening up, he asked, “What about the Soul-Devouring Worms? Were they destroyed?”

Tian Yan slowly shook his head and said gloomily, “It’s shameful to admit, but even though we paid a tremendous price, the Soul-Devouring Worms... truly weren't something the beings of this world could destroy.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically, and he exclaimed, “Senior, do you mean... the Soul-Devouring Worms are still alive?”

Tian Yan nodded.

“How can that be?” Yang Kai suddenly felt a bit of sorrow. So many experts here died to eradicate the Soul-Devouring Worm, yet after sacrificing their lives, they still failed. Doesn’t that mean their sacrifice was of little value?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai was startled and asked, “Where are the Soul-Devouring Worms now?”

“Come with me!” the old man said, once again using his power to envelop Yang Kai. In a flash, they arrived before the pitch-black altar. He waved his hand to disperse the thick mist, revealing the altar, and pointed at it with a wary look. “All the insects that once brought disaster to this world are sealed within!”

He didn’t need to say it—Yang Kai had already sensed it.

Because as soon as he arrived here, the Soul-Devouring Worms inside the Warm Spirit Lotus suddenly became uncontrollable, as if they wanted to break free from Yang Kai’s restraint and fly out of his body.

At the same time, a buzzing sound came from within the altar, resonating strangely with the Soul-Devouring Worms on the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Yang Kai’s expression changed wildly.

“So you really do have Soul-Devouring Worms,” the old man glanced at him, his gaze complex. “It was precisely because of their agitation that I noticed something was wrong and went to Heavenly Yao Mountain to investigate. But by the time I arrived, you were already gone. However... I have guarded this place for tens of thousands of years and am extremely familiar with the aura of the Soul-Devouring Worms. I sensed that unique aura in Heavenly Yao Mountain, and after asking the Yao King there, I tracked it to Divine Roaming City.”

“Please rest assured, Senior. My Soul-Devouring Worms are not powerful. They won’t cause any harm to this world, and... when I leave, I will definitely take them with me,” Yang Kai hurriedly said.

He had thought Tian Yan brought him here to make him leave the Soul-Devouring Worms behind, so he quickly explained.

“Young friend Yang, you misunderstand,” Tian Yan slowly shook his head. “I have no intention of taking your Soul-Devouring Worms. This world nearly faced destruction because of these insects—how could I leave even more of them behind? I brought you here to ask for your help.”

“What help?” Yang Kai was confused.

“I want you... to take these away as well!” Tian Yan said, pointing at the pitch-black altar.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, and he said dryly, “Senior, you must be joking.” He explained, “My Soul-Devouring Worms are weak, and I obtained them long ago, so I could still control them. But the Soul-Devouring Worms sealed here... I’m afraid I’m powerless.”

The Soul-Devouring Worms sealed here had devoured dozens of Third Stage Emperor Realm cultivators. How could Yang Kai dare to touch them? If he really put them into the Warm Spirit Lotus, he’d die without a burial place in no time.

“They are no longer as powerful as they once were,” Tian Yan said. “They’ve been sealed for tens of thousands of years, unable to nourish their souls, and are now extremely weak. Since you can control your Soul-Devouring Worms, can’t you control these as well?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “Senior, you overestimate me... I could still control my Soul-Devouring Worms before, but after less than twenty days here, they’re already starting to disobey. After I leave, I’ll have to find a way myself...”

At this point, Yang Kai suddenly paused, falling into deep thought.

Seeing him like this, Tian Yan couldn’t help but become excited, looking at him with hope.

He had guarded this place for tens of thousands of years, never leaving Mist Valley—partly to watch over his old friends’ graves, and partly to guard the Soul-Devouring Worms.

However, leaving the Soul-Devouring Worms in this world would always be a hidden danger. If they could be taken away and the threat eliminated once and for all, that would be Tian Yan’s greatest wish.

That’s why, after sensing the Soul-Devouring Worms awakening in the altar, he immediately sought out the cause, found Yang Kai, and made this request.

After a long while, Yang Kai finally looked up, his eyes shining. He asked, “Senior, how strong are the sealed Soul-Devouring Worms now?”

Tian Yan answered seriously, “By my estimation, even if they’re a bit stronger than your Soul-Devouring Worms, it’s not by much.”

“Is that all?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. “If that’s the case, there might be a chance.”

“What do you mean?” Tian Yan asked in confusion.

Yang Kai said solemnly, “Senior, you must know that the outside world is very different from here. The Soul-Devouring Worms may be unrestrained here, but outside there are many ways to deal with them. I have a rare treasure that is a natural nemesis of all kinds of strange insects...”

“Such a thing exists?” Tian Yan was invigorated.

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded. “I originally planned to use this treasure to subdue my own Soul-Devouring Worms after leaving here, so they would obey me in the future. If the sealed Soul-Devouring Worms aren’t too strong, I might be able to subdue them as well.”

The item he referred to was, of course, the Slave-Insect Bracelet left behind by the Insect Emperor.

This thing is extremely effective against all kinds of strange insects. The Soul-Devouring Worms absolutely cannot resist its power—of course, that’s only if they aren’t too strong. If they’re strong enough to devour even Emperor Realm cultivators, Yang Kai wouldn’t dare act recklessly.

But after hearing Tian Yan’s answer, a bold idea emerged in Yang Kai’s heart.

“With this treasure’s help, it’s worth a try,” Tian Yan said excitedly. “But how confident are you? I brought you here to make this request, but if it’s too dangerous, I’ll just keep guarding them for another few tens of thousands of years.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “I’m quite confident, but I’ll need your help, Senior.”

Tian Yan said, “Whatever you need, just say it.”

Yang Kai said, “My own Soul-Devouring Worms are fine. They’re unruly, but they don’t harm me. But if I take away the sealed Soul-Devouring Worms, they’ll have to enter my Spirit Body. I’d like you to seal them a bit, so I can handle them.”

This was exactly what he was worried about.

To take the Soul-Devouring Worms away, he’d have to put them into his body first.

If they suddenly rebelled, how could Yang Kai resist? Besides, after leaving, he’d need to refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet, and couldn’t afford any major disturbances. If he got caught up fighting the Soul-Devouring Worms, he wouldn’t be able to refine the Imperial Treasure at all.

What Yang Kai didn’t expect was that, after he made this request, Tian Yan looked troubled.

Yang Kai asked in surprise, “Is this difficult for you, Senior?”

Tian Yan glanced at him and nodded slightly.

Yang Kai was shocked, “How can that be? According to you, these Soul-Devouring Worms are already extremely weak, and your cultivation is unfathomable...”

"It’s easy for me to suppress them for a while, but... I can’t leave this world together with you. Without me, the Soul-Devouring Worms would have no restraint."

Yang Kai stared wide-eyed at Tian Yan, pointing at the altar, “But Senior, how did you seal them back then?”

The Soul-Devouring Worms back then were a thousand times stronger than now, yet they were sealed. Why can’t they be sealed now?

Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out.

Tian Yan said, "Shameful to admit, the seal was not my doing."

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise, “Was it the combined effort of everyone back then?”

“You could say that,” Tian Yan nodded. “But there was another force added in. Otherwise, how could they have been sealed for so long?”

“What force?” Yang Kai asked.

Tian Yan didn’t answer, but pointed at the sky.

Yang Kai was confused at first, then suddenly understood, and exclaimed in shock, “The power of heaven and earth! The Mirror Soul?”

Tian Yan explained, “This world possesses its own will and laws. The Soul-Devouring Worms brought ruin to all living things, tearing the world asunder. Such devastation could not be tolerated by the might of heaven and earth. Only when the laws of this world descended did we have a chance to seal the Soul-Devouring Worms! No matter how powerful we were, to the Soul-Devouring Worms, our strength was nothing but food. Only by relying on the power of heaven and earth to form a barrier between us and the worms could we prevent them from devouring everything.”

With this explanation, Yang Kai immediately understood.

The seal itself is actually composed of two layers: one is the will of the Mirror Soul, which is the very power of this world, and the other is the combined strength of those many experts. Only by merging these two forces together could the Soul-Devouring Worms be sealed for tens of thousands of years—neither could be lacking.

“Senior, could you let me communicate with the power of heaven and earth here?” Yang Kai asked, his eyes shining.

Because in that instant, he suddenly thought of Granny You’s earlier plan.

She wanted to seize the Warm Spirit Lotus, mainly to use it as a vessel to carry the Mirror Soul and refine this world.

If Yang Kai could communicate with the Mirror Soul, he might have a chance to do it himself.

If he succeeded, he would become the master of the Divine Roaming Mirror and could enter it to temper his soul at any time in the future.
