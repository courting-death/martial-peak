## Chapter 2561 — Xi Lei

No matter how much the middle-aged man argued and pleaded with the two gatekeeping yao, he couldn’t persuade them to pass on his message.

Left with no other choice, the middle-aged man could only take out a modest gift. Out here in the wilds, he had nothing of real value—just a few Inner Cores he’d harvested from Demonic Beasts he’d slain.

Inner Cores were hard currency among the various races of the Ancient Wilds, as anyone could use them to strengthen themselves. This made the two gatekeepers beam with joy, and after a brief discussion, one yao turned and headed inside, clearly to report.

The man who had once transformed from the Black Python truly understood the saying, “It’s easy to meet the King of Hell, but hard to deal with his little devils.”

He idly chatted with the remaining gatekeeping yao, secretly vowing that once he earned a great reward he’d make them understand the might of this Lord. Daring to show him attitude—he vowed they would have to cough up everything they’d taken.

Before long, the yao who’d gone to report returned, cupped his hands to the middle-aged man, and said, “The Lord is in a good mood today. You’re permitted to meet him—go ahead!”

The middle-aged man thanked him and hurried up the mountain.

The two gatekeeping yao stayed behind, happily playing with the few Inner Cores.

Though no one guided him, the middle-aged man clearly wasn’t a stranger here. He advanced smoothly, passed several checkpoints, and soon reached the summit, where a palace-like building stood. Unlike the refined structures he’d seen elsewhere, this palace exuded a rugged, bold style—massive stones piled together, utterly lacking in beauty. Outside, a giant rhino statue stood with all four hooves thundering forward, as if charging. Its might was unstoppable.

Yao King Xi Lei’s true form was a rhino. No one knew what opportunity he’d encountered, but he’d cultivated to the peak of the Twelfth-Tier, allowing him to command a region of the Ancient Wilds, with over a hundred thousand yao under his command.

Throughout the Ancient Wilds, there were thirty-two such beings, each under the rule of one of the four Divine Spirits. Their territories were divided, and they never encroached on each other.

Each house had eight Yao Kings, all with peak Twelfth-Tier strength. Beneath the Yao Kings were Yao Commanders and Yao Generals, and countless Demonic Beasts below the Twelfth-Tier served under them. The Ancient Wilds were unimaginably dangerous.

Of course, outsiders could never know these things. Everyone said the Ancient Wilds were full of peril and chaos, but deep within, the region had its own way of life.

The middle-aged man arrived at the palace, where the gatekeeping yao checked his identity and let him inside.

It wasn’t that they were careless or negligent—rather, with the middle-aged man’s meager cultivation, he simply posed no threat before the Yao King Xi Lei. The yao had always acted unconventionally, unconcerned with rigid formalities.

If this were a human Sect, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator wanting to meet a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert would never have it so easy.

Inside the palace, seductive music and dancing immediately filled his ears, silk and bamboo swirling around. The middle-aged man was stunned, instinctively thinking he’d entered the wrong place.

But looking up, he saw a burly man seated atop the hall, a Demonic Beast corpse laid out on the table before him. It looked freshly killed, blood still flowing. The burly man held the corpse in both hands, feasting ravenously, blood streaming down his mouth. The sight was terrifying, yet he ate with relish, his eyes flashing red.

The middle-aged man’s legs nearly gave out; he almost fled in panic.

He’d long heard that Yao Kings liked to eat their subordinates raw, thinking it was just rumor. Seeing it today, he realized there was truth behind the tales.

The burly man was undoubtedly the Yao King Xi Lei. The middle-aged man had seen him from afar before, so he recognized him at a glance.

Xi Lei gnawed a few bites of flesh, feeling pleased, and laughed heartily.

On either side of him, two scantily clad women with snow-white bodies exposed served him, doing their utmost to please. Their graceful figures, veiled in gauze, revealed tantalizing scenery, making one’s blood race and breath quicken.

One woman, taking advantage of Xi Lei’s laughter, picked up a grape-like spirit fruit from the table, peeled it, and fed it to him.

Xi Lei roared with delight, pulling the woman into his arms and brazenly indulging himself with her.

Moments later, the woman’s mouth was full of blood, but she wasn’t angry. Instead, she savored it, licking the blood clean with her crimson tongue. Her wanton behavior was shocking.

Watching from below, the middle-aged man’s heart pounded with both fear and longing. He wondered when he’d ever attain Xi Lei’s cultivation, so he too could enjoy such blessings, with beauties throwing themselves at him.

Beneath the table, several fox spirits sang and danced, their slender waists and ample hips dressed in scandalous attire.

The middle-aged man was entranced, his eyes spinning, unable to decide which beauty to focus on.

The woman previously molested by Xi Lei seemed to notice the middle-aged man, curling her lips into a smile. Her eyes, as gentle as flowing water, glanced at him, nearly stealing his soul.

She leaned close to Xi Lei’s ear and whispered something.

Only then did Xi Lei look at the middle-aged man, waving his hand so the fox spirits retreated to the side.

The middle-aged man dared not be disrespectful, quickly walking forward, kneeling, and saying, “Your humble servant Wu Zhui greets the Lord!”

Xi Lei said in a deep voice, “You said earlier you had urgent business to report?”

“Exactly!”

Xi Lei’s eyes narrowed. “Speak—what business is so urgent that you must see me in person? If it’s something trivial, you’d best watch your head!”

Wu Zhui’s face darkened; he dared not hide anything and quickly said, “My Lord, it’s about the Blood Gate!”

“Blood Gate!” Yao King Xi Lei suddenly stood up. All the female yao in the hall covered their red lips and stared wide-eyed at Wu Zhui.

The words ‘Blood Gate’ meant too much to the beings of the Ancient Wilds. Rumor had it that within the Blood Gate lay the secret to awakening bloodline power and evolving into a Divine Spirit.

Even as a peak Twelfth-Tier yao, Xi Lei couldn’t suppress his desire to enter the Blood Gate. If he could truly evolve into a Divine Spirit, it would rewrite the history of the Ancient Wilds, turning the Four Great Saint Venerables into Five.

“Everyone, leave!” Xi Lei waved his hand and shouted, realizing the explosive nature of the news. He was clearly unsettled.

One of the women who’d served him pressed her body against him, acting pitifully, obviously wanting to stay and listen.

Xi Lei turned, his crimson eyes glaring at her.

The woman froze, no longer daring to act up, and quickly retreated, soon disappearing with the others.

“Speak—what’s happened with the Blood Gate?” Only after everyone had left did Xi Lei ask in a deep voice.

Wu Zhui quickly replied, “There’s been an anomaly at the Blood Gate.”

“What kind of anomaly?” Xi Lei asked in shock.

Wu Zhui recounted what he’d seen. Xi Lei listened, his brows furrowed, his expression full of doubt and surprise.

The anomaly was too obvious; his subordinates couldn’t have faked it, and Wu Zhui wasn’t the only one who’d seen it. Anyone near the Blood Gate could confirm it, but what did it mean?

Since the Blood Gate appeared, no one knew how many years it had stood, never changing—just quietly standing atop the mountain. Now, suddenly, red light surged skyward, clearly abnormal.

No matter what, this news was extremely important to any being of the Ancient Wilds.

Xi Lei paced back and forth in the hall, his face uncertain. After a long while, he stopped and said, “You, come with me to see the Saint Venerable. Report everything you’ve seen!”

Saint Venerable!” Wu Zhui nearly bit his tongue.

The Ancient Wilds had four Saint Venerables. Xi Lei served one of them, but these Saint Venerables were as elusive as dragons, rarely seen. Ordinary yao couldn’t meet them, and even the thirty-two Yao Kings couldn’t see them at will.

Wu Zhui never imagined he’d one day meet a Saint Venerable.

Soon, excitement replaced his shock. Since he was to see the Saint Venerable, his news must be important. He might earn great merit and rise to glory.

He didn’t expect much, given his strength, but hoped for some reward. If he could be promoted to Yao General, he’d command some subordinates and guard a mountain, far better than his current lonely, wandering life.

Steadying himself, Wu Zhui cupped his fists and said, “I obey your command, Lord!”

“Let’s go!” Xi Lei was a man of action, his temper as fierce as wind and thunder. Now that he’d decided to see the Saint Venerable, he didn’t hesitate for a moment. With a sweep of yao wind, he swept Wu Zhui up and charged straight out of the grand hall.

“This news—besides you, who else knows?” Xi Lei suddenly asked.

Wu Zhui replied, “Surely I’m not the only one who saw the Blood Gate anomaly, but I hurried to report to you. Who else noticed, I really don’t know.”

Xi Lei nodded, knowing Wu Zhui spoke the truth. The anomaly was so obvious, others must have seen it. Perhaps all thirty-two Yao Kings knew and were rushing to the Saint Venerable, hoping to claim the credit for reporting first.

Wu Zhui’s eyes spun, and he sighed, “But I’m of low status. When I came to seek an audience, the two gatekeepers blocked me for ages, refusing to let me in. In the end, I handed over all my possessions to them before they let me pass!” He looked anxiously at Xi Lei. “I didn’t delay your business, did I?”

Xi Lei’s face darkened, and he shouted, “This is getting more and more outrageous!”

As he finished, he suddenly punched downward.

Crack!

Thunder rumbled, making Wu Zhui’s eardrums ache. A lightning bolt as thick as a barrel struck down like a dragon.

Moments later, a roar echoed, mixed with two abrupt screams.

Wu Zhui looked down to see the mountain gate in ruins, a huge pit in the ground, and the two gatekeeping yao nowhere to be found.
