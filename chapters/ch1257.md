## Chapter 1257 — Spend Everything

Luo Qing was indeed sent by Qian Tong and had been stationed here to keep constant watch for any news of Yang Kai; now that Yang Kai had returned safely, Luo Qing could not help but hurry to relay the information to Qian Tong so that he could rest easy.

Yang Kai did not try to keep him. After a brief exchange of courtesies, he politely saw him off.

After Luo Qing departed, Yang Kai said, “Let’s head back as well. This place has changed so much — you’ll have to fill me in properly. Otherwise, if I accidentally trigger some restriction later, that would be quite troublesome.”

Yang Yan smiled proudly. “Of course we’ll tell you, but rest assured, the restrictions here won’t affect you.”

The group laughed and chatted, surrounding and escorting one another as they made their way deeper into Dragon Lair Mountain.

Outside the cave Yang Kai had used for meditation stood an imposing hall where Yang Yan, Wu Yi, Yu Feng, Chang Qi, and Hao An had gathered. They clustered around a table on which lay a pale, gleaming disc. Within that disc was displayed a complete, detailed map of Dragon Lair Mountain — so precise it was jaw-dropping; every tree and blade of grass could be seen. On the disc dozens of lights, bright or dim, marked activity — some moving, some utterly still — indicating all the living stirrings within Dragon Lair Mountain.

That device was the Tian Luo Compass, a special treasure forged by Yang Yan through combining her refining arts with array formations; it had no offensive or defensive power, only the ability to monitor the come and go of Dragon Lair Mountain.

It was thanks to the Tian Luo Compass that Yang Yan had been able to discover Yang Kai’s return so promptly.

Yang Kai, like a country bumpkin seeing a city’s wonders for the first time, was intensely curious about the Tian Luo Compass, pointing and asking about all manner of details. Yang Yan and the others chattered as they explained, and within less than an hour Yang Kai had gained a full, all-round understanding of the present state of Dragon Lair Mountain.

He was horrified in his heart, and simultaneously shocked at how much Dragon Lair Mountain had changed in the span of a year or so.

Dragon Lair Mountain was now both strong in offense and defense, containing countless astonishing arrays inside. Even Origin Returning Realm warriors who blundered in could not easily escape. According to Yang Yan, to break the arrays of Dragon Lair Mountain would absolutely require the combined strength of at least a dozen Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

What kind of Third Stage Origin Returning Realm masters would suddenly come attacking Dragon Lair Mountain? And in a group of seven or eight no less — they’d have to be out of their minds. Besides, the defensive formations on Dragon Lair Mountain are still in their infancy, far from complete. With sufficient funding, Yang Yan could further enhance their power.

Learning of Dragon Lair Mountain’s transformation, Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh inwardly — bringing Yang Yan back from Tianyun City had been a major win.

She had the ability to turn a place once overlooked into this; if in the future he invited friends and family from across Tongxuan Continent to come and found a sect, she would be able to play an even greater part.

“But the Saint Crystals spent on setting all this up were truly enormous,” Wu Yi said with a troubled expression, complaining to Yang Kai, “The hundred million Saint Crystals you left before leaving have already been completely used up. Even the thirty million that Elder Chang brought back are gone. We’ve purchased vast quantities of materials from Yingyue Hall — at this point, Dragon Lair Mountain is their biggest customer.”

“Thirty million Saint Crystals from the Guest Elder?” Yang Kai raised a brow and looked toward Chang Qi, then suddenly understood — Chang Qi’s supply must have come from the underground veins in Flowing Flame Sandland.

It seemed that since Yang Kai’s departure Chang Qi had been mining there continuously, likely not emerging until the Flowing Flame Sandland closed; otherwise such a staggering amount would not have been possible.

“Even if these Saint Crystal were borrowed from the Guest Elder, they’ll be returned when we get more.”

Chang Qi straightened his face and feigned annoyance. “Yang Kai, you talk as if I’m not family. Never mind how those thirty million Saint Crystals were obtained — if it weren’t for you bringing us there, how would I have found that vein? What fortune allowed me to gain so many Saint Crystals? At least half of them belong to you. Besides, without you, Old Hao and I would probably be homeless right now. Even if we had a fortune in Saint Crystal, my strength would only invite disaster; I couldn’t keep them safe. In the end we’d have to rely on some other power and hand those Saint Crystals over for protection.”

Hao An chimed in beside him, “Yes, Yang Kai, before Flowing Flame Sandland opened you accepted Old Chang and me. You gave us a place to rely on — that alone is enough. Being cast adrift is the saddest thing; for that we are endlessly grateful. These Saint Crystal are just a token from Old Chang; don’t worry over them. We won’t live forever, with no heirs — what would we need so many Saint Crystal for? Dragon Lair Mountain has already become a famed treasure land; many warriors without sects or families wish to come and depend on it but lack the means. We’re already satisfied to have entered here, nothing more needs to be said.”

Yang Kai smiled wryly, knowing that pressing the issue further would dampen spirits. He clasped his fist solemnly and said, “Then I thank you both, Guest Elders, for your kindness.”

Chang Qi laughed heartily. “That’s more like it. The two of us brothers are counting on spending our old age here; to die peacefully in this place would be the best outcome.”

Yang Kai shook his head. “That wish of yours may be hard to fulfill for now. After you break through the Origin Returning Realm your lifespans will naturally extend a bit.”

“Origin Returning Realm…” Chang Qi’s eyes brightened as he thought of the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, but then he sighed sadly. “Even with that thing, Old Hao and I might still not manage to breakthrough.”

“Leave that to me,” Yang Kai said with a grin. “You two spend a few days recuperating and get yourselves into the best possible condition.”

Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a glance and were deeply moved; neither spoke further, secretly brimming with hope.

Funds at Dragon Lair Mountain were tight, so Yang Kai did not hesitate. He had pocketed several million Saint Crystal from the underground vein and immediately handed them to Wu Yi for distribution.

He also took out the refining materials pillaged from the stone chambers in the Earth-Lung Fire Pool and handed them all to Yang Yan.

Yang Yan was delighted at the sight of those materials and happily stored them all in her Spatial Ring.

With that, Dragon Lair Mountain would not need to worry about Saint Crystal or materials for the short term. As long as they didn’t squander funds like Yang Yan had at first, it would sustain them for a long while.

Since Yang Kai had just returned from Flowing Flame Sandland, everyone had much to say but did not want to disturb his rest. After discussing the future development of Dragon Lair Mountain for a time, they each took their leave.

Yang Kai returned to the cave he had previously lived in and sat down to meditate and rest.

That cave had now become a restricted place on Dragon Lair Mountain, jointly arranged by Yang Yan and the Stone Puppet; they hollowed out all the chambers and linked them into a single vast grotto dwelling.

They had also carved many small stone rooms inside for Yang Kai’s exclusive use, while the Haike Family warriors lived in newly built pavilions outside — nearly everyone had quarters they were satisfied with.

The spiritual qi within this place was naturally thicker than elsewhere.

No sooner had Yang Kai settled into the lotus position than the ground twitched, and a small head popped up. Its head was sharply faceted, and its nose and mouth looked oddly stiff, as if carved; only its pair of eyes were lively, bright, and full of expression.

“Stone Puppet!” Yang Kai thought and beckoned; the comical little Stone Puppet immediately burst from underground, using hands and feet to scramble up to Yang Kai’s shoulder and sit there as if very affectionate.

Yang Kai examined the Stone Puppet carefully and realized that after more than a year apart the little thing had changed considerably.

When it was first born its surface had been dull and gray like an ordinary rock, but now its exterior was crystal clear and gleaming, as if naturally sheathed in a sturdy, exquisite suit of armor.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over that armor and was secretly alarmed — he found that the Stone Puppet’s outer layer was incredibly tough; even if he struck with all his strength a single punch might not break through that armor’s protection.

Had the Stone Puppet evolved on its own, or had Yang Yan done something to it?

While Yang Kai pondered, the Stone Puppet seemed to recall something, scratched its head with its small palm, then opened its mouth. One after another Ethereal Crystals began to pour from it as if from a fountain, a truly wondrous sight.

In the blink of an eye a small mountain of them had piled up before Yang Kai — at least a few thousand Ethereal Crystals.

Yang Kai had no idea where the Stone Puppet had been hiding all those crystals. Yang Yan had once said the Stone Puppet’s belly had an innate capacity for storage, allowing it to endlessly swallow and refine ores; this, she had explained, was its instinct and innate divine ability.

“These are the last of what that underground Ethereal Crystal vein produced,” came a pleasant voice from nearby. Yang Yan had appeared in the chamber without anyone noticing.

Yang Kai was unperturbed, as if he had expected her arrival; he inclined his head and stored the Ethereal Crystals into Black Book Space.

“I did keep a third of them, teehee,” Yang Yan said with a mischievous smile as she sat cross-legged in front of Yang Kai.

“What do you need Ethereal Crystals for?”

“They have great uses!” Yang Yan smiled sweetly and coyly kept her secret.

Yang Kai didn’t pry. Since he relied on spatial power, these Ethereal Crystals should be plenty for his needs.

“Why did you call me here? Is there something you can’t bring out easily?” Yang Yan’s eyes flashed with slyness and she hit the point at once.

“Yes, there are a few things, and many I don’t even recognize,” Yang Kai nodded, not in haste to present what he had gathered; instead he gazed at Yang Yan solemnly and asked, “Yang Yan, I’ll ask you honestly: tell me the truth.”

Seeing Yang Kai so serious for the first time, Yang Yan was slightly stunned, then nodded after thinking it over. “Alright.”

“Are you the true owner of this body?” Yang Kai squinted, his eyes deep as if he sought to peer into Yang Yan’s innermost heart.
