## Chapter 681 — Wind Eye

In the dungeon, Ji Meng stared at Yang Kai, her expression somber.

Yang Kai let out a short chuckle. "If he won't believe me easily, how does he intend to win me over? I can agree to any terms now, but the moment I leave this place I can take it all back."

"Exactly, so it requires my effort to make sure you won't break your word," Ji Meng forced a smile. "I'm a disciple of the Divine Cult, Leiguang is my sect; I hope you won't hold it against me."

Yang Kai regarded her coolly.

He had no right to reproach Ji Meng, but from his vantage she had effectively become an enemy.

Yang Kai never showed mercy when dealing with enemies.

Feeling Yang Kai's chill, Ji Meng tasted bitterness and tried to soothe him. "Why must you be so stubborn? I don't know what Elder Duan hopes to gain from you, but as long as you're willing to cooperate he certainly won't treat you unfairly. Imprisoning you but not torturing or killing you already shows his sincerity."

"Plenty of sincerity," Yang Kai sneered.

"Just yield, will you? If you compromise, it benefits you, Elder Duan, and me," Ji Meng pleaded softly.

"Benefits you as well?" Yang Kai's expression turned playful. "Duan Hai promised you a lot of conditions, didn't he?"

Ji Meng didn't answer. Instead she produced a jade vial the color of fresh leaves from her bosom, uncorked it, and a thick white mist visible to the naked eye billowed out.

Ji Meng blew on it gently; the white mist surged into the dungeon, filling the air around Yang Kai.

Yang Kai watched her warily and held his breath, but the mist still seeped through his pores and entered his body.

Faintly, Yang Kai felt something amiss—his blood quickened, his heart beat harder, and a faint, seductive melody even surfaced in his mind.

Ji Meng blushed as she explained, "This is the Seven-Emotions-and-Six-Desires Mist — a potent charm elixir."

"What are you trying to do?" Yang Kai laughed loudly. "You don't intend to force yourself on me, do you?"

The idea of a woman fair as a flower using an aphrodisiac on him was truly a story for the ages.

"Yes. Elder Duan said that if I can bear you a child, you may leave here," Ji Meng said softly, gazing at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he instantly saw through Duan Hai's sinister intent.

Knowing he could not control Yang Kai by ordinary means, Duan Hai had resorted to such despicable tactics.

A tiger may be fierce but it won't eat its young—if Yang Kai had offspring, Duan Hai could hold that over him and need not fear Yang Kai's disobedience.

Although that plan would take a long time to bear fruit, patience was no issue for him.

In only a short while the white mist around Yang Kai had been wholly absorbed by his body. Gradually his eyes reddened, his breathing grew rougher, and his gaze fixed on Ji Meng at the cell door with a fierce, predatory intensity.

Under that stare, Ji Meng could not help but flush with shyness, fidgeting and uneasy, though she restrained herself and waited quietly for the drug to take full effect.

"Do you like me? Would you entrust your life to me?" Yang Kai forced himself to stay clear-headed, coldly looking at Ji Meng.

"I wouldn't say I like you," Ji Meng shook her head slowly. "We're not that familiar, but entrusting my life to you seems a decent choice. You're an alchemist with a bright future; I'm only an ordinary disciple of the Divine Cult — if I want to get ahead I have to rely on the man I choose."

"You're thinking too much," Yang Kai grinned wickedly. "Even if I took you, I wouldn't treat you well—might beat you or scold you every now and then!"

Ji Meng's body trembled and she looked downcast. "Then I'll accept it anyway."

"Absurd." Yang Kai shook his head, and whatever small goodwill he felt toward her evaporated.

"You shouldn't be able to hold out much longer, right?" Ji Meng bit her thin lip and loudly called, "Elder Duan, open the door."

A few points of light flashed on the cell door, the surrounding restraints were instantly broken, and Ji Meng pushed the door open, entered, and leaned over Yang Kai, watching him quietly.

A intoxicating fragrance filled the air; affected by the woman's presence, Yang Kai seemed on the verge of madness, his eyes flashing with nothing but beastly ferocity.

Ji Meng was somewhat frightened but gritted her teeth and endured the discomfort, closed her eyes, and pressed her red lips to Yang Kai's.

Breath disordered, Ji Meng slowly closed her eyes, her cheeks flushed.

Just as their lips were about to meet, Ji Meng suddenly let out a soft cry and hurriedly opened her eyes.

Her neck was clamped in one of Yang Kai's hands; this man's eyes were clear and his breathing steady—there was no sign of the drug's influence now.

He looked at her with disgust and contempt, his expression icy.

"A woman should hold herself to a higher standard," Yang Kai said coldly.

Ji Meng struggled and finally broke free of Yang Kai's grip, stumbling out of the cell, gasping, her face pale with lingering fear, staring at him in disbelief.

"I've come across too many women who cultivate seductive techniques. A mere aphrodisiac hopes to move my heart? Elder Duan, your methods are rather crude," Yang Kai said, gazing into empty space and sneering.

Outside the dungeon, Duan Hai's face darkened as he probed the cell with his Divine Sense.

"Yang Kai, I—" Ji Meng opened her mouth, faltering and embarrassed.

"Get out if you value your life!" Yang Kai looked at her indifferently, utterly cold.

Ji Meng immediately looked desolate; she hesitated and struggled for a long time before covering her face and leaving.

"Senior Brother, this fellow is strange, isn't he? I put a lot of effort into concocting that Seven-Emotions-and-Six-Desires Mist — even a Transcendent shouldn't be able to withstand it. How is he unharmed?" Xu Qi exclaimed in astonishment outside the cell.

Duan Hai's expression was gloomy; he didn't know what to do.

Yang Kai's refusal to budge left him feeling powerless.

"Senior Brother, why not take him to the Wind Eye?" Xu Qi suggested in a low voice.

"Wind Eye?" Duan Hai frowned. "You mean use the Wind Eye's power to blow his soul out?"

"Exactly!" Xu Qi nodded emphatically. "It seems we can't get him by ordinary means, so taking his soul will do. Not to mention his memories about the Coffin-Bearer, even preserving that Divine Sense Fire would be valuable — perhaps some fortunate disciple in our Divine Cult could ingest his Divine Sense Fire…"

Duan Hai's eyes brightened; after considering it he silently agreed the plan was feasible.

With a scheme in mind, Duan Hai did not hesitate and nodded, "So be it. But to use the Wind Eye's power we must report it to the leader first."

"We can report after the deed is done; the leader will be delighted."

"Fine. Prepare what you must, I'll bring the brat there shortly." Duan Hai waved his hand.

Xu Qi nodded heavily, excitement on his face as he took to the sky.

After a moment outside the dungeon, Duan Hai pushed the door open, entered, and without ceremony grabbed Yang Kai and lifted him up.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, eyes closed as if resting.

"Honored Guest Yang, since you won't accept a favor, don't blame me for showing no mercy," Duan Hai said as he flew toward the location of the Wind Eye.

Yang Kai cracked a crooked smile. "Elder Duan, where is it you intend to take me?"

"The Leiguang Divine Cult has several founding strongholds. What we're heading to is one of them, a Wind Eye that contains the power of the wind. Many disciples who cultivate wind-affinity techniques and martial skills choose to train there to perceive the mysteries of wind. Besides it, we have a Thunder Eye that is similar, but even I dare not draw too close — that force is beyond what mortals can withstand. Within the Wind Eye, even a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivator's soul will be blown apart."

Yang Kai's expression stiffened as he realized the danger.

"You can still change your mind. If you unite with Ji Meng and bear a child, I'll acknowledge you as one of our Divine Cult, and you'll be treated with honor thereafter; you won't be slighted in the least," Duan Hai made one final attempt to persuade him. "What do you say?"

"No!" Yang Kai shook his head, secretly drawing in a breath as he weighed whether now was the time to unleash Demon God Transformation and break free in one move, then seize the chance to escape.

But on enemy ground his confidence in success was not high; failure would leave him without any further opportunities.

While he hesitated, Yang Kai suddenly sensed an influx of lively, drifting energy around him.

It was the energy of wind.

More intense and vast than he'd ever felt before; sharp pain flared again along his shoulder blades, yet faintly mingled with a thrill of exhilaration that sent a spark of joy through him.

Yang Kai's expression changed; he suppressed the rising thoughts and focused his gaze toward the distance.

Far off in the void, a huge, clearly visible vortex slowly turned, the lively, drifting wind energy suffusing the space — the closer one drew, the more abundant the wind's power became.

"Quite spectacular, isn't it?" Duan Hai's face showed a hint of pride. "Precisely because of the Wind Eye and the Thunder Eye, our Leiguang Divine Cult settled roots here. This place is considered forbidden within the Cult; except for certain permitted disciples, no one may set foot here. Those who train near it advance with half the effort and gain great enhancement."

Yang Kai nodded inwardly; such a celestial anomaly was indeed magnificent. It was not man-made but caused by coincidental factors allowing the world's might to pour forth here, year after year without cease.

As they spoke, the two rapidly approached.

Xu Qi had been waiting early; when he saw Duan Hai bring Yang Kai over he was thrilled and said, "The disciples have all been dispersed. Senior Brother, you may begin."

Duan Hai nodded slowly, staring at Yang Kai. "Honored Guest Yang, you have one last choice; once you enter the Wind Eye I can no longer guarantee your safety."

"No need to say more." Yang Kai smiled.

"Courting death!" Xu Qi snorted coldly.

Duan Hai took a deep breath. "Very well, then go."

Saying that, he sped toward the Wind Eye with Yang Kai. Soon they neared its location. Even someone as strong as Duan Hai had to exert True Yuan to withstand the Wind Eye's destructive pull and tearing force.
