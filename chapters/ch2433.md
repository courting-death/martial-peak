## Chapter 2433 — Testing the Waters

The Origin Power here was so thin that Yang Kai didn’t think much of it. After all, he already possessed the complete Origin Power of Dark Star. But seeing these two act so arrogant and loud right from the start made Yang Kai a bit annoyed.

After a moment's thought, he didn’t lose his temper; instead, he cupped his fists and said, “Friends, I have a few things I’d like to ask. Would you be willing to answer?”

The man who spoke first glanced at Yang Kai with a sidelong glance and snorted coldly, “What is it?”

Yang Kai said, “Did you come here because your Star Seal resonated with the Origin Power in this place?”

Hearing this, the man looked at Yang Kai in surprise and sneered, “Aren’t you here for the same reason?”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Of course I am.”

So the Star Seal really could sense the power of the Stellar Origin. He had suspected as much before, but since no one had confirmed it, he hadn’t been sure. Now, after hearing this man’s answer, Yang Kai immediately understood: the Star Seal on the back of his hand wasn’t just a pass to enter the Shattered Star Sea—there seemed to be other uses for it here.

The man snapped angrily, “If you’re here for the same reason, why bother asking? You’re being ridiculous!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Just making conversation. Why get so worked up? Anger is bad for your health. By the way, do you know how long the Shattered Star Sea stays open from start to finish?”

As soon as he said this, both men looked at Yang Kai with strange expressions, as if they’d realized something. One of them said, “Looks like you don’t know anything about this place.”

Yang Kai straightened his expression and cupped his fists, “Please enlighten me!”

He really did know nothing about the Shattered Star Sea, and there was nothing to hide about it. While he could figure some things out on his own, it was much faster to get information from others.

Although these two didn’t seem like good people, that didn’t stop Yang Kai from trying to get information out of them.

The other man burst out laughing. “Senior Brother, there’s actually someone who came to the Shattered Star Sea without knowing anything! Didn’t his sect elders teach him anything?”

He looked utterly delighted, as if he’d just heard the funniest joke in the world.

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “So what if I don’t have any sect elders? Is that funny to you?”

The man’s smile faded. “Not really funny, just surprising that someone without any sect elders could make it here.”

“You still haven’t answered my question,” Yang Kai pressed.

“And what do I get for answering?” the other man snorted.

Yang Kai said, “How about I let you two have the Origin Power here?” He paused, then added, “I was here first, but as long as you answer my questions, I’ll leave right away and you can take all the Origin Power you want. I won’t interfere!”

The Junior Brother snapped, “Who would dare snatch the Origin Power my Senior Brother and I have set our sights on? We don’t need your charity!”

But the Senior Brother waved his hand and said, “Since you’re being so reasonable, we’ll gladly accept.”

The Junior Brother curled his lip in displeasure.

The Senior Brother continued, “No one knows exactly how long the Shattered Star Sea stays open after it’s activated, and it’s not a fixed period. According to the records, every time the Shattered Star Sea opens, it lasts at least two years and up to ten years! And when it ends, there’s no warning at all. Once the secret realm closes, every cultivator inside will be expelled, no matter where they are! Does that answer satisfy you?”

“So it’s not a fixed time?” Yang Kai was a bit surprised, but this wasn’t the first time he’d encountered something like this, so he quickly accepted it.

Still, based on what this man said, the Shattered Star Sea would be open for at least two years each time. In other words, he had at least a year to train here, which wasn’t bad.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Thank you! Farewell!”

He still had many things he didn’t understand, but these two weren’t the type to talk. If he kept asking, they might not tell the truth. Rather than be misled, it was better to figure things out himself or wait until he met someone he knew.

As he spoke, Yang Kai turned and flew up into the sky.

But just as he turned, the Senior Brother who had answered his question suddenly flashed with a cold light in his eyes. His wrist flicked, and a jet-black beam shot out, streaking toward Yang Kai’s back in a split second.

It looked like Yang Kai was about to be pierced through the chest by that black light, but at the critical moment, he suddenly twisted his body and narrowly dodged the sneak attack.

In the next instant, Yang Kai hovered in midair, looking down coldly and said calmly, “What is the meaning of this?”

The Senior Brother was shocked and couldn’t help but exclaim, “He actually dodged it? How is that possible?”

He had attacked without any warning and hadn’t revealed the slightest killing intent beforehand. By all rights, Yang Kai shouldn’t have noticed anything, but in reality, Yang Kai seemed to have some kind of foresight and dodged at the very instant the attack arrived.

This guy isn’t an easy target! the Senior Brother thought to himself.

His Junior Brother, however, still looked down on Yang Kai and sneered, “Isn’t it obvious what this means? Why do you keep asking questions you already know the answer to, kid?”

“You two want to kill me?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and said sadly, “We’re strangers, I’ve never wronged you, and I even offered you the Origin Power here. I had no intention of fighting, but you still tried to kill me? You’ve really broken my heart. Is there no basic trust left between people?”

The Senior Brother’s mouth twitched. “If you don’t want to die, just leave your right hand behind and get lost.”

The Junior Brother nodded in agreement, “That’s right. If you want to live, cut off your right hand! My Senior Brother and I will spare your life. Otherwise, this time next year will be the anniversary of your death!”

Yang Kai frowned, “Why do you want my right hand? Don’t you have hands of your own?”

The Junior Brother sneered, “You think your right hand is so special? We don’t want your hand—we want the Star Seal on the back of it!”

“We’re already inside the Shattered Star Sea. What’s the point of taking my Star Seal?” Yang Kai still looked confused.

“You really don’t know anything!” The Junior Brother laughed, “My Senior Brother and I will do you a favor and give you a free tip: in the Shattered Star Sea, stealing other people’s Star Seals is completely normal. As for why and what the benefits are… heh, you’ll find out soon enough.”

The Senior Brother’s face darkened. “You managed to dodge my attack, so you must be skilled. But do you really think you can beat the two of us together? If you don’t want to die, cooperate. Otherwise, after we kill you, we’ll just take your Star Seal anyway!”

Yang Kai stroked his chin and said calmly, “You two are making me curious. What’s so great about stealing someone else’s Star Seal? I’m so curious, I almost want to kill you both!”

“Kill us?” The Junior Brother’s eyes bulged, then he burst out laughing, pointing at Yang Kai and saying to the other man, “Senior Brother, did you hear what he just said? He actually said he wants to kill us! Is this kid still dreaming?”

The Senior Brother snorted, “Since this friend refuses a toast and insists on drinking a forfeit, there’s no need to be polite. Let’s take him together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Junior Brother’s laughter stopped abruptly, his face turning vicious. The two of them simultaneously circulated their Origin Qi, ready to attack.

But Yang Kai suddenly formed a seal with both hands, and a strange, unfathomable Law Power surged out, instantly enveloping the two brothers.

The two, just about to attack, suddenly shivered all over. A primal sense of danger welled up in their hearts, and it was as if they could hear death calling in their ears. Their clothes were instantly drenched in sweat.

They wanted to look up and see what kind of secret technique Yang Kai was using, but to their horror, their minds froze in that instant, and their bodies couldn’t move at all. Everything around them became utterly silent—even time itself seemed to stop, and everything was frozen in that moment.

A low, chilling murmur sounded in their ears, so cold it made their hands and feet go numb.

“The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream—Years Like a Shuttle Seal!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Kai struck out with his palm from afar. The mysterious seal exploded forth, and before the two brothers could react, it landed directly on them.

Two muffled groans rang out at the same time. The Power of Time crazily invaded the two brothers’ bodies, draining away all their vitality in an instant.

Visibly, their black hair turned white at a shocking speed, then fell out. Their skin wrinkled, and their once healthy, robust bodies turned into decrepit old men within ten breaths, tottering and barely able to stand.

It was as if hundreds or thousands of years had swept over them, leaving only deep scars behind.

Strangest of all, the two remained frozen in that dazed posture, completely unaware of their own transformation, their eyes empty.

Only after a moment did they suddenly come to their senses and collapse to the ground together.

“S-Senior Brother…” The Junior Brother, who had once looked rather handsome, now looked no different from an old man with one foot in the grave. His eyes were sunken, and he stared in terror at the barely recognizable Senior Brother beside him, mumbling through toothless gums, “What happened to you?”

“Junior Brother, you…” The Senior Brother was also horrified, looking at his Junior Brother with the same gaze.

Only then did the Junior Brother belatedly touch his own face, then hold his withered hands up before his eyes. He stared blankly for a while, then let out a loud scream.

“What… what did you do to us?” The Senior Brother struggled to lift his head and looked up at the sky, his cloudy eyes full of terror and despair.

He had never seen anything so bizarre—hadn’t even heard of it before. With just one move, he and his Junior Brother were rendered powerless, turned into this state. The strength of this young man was simply the greatest he’d ever seen.
