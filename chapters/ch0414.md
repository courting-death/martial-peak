## Chapter 414 — No One Cares

In front of the South Gate, seven groups of people suddenly and mysteriously appeared, surging forth so that the martial artists of the forces gathered there were all pushed back by an invisible force.

Once everyone regained their footing and looked forward in shock, instead of anger, they were filled with excitement and joy.

The heads of the Seven Great Families had appeared together!

These great figures were not usually seen, so coming to Zhongdu this time had truly been worth it — just seeing these seven alone was worth the round-trip ticket.

For a moment, many martial artists looked on with admiration and reverence at the seven.

However, the seven themselves were all staring into Zhongdu City, their faces showing interest. The moment they stepped out of Zhongdu was also the moment to test the charisma of the Yang Family’s young masters. Naturally, they wanted to see which of the young masters the forces waiting outside the South Gate would align with.

With the sound of racing hooves, eight Treading Cloud Steeds appeared one after another.

Eight young masters of the Yang Family participating in the succession war made their grand entrance.

Meng Shanyi of the Meng Family hurried to meet Yang Wei with a smile, clasping his fists in salute, “Young Master Wei.”

“Sorry to keep you waiting!” Yang Wei nodded calmly. It was no surprise to see such close intimacy now, as news of their alliance had spread long ago.

Ye Xinrou of the Ye Family stepped forward gracefully, a faint blush on her lovely face. At the peak of her youth with skin as fair as snow and a supple, graceful figure, she smiled sweetly with a touch of coquettishness. “Young Master Zhao.”

Yang Zhao laughed heartily, extending a large hand warmly, “Come aboard!”

Ye Xinrou nodded lightly, grabbed Yang Zhao’s hand, leapt up, and gracefully seated herself on the Treading Cloud Steed.

The heads of the other six great families shot a meaningful glance at Ye Kuangren, head of the Ye Family.

Under so many eyes, such intimate behavior between a man and a woman did not look like a mere alliance. There might be some deeper, hidden secrets.

Ye Kuangren remained detached and showed no intention of reproaching his daughter’s boldness; he appeared to have long been in the know.

Meanwhile, Gao Rangfeng and Yang Kang were talking amiably, and Kang Zhan and Yang Ying exchanged smiles.

The four great families had already declared their positions, and their young masters were in high spirits.

This was truly the stage of youth.

“Old Qiu, hasn’t your Qiu Family made a choice yet?” Huo Zheng looked on eagerly, inwardly anxious like a cat on hot bricks. Yet, scanning the crowd, he saw none of his worthless son and knew he was surely off somewhere indulging himself. Anger boiled inside him, but then he noticed Qiu Shoucheng standing seemingly lonely beside him, and he felt a pang of sympathy.

“Hasn’t the choice been made?” Qiu Shoucheng smiled slightly.

Huo Zheng was stunned. Looking again, he suddenly saw that Qiu Ziru had already joined with the sixth young master Yang Shen, who beamed with delight and spoke politely to Qiu Ziru.

Huo Zheng was quite surprised. “Eh, Old Qiu, is your son leading the Qiu Family’s succession bid this time? What about Little Mengmeng?”

Others also looked at Qiu Shoucheng with puzzled expressions.

Though Qiu Shoucheng had a son and a daughter, there was a great rift between them. Qiu Yimeng’s name had already spread throughout Zhongdu as the second-ranked figure among the young generation. Everyone had assumed she would lead this succession war, but unexpectedly, it was Qiu Ziru who showed up instead.

“He’s grown up; he has to be tempered,” Qiu Shoucheng chuckled, “The succession war is a rare opportunity.”

Huo Zheng sneered, “Old Qiu, no offense, but my son’s a hopeless fool. Your son might be better, but not by much. Honestly, you should just pass the family head position to your daughter. If you hand it to your son, the Qiu Family is doomed.”

Qiu Shoucheng snorted coldly, “When I act, I don’t need your interference!”

Huo Zheng rolled his eyes, “Unappreciative.”

The five great families had already declared, and the observing forces could no longer wait. One hurried forward to Yang Wei, clasping his fists, “I am Xuan Li, the chief disciple of the Three Saints Sect. I wish to serve the Eldest Young Master as a loyal servant.”

Yang Wei glanced at him and nodded lightly. “Agreed.”

Xuan Li was instantly overjoyed and quickly took a place behind Yang Wei.

With Xuan Li leading, the young representatives of various forces quickly stepped forward to pledge allegiance to the Yang Family’s already chosen young masters.

The scene grew exceedingly lively. Looking across the crowd, it was clear the most support went to the eldest Yang Wei and the second Yang Zhao. Every time someone came forward, Yang Wei would lightly nod in approval, while Yang Zhao greeted each with a warm smile.

The two brothers' differing personalities were fully revealed at this moment.

Besides these two, the fifth, sixth, and seventh sons—Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying—also quickly gathered considerable support within moments.

Yet, before the third, eighth, and youngest, Yang Kai, there was silence—no one came.

The difference in their networks and charisma was clear at a glance.

Yang Tie and Yang Quan exchanged bitter smiles, knowing their chances in this succession war were slim.

“Younger Brother Kai, don’t mind it,” Yang Tie suddenly said softly.

“Yeah,” Yang Quan nodded, “You’re better off than us. At least you have two Blood Servants and a first-rate force from your mother’s family backing you. We…” His voice trailed off with unhidden melancholy and helplessness—the two only had one or no Blood Servants supporting them.

“I don’t care,” Yang Kai shook his head gently, showing no hint of disappointment. His eyes, however, remained locked on two of the dozen or so Blood Servants standing opposite.

Among the Blood Servants selected by the Yang Family young masters to participate in the succession war, Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu stood pale and unwell in the center. Any astute observer could see these two were badly injured and unsteady. Without treatment and rest, they would either die or become crippled.

Yet, they stood with determined expressions and unbending bodies.

Only when Yang Kai looked their way did they straighten their posture slightly.

Yang Kai’s gaze was not on these two but on another young man and woman: Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Both forced bitter smiles at Yang Kai. They didn’t want to be enemies, but having been selected by the Yang Family young masters from the Blood Servants Hall, they were destined to become foes in this succession war.

However, Yang Kai did not yet know which young master they followed.

He grinned wide at them, and the two couldn’t help but feel a chill down their spines. Whenever the young master smiled like this, it usually meant he was about to do something mischievous.

They truly did not want to oppose him!

Though much stronger than him, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian still felt a deep respect for Yang Kai from their hearts.

Before long, the forces had been divided among the five promising young masters of the Yang Family.

Yang Tie and Yang Quan’s expressions grew ever more dejected.

The heads of the Seven Great Families whispered among themselves in evaluation of the Yang Family young masters, but Qiu Shoucheng remained puzzled and unsettled.

Since the night he heard his daughter’s appraisal of Yang Kai, he had taken a special interest in the young man. Today, upon watching him carefully, he was surprised to see that though Yang Kai had no followers from any forces, his expression never faltered; rather, his bright eyes brimmed with absolute confidence.

Qiu Shoucheng felt amazed.

He also noticed the exchange of glances between Yang Kai and Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, and his confusion deepened.

A Yang Family young master without support was like a tiger without claws. What waves could he possibly make in this succession war? Yet, in such desperate circumstances, he never showed embarrassment but seemed remarkably composed, as if fully confident.

Furthermore, why did those two formidable Blood Servants at the Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage appear somewhat fearful of him?

Qiu Shoucheng clicked his tongue in curiosity and slightly raised his estimation of Yang Kai.

Perhaps he truly had hidden strength, but absolutely not enough to win the succession.

From the current situation alone, it was clear he had no right to participate in the final battle.

After the forces were divided, the Yang Family young masters naturally prepared to set off for the battlefield city.

As Yang Wei tightened the reins ready to lead the way, a knock-knock sound came steadily from a distance.

Outside the South Gate, where silence reigned and even the fall of a pin could be heard, the knocking echoed unnervingly sharp and loud.

Following the sound, everyone turned their heads to look and saw a Treading Cloud Steed approaching with an unruly smile on its rider’s face. A young man sat cross-armed on the steed, casually surveying the crowd’s beauties with flickering, unusual glimmers in his eyes, radiating the aura of a reckless, spoilt scion.

Any woman caught in his gaze felt as if her clothes had been stripped away, a chill running through her.

Huo Zheng’s face, the head of the Huo Family, instantly turned deathly pale.

For the rider was none other than his worthless son, Huo Xingchen.

From a short distance, Yang Kai and Huo Xingchen exchanged glances. The latter’s face showed disdain and provocation, a slight curl at the corner of his mouth.

That night, Huo Xingchen led the Xuan Guang Association to attack the Bamboo Segment Gang. Yang Kai arrived to aid and captured Huo Xingchen, creating an enmity. Later, he extorted a large sum from Huo Xingchen, forcing him to give up the Xuan Guang Association. Meeting again now, Huo Xingchen naturally bore no good will toward him.

“I didn’t come late, did I?” Huo Xingchen stopped before the crowd, smiling, sweeping a glance around, and nodded. “Good, looks like I arrived just in time!”
