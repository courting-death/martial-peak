## Chapter 2127 — Claimed by the Strong

After a short while, two beams of light flashed by and landed not far in front of Yang Kai, revealing the figures of two people.

The one on the left wore robes as white as snow, with star-like eyes and sword-shaped brows, exuding an extraordinary aura. His entire body radiated a sharp energy, like an unsheathed sword.

This man possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, causing Yang Kai to glance at him a few more times.

The man's aura gave Yang Kai a faint sense of pressure, as if that sharp energy could slice skin at a distance, leaving him slightly shocked.

He thought to himself that, as expected of an elite disciple from a great Sect, even the aura he unconsciously released was not something an ordinary Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm could achieve.

The person on the right had a wide mouth and broad nose, a burly figure, wearing only a short shirt and shorts. His thick calves and arms were covered in black hair.

At first glance, this man looked like a standing gorilla, giving a strong visual impact!

That man had reached the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

After the two landed, they both turned their gazes toward Yang Kai.

"Yang Kai of Fenglin City greets you both!" Yang Kai cupped his fists. "May I ask how I should address you?"

The man in white remained cold and indifferent, as if he hadn't heard Yang Kai speak at all. Instead, the burly, gorilla-like man suddenly shouted, "Hey, are you that Yang Kai?"

Yang Kai was inwardly startled, but he kept a straight face and nodded. “If no one else in your Shrine bears this name, then yes—I'm the one.”

"Good!" The burly man grinned fiercely, scanning Yang Kai up and down like he was sizing up prey, and said in a buzzing voice, "So you're the brat who snatched my spot to enter the secret realm. Looks like you're tired of living."

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that these two were not companions sent to escort him to the secret realm, but rather... troublemakers.

He knit his brows and said, “Friend, you misunderstand. If I explain this on my own, it gets a bit complicated. Why not ask Elder Gao? I think she'll give you a satisfactory answer."

"Hmph. No need to ask anything." The burly man snorted, "Elder Gao already told me. She said my spot would be canceled and given to you. I refuse! I earned that spot through the Sect's martial trials, fighting bloody battles. Why should you take it just by showing up?"

"Sect martial trials?" Yang Kai frowned.

At that moment, the white-clothed man, who hadn't spoken, suddenly said, "Three months ago, our Shrine disciples had an internal Sect competition. Only the top twenty could qualify to enter the Four Seasons Land. Xue Yi... he ranked fifteenth!"

"So you're Brother Xue!" Yang Kai finally learned the burly man's name, then curiously looked at the man in white. "And how should I address you?"

"This is Senior Brother Xiao Baiyi!" Xue Yi snorted.

"I'm curious, Brother Xiao, what was your rank in the Sect martial trials..." Yang Kai probed.

"Senior Brother Xiao was second!" Xue Yi said proudly, then suddenly barked, "Brat, don't try to change the subject. Today, I brought Senior Brother Xiao with me to tell you: if you want to snatch my spot, you have to see if I agree! Don't think Elder Gao backing you means you can do whatever you want. Watch out or I'll crush your skull!"

As he spoke, he spread his fan-like hand and squeezed it fiercely, threatening Yang Kai viciously.

Yang Kai smiled and said, "So what would it take for Brother Xue to agree to give up the spot?"

"Simple!" Xiao Baiyi said coolly, "All our spots were earned through the Sect's martial trials. In other words, claimed by the strong. If you can defeat Junior Brother Xue, the spot is rightfully yours. I doubt anyone would object."

"That's right!" Xue Yi nodded vigorously, "Defeat me, or... get defeated by me. Whoever survives gets the spot!"

"Isn't that a bit much?" Yang Kai looked hesitant.

Their bloodthirsty talk made him uneasy. If Xue Yi killed him, it wouldn't matter much, but if he killed Xue Yi, it would cause a huge uproar.

"Nothing wrong with it." Xiao Baiyi remained cold. "Or... are you scared?"

"Why provoke me, Brother Xiao?" Yang Kai gave a wry smile.

"Heh, if you're really scared, you can still leave Qingyang Mountain Range now. With your weak First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, I'm honestly worried I might accidentally kill you!" Xue Yi laughed arrogantly.

Yang Kai sighed, "I understand your intentions."

He hadn't expected that just trying to get a spot to enter the Four Seasons Land would lead to such trouble. If possible, he naturally didn't want to clash with the martial artists of Qingyang Shrine.

But seeing Xue Yi so aggressive, even if he backed down, it wouldn't solve anything.

After all, he had promised Qin Chaoyang and even used the Jade Maiden Beggar Token left by a master. He had no choice but to go to the Four Seasons Land.

"Since you two are so enthusiastic... then I won't refuse. Brother Xiao, please witness the process and outcome!"

"Rest assured." Xiao Baiyi was a bit surprised that Yang Kai agreed. He had thought that coming with Xue Yi and threatening him would scare him off, but things turned out differently...

He said calmly, "I came at Junior Brother Xue's request to witness this. No matter who wins or loses, or if you end up in danger, I won't interfere."

"Brother Xiao seems trustworthy." Yang Kai grinned, "I'll leave it to you then."

"Just take care not to die too easily, or it'll reflect badly on our Shrine's reputation." Xiao Baiyi's eyes narrowed slightly.

...

In the void, two graceful figures hid nearby, quietly watching below.

Chen Qian said, "This fellow Yang... he's got guts. Facing Xue Yi, who's a whole Stage higher, and not showing any fear."

"Courage has nothing to do with strength!" Gao Xueting replied calmly.

As she spoke, she suddenly glanced up at the void, curled her lips, and snorted, "Not minding your own business! Even such a trivial matter draws a crowd—how improper!"

Chen Qian, hearing this, also looked over and smiled, "The Hall Master must be bored..."

Just then, Wen Zishan's voice reached both women: "Beauties, are you interested in joining this Hall Master for a drink? I've prepared something special..."

"No interest!"

"Not going!"

The two women refused before he could finish, leaving no room for negotiation.

Wen Zishan was stunned, looking utterly heartbroken, and sighed, "Wine with no company—life is ten parts disappointment..."

"Behave yourself, or I'll come flip your table!" Gao Xueting glared coldly.

Wen Zishan slapped his face in despair, "How did I raise you to be so cold... you're nothing like me!"

Gao Xueting snorted, "Are you my father or something? Why should I be like you?"

Wen Zishan was left speechless.

Gao Xueting’s lips quirked, a rare, hidden smile blooming at the corner of her mouth.

...

"Senior Brother Xiao, he agreed to fight me, right?" Xue Yi turned to ask.

"He agreed!" Xiao Baiyi nodded.

"Then I can make my move?" Xue Yi asked again.

He didn't wait for Xiao Baiyi's answer. As soon as he spoke, he charged straight at Yang Kai, swinging his fist at him.

Even with Yang Kai’s lightning-quick reflexes, he hadn't expected the dull-looking, gorilla-like man to be so crafty. In that brief lapse, the man's fist was already smashing toward his face.

The force of the punch was wild, with a powerful destructive energy swirling around it, focused to a point and gleaming coldly.

Startled, Yang Kai could only tap his feet and retreat lightly.

Xue Yi’s hulking frame moved with a speed that belied its size, clinging to Yang Kai like maggots to bone, keeping almost no distance between them. He bared a savage grin and snarled, “Brat, if you live through this, learn to mind yourself in the future!”

With that, his fist smashed into Yang Kai's face.

With a thunderous crash, violent power erupted, sending Yang Kai flying uncontrollably backward, crashing into the palace wall and smashing a huge hole in it.

Rumble...

A series of crashes echoed from inside the palace, as if Yang Kai had smashed through several walls. After a while, the commotion finally subsided.

"Boring!" Xue Yi shook his massive fist, snorted, and didn't even glance in Yang Kai's direction. "Senior Brother Xiao, let's go!"

Xiao Baiyi remained motionless, squinting ahead, his gaze sharp enough to pierce the void.

Suddenly, his expression changed and he said in a low voice, "It's not over yet..."

"Hm?" Xue Yi turned abruptly.

From the hole in the broken wall, a man slowly walked out, rubbing his arms and grimacing in pain.

"He blocked it... just in time!" Wen Zishan squinted at the scene below, praising, "Nice reaction!"

In that instant, Wen Zishan clearly saw Yang Kai suddenly cross his arms in front of himself.

Xue Yi's earth-shattering blow landed directly on Yang Kai's crossed arms, not his head. Otherwise, with such brute force, Yang Kai would have either had his skull crushed or been knocked out cold.

"This brat Yang's body is formidable...!" Gao Xueting's beautiful eyes narrowed, a sharp light flickering within.

Chen Qian said, "I remember Xue Yi trained in the Diamond Heavenly King Body, right?"

Gao Xueting nodded, "He started cultivating it back in the Void King Realm. If I'm not mistaken, he should be at the Sixth Stage now. In terms of physical strength, among all Dao Origin Realm disciples, except for that one person, he's the very best."

"Taking Xue Yi's blow head-on and looking unharmed, this fellow Yang must have trained in a Body-Tempering Cultivation Method too!" Chen Qian mused.
