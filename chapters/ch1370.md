## Chapter 1370 — Love of Beauty

As for Jubao Tower deliberately sending an invitation to him, that was not hard to explain.

After all, at that auction a few years ago the finale items had all been sent by him; others may not know that intelligence, but Jubao Tower certainly should. Besides, given Dragon Lair Mountain's present display of wealth, it fully qualified to participate in this auction.

“This invitation was personally entrusted by Master Yan Pei to Elder Qian, who ordered me to forward it,” Wei Guchang chuckled.

Hearing Yan Pei's name, Yang Kai immediately recalled an old face like black coal, then said, “Master Yan specifically asked you to deliver the invitation—it's not just a mere invite, is it? There's something else.”

Wei Guchang rubbed his nose and shook his head with a bitter smile. “Xuan'er, I told you—Brother Yang is incredibly sharp. Even if we didn't mention it, he'd realize it.”

Xuan'er at his side couldn't help but smile wryly.

Yang Kai looked at Wei Guchang and said, “Just say it straight, Brother Wei. We're not strangers.”

After a moment's thought, Wei Guchang nodded. “Master Yan did indeed have a matter for me to convey, but I originally didn't want to bring it up. Since Brother Yang insists, I won't beat around the bush: Master Yan hopes you can provide him with several finale auction pieces.”

“Finale auction pieces?” Yang Kai was taken aback and scoffed, “What does he think I am, an inexhaustible Treasure Vault? Where would I get so many finale items?”

Wei Guchang shrugged helplessly; it truly was Master Yan's original request. If Elder Qian and Master Yan weren't on good terms, he wouldn't have come as the messenger. Hearing Yang Kai, he laughed it off, “Then I'll go back and tell Elder Qian that there are no treasures from this side.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. To be fair, he did have plenty of treasures; taking them out to auction could definitely control the scene. Even if not, Yang Yan could now forge a few Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures in time.

With the Imperial Garden emerging, Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures would surely be in hot demand.

But Yang Kai knew well that a big tree catches the wind; the last time he carelessly displayed several items, many forces from Dark Star scrambled desperately. If he revealed more now, those with designs on them would surely take notice.

He wouldn’t even allow Yang Yan to sell Secret Treasures on her own—how could he possibly commit such a foolish act as flaunting his wealth?

“Still, Brother Yang, it's worth going to see the auction. You might spot something you like,” Wei Guchang laughed. “The back pages of your invitation show some of the items to be auctioned this time.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai's interest was piqued. He flipped to the last pages and, sure enough, found the images Wei Guchang mentioned: exquisite illustrations and brief descriptions of the items to be auctioned.

There were fine Secret Treasures, pills that could enhance one's cultivation, mighty secret techniques, and rare, hard-to-find materials.

Yang Kai browsed them one by one, secretly impressed by Jubao Tower's selection. This faction indeed had its own channels—after only a few years since the last auction they had gathered so many good things; he wondered where they found them.

But though the items were fine, they did not appeal to Yang Kai—not because of rank, but because even if he bought them they would be useless to him. He already had no shortage of Secret Treasures, pills, or techniques, so he was naturally uninterested in the auction.

Yet when he turned to the final page, his expression suddenly froze. Staring at an image on that page, a flash of surprise passed through his eyes, and then joy erupted.

That momentary change, though quick, did not escape those present. Wei Guchang chuckled, “Looks like Brother Yang really found something he needed.”

“I did find something—didn't expect Jubao Tower could even bring something like this!” Yang Kai said with astonishment. In front of these people he had no need to hide; he carefully put the invitation away and asked, “When does the auction start?”

“In a month, at the same place as last time. Brother Yang, will you go?”

“Such a grand event must not be missed!” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Then I shall await your arrival,” Wei Guchang said with pleasure. He intended to attend the auction as well; going with a like-minded friend would make it far less dull.

After that, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er chatted with Yang Kai for quite a while.

Since their last seclusion they hadn't seen one another for years, and Yang Kai had already reached the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm—soon he would likely break into the Origin Returning Realm. Wei Guchang and Xuan'er had just gone through that themselves and generously shared their experiences, which greatly benefited Yang Kai and Daiyuan listening nearby.

Daiyuan, especially, listened with intense focus, and when she didn't understand something she would interject a question. The Senior Brother and Sister explained patiently, showing no impatience.

After half a day, the two took their leave. Before departing, Xuan'er invited Daiyuan to visit Yingyue Hall; she accepted at once.

Once the two left for Yingyue Hall, Yang Kai turned and looked at Daiyuan with a smile.

She glared at him, and her ugly face suddenly twisted and changed—then, in the next moment, her true face was revealed to Yang Kai.

Skin like congealed cream, brows like the moon, eyes like stars, a fine nose and red lips—calling her face a world-stunning beauty would not be an exaggeration.

The abrupt transformation left Yang Kai momentarily stunned. Daiyuan tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, full of grace, and laughed softly, “Junior Brother Yang, don't you find this appearance more pleasing?”

Yang Kai wore a serious expression, shaking his head as he said, “A person’s appearance is nothing but an outer shell—beauty or ugliness are things one is born with, gifts from one’s parents. What truly matters is what lies within.”

Daiyuan seemed to agree and was about to nod when Yang Kai changed tack: “Still, this look is indeed easier on the eyes—after all, everyone has a love of beauty.”

Daiyuan was furious; she glared at him so fiercely that her peerless beauty vanished, replaced by the ugly, pockmarked, yellow-tinged face from before.

Moments earlier she had almost believed Yang Kai and felt moved; she hadn't expected that feeling to be snuffed out so instantly by him.

Yang Kai cleared his throat, realizing he'd angered her, and hastily changed the subject, “By the way, Daiyuan, is there anything you came to ask my help with?”

“What? You think I came here to ask you for help? Can't I just come to look around? Am I not welcome?” Daiyuan snorted, acting as if she disliked Yang Kai.

“No, that's not it.” Yang Kai knew he'd misspoken again and didn't know what to say.

Daiyuan merely smiled faintly. “So you’re allowed to tease me, but I can’t joke back? To be honest, I really did come this time to ask for your help.”

Yang Kai’s expression relaxed slightly, and he quickly said, “If there’s anything I can help with, Miss Daiyuan, just say the word.”

Daiyuan parted her lips and said plainly, “An Origin Condensing Pill.”

Yang Kai's expression showed understanding.

Daiyuan explained, “I was planning to seclude myself a while longer before attempting to break into the Origin Returning Realm, but with the Imperial Garden's emergence, time is pressing. I need an Origin Condensing Pill to aid me—this shouldn't be difficult for Senior Brother Yang, right?”

“Not difficult.” Yang Kai smiled confidently. His skill as a pill master was known to Wu Yi and Yang Yan, and Daiyuan had already seen his alchemical methods when he helped her detox before.

A single Origin Condensing Pill was trivial for Yang Kai to concoct with his current methods.

Daiyuan brightened and said, “I've prepared the materials—Junior Brother Yang, I'd be obliged.”

While she spoke she produced several materials for refining an Origin Condensing Pill from her Spatial Ring. Yang Kai accepted them without ceremony and said, “Stay here a day. I'll have the pill ready by tomorrow.”

“Mm.” Daiyuan nodded happily.

For Yang Kai refining the pill was exceptionally simple; within the time it took for an incense stick it was complete. Still, he waited until the next day to personally give the pill to Daiyuan.

Daiyuan received it and thanked him profusely.

She then told Yang Kai that Liuli Sect had also dispatched many people to Tianyun City to monitor the Imperial Garden, and that her junior sister Yin Sudie was among them.

Yin Sudie, like Wei Guchang, had risen to the Origin Returning Realm but had done so more recently and was consolidating her cultivation. She seemed to bear ill will toward Yang Kai, and Daiyuan warned him to be extra careful.

Yang Kai's face took on a peculiar look. After some probing he concluded that the conflict and even the killing of a Liuli Sect disciple after leaving Liuli Sect had not been exposed—apparently Yin Sudie hadn't reported it to her sect. He couldn't figure out how she had covered up that fellow disciple's death.

That was good news for Yang Kai; if Yin Sudie was willing to conceal it, he could only be grateful.

Daiyuan then casually mentioned the disaster at Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, which sent a cold sweat down Yang Kai's spine; when she spoke of it her gaze toward him was full of meaning.

Fortunately she showed no intention of continuing the topic, merely touching on it briefly before moving on.

Once Daiyuan had finally left, Yang Kai stood before the stone residence, his face deep in thought.

Yang Yan appeared by his side like a specter and frowned, “From the way she spoke, it seems she knows something.”

“Mm. Others may not know, but that doesn't mean she doesn't. The Stone Puppet entered the Glazed Mountain from her Qianhuan Peak; though I covered the traces, if she investigated carefully she might find something. Besides, she cultivates Thousand Illusions Glaze, which may have some connection to the Glazed Mountain,” Yang Kai mused.

He didn't know the full truth, but his guess was not far off. Daiyuan's awareness of the Glazed Mountain's internal situation was largely due to her cultivation of the glaze skill.
