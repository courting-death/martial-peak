## Chapter 841 — Healing

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace was bustling with activity.

The Youhan Grotto-Heaven had launched an assault, but the suddenly appearing Dragon Emperor slew one Saint Realm attacker and another expert fled with an arm severed by Palace Master Chen Zhou.

When Chen Zhou and the others returned in triumph, everyone erupted in excitement.

Never before had there been a victory so satisfying.

The Youhan Grotto-Heaven had long harbored grievances; every time they made trouble, Dragon-Phoenix Palace’s people had to swallow their pride and avoid confrontation. Over the years, Dragon-Phoenix disciples had bowed their heads whenever they met Youhan disciples and would go out of their way to steer clear.

Almost every Dragon-Phoenix disciple despised the people from Youhan Grotto-Heaven.

This time the other side had launched an unprovoked full-scale invasion, sending out their best—everyone assumed the sect was doomed.

The result, however, stunned them.

From the mouths of returning fighters they learned the reason Dragon-Phoenix won so decisively: the Dragon Emperor had appeared out of nowhere.

And that Dragon Emperor was none other than Sun Yu, the most-talked-about name over the past two years.

Most people had also witnessed the golden dragon soaring through the sky, its divine might unfathomable.

“Now the sect has hope of revival. That Dragon Emperor, with the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, felled Yan Zhi at the First Stage of the Saint Realm. In a few years, he may be able to stand alongside a Third Stage Saint Realm expert.”

“Exactly. During his duel with Yan Zhi I saw him stand there calmly, looking utterly untroubled, as if victory came effortlessly.”

“So he didn’t use his full strength?”

“Of course not. If he had gone all out, even Bai Jingchu wouldn’t have escaped.”

“Incredible! The Dragon Emperor inheritance really is wondrous. I heard two years ago when the Dragon Emperor entered Dragon Valley he was only at the Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm, and now he’s at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm—what a rapid rise.”

“He and I grew up together… I knew he wasn’t ordinary even as a child, and now it’s clear — ha ha ha!”

“Really? Any special news to tell us?”

“Special news… there is one thing, hehe, but it’s of no use to you.”

“Then who is it useful for?”

“Of course the young ladies in the palace who haven’t chosen partners yet… Listen, the Dragon Emperor still has no partner to cultivate with!”

“If a girl wins his favor, won’t she be set for life?”

“Exactly, exactly… Haven’t you noticed these days that senior and junior sisters keep running to where the Dragon Emperor lives? Fortunately the Palace Master moved him to another hall, otherwise he wouldn’t even be able to rest!”

“……”

Gossip filled the Dragon-Phoenix Palace; groups of disciples clustered everywhere, and every conversation centered on Sun Yu.

This suddenly risen Dragon Emperor was once one of Dragon-Phoenix Palace’s greatest figures. It was because of the Dragon Emperor and the Phoenix Empress that the palace had been a premier force.

Sadly, after the inheritance was broken many years ago, the sect gradually declined.

Now that the Dragon Emperor’s legacy had reappeared, everyone believed the Phoenix Empress’s arrival could not be far behind.

Of course, that depended on the Dragon Emperor himself; after all, he would choose a companion for life.

Palace Master Chen Zhou had been busy handling the aftermath of the battle. Elder Ling Jian was promoted to Grand Elder for his success in cultivating disciples and now held real power, second only to Chen Zhou.

……

Inside a grand and magnificent palace of Dragon-Phoenix, the floor was covered with thick plush carpets and the walls dotted with rare strange stones.

The hall likely contained hidden formation arrays that made the Spiritual Qi in the hall exceptionally dense.

This palace originally belonged to Palace Master Chen Zhou, but a few days earlier he had given it to Sun Yu to live in.

Outside the hall, Dragon-Phoenix experts hid in the shadows, their auras distant and steady, serving as guards—anyone attempting to approach the palace would be seen.

Though the Dragon Emperor’s might was unstoppable, he was only sixteen or seventeen, and Chen Zhou worried for his safety, so defensive measures were arranged around his residence.

A dozen or so paces from the palace, a cluster of beautiful young girls chattered excitedly.

Each of these girls had been raised within Dragon-Phoenix to be chosen by male disciples as partners for dual cultivation.

Dozens of girls were scattered about—slim and full-figured, each bearing different charms that dazzled the eye.

Sun Yu leaned at the window, peeking out, and found several overtly dressed senior sisters striking coquettish poses and batting their eyelashes at him.

Their seductive charms brushed his heart like a gentle hand, warming him all over; his face flushed red. He tried to look away but found he couldn’t, helplessly torn.

After watching for a long while, Sun Yu steeled himself, forced his gaze away, took a deep breath, and circulated his profound arts to calm himself.

“Which young man hasn’t been a flirt? If you want, tell the Palace Master and he’ll arrange it for you,” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came.

Sun Yu was startled and turned embarrassed, blushing: “You jest, Senior— I don’t think so.”

“Then what do you think?” Yang Kai smiled as he rose from the soft jade bed and looked at him warmly.

Sun Yu thought carefully, then said solemnly: “Everything I have today is because of your help behind the scenes. I don’t possess that kind of ability. If you hadn’t hidden yourself, I would have reported everything to the Palace Master. These senior and junior sisters come with hope; if I actually chose one now, they would be disappointed later. I need to become strong—so that if they choose me they won’t be disappointed. Only then can I think about this…”

He paused and scratched his head. “Besides, I’m still young… my master says I’m still growing; thinking about such matters isn’t appropriate.”

“Ha ha ha!” Yang Kai laughed heartily and nodded slightly. “You’re right. Wait until you’re strong before seeking a partner; you’ll then have the power to protect her.”

“Yes, Senior, you’re right.” Sun Yu nodded heavily, then asked eagerly, “Have your injuries healed?”

“Almost.” Yang Kai replied casually. He had been recuperating here the past few days. Yan Zhi was indeed a Saint Realm expert, and the wound to his abdomen had tremendous destructive force; Yang Kai had spent much time dispelling the lingering icy energies.

Sun Yu didn’t understand why Yang Kai had been injured, because Yang Kai never appeared during the battle.

In truth, the golden dragon that fought Yan Zhi in the sky was Yang Kai himself.

After receiving the true Dragon Emperor inheritance, Yang Kai could use the immense energy hidden in his golden dragon pattern to transform into a dragon.

That was True Yuan taking form—too real, indistinguishable from the monarch of demonic beasts, with his self hidden inside the dragon body.

It was Yang Kai’s first time using such a method; his size was too enormous, and the world seemed unaccustomed, causing him to suffer many setbacks in the fight with Yan Zhi.

If he could use it again, it would likely go much better.

Transforming into a dragon increased both his power and his defenses considerably.

Without that, Yang Kai believed that to truly defeat or slay a Saint Realm expert he would have had to enter the Demonic State.

The Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm was only one step short of the Saint Realm, but it was not the same.

That bloody clash with Yan Zhi taught Yang Kai much; at the very least he confirmed that with his current cultivation he could kill a First Stage Saint Realm opponent.

As for the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Yang Kai could not say—there were too few experts of that calibre to judge without an actual fight.

While healing, Yang Kai reviewed the bloody battle, spotted many mistakes, and silently filed them away as warnings for himself.

“Senior……” Sun Yu stammered, “What should I do? The Palace Master and others all think I’m the Dragon Emperor’s successor!”

“Let them think so… you can get the best resources this way. With your talent now, becoming powerful shouldn’t be difficult.”

“But deceiving the Palace Master and my master, I feel guilty.”

“Don’t overthink it.” Yang Kai frowned. “When the time comes I will explain it myself. Until then, you just need to cultivate.”

“That’s good.” Reassured by Yang Kai’s promise, Sun Yu relaxed—if the real Dragon Emperor explained things in person, the Palace Master and his master would hardly blame him.

“Yes. If I’m not mistaken, before long the Palace Master will start arranging things to find a Phoenix Empress for you.”

The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress appearing together was what Chen Zhou and the palace’s ancestors had hoped for for countless years. Now that the Dragon Emperor had been revealed, Chen Zhou naturally hoped the Phoenix Empress would appear soon.

Only when both appeared together would the Dragon-Phoenix Palace be complete.

Chen Zhou had not stopped those young girls from coming—he likely wanted to test Sun Yu; if Sun Yu voluntarily chose one, that would be ideal.

Hearing Yang Kai, Sun Yu panicked. “What should I do?”

Yang Kai chuckled in surprise. “Refuse. You’re the Dragon Emperor now; Chen Zhou won’t ignore your wishes. Tell him you’ll retreat into seclusion to cultivate!”

“Good idea!” Sun Yu’s eyes brightened; if he secluded himself for a few years and reemerged strong, the problem would solve itself.

“I want to see your Phoenix Nest; show me the way.” Yang Kai instructed.

“Okay… but the Palace Master certainly won’t let me go alone.”

“No matter—they won’t notice me.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Sun Yu said no more and hurried out to make the arrangements.
