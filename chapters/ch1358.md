## Chapter 1358 — Imperial Garden Emerges

Amidst everyone's suspicion and astonishment, a violent and terrifying anomaly erupted on the Fallen Emperor Mountains tens of thousands of li away, as the Spiritual Qi across an area exceeding a hundred thousand li frenziedly converged toward that spot.

The martial artists who had been lingering inside the Fallen Emperor Mountains all wore ghastly expressions, hastily employing their body techniques to flee outward, but it was clearly too late — just as they began to move, an unimaginable surge of Imperial Might descended from the heavens, its force scarcely any weaker than that at the very center of the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

That Imperial Might was everywhere; everyone felt it, as if a pair of cold, indifferent eyes were staring down upon them.

Under that gaze they felt as insignificant as ants; their movements froze, and they did not even have the strength to twitch a finger.

Fortunately the Imperial Might arrived and left quickly. When the martial artists found their freedom restored and tried to move again, they were horrified to see the surrounding Spiritual Qi billowing into clusters — the Qi converging from over a hundred thousand li was now visible to the naked eye, multicolored, and in an instant the whole of the Fallen Emperor Mountains looked as if it were filled with innumerable bubbles.

Within each of those bubbles pulsed energy fluctuations that made the heart race.

A violent roar thundered up from beneath; the ground split into spiderweb-like chasms, jagged and interlaced, terrifying beyond measure. The unsuspecting martial artists had no time to guard against them — many fell into the rifts and were mercilessly torn apart by strange forces, without even a chance to resist.

In scarcely a dozen breaths the Fallen Emperor Mountains saw countless dead and wounded, wails of grief covering the land.

Only those whose strength was not very high and who had remained on the periphery were fortunate enough to escape the calamity.

Far away, Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong and the others went pale. Though the distance prevented a clear view, the abnormality coming from the Fallen Emperor Mountains was felt by them as plain as day; they glanced at one another and each saw doubt and terror reflected in the other's eyes.

Before Qian Tong could ask Fei Zhi Tu and the others what they had done to cause such a change on the Fallen Emperor Mountains, the anomaly abruptly subsided. The continuous thunderous sounds vanished at that moment, but the world was filled with an extremely dangerous aura.

The eerie calm before a storm put everyone's heart on edge.

The Spiritual Qi continued to converge toward that place without sound, even swifter and more terrifying than before.

After a short while, a blinding radiance erupted from a point on the Fallen Emperor Mountains. A bolt cleaved the clear sky, leaving people dizzy, and the brilliance that bloomed was impossible to look upon directly.

A sensation as if the heavens and earth might be shattered descended; every face turned pale.

When the light dispersed and people looked again in that direction, they were left dumbstruck.

A palace-like structure had appeared above the Fallen Emperor Mountains; its architecture was archaic and exuded a savage air. Around the palace runes flashed, golden and silver incantations flowing like shoals of fish.

At this moment the palace was slowly rising into the sky, its speed not great, and from it emanated an inscrutable Imperial Might that almost shrouded the entire Dark Star.

"This is…" Ning Xiangchen stared at the palace in a daze, then, as if recalling something, his expression shifted dramatically, a complex mixture of surprise, doubt, excitement, and unease flooding his face.

"The Imperial Garden!" Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong both cried out in alarm at the same time.

Several younger disciples of the Saint King Realm brightened at their words, showing expressions of disbelief.

Yang Kai was the same. Long ago he had known that there were three great forbidden places on the Dark Star.

One was the Flowing Flame Sandland he had once visited; its perils need no further mention. The last time over ten thousand elites from the great Sects entered, fewer than six in ten emerged alive — nearly half were lost — and that was with the Heat‑Flame Zone's power already diminished.

If the Flowing Flame Sandland were to open in full strength, the probability of death would be even higher.

The second was the Imperial Garden that Fei Zhi Tu and the others had just named.

Rumor said this was the private garden of the Starry Sky Emperor. The name alone was enough to intimidate.

The third was the Ghost Isle on the Wuyou Sea of the Dark Star.

The first forbidden place existed in some corner of the Dark Star and would open once every few hundred years; every time it awakened, the great powers of the Dark Star benefited greatly.

The second forbidden place, the Imperial Garden, had never been truly entered. It would occasionally appear like a fleeting bloom and then vanish without a trace. The martial artists of the Dark Star had only heard of its existence; across thousands and tens of thousands of years some had seen the Imperial Garden's brief appearance, but no record had ever recorded anyone actually setting foot within it.

As for the third forbidden Ghost Isle, it was even more unreachable; those who claimed to have seen it were said to be dead, and it was far more mysterious than the Imperial Garden.

At this moment, with Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong shouting the name Imperial Garden, how could Yang Kai not be astonished? He steadied his spirit and asked respectfully, "Sirs, is this the fabled private garden of the Starry Sky Emperor?"

Fei Zhi Tu's eyes narrowed to slits, occasional sparks flashing within; he nodded slightly at the question. "It should be so. Although this city lord has never seen it, it's identical to what the hall's records describe, only…"

"Only what?" several younger Saint King disciples asked, turning to him.

"Only slightly different," Qian Tong said, his brows tightly drawn.

"How different?"

Qian Tong pondered for a moment and then slowly said, "There's no great point in telling you now. Since the Imperial Garden has appeared here, even if I do not speak these matters will spread quickly. You should have heard some of the rumors — it always appears like a mirage and then disappears swiftly. Over a thousand years ago a predecessor of Yingyue Hall was fortunate enough to witness it once, hence we have records. That time the Imperial Garden's appearance lacked such momentum; it arrived silently and left silently and did not alarm many people. But this… I think half of the Dark Star may be able to see it."

A bitter smile crossed Qian Tong's face as he spoke.

"Not only that," Fei Zhi Tu cut in, brows full of worry, "the Imperial Gardens that appeared previously were all illusory, like a mirage — visible to the eye but not solid. But this time…"

No one needed to be told; everyone could see clearly that this Imperial Garden appeared to be real, not some mirage. If one could fly close to the Imperial Garden, one might have a chance to enter.

"Could the ancient ruin we entered before have been the Imperial Garden?" Yang Kai's expression flickered as he asked with suspicion.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu said nothing, but their faces betrayed the same thought. After all, the group had just been expelled from within the Fallen Emperor Mountains, and immediately afterward the Imperial Garden rose from that direction — there had to be some connection.

If that ancient ruin did turn out to be the Imperial Garden, it would explain why so many extinct things were found within. The Imperial Garden's reputation was so great that it would be strange if it did not hold valuable treasures.

At the thought that they had once ventured into the Imperial Garden and emerged alive, Cai He and Du Sisi trembled slightly, their emotions stirring.

And now that the Imperial Garden had appeared in the sky, they might have another chance to enter it.

As they spoke, the Imperial Garden still rose slowly into the heavens. Strangely, no matter how high or how far it ascended, those standing below could still see it clearly and it showed no sign of shrinking — a most bizarre sight. However, as it rose, the Imperial Might that shrouded the surrounding area did gradually weaken.

"The Imperial Garden appears, the Star Domain grows chaotic — who knows whether the ancient records are true!" Fei Zhi Tu murmured in confusion.

"Either way, Old Fei, you and I should go investigate first. If this Imperial Garden has truly emerged, it may not be good news for us," Qian Tong said with worry.

"Agreed. Even if you don't say it, I had the same thought," Fei Zhi Tu nodded casually.

The two Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts reached an agreement. Qian Tong immediately instructed the juniors to return to Tianyun City quickly and not to rush to join the commotion, then told Ning Xiangchen a few words to look after them along the way. With that, he and Fei Zhi Tu transformed into streaks of light and flew in the direction of the Imperial Garden.

After they left, Ning Xiangchen stood where he was, his expression wavering for a moment before he sighed, "Let's head back."

He truly wanted to go to the Imperial Garden to take a look, but sensing the Imperial Might emanating from it he could only give up — his strength was too low; perhaps before he could even approach the Imperial Garden he would be pulverized into dust by the Imperial Might.

He then took four Saint King disciples and the middle‑aged artificer and sped off toward Tianyun City.

Along the way Yang Kai looked at the Imperial Garden with suspicion; the more he looked, the more puzzled his expression became.

He had once seen a flying palace before — Meng Wuya's Secret Treasure, the Heavenly Journey Palace. By that logic the Imperial Garden might also be a Secret Treasure, only of a rank countless times higher than Meng Wuya's Heavenly Journey Palace.

And the master of such a Secret Treasure would have to be the Starry Sky Emperor; the Imperial Might it emitted could not be faked.

What troubled Yang Kai was not that conclusion, but a persistent feeling that the Imperial Garden was missing something; it was merely a sense, and he could not say what it was.

He kept the thought in his heart and did not attempt to investigate — matters concerning the Imperial Garden were unlikely to yield much even if he tried to ask around.

On the way back, Cai He and Du Sisi asked Ning Xiangchen some questions, learning that after parting ways they had fought several battles against various puppets and come back with their clothes askew, and that the martial artist surnamed Wen had been gruesomely slain by a puppet of astonishing strength.
