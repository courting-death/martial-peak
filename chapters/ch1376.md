## Chapter 1376 — Seeing Lu Ye Again

The price that young man called out was exceedingly subtle—he had only added ten thousand on top of ten million, as if merely to avoid breaking Jubao Tower’s auction rules.

Not only did numerous martial artists suspect his identity, even the usually steady-as-a-mountain Ren Tianrui frowned slightly and scrutinized him with a doubtful gaze, secretly wondering what background this person came from to possess such vast wealth.

Under the eyes of all, the young warrior remained composed, showing no trace of pressure or nervousness, which made people look at him with fresh respect.

“Lu Ye!” In the room B-13, Yang Kai’s eyelids contracted and he stared fixedly at the young man bidding in the hall, his eyes full of disbelief. What shocked Yang Kai was not that this person came to the auction — Liu Yun Valley, though not a major power, was still a sect, and as its Young Master Lu Ye naturally had the right to enter Jubao Tower — but that he didn’t even have a private room and had to squeeze in among the hall attendees.

What astonished Yang Kai was his arms!

Looking now, both of Lu Ye’s arms were intact, with not a single one missing.

How could this be? Yang Kai cried inwardly; he clearly remembered that back in the Flowing Flame Sandland, when he had competed with Lu Ye over the Red Candle Base, he had indeed severed one of his arms, and although Lu Ye had fled, the scene was vivid in Yang Kai’s memory — there was no way he could be mistaken.

Yet now, for some reason, the severed arm had regrown, and judging by the color and texture of that hand, it was not a prosthetic or fake — it was flesh and blood!

How had he managed it? Yang Kai stood stunned on the spot — severed limb reborn. Such a thing existed only in legend; never mind that Lu Ye was merely a Saint King Realm warrior, even a Void King Realm cultivator could not accomplish this.

Yang Kai suddenly realized he had underestimated how uncanny this Lu Ye was. From the fact that he could make a severed arm regrow alone, this man clearly harbored great secrets.

“That person…” As Yang Kai racked his brains in confusion, Yang Yan suddenly furrowed her brow, pointed down at Lu Ye, and a thoughtful expression appeared in her beautiful eyes.

“What is it?” Yang Kai turned to look at her.

“I don’t know why, but I find him very annoying!” Yang Yan shook her head slowly, puzzled. “But this is my first time seeing him. You just called him Lu Ye — do you have some grudge with him?”

“Yes! But I don’t even know why — this man tried to kill me in the Flowing Flame Sandland!” Yang Kai snorted lightly; his feud with Lu Ye was indeed inexplicably odd. The other had attacked him for no reason and intended to finish him.

Yang Kai asked himself — before going to the Flowing Flame Sandland he had never had dealings with Lu Ye; even when they met there it was their first encounter.

“Mm, be careful of him; he seems dangerous,” Yang Yan warned.

“I understand.” If Yang Yan hadn’t warned him, Yang Kai would have known anyway. Still, how could Lu Ye have so many Saint Crystals to bid on a single Storage Spirit Pearl? From what he knew, Liu Yun Valley was a backwater sect at best, roughly comparable to some small families; its Sect Master only had the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and the disciples numbered only three or four hundred.

Their territory wasn’t particularly fertile, and they had no Saint Crystal mines — how could he possibly afford ten million Saint Crystals?

“Hehe, Brother Cheng also spoke of letting others accomplish their good deed. Since this young friend wishes to have that Storage Spirit Pearl, then this Mo shall yield.” Just as Yang Kai was growing suspicious, a hearty laugh came from the private room belonging to the Battle Sky Alliance.

Immediately after, Cheng Pengxuan’s deep and resonant voice sounded out: “Hmph, Old Ghost Mo, don’t make it sound so pleasant. But since you’ve given up, then this Cheng will withdraw as well.”

It sounded as if he despised the Storage Spirit Pearl, but the many shrewd martial artists present naturally understood that the two old men were passing the hot potato and throwing off this troublesome item.

One could say that the price of ten million and one hundred thousand was perfectly calculated: not only did it let the two old fellows save face, it also secured the Storage Spirit Pearl — killing two birds with one stone.

Thinking of that, many secretly regretted it — had they known, they would have bid the same. Although over ten million Saint Crystals was no small sum, if it could curry favor with elders of two great powers, the cost would be worthwhile, and for a moment many felt chagrined.

But even understanding that, if asked to make that choice again in the moment, not everyone would have the nerve to bid — if they flattered the wrong people, they might only make fools of themselves.

That young man, however, was decisive, and many admired him for it.

Standing atop the high platform, Ren Tianrui called the bid three times. When no one else raised the price, the Storage Spirit Pearl was purchased by Lu Ye for ten million and ten thousand. Immediately, someone led Lu Ye into the auction’s rear hall to complete the exchange of Saint Crystals and the Storage Spirit Pearl.

The auction continued; with the first item sold to warm the floor, the atmosphere in the auction hall rose noticeably. Jubao Tower’s offerings this time were indeed excellent — each item that appeared sparked fierce scramble among the martial artists, and prices climbed steadily. Ren Tianrui remained on the high dais, his folded fan oscillating or tucked away, ever the polite and refined host, but this man known as the young black-faced one had already, without a sound, driven up the price of every lot beyond its intrinsic worth — the subtlety of his methods left the onlookers with no small admiration.

The items offered at this auction were of great use to martial artists: secret treasures, pills, cultivation techniques and secret arts, spiritual herbs, ores — all manner of categories, without exception.

Yang Kai did not bid; he sat upright in the B-13 private chamber, listening to Yang Yan critique and evaluate the lots while enjoying the pleasant kneading and pounding from the young girl Qing'er, feeling extremely content.

Though the items were fine, they were of little use to him, and with Dragon Lair Mountain now cooperating with Yingyue Hall, obtaining such things wasn’t terribly difficult. Overall, the first half of the auction passed without incident; most lots could be bought with Saint Crystals alone, and most bidders were those in the hall, while the experts in the private chambers rarely intervened unless a particularly valuable lot appeared.

In the latter half, however, the experts in the private chambers finally began to act, and those lots were no longer open to the hall’s participants.

Surprisingly, the young man who had bought the first lot continued to bid fiercely in the subsequent auctions, displaying immense wealth; to everyone’s disbelief he purchased several items back-to-back, paying more than forty million in Saint Crystals.

Lu Ye’s actions naturally left Yang Kai continually astonished, though before long a mocking smile curled at the corner of his mouth.

Without a powerful sect backing him, Lu Ye repeatedly exposing his wealth was akin to courting death — Yang Kai felt numerous experts’ divine senses constantly sweep toward Lu Ye; evidently after the auction someone would come have a serious talk with him.

This was precisely what Yang Kai was happy to see. No matter why Lu Ye had targeted him—since the man had made a move against him, he was an enemy. Now that Lu Ye had gone courting death on his own, Yang Kai was naturally content to sit back and watch, even wishing in his heart that the fool would die all the sooner.

Yet Lu Ye proved formidable; faced with so many hostile glances, he remained calm and composed, sitting in the hall with no sign of leaving early, as if he intended to continue bidding.

As one lot after another was sold, the auction gradually neared its end.

Yang Kai grew increasingly anxious — he had been waiting for the one item he needed, but there had been no sign of it yet. He feared Jubao Tower might change its mind and withdraw it from the auction, though he quickly reasoned that since it had been printed on the invitation and widely publicized, they wouldn’t do such a thing; to do so would ruin Jubao Tower’s reputation.

Just then, a woman in palace-style robes ascended the dais carrying a jade tray. Though the lot was covered with a red cloth, when Yang Kai’s divine sense swept over it his expression brightened and he straightened up, rubbing his hands together in anticipation.

The thing he had been waiting for had finally appeared.

At the same time, waves of divine sense swept from the private chambers, and soon the hall buzzed with whispers; the lot about to be unveiled seemed unusual. When the palace-dressed woman carrying the jade tray appeared, everyone felt an invisible aura cutting at their skin like a blade.

What kind of thing could be so extraordinary?

The crowd watched with curious and eager eyes.

Ren Tianrui observed the crowd’s expressions and was quite satisfied with their reaction. Folding his fan and tucking it behind his collar, he chuckled and said, “The next item up for auction may not be something unseen in ten thousand years, but it is nevertheless an exceedingly rare treasure. As for exactly what it is, allow me to keep it a mystery for now. I can only say this much—it is a material, and for those seniors who have cultivated certain special arts, it holds tremendous value.”

“Enough teasing — let the old man see it already!” came a hoarse, authoritative voice from a private A-Class room, tinged with impatience, clearly showing the speaker cared greatly about the lot.

Yang Kai frowned; he secretly suspected that securing this lot would not be so simple.

“Hehe, that must be Senior Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect, yes? Please don’t be impatient, Senior—this junior will let you have a clear look right away.” With those words, Ren Tianrui exposed the speaker’s identity, then reached out and lifted the red cloth.

In an instant, a dazzling golden light burst forth, blinding in its intensity. Weaker onlookers felt their eyes sting and closed them involuntarily; the strong had to circulate Saint Yuan through their eyes in order to see clearly the object within the golden radiance.

Yang Kai squinted as well, and when he saw what lay within the golden glow his heart pounded wildly with excitement.
