## Chapter 2552 — You Deserve This Fate

In less than ten breaths, that Netherworld Sect disciple suddenly convulsed all over, then lost all signs of life, lying motionless on the ground. Not a single part of his body was intact, and even his colorful intestines had been pulled out by his own hands, making for a truly horrifying sight.

The pitch-black energy continued to burn on his body, as if it would last for all eternity.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Beams of black light shot out one after another from within the Heaven Net Sealing Array, each one striking unerringly toward a Netherworld Sect disciple.

The disciples were scared out of their wits, scrambling to flee as they cried out for the Elder to save them.

But Hua Feichen had no time to save their lives. At this moment, even with Yin Lesheng working together with him, both were being relentlessly pursued by Yang Kai, barely able to catch their breath. So even though he knew those disciples were suffering the agony of being devoured by ten thousand ghosts, he was powerless to help.

But even if he were free right now, he still wouldn’t be able to save those disciples.

For the disciples of the Netherworld Sect, being devoured by ten thousand ghosts was the most terrifying torture, the most unbearable way to die. This was related to the cultivation techniques they practiced and the Secret Treasures they refined.

But this was the very foundation of the Netherworld Sect—what disciple wouldn’t cultivate it?

Screams rang out, but this time it wasn’t the Yin-Souls, it was the Netherworld Sect disciples being devoured by ten thousand ghosts.

In just thirty breaths, nearly half of the Netherworld Sect’s people had perished, all dying from backlash after the Netherworld Infernal Banner was damaged.

Yet the grand array continued to operate.

The Heaven Net Sealing Array was a rather peculiar formation, and also an extremely flexible one. Five people could set it up. Ten people could set it up. Twenty people could as well…

So even though many had died, the array did not stop running.

However, the color of the black sphere seemed to have faded considerably, and one could vaguely see three figures darting about inside, engaged in a fierce battle.

With half their numbers suddenly dead, the remaining Netherworld Sect disciples were naturally terrified. They knew that if they didn’t escape, they would end up just like their fallen Senior Brothers—sooner or later, they too would die from the backlash.

But without Hua Feichen giving the order, how would they dare to flee? If they really tried to escape now, they would surely be hunted down by the entire Netherworld Sect, so they could only grit their teeth and endure.

“Summon the Ghost King, you idiots!” Yin Lesheng suddenly cursed.

Hearing this, all the Netherworld Sect disciples trembled, then a look of determination flashed across their faces. Suddenly, they all formed hand seals, surging Origin Qi throughout their bodies.

Next, each of them spat out a mouthful of Essence-Blood toward the black sphere.

The crimson blood merged into the black sphere like raindrops falling into the sea, quickly vanishing without a trace.

But inside the black sphere, the banner souls seemed to be agitated by something, boiling and roaring incessantly.

Hua Feichen seized the moment to lunge forward, blocking Yang Kai. Yin Lesheng quickly withdrew, glaring venomously. In the next instant, a ghost banner suddenly appeared in his hand.

It was the signature artifact of the Netherworld Sect disciples—the Netherworld Infernal Banner.

Gripping the ghost banner with both hands, he also spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood onto his Secret Treasure. With a fierce wave, the ghost banner unfurled in the wind.

Hoo, hoo, hoo…

A rhythmic sound suddenly came from the ghost banner, like the sound of breathing, making it feel extremely eerie.

As the sound rang out, the dense black energy and countless banner souls within the black sphere seemed to be drawn by some force, all surging toward the Netherworld Infernal Banner in Yin Lesheng’s hands.

In less than a moment, all the black energy and banner souls had vanished.

Where Yang Kai and the others stood, the view was now clear, with only the pure white light of the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl’s barrier covering the ground and sealing the space.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat, instinctively sensing danger. While fighting Hua Feichen, he managed to glance over at Yin Lesheng, only to see him grinning wickedly and shouting, “Yang Kai, let’s see if you can survive this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Netherworld Infernal Banner in his hand suddenly exploded into a cloud of black mist. Within the churning mist, two crimson eyes flashed with a strange, demonic light, as if they could devour one’s Divine Soul, making it impossible to look away.

Immediately after, two enormous ghostly claws reached out from the black mist.

As they twisted and writhed, a massive figure emerged.

This figure stood over five zhang tall, its entire body pitch-black, with a hideous face and even a single upward-curving horn on its forehead. Its mouth was full of fangs, and its very presence brought an overwhelming sense of oppression.

The air around them seemed to freeze in an instant.

Hoo…

A breath of white mist sprayed from the figure’s nostrils, freezing even the space itself.

“Ghost King!” Elder Fu’s eyes narrowed, realizing that the Netherworld Sect was going all out. Otherwise, they would never use such a secret technique—once unleashed, it was either you die or I die.

This Ghost King was different from the one in the Ancient Land passage. The one in the passage was naturally formed, having cultivated for countless years to reach such strength, while this one was created by the Netherworld Sect disciples fusing the banner souls they controlled.

There was no denying that the aura this Ghost King emitted was extremely powerful, comparable to an expert at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. The moment its yin energy swept out, even Elder Fu, who was watching from outside, couldn’t help but shiver.

On the other hand, Lin’er, whose cultivation was lower, remained unharmed. However, a faint glow flickered around her body, and it seemed to be this light that protected her from the invading yin energy.

“Senior Uncle, assist me!” Yin Lesheng shouted sharply.

Hua Feichen immediately feinted, forcing Yang Kai back, then flashed over to Yin Lesheng’s side and punched himself in the chest.

Puff…

Blood sprayed from Hua Feichen’s mouth, landing directly on the Ghost King, causing its aura to grow even stronger.

Forming hand seals, both Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng’s expressions turned solemn, as if they had established some mysterious connection with the Ghost King.

Yang Kai stood in place, his expression grave, eyes darting as he carefully observed the Ghost King.

As expected of a top sect in the Eastern Territory, they truly possessed such bizarre secret techniques. He had thought victory was in his grasp, but hadn’t expected such a turn of events.

On the other side, Yin Lesheng gritted his teeth and shouted, “Yang Kai, I didn’t expect you to be so strong, but can you be stronger than the Ghost King? This is the combined strength of more than a dozen of my Netherworld Sect disciples—you’re doomed!”

Yang Kai snorted, “You’ve said that several times today, yet I’m still standing here, aren’t I?”

Unable to contain his anger, Yin Lesheng couldn’t be bothered to waste more words. Forming a hand seal, he shouted, “Die!”

As soon as he spoke, the Ghost King’s eyes blazed crimson. Like a puppet on strings, it lunged at Yang Kai.

“Devour it!” Yang Kai commanded, pointing his finger. Instantly, countless Soul-Devouring Worms took flight, their wings buzzing as they swarmed together in midair, forming a dense insect cloud that collided head-on with the Ghost King.

Boom…

The insect cloud instantly scattered, countless Soul-Devouring Worms sent flying and crashing to the ground, their fate unknown.

The Ghost King, on the other hand, was completely unharmed, its momentum undiminished.

After all, the insect cloud was made up of countless Soul-Devouring Worms, and its structure was not tight. How could it withstand such a collision? Naturally, it scattered at once, looking utterly fragile.

Yin Lesheng laughed loudly, “That’s what you get for being arrogant, for being reckless—you deserve this fate.”

His words implied that Yang Kai was doomed.

A cold smile played at the corner of Yang Kai’s lips as he stared indifferently at the charging Ghost King, not moving an inch.

Yin Lesheng’s laughter abruptly stopped. He stared wide-eyed ahead, only to see that the Ghost King was now crawling with those pitch-black insects, which had clearly landed on it during the earlier collision.

Crackle, crackle…

The sound of silkworms munching on mulberry leaves rang out. The charging Ghost King showed an expression of extreme pain, howling with its mouth wide open, and its speed suddenly slowed considerably.

“This…” Yin Lesheng was dumbfounded. He hadn’t expected those strange insects to be so formidable—they could even devour the Ghost King.

Hua Feichen’s face flickered, a look of confusion in his eyes. Suddenly, as if remembering something, he cried out, “Soul-Devouring Worms! Those are Soul-Devouring Worms!”

As a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert who had cultivated for countless years, Hua Feichen’s experience was vast, so it was no surprise he recognized the Soul-Devouring Worms.

He hadn’t recognized them at first, since these Soul-Devouring Worms were quite different from those described in the records—both in size and ferocity, they were far beyond what the texts described.

Only now did he suddenly realize.

Now that he knew they were Soul-Devouring Worms, Hua Feichen became extremely flustered.

Yin Lesheng might not know how terrifying the Soul-Devouring Worms were, but Hua Feichen did. The Netherworld Infernal Banner and Yin-Soul ghosts feared them most. No wonder so many disciples had died so miserably before—it was these things at work.

As he spoke, the Soul-Devouring Worms that had been knocked to the ground earlier slowly crawled up, flapped their wings, and buzzed back toward the Ghost King.

In an instant, the massive Ghost King was covered by the Soul-Devouring Worms, with only its two crimson eyes still faintly visible.

As the Soul-Devouring Worms gnawed at it, the Ghost King seemed to slip from Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen’s control, howling and writhing in agony.

Realizing things were going badly, Hua Feichen shouted, “Finish this quickly!”

With the Soul-Devouring Worms out, they couldn’t afford to drag things out. If this went on, the Ghost King would be eaten down to nothing, and then both he and Yin Lesheng would suffer the agony of being devoured by ten thousand ghosts.

Having watched more than a dozen disciples die before his eyes, Hua Feichen had no desire to follow in their footsteps.

Yin Lesheng was no fool either. Naturally, he understood the danger, so he and Hua Feichen joined forces to forcibly drive the Ghost King to attack.

Roar…

With a roar, the Ghost King’s eyes grew even redder, as if drenched in blood. Ignoring the Soul-Devouring Worms, it lunged straight at Yang Kai. In midair, its massive ghostly claw clenched, and a pitch-black scythe appeared in its hand, which it swung at Yang Kai from a distance.
