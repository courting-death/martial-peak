## Chapter 2171 — Freedom

Yang Kai was not a greedy person. At this moment, having already seized a treasure and helped Murong Xiaoxiao obtain the Taiyi Divine Water, it was naturally best to leave first.

Murong Xiaoxiao had no objections upon hearing this. She immediately gripped the jade bottle in her palm, put away the Feathered Heaven Ring, and closely followed behind Yang Kai. The two of them, one after the other, darted straight into the light gate and vanished from sight.

At the same time as the two departed, atop the high platform, with a fierce shout from Luo Yuan, surging Origin Qi thundered forth. Kong Qi’s expression changed drastically, and he cried out in alarm, “You...!”

As soon as he spoke, blood spurted from his mouth, and he was sent flying backward.

When he landed, his face was filled with shock.

He had never expected that Luo Yuan’s strength would be so formidable. Both possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet at the final moment of their contest of Origin Qi, Luo Yuan was able to severely injure him.

Kong Qi was also a favored son of heaven, the foremost rising star of the Qiyao Commerce Guild, but compared to Luo Yuan, the difference between the two was immediately clear.

"Hmph, overestimating yourself!" After shaking off Kong Qi, Luo Yuan had no intention of pursuing him to finish him off. Instead, he struck the barrier of light with his palm, shattering it, and easily collected the Emperor Severing Pill that contained the full-force strike of an Emperor Realm expert!

Then, he cast his gaze toward the misty area, let out a low shout, and charged in fiercely.

But at that moment, the rolling mist parted on its own to both sides. When Luo Yuan rushed over, the dense fog dissipated like an illusory bubble, vanishing completely.

Only Bian Yuqing remained at the original spot, looking around in confusion, gritting her teeth in frustration!

A shadow flashed by like a ghost, rushing toward the light gate, quickly slipping inside and disappearing.

“Where’s the Imperial Aura...” Although he had some guesses, Luo Yuan still shouted sternly at Bian Yuqing.

Bian Yuqing replied with a wronged expression, “How would I know... I was trapped in that mist and couldn’t see anything...”

“Useless!” Luo Yuan cursed. He chased after the shadow and disappeared into the light gate. As expected, that shadow was undoubtedly Gong Wenshan, who must have snatched the Imperial Aura and fled.

“Why are you taking it out on me!” Bian Yuqing was thoroughly aggrieved.

In the blink of an eye, only Kong Qi, pale-faced and bleeding from the mouth, and the dejected Bian Yuqing remained in the grand hall.

The latter glanced at the former, pursed her lips into a smile, and said, “Young Brother...”

Kong Qi looked at her, gave a bitter smile, and said, "Don’t call me that affectionately. I didn’t get anything. It’s useless to set your sights on me!"

Bian Yuqing pouted in resentment and muttered, “A pack of beasts—you’re driving me mad.”

In this contest for rare treasures, aside from Lan Xun and Xiao Chen who left at the very beginning, only she and Kong Qi ended up with nothing, while the rest divided all the other treasures among themselves. Naturally, this left Bian Yuqing extremely frustrated.

In terms of cultivation, she wasn’t the lowest among everyone. In terms of strength, she didn’t think she was at the bottom either. Yet the final result was that she returned empty-handed. Faced with such an opportunity, she simply couldn’t accept it.

...

Outside the Time Temple, somewhere. A flash of light appeared, and Yang Kai and Murong Xiaoxiao materialized at the same time.

Yang Kai immediately released his Divine Sense, scanning the surroundings. After confirming there was no danger, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

There was no sign of anyone else nearby. Perhaps they had been sent elsewhere. However, that light gate was indeed the passage out of the Time Temple—there was no doubt about that.

After waiting a while, there was still no sign of the others.

Yang Kai quickly understood that unless one passed through the light gate at the same time as another, they would appear in a different location.

He turned to look at Murong Xiaoxiao, who was gazing at him gratefully. Just the fact that Yang Kai had helped her obtain the Taiyi Divine Water at the last moment, without taking advantage to snatch it, was enough to make Murong Xiaoxiao deeply thankful.

In that situation, Yang Kai could have easily made a move, and he definitely had the chance to seize the Taiyi Divine Water.

Murong Xiaoxiao opened her mouth, about to say something, when a sudden change occurred.

In the sky, a muffled thunder-like hum suddenly rang out, so loud it spread in all directions. Every martial artist within a hundred li heard it clearly.

At the same time as the sound echoed, the Time Temple suspended in the sky began to radiate dazzling divine light, so bright that it was impossible to keep one’s eyes open.

An astonishing pressure spread from that direction, filling the four corners of the world...

Rumble...

The sound continued unceasingly.

“Junior Brother Yang...” Murong Xiaoxiao called out gravely.

Yang Kai did not reply, but squinted his eyes to observe. After a long while, he sighed, “It seems the temple is about to hide itself again. Who knows what kind of opportunity will be needed for it to appear next, or how many years and months it will take.”

Just as he said, after the dazzling light faded, the Time Temple in the sky was nowhere to be seen. Just as it had appeared mysteriously, it once again vanished into the void.

Yet...

In the place where the temple had been, a black dot now stood.

"What is that...?" Yang Kai focused his gaze, his eyes narrowing.

In the sky, a strange beast appeared out of nowhere. Its entire body was ablaze, massive in size, resembling both a tiger and an ox, as if forged from fire. A crimson horn grew from its forehead, twin wings sprouted from its back, and its body was covered in scales, exuding a majestic aura.

Flames spewed from its nostrils, melting the void. Wherever its four feet landed, fire burned and space twisted.

“Qiong Qi!” Yang Kai exclaimed in shock.

Murong Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but cover her red lips with her small hand, her beautiful eyes trembling violently.

As an elite disciple of Qingyang Shrine, she had naturally heard the name Qiong Qi before.

Those two simple words represented ferocity and evil, endless slaughter, and eternal despair!

Even in antiquity, the Divine Spirit Qiong Qi was a monstrous fiend infamous across the ages. Countless heroes perished beneath its blazing wrath, and scarcely any expert could even muster the will to resist in its presence.

At this moment, it simply stood quietly in the void, but its savage and violent aura was like deadly poison, making all living beings within a hundred li struggle to breathe and tremble uncontrollably.

Within a hundred li, any martial artist who felt this wild pressure found their bodies weighed down, as if a mountain ten thousand zhang high pressed upon their shoulders, and a sense of impending death arose in their hearts...

“Roar...”

A furious roar echoed out. Qiong Qi raised its head to the sky and howled, its voice filled with complex emotions—joy, excitement, and a touch of sorrow and confusion.

Immediately after, it swept its gaze around, its flame-like eyes fixing on a spot in the void. It stretched out a claw, tore open the void, and dove inside, disappearing from sight.

Outside the Four Seasons Land, in a nameless valley.

The Spiritual Qi here had long since faded, leaving the place desolate. Only a massive oval-shaped light gate still persisted in midair.

The many martial artists who had originally gathered here had already rushed into the Four Seasons Land days ago. Now, only a few Emperor Realm experts leading their teams remained.

Xiao Yuyang, the Star Envoy of Star God Palace; Gao Xueting of Qingyang Shrine; Chen Wenhao of Tianwu Sacred Land; Feng Ming of Wuhua Hall; Zeng Yuan of Qiyao Commerce Guild; Lou Chi of Ziyuan Commerce Guild...

These experts stayed here partly to observe changes at the entrance to the Four Seasons Land, in case of emergencies, and partly to await the return of their elite disciples.

After the Dao Origin Realm experts entered the Four Seasons Land, these Emperor Realm experts each found a spot to meditate and rest.

For experts like them, waiting thirty-three days was nothing. Perhaps they would ponder the mysteries of their cultivation techniques, or refine their Imperial Treasures a bit, and the thirty-three days would pass, so no one felt bored at all.

Suddenly, Xiao Yuyang sensed something and opened his eyes, a trace of confusion flashing in his gaze, which quickly turned to shock and alarm.

The next moment, all the Emperor Realm experts stood up, eyes wide, looking in the same direction.

There, the void suddenly split open, and the crack instantly widened into a gaping maw. From within, a terrifying pressure surged forth, making everyone present tremble in fear.

Before their very eyes, a fiery red, flame-wreathed strange beast slowly stepped out.

“Hahahaha... This Lord is finally free!” As soon as the beast appeared, it suddenly spoke in human tongue, laughing wildly like a prisoner freed after countless years of confinement.

“Divine Spirit... Qiong Qi!” After observing the beast for a moment, Xiao Yuyang couldn’t help but cry out, his Origin Qi surging violently.

The other Emperor Realm experts’ expressions also darkened, and without a word, they all moved to gather around Xiao Yuyang.

Emperor Realm experts understood Qiong Qi’s terror better than anyone. None of them had expected that a Divine Spirit, and one as notorious as Qiong Qi, would suddenly appear in this nameless valley...

Zeng Yuan, the vice president of Qiyao Commerce Guild, was so frightened that his legs were shaking, his face deathly pale.

"Oh…" Qiong Qi’s beastly eyes swept over the crowd below. It drawled in a low, rumbling voice, "Barely stepped out… and I’m greeted by such a feast of prey…"

As it spoke, a string of crystal-clear drool dripped from the corner of its mouth, as if it had been hungry for a long time.

Gulp...

The sound of swallowing echoed, but it didn’t come from Qiong Qi—it came from the gathered Emperor Realm experts.

Nearly everyone was terrified by Qiong Qi’s words. The words of a Divine Spirit are not to be taken lightly. Any mature Divine Spirit’s strength would not be inferior to a Great Emperor. If it truly wanted to treat the Emperor Realm experts present as food, few would escape this calamity.

At the critical moment, Xiao Yuyang was the first to recover. He quickly cupped his fists and shouted solemnly, “Xiao Yuyang, Star Envoy of Star God Palace, greets Lord Qiong Qi! May I ask, Lord... why have you appeared here?”

“Star God Palace?” Qiong Qi snorted disdainfully, a trace of contempt flashing in its beastly eyes. “What’s that supposed to be?”

It hadn’t even heard of the dominant sect of the Southern Territory.

Xiao Yuyang couldn’t help but feel uneasy, realizing things were bad. This was likely a Divine Spirit that had slept for countless years, so it hadn’t even heard of Star God Palace. His plan to use the name of Radiant Moon Great Emperor to intimidate it would not work at all.
