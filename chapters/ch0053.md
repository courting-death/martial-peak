## Chapter 53 — Body Tempering Realm, Ninth Stage

Ten days after planting the seeds of the Three Yang Fruit tree, three fruits quietly ripened! Their bright red hues hung from the branches, irresistibly charming.

Yang Kai could sense a strong surge of Yang energy emanating from these three fruits.

In just ten days, the Earth-Grade Lower-Level spirit fruits had grown from nothing to full maturity. The effect of that single drop of Yang liquid was truly immense.

He carefully reached out, plucking the three fruits and turning them over in his palm. The more Yang Kai gazed upon them, the more fond he became.

Yet no matter how delightful they were, their true power could only be realized by consuming them.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai seated himself cross-legged and popped one of the Three Yang Fruits into his mouth. The warm, sweet juice spread across his tongue, leaving a lingering fragrance on his lips.

As the spirit fruit entered his body, the True Yang Technique activated. His abdomen felt as if it were aflame, but for someone cultivating the True Yang Technique, this heat was most agreeable, even invigorating.

The Yang Primordial Qi contained within the Earth-Grade Middle-Level spirit fruit swiftly coursed through his meridians, saturating them. With a faint drip, a drop of Yang liquid quietly formed.

Moments later, another soft sound echoed.

By the time three drops of Yang liquid had been condensed, the medicinal effect of this Earth-Grade Lower-Level spirit fruit was fully expended.

Within his dantian, four drops of Yang liquid now resided—three freshly formed, and one remaining from Yang Kai’s cultivation over the past ten days.

Due to the lingering fragrance from the incense burner obstructing his progress, his cultivation results over these ten days were rather meager. But Yang Kai paid it no mind; his gaze was fixed on the future. How could he fuss over such trifling gains?

Moreover, he harbored a faint premonition: if he consumed the remaining two fruits, he might break through to the ninth stage of the Body Tempering Realm, brushing the very threshold of the Open Origin Realm.

With this thought in mind, Yang Kai did not hesitate to swallow the last two Three Yang Fruits.

The Yang Primordial Qi dissolved in his abdomen, fierce heat blazing through his meridians. His skin suddenly flushed a deep red.

The True Yang Technique surged wildly, accompanied by the rhythmic drip of Yang liquid forming drop after drop in his dantian. The Yang energy overflowing from Dragon Confinement Ravine seeped through the pores of his skin, working in tandem from inside and out.

The stirring of Primordial Qi within him grew ever more intense, more violent. Any discerning observer witnessing Yang Kai’s current state would surely be astonished beyond measure. Never before had a Body Tempering Realm cultivator’s internal energy been so dense.

Typically, Body Tempering Realm practitioners possess narrow meridians and limited dantian capacity, incapable of withstanding such vast and majestic energy.

The sheer magnitude of this energy fluctuation alone rivaled that of an Open Origin Realm cultivator, yet Yang Kai was still only at the eighth stage of Body Tempering.

At this moment, Yang Kai also felt a pressure—indescribable yet palpable—like an invisible shackling force imposed by the heavens and earth upon him. Without breaking this restraint, no breakthrough was possible.

The scorching True Yang Yuan Qi burned at this unseen fetter. As time passed, Yang Kai sensed the barrier gradually thinning, the breakthrough imminent. His mind sharpened, and the True Yang Technique accelerated.

Boom! With a resounding crack, it was as if a chain had been broken. His entire body felt light, all pressure and discomfort vanished. Yang Kai was filled with a refreshing clarity.

Body Tempering Realm, Ninth Stage! Standing just beyond the threshold of the Open Origin Realm.

Though he had broken through, the previous state of enlightenment lingered. Yang Kai moved casually, and the ten drops of Yang liquid stored in his dantian began to whirl, dispersing in all directions, permeating his internal organs, flesh, and meridians.

The Yang Flame power within the Yang liquid ignited, burning away impurities within his body, tempering his organs and meridians.

Just as refined steel requires countless hammerings to form, so too must a cultivator’s body be forged. Each breakthrough into a new great realm is accompanied by the influx of heavenly energy to temper the flesh, enabling a tremendous surge in strength.

Yang Kai’s breakthrough was but a minor stage, with no surplus heavenly energy to draw upon, but the Yang liquid within served the same purpose.

After a long while, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes. He could feel the immense progress this breakthrough had granted him; his strength was no longer comparable to what it had been before.

If he were to encounter Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao now, Yang Kai was confident he could easily slay them without even using the Yang liquid.

Beyond the increase in strength, Yang Kai also faintly grasped a trace of enlightenment, though it was too subtle and profound to comprehend fully. He would have to wait for future breakthroughs to understand it better.

His meridians were suffused with True Yang Yuan Qi, but his dantian felt empty.

Upon careful inspection, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

All the painstaking effort of so many days had vanished in an instant! The ten drops of Yang liquid formed from the three Three Yang Fruits, plus the one drop he had previously condensed, were now completely gone—fully absorbed during the breakthrough.

Though his body had greatly benefited, the Yang liquid was depleted.

Yet this mattered little. As long as he had money, acquiring Yang liquid was simple—just buy some Yang-attributed rare treasures and absorb them directly.

The only problem was that Yang Kai was utterly broke. Aside from the spoils taken from slaying Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao, he possessed nothing of value.

Sitting still, pondering, an idea suddenly struck him.

He could not afford those rare treasures, but could he not at least afford seeds?

The successful precedent of the Three Yang Fruit tree stood before him. With the extraordinary power of Yang liquid, obtaining spirit fruits was easy, provided one had the right seeds.

Yet seeds were scarce. Yang Kai had searched the Black Wind Trade Market for half a day before, but found no one selling seeds. This was understandable—planting spirit herbs and trees required not only a suitable environment and meticulous care but also many years before yielding results.

Who would bother with such trouble? Those with the time and energy preferred to cultivate. Without demand, there was no market.

Yang Kai resolved to buy seeds—and buy in large quantities!

With determination, he left Lingxiao Pavilion and headed toward the Black Wind Trade Market.

Though this was only his second visit, Yang Kai moved with ease and familiarity. After more than half a month, the market remained bustling as ever, with cultivators coming and going like schools of fish crossing a river. The stalls displayed a dazzling array of rare treasures, overwhelming the senses.

After circling through the lively stalls, Yang Kai found no seeds for sale. Prepared for this, he was not disappointed. Following his memory, he made his way to the stall run by the Blood Battle Gang, hoping to see if that fellow still had any extra seeds.
