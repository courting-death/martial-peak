## Chapter 275 — Who Says Alchemy Cannot Reach the Peak of Martial Arts

After a brief explanation from Xiao Fusheng, Yang Kai finally understood what was hidden within that Poison Pill.

The refinement of that medicinal cauldron's Poison Pill was not complicated, and the materials required were not precious; otherwise, there wouldn't be so many of them.

However, the greatest function of this Poison Pill was to test the purity of a person's Primordial Qi.

Alchemists were also martial artists, all possessing Primordial Qi within their bodies. Yet, this group of people treated alchemy as their primary profession, cultivating their cultivation base and increasing their strength solely to serve alchemy.

When the Poison Pill was consumed, if the Primordial Qi was pure enough, the toxins could be completely expelled from the body; otherwise, it would not be possible.

The purity of Primordial Qi was related to many factors, including the cultivation techniques practiced by a martial artist, martial skills, pills consumed, physical constitution, and various other influences.

Although those alchemists dedicated their lives to alchemy, due to various experiences, the Primordial Qi within them was mixed and impure, which was why they failed to pass Xiao Fusheng's test.

Having cultivated to this point, Yang Kai had only practiced the True Yang Technique, continuously refining his Primordial Qi. It was not surprising that the purity of his True Essence could meet Xiao Fusheng's requirements.

Dong Qingyan's situation was similar. She practiced fire attribute techniques, and the Dong Family was affluent. At the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, her family spent many rare treasures to help her condense her True Essence, ensuring her Primordial Qi was naturally not too mixed.

After finishing speaking, Xiao Fusheng sighed bitterly, "In fact, that jar of Poison Pill I have, if taken by alchemists, 99% of them would fail the test. Because they do not take the purity of Primordial Qi seriously. When refining pills, many alchemists must personally test the medicinal properties, and with various medicinal effects clashing within their bodies, how could their Primordial Qi be too pure? But if those with outstanding talent who practiced fire or Yang attributes were to take it, it might be a different story."

Yang Kai suddenly realized why he was able to dispel the toxins faster than Dong Qingyan; it turned out there was this layer of reason.

However, who among those participating in Xiao Fusheng's test was not an alchemist? Only a martial artist like Yang Kai, who had a special purpose, would dare to try.

It was indeed difficult to find such an heir among alchemists.

Dong Qingyan passing the test smoothly was also thanks to the Dong Family not supporting her in alchemy over the years. If she had started learning alchemy from a young age, she would likely have ended in regret this time.

"The path of an alchemist has been misled by many, and I have also erred!" Xiao Fusheng sighed deeply, expressing an indescribable sense of loneliness and regret.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows and pondered, "Master, if what you say is true, wouldn't it be better to cultivate an outstanding child from a young age?"

"Child..." Xiao Fusheng shook his head at the words, smiling bitterly, "I cannot wait that long."

Yang Kai's heart stirred. He looked at Xiao Fusheng in surprise.

The two beautiful women also wore expressions of sadness, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Dong Qingyan, perceptive as always, exclaimed in shock, "Master, you..."

Xiao Fusheng chuckled lightly, his expression calm, "It's nothing. I can still live a few more years, but in this lifetime, I fear I won't be able to break through to the Upper-Level of the Mystic Realm. I truly wish to see what the Spirit Realm above the Mystic Realm is like."

His words were filled with longing and regret.

His expression suddenly brightened, full of vigor as he declared, "I may not be able to do it, but I want to cultivate a Spirit Realm alchemist to break the shackles of the world lacking Spirit Realm practitioners. This will depend on your efforts!"

It was precisely for this reason that Xiao Fusheng wanted to take on disciples. He had devoted his life to alchemy but had never been able to break through to the Spirit Realm; how could he not feel regret?

He possessed unparalleled knowledge of alchemy and had personally experienced the path of alchemy. He firmly believed he could cultivate a disciple who would surpass him!

Noticing Xiao Fusheng's determination, Yang Kai struggled for a moment before solemnly saying, "Senior, please forgive me. I did not come to Hidden Cloud Peak to learn alchemy."

Xiao Fusheng frowned, looking at Yang Kai in surprise.

"I wish to reach the peak of martial arts. If I were to learn alchemy, I fear I would be distracted and unable to focus," Yang Kai said sincerely. His purpose for coming to Hidden Cloud Peak was merely to leverage the geographical advantage to get closer to Dan Sheng Peak.

Xiao Fusheng opened his heart. Yang Kai did not want to deceive him too much; he certainly could not reveal his intention to go to Dan Sheng Peak, but he also could not learn alchemy, or he would likely find himself in trouble.

Hearing Yang Kai's words, the two beautiful women immediately frowned, casting displeased glances at him.

On the contrary, Xiao Fusheng laughed, "Who says alchemy cannot lead to the peak of martial arts?"

Yang Kai's expression shook, deep in thought.

During his first meeting with Xiao Fusheng, the old man left a deep impression on Yang Kai. Although he was half-buried in the ground, that spirited attitude, wanting to compete with the heavens, was something many young people lacked.

The master did not require him and Dong Qingyan to bow as disciples; he simply stayed there.

As a few days passed, Xiao Fusheng rarely showed himself. Dong Qingyan insisted on addressing him as Master, while Yang Kai only referred to him as Elder Xiao.

Although the two beautiful women had shown some displeasure towards Yang Kai's attitude and tone that day, their conduct was excellent, and they did not make things difficult for him. They continued to greet him with smiles daily, taking care of the living arrangements at Hidden Cloud Peak and quietly contributing.

One day, Xiao Fusheng summoned Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan to his room.

The two stood before Elder Xiao, Yang Kai appearing calm, while Dong Qingyan seemed somewhat reserved.

Xiao Fusheng smiled faintly and nodded, "In the past few days, I haven't taught you anything, but I have been observing your characters. Although time reveals a person's heart, I have lived long enough to have some insight. Yan'er, you have a kind nature and come from a prestigious family, yet you do not possess the spoiled temperament of those young ladies. Even if you inherit my mantle, I believe you will not go astray. If you are willing, I can accept you as my disciple."

"I am willing!" Dong Qingyan quickly replied, her face filled with joy.

Xiao Fusheng nodded in satisfaction and then turned to Yang Kai, "You are different. Although you are young, you have endured many hardships, and your character is much more mature than your peers. Your True Essence is like a sword, sharp and imposing; you must have killed quite a few people. However, despite your ruthless methods, you do not kill the innocent recklessly!"

Yang Kai silently nodded, not refuting.

The old man was astute, and his insight was indeed sharp.

"Your pursuits differ from Yan'er’s, so even if your qualifications are better than hers, I will not force you. You have your own path to walk, so I will not accept you as a disciple, nor will I pass on the alchemy techniques to you."

"Master!" Dong Qingyan exclaimed, thinking he was about to dismiss Yang Kai.

Xiao Fusheng waved his hand, smiling slightly, "However... since you have passed my test, it is a kind of fate. I can impart some other things to you. For now, you can stay with Yan'er at Hidden Cloud Peak."

"Thank you, Elder Xiao!" Yang Kai couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. If Xiao Fusheng truly wanted to send him down the mountain, he would have had no way to resist. Now that he heard he could stay at Hidden Cloud Peak, he naturally felt relieved.

With this, he could act without psychological burdens.

"This is a set of techniques for you two to practice. However, remember, you only need to practice for one hour each day at most," Xiao Fusheng handed over a small booklet and then closed his eyes in silence.

Yang Kai took it and exited with Dong Qingyan.

Half a day later, the two became familiar with the techniques in the booklet and returned to their respective rooms to cultivate.

It was unclear what kind of technique it was, as it had no name, and the operation route was quite strange, requiring the simultaneous operation of one hundred and eight meridians within the body, a number that was astonishing.

Yang Kai studied it with the Earth Demon for a long time. Even with the Earth Demon's vast knowledge, he could not comprehend the purpose of this technique, only knowing it was harmless.

Xiao Fusheng had little time left, and now that he had finally accepted Dong Qingyan as a disciple, he would naturally not harm her.

Thinking this, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the bed, adjusted his breathing, and began to practice this unknown technique.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

During this month, Yang Kai rarely enjoyed a leisurely life. Each morning, he would rise with the dawn and practice the Proud Bone Golden Body technique, followed by an hour of the unknown technique.

Then came his own arduous training.

Days passed quickly and were fulfilling.

Yang Kai made several attempts to inquire about Dan Sheng Peak, but without suitable reasons or excuses, he often found himself chased away before he could get close, leaving him at a loss.

The two beautiful women on Hidden Cloud Peak treated Yang Kai well, preparing medicinal meals daily for him and Dong Qingyan. Their cooking skills were excellent, turning simple ingredients into exquisite dishes.

During this time, Dong Qingyan's relationship with the two beautiful women also greatly improved. After all, they were all women, making it easier for them to interact.

After a month of hard training, Yang Kai's strength had not increased much. The unknown technique did not enhance his Primordial Qi and had no miraculous effects. However, as Elder Xiao had said, this technique only required one hour of practice each day; any longer, and Yang Kai's True Essence would boil like boiling water, causing unbearable pain.

One day, a month later, after Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan finished breakfast, the two beautiful women smiled as they handed over two medicinal baskets.

"Aunt Xiang, what is this for?" Dong Qingyan asked in confusion as she took the basket and divided one for Yang Kai.

Aunt Xiang smiled, "The Master has a task for you two."

"Really!" Dong Qingyan was overjoyed. During this time, apart from cultivating, she had been cultivating, and Xiao Fusheng had not taught her a single bit of alchemy, which made her quite frustrated.

She had joined Hidden Cloud Peak to learn alchemy, but until now, she had not even seen the shadow of a pill. How could she not be anxious? Now that she heard her Master had a task for her, she naturally wanted to perform well to win his favor and then take the opportunity to request to learn alchemy.

"What task?" Yang Kai asked indifferently.

"The Master wants you to gather some herbs," Aunt Xiang said with a smile, listing the names of the herbs to be collected and detailing their living habits and appearances.

Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan quietly noted them down and set off with the medicinal baskets on their backs.
