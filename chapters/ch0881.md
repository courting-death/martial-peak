## Chapter 881 — Reentering the Starry Sky

After watching for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly gave a light, surprised sound. “There are still people here?”

Among the buildings of the War Soul Hall, a small number of martial artists walked about, looking around as if they were searching for something.

“Oh, those are disciples of my Netherworld Sect; they’re searching here with the War Soul Hall’s own disciples to see if there’s anything left worth taking,” Wu Jie said with a smile.

Yang Kai nodded and pointed downward. “I want this place. Sect Master Wu, when you return tell your disciples below not to wreck it.”

“Yes.” Wu Jie hurriedly replied. Although he didn’t know what Yang Kai intended to do with this abandoned foundation, he didn’t ask.

He spoke little and acted more, which was why Wu Jie understood how to read the situation better than Zhang Ao and Cao Guan.

“Let’s go check Poxuan Palace next.” There was nothing else below that required special attention, so Yang Kai waved his hand.

Wu Jie led the way once more.

After a short while, nearly two hundred li away, the three arrived above Poxuan Palace.

“This is Zhang Ao’s territory,” Wu Jie said, pointing below. “It’s quite a bit better than the War Soul Hall or my Netherworld Sect.”

Yang Kai observed calmly and found the place indeed fine; though not on par with the Sacred Land’s Nine Peaks, it was still a rare good location.

There was reason for Poxuan Palace to be established here.

“Saint Lord, I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave.” After a moment, Wu Jie suddenly spoke.

“Very well, Sect Master Wu, feel free.” Yang Kai nodded.

With a brief apology, Wu Jie quickly departed.

Watching his vanishing figure, Li Rong pressed her lips into a smile. “Though this fellow looks a bit sinister, he’s actually pretty decent. But why was he in such a hurry to leave? It’s like he thinks we mean him harm.”

“Because he knows what I’m about to do…” Yang Kai chuckled. “If he doesn’t want to see too many secrets, he’d best leave quickly.”

Li Rong was taken aback.

“Let’s go see!” Yang Kai flashed and flew straight toward a spot below.

Poxuan Palace covered a vast area. Behind the sect master’s main hall, Yang Kai and Li Rong descended into a stone forest where pillars of varying heights rose up in disorder, appearing random and irregular.

“Li Rong, where’s that Blood Essence Stone?” Yang Kai asked as he turned his head.

“Still with me.” Li Rong replied, producing the Blood Essence Stone and handing it over.

The last time the Blood Essence Stone had absorbed a great deal of fresh blood to form potent blood qi, but after using it to heal members of the Ancient Demon Clan the blood qi had been exhausted; now the stone showed no trace of energy.

Yang Kai held the Blood Essence Stone and scanned the surroundings.

“Master, what are you looking for?” Li Rong studied the area for a while and asked thoughtfully.

“I’m looking for the gate to the starry sky.” Yang Kai replied in a low voice.

“The gate to the starry sky?” Li Rong’s expression turned grave as she suddenly recalled what Zhang Ao had said before he died and realized, “You mean… the gate to the starry sky is hidden here?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded. “I glimpsed part of Zhang Ao’s memory—he indeed found that Blood Essence Stone in this stone forest, though I don’t know the exact spot. Help me look around and see if anything nearby stands out, especially places with unusual ore.”

“Do you really think you can enter the starry sky? That’s just a legend…”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai asked with a chuckle.

“I don’t know.” Li Rong shook her head slowly. “I was born in Mogu Castle and never even saw the ordinary sun, moon, or stars. I only left a few months ago, never mind the starry sky; it all sounds impossible.”

“Why?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Because even the strongest masters can only ascend tens of thousands of zhang into the sky—beyond that they are powerless. This continent seems to exert an invisible pull that keeps people from leaving. No one has ever truly departed. How could anyone enter the starry sky? Those stories must just be legends.”

Yang Kai said nothing further, only grinned. “Search. If we find it, I’ll take you to see it.”

Li Rong’s eyes brightened; Yang Kai did not seem to be joking, and she nodded at once. “Good!”

The two separated and began to search the stone forest carefully.

This stone forest should be considered a forbidden area of Poxuan Palace; Yang Kai felt many hidden restrictions here—vicious traps tied to those seals that could cause great trouble if triggered.

Those restrictions were likely set by Zhang Ao.

But under Yang Kai’s vast will, the hidden seals were laid bare; he had no fear of accidentally setting them off.

After the time it takes a stick of incense to burn and finding nothing, Yang Kai frowned and scanned the area. Just as he was at a loss, Li Rong’s call came from not far away.

Startled, he hurried in that direction.

A moment later he reached Li Rong.

“Master, this place feels strange!” Li Rong pointed to several stone pillars of different heights. “And I found these nearby!”

As she spoke she handed him the fragments she’d picked up.

Yang Kai took them and examined them closely; his eyes lit up and he said with certainty, “This has to be the place.”

The fragments Li Rong found looked like products of the starry sky, and the shape and arrangement of these pillars matched the vague fragment of Zhang Ao’s memory.

“But there’s nothing special here,” Li Rong said, puzzled.

“If it were obvious at a glance, Zhang Ao wouldn’t have discovered this secret by accident.” Yang Kai said as he stepped forward and patted the pillars.

At a glance they weren’t different from the nearby pillars, but compared carefully these were of much harder material—something other than ordinary stone.

Recalling the scenes he’d seen in Zhang Ao’s memory, Yang Kai finally reached out and flung several streams of pure True Yuan into one of the nearby pillars.

The True Yuan disappeared as soon as it entered, as if the pillar had devoured it.

Yang Kai waited a moment; when there was still no reaction and he was growing impatient, a sudden buzzing sound rang out.

He leapt back to stand beside Li Rong and watched the front intently.

Buzz—buzz—buzz…

The pillars trembled as if gripped by an invisible hand, shaking and making the ground feel unstable.

Rings of ripples, visible to the eye, radiated from the pillars and spread outward like shockwaves.

Countless ripples collided at the center of those pillars, producing unexpected changes.

The central space within the pillars seemed to turn into a mirror, reflecting the ripples’ motion.

With a crash, when the ripples reached a certain density the mirror shattered and a black, fathomless hole suddenly opened before Yang Kai and Li Rong, gaping like a ferocious beast.

Li Rong involuntarily felt her scalp prickle.

Yang Kai, however, wore an exhilarated expression—he felt a special aura from the hole, one that belonged to the starry sky!

“Go!” Without hesitation, Yang Kai grabbed Li Rong and dove in.

In the next instant an overwhelming pressure assaulted them from all sides like a tidal wave; Yang Kai felt his bones creak as his flesh tensed to resist that annihilating force.

Li Rong cried out and immediately activated her Demon God Transformation upon sensing the power.

Strange demon marks crawled across her lovely face, giving her a wild, fierce beauty.

“Don’t be afraid!” Yang Kai chuckled to calm her.

Li Rong’s cheeks flushed and she relaxed bit by bit, covering her mouth as she looked around with bright eyes.

Stars dotted the surroundings, magnificent and wondrous; they stood in the void with no ground beneath their feet—looking down there was nothing but those scattered stars.

It felt as though they had already left Tongxuan Continent.

“This is the starry sky?” Li Rong cried.

“Yes. Isn’t it marvelous?” Yang Kai nodded slightly, bearing the immense starry sky power with calm composure.

“Master, you seem like you’ve been here before?”

“Once. It was in the starry sky that I rose to the Transcendent Realm.”

Li Rong’s eyes trembled.

From his words she gleaned something extraordinary.

When her master had been here before, he was only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. How had he withstood the starry sky’s enormous, terrifying power?

Li Rong felt that if she hadn’t used her Demon God Transformation she would have been crushed by the pressure here; such a force that could pulverize anyone wasn’t something a peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivator could withstand.

“But the place I visited last time doesn’t seem to be this one.” Yang Kai looked around and confirmed.

The last time he came his feet had stood on a blue planet—which Zhai Yao had identified as Tongxuan Continent.

But here there was no such scene; after passing through that stone forest they must have been transported elsewhere.

Looking back, the void passage leading to the stone forest remained behind them; he didn’t know how long it would last, though from its aura it should hold for some days.

Yang Kai relaxed and beckoned, “Follow me.”

Li Rong hurried to keep up, maintaining her Demon God Transformation as she surveyed the surroundings.

Few have ever set foot in the legendary starry sky, and Li Rong was naturally filled with curiosity.

The two released their divine senses outward, covering a range of a hundred li to scout for any movements.

“Master, what are you looking for?” After following Yang Kai in aimless flight for a long time, Li Rong finally asked.

“Some meteorites,” Yang Kai explained. “Meteorites in the starry sky often contain rare minerals and unusual stones. Since we’ve come this far, search and see if we can get any unexpected finds—perhaps something as precious as the Blood Essence Stone.”

“Oh!” Understanding their goal, Li Rong began searching with renewed vigor.
