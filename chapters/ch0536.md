## Chapter 536 — Return Your Freedom

“I have said before, the day I ascend to the Divine Roaming Realm, I will return your freedom!” Yang Kai smiled lightly, his expression gentle as he looked at Leng Shan’s doubtful face. “Now, it is time to fulfill that promise.”

Leng Shan’s eyes brightened instantly, filled with anticipation.

Several years ago, during that foreign pilgrimage, she and Zi Mo from Tianlang Kingdom had both been branded with soul imprints by Yang Kai, forced to obey him. At first, both Leng Shan and Zi Mo tried every means to break free from Yang Kai’s control, but after sharing a life-or-death ordeal, Leng Shan gradually changed her view and attitude toward him.

Later, inside the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, Yang Kai turned the tide single-handedly, saving seven or eight disciples of Ghost King Valley. Leng Shan was deeply grateful.

During the Succession War, when disciples from Ghost King Valley came to strongly assist, Leng Shan simply wished to repay their kindness and express gratitude for Yang Kai’s previous help toward the Ghost King Valley disciples.

She no longer cared much about the soul imprint planted in her mind by Yang Kai, whether it could be removed or not—the matter was of little consequence. After all, Yang Kai wouldn’t harm her or force her to do anything against her will through that imprint.

Although indifferent, hearing Yang Kai say this still made Leng Shan somewhat happy.

This man kept his promises.

Nodding gently at Yang Kai, Leng Shan stepped forward and sat cross-legged before him.

“Relax,” Yang Kai chuckled softly, noticing her nervousness.

The next moment, a vast and pure Divine Sense condensed and directly entered Leng Shan’s mind.

Leng Shan had now reached the Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm. Although she had not yet reached the Divine Roaming Realm, nor opened a Sea of Consciousness, as a living being, her soul was innate.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense circled inside Leng Shan’s mind and quickly found a strand of energy completely identical to his own primordial aura.

That was the soul imprint that had been implanted in Leng Shan’s body for several years!

Peeling it layer by layer, Yang Kai carefully drew the imprint out, using his primordial aura to attract it back to himself.

This was no trouble to Yang Kai, who had already ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm; it was easy.

In less than the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense and smiled: “Done.”

Leng Shan slowly opened her eyes, gazing at Yang Kai with a subtle expression.

To regain one’s freedom should be cause for celebration, yet Leng Shan felt as if something was suddenly missing, making her somewhat uneasy.

“Thank you,” she said softly as she stood.

From now on, she and Yang Kai would have no further contact. After the Succession War, she might return with her disciples to Ghost King Valley and would no longer set foot in Zhongdu or War City.

“It’s only right,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Leng Shan gave a silent smile and turned to leave.

Outside, Di Mo chuckled, “Miss Leng, congratulations.”

Unexpectedly, Leng Shan shot him a glare that left Di Mo bewildered, unsure what he had done to offend her.

“Di Mo, come in,” Yang Kai called from inside.

Di Mo hurried inside and bowed respectfully. “What orders do you have, Young Master?”

“Sit too.”

“Ah...” Di Mo was startled, immediately realizing what Yang Kai intended. His face flushed with excitement as he stared at him, whispering, “Young Master...”

“Sit if I say to sit, no need for so much nonsense.”

Quickly catching on, Di Mo scrambled to sit before Yang Kai, composed but nervous and expectant.

“Lower the Sea of Consciousness defenses,” Yang Kai said calmly.

Di Mo complied immediately.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense invaded within, searching the Sea of Consciousness for the strand of soul belonging to himself.

Moments later, both opened their eyes simultaneously; Yang Kai’s expression was strange, while Di Mo looked extremely embarrassed.

“Heh heh...” Yang Kai smiled wryly at Di Mo. “I think I have just seen some very interesting things.”

Upon invading Di Mo’s Sea of Consciousness, all he saw was a flood of blood-red.

Di Mo’s Sea of Consciousness was wholly irrigated by blood, filled with incomparable sinister demonic energy. Even Yang Kai’s strong Divine Sense felt uneasy within it.

While traversing this blood-like Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai vaguely caught some of Di Mo’s stray thoughts, which even included his former ideas of being unkind to Yang Kai.

But as men, Yang Kai dared not delve too deeply—otherwise, it would be too disgusting. After locating his soul strand, he withdrew promptly.

Di Mo was deeply embarrassed. “Young Master, please forgive me. Those were old thoughts from long ago. Now, I am utterly loyal to you; this heart is witnessed by Heaven and Earth, by the sun and moon.”

“Enough,” Yang Kai stood. “You don’t need to prove loyalty. If I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t have given you freedom.”

“Your wisdom humbles me!” Di Mo was touched. “From now on, I will serve by your side without any second thoughts.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, saying no more.

Di Mo, however, did not leave immediately; rubbing his big hands, he seemed hesitant to speak.

Yang Kai turned his head, waiting.

“Young Master, I must admit a fault,” Di Mo smiled awkwardly.

“If it’s about those old thoughts, there is no need,” Yang Kai replied.

“No, it concerns your method of controlling others.”

“That is your method.”

“Yes, yes, my method,” Di Mo hurried to admit. Whether himself, Leng Shan, or Zi Mo, it was Di Mo’s doing that allowed Yang Kai to control the three.

During this, Yang Kai only provided a strand of his soul; the rest was Di Mo’s effort.

Back then, Yang Kai’s power was low, unable to implant imprints using Divine Sense alone.

“My method... how to describe it... has its advantages and disadvantages,” Di Mo glanced at Yang Kai. Seeing him silent, he pressed on, “The benefit is convenience. Young Master probably noticed that with my help, only a strand of your soul is needed to easily control others.”

“What about the downside?” Yang Kai pressed, this was new to him.

Di Mo scratched his head awkwardly, then confessed, “The downside is all or nothing...”

“Explain clearly.”

“If the controlled person's Divine Sense is destroyed, Young Master you might also be hurt,” Di Mo bared all.

Yang Kai was stunned, then realized: “Because a strand of my soul remains in their mind, right?”

“Exactly. Fortunately, neither I nor Miss Leng Shan have been harmed during these days,” Di Mo wiped cold sweat from his brow in a low voice. “But... it seems there is a girl named Zi Mo...”

Yang Kai chuckled wickedly, understanding Di Mo’s meaning.

“If Young Master is concerned, I can go to Tianlang Kingdom now and bring her back,” Di Mo offered quickly.

“Do you have the ability?” Yang Kai glared at him.

Though Tianlang Kingdom was not as vast as the Great Han territory, it was still a gathering place for martial artists. The Senluo Palace, where Zi Mo resides, was a superpower within Tianlang Kingdom, even boasting residents beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Even Di Mo couldn’t snatch someone from Senluo Palace.

He had withheld this from Yang Kai before, likely hoping to use it against him. Yang Kai was keen enough to perceive this and had no intention to pursue the matter now; his frankness reflected his loyalty.

Moreover, to Yang Kai, it wasn’t a major concern.

As long as Zi Mo remained alive, he would not be harmed.

“I’ll visit when I have time,” Yang Kai sighed.

“Understood,” Di Mo replied with guilt, nodding.

Having one’s soul strand implanted inside another’s mind was never ideal. Yang Kai could only wait for the Succession War to end and see if there was leisure to look for Zi Mo.

Thinking of that bold and outgoing woman, Yang Kai’s expression twisted strangely.

Back then, in that foreign land, he had nearly taken her...

Youthful recklessness, Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly.

...

Two days later, at dawn, an unexpected group arrived at Yang Kai’s manor.

Outside, the guards hurriedly reported. When Yang Kai arrived at the side hall, he was shocked to see Elder Yang Zhen of the main seat of the Yang Family Elder Hall, personally come.

Those who accompanied him were people Yang Kai had never met, all formidable cultivators, at least at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

There were about four or five of them.

Frowning, Yang Kai stepped forward and saluted, “Greetings, Elder.”

Yang Zhen inclined his head slightly, his demeanor serious.

“Elder, who are these gentlemen?” Yang Kai asked, looking upon the others.

“They are all elders of the Yang Family,” Yang Zhen explained.

The elders in the Elder Hall were not limited to the few old fellows Yang Kai had seen—those men had served the Yang Family well in their youth and were now placed in elder positions to oversee the Elder Hall, spending their remaining years handling minor affairs.

True control over Yang Family matters lay with another cadre of elders, those who wielded real power.

Like the ones before him now.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, greeting each in turn.

Those few bore haughty expressions, offering no response.

Yang Kai paid them no mind; the upper echelon of the Yang Family was mostly like this. Not only the Yang Family, but all Eight Great Families behaved thus.

“May I ask, Elder, what business brings you to my manor?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice, a bad premonition stirring.

Previously, he had been summoned back over issues with the Blood Servants; this time, multiple elders had come in person, undoubtedly indicating graver matters.

“Don’t play coy!” Yang Zhen snorted coldly, his tone authoritative. “You openly killed the heirs of the Nan and Xiang Families before tens of thousands in War City. Your behavior defies all laws. Do you think yourself some great figure?”

“Is it just about this?” Yang Kai looked at Yang Zhen in surprise, chuckling lightly. “The elders seem to be blowing this out of proportion.”

“Blowing it out of proportion?” A man in a blue robe on the left snapped coldly, “Those were heirs of two first-rate families, not just some random street dogs!”
