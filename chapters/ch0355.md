## Chapter 355 — Apology

"Apologize?" Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard, adept in the Divine Roaming Realm, were momentarily taken aback upon hearing this.

The young people present were equally shocked, staring blankly at Xiang Chu.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered, and an inexplicable smile formed on his lips.

"Young Master Xiang..." Xie Rong, missing several teeth and speaking through the gaps, called out with utmost humiliation, hoping Xiang Chu would stand up for him, but upon meeting Xiang Chu's penetrating gaze, he quickly swallowed his words.

With a warm smile, Xiang Chu repeatedly cupped his hands towards Yang Kai. "This friend, Xiang Chu, failed to manage the situation well, causing the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower to suffer grievances. Now that your anger has subsided, as a mediator, shouldn't friends take a step back? My sincerest apologies, truly sorry. I guarantee that this kind of incident will never happen again."

While he smiled and bowed apologetically, his words were sincere and his expression genuine, almost as if he were the one at fault.

Xiang Chu's humility caught everyone off guard.

The younger generation from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower felt a surge of relief and elation. They were completely unaware of the peril Yang Kai had just faced and thought this was merely a common brawl.

Xie Rong and Li Fu, who often ridiculed them, had just encountered a huge setback, and now Xiang Chu was favoring them; how could they remain dissatisfied?

Only Fang Ziqi and the sisters from the Hu Family glanced thoughtfully at Yang Kai, sensing that something was amiss.

From a distance of over ten zhang, Yang Kai's intense gaze locked onto Xiang Chu. It was only at this moment that he truly understood what it meant to have deep schemes.

The two experts behind Xiang Chu had been monitoring everything with their Divine Sense, and he himself had been observing closely, yet he still pretended to be unaware as he approached.

This man was indeed two-faced. Sweet on the outside, deadly on the inside.

"Is there anything else you find unsatisfactory, friend? If you have any requests, feel free to speak up," Xiang Chu smiled slightly.

"If Young Master Xiang can uphold justice, I, of course, will be satisfied!" Yang Kai grinned.

"That’s good to hear. That’s good to hear!" Xiang Chu's expression eased, and he laughed heartily. "Let’s downplay this matter, making a big deal small, and a small matter nonexistent. We are all part of the same path; there’s no need to target each other. We must focus on our true enemy, the Cangyun Evil Land. Friends, would you please release them? This certainly does hinder the view!"

"Alright!" Yang Kai nodded, his feet launching out directly.

With a pair of loud thuds, Xie Rong and Li Fu were sent flying back into their camp like broken sacks, caught by their respective elders, but not before a few of their ribs were kicked in the process.

Xiang Chu's eyes narrowed. Yang Kai flashed him a grin, utterly unafraid.

"You brat..." Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard shouted angrily.

"Apologize!" Yang Kai turned to look at them, his gaze sharp as a cold wind, his tone unyielding.

The two of them were furious, their eyes nearly bursting with rage, but they eventually turned to Xiang Chu, whose expression twitched briefly before he subtly nodded.

Seeing Xiang Chu gesture, the two, though reluctant, had no choice but to save face. They said in a muffled voice, "We apologize to the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower for what happened earlier! I will sternly discipline my disciples, and I won't let them cause trouble again!"

"Get lost!" Yang Kai sneered.

"Leave!" Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard held onto Xie Rong and Li Fu, leading a group of incredibly aggrieved young disciples as they hurried away.

Once they had departed, Xiang Chu smiled warmly at the sisters from the Hu Family before taking his leave politely.

By the campfire, there was a moment of silence before the disciples of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower erupted into laughter, looking at Yang Kai with immense admiration, each one seeing him as a hero.

Though the people here belonged to three different factions, now that they were together, there was no distinction between sects. United in one purpose, they had long since tied themselves together; Yang Kai had forcefully avenged them, and they felt invigorated and excited.

Only Guan Chile wore a frown, his expression somewhat worried.

The sisters from the Hu Family quietly approached, with Hu Jiao’er softly asking, "What exactly happened earlier?"

"Nothing much," Yang Kai lightly shook his head. The events that transpired were well understood by those in the know, and there was no need to bring it up.

Fang Ziqi joined them, though he was also puzzled, he asked no further questions, only suggesting, "Shall we continue drinking?"

"Sure!" Yang Kai chuckled.

Inside Xiang Chu's residence, Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard had settled the injured Xie Rong and Li Fu and entered the room.

As the door opened, Xiang Chu strode in briskly and sat down in a chair, with two guardians standing silently by his sides.

"Greetings, Young Master Xiang!" Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard quickly paid their respects, their expressions filled with displeasure and anger.

Xiang Chu cast a fleeting glance at them, a smile forming as he asked, "So, why don't you tell me what happened earlier? Why is that kid still bouncing around?"

After exchanging looks, Leiguang and the expert from Feihong Courtyard recounted the events.

Upon hearing this, Xiang Chu's eyes narrowed, and in a low voice, he said, "Are you saying that not only did you fail to overcome his Divine Sense technique, but it was also harmed by his technique?"

Both of them flushed, their resolve hardening as they responded affirmatively.

Leiguang's expert quickly added, "I know this excuse is somewhat flimsy, but it’s the truth; please trust us, Young Master Xiang!"

"I understand; I didn't doubt you," Xiang Chu nodded slightly and suddenly turned to his two guardians. "What do you think?"

One of them replied, "If that's the case, he must possess a considerable Divine Soul treasure."

The other added, "It might even be two! One for defense and another for attack; otherwise, at his cultivation level, he couldn't possibly use Divine Sense techniques!"

"Indeed," Xiang Chu nodded slightly. "I feel the same."

Suddenly, he broke into a bright smile. "Interesting! He actually has a Divine Soul treasure; that’s not something just anyone can possess."

Leiguang's expert's expression turned icy. He quietly asked, "Young Master, shall we go and..."

"Do you have the capability to do that?" Xiang Chu snorted.

"As long as we can detain Guan Chile, we have complete confidence in taking that kid's head!"

"No need, we've already startled the snake!" Xiang Chu slowly shook his head, his expression slightly displeased.

"Yes."

"By the way, how are Xie Rong and Li Fu's injuries?" Xiang Chu inquired with concern.

Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard showed gratitude as they quickly responded, "That kid struck quite hard. Fortunately, he left some leeway; they won’t lose their lives and will recover after resting for a few days."

Xiang Chu nodded and gestured to the guardians behind him. One of them casually tossed a bottle to the experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard.

Xiang Chu said, "This is a healing pill specifically made by the Xiang Family. Let them take it with warm water once you return. They will recover in about ten days."

"Thank you, Young Master Xiang!" Both were overjoyed, repeatedly expressing their gratitude.

"Go back," Xiang Chu waved his hand, and the two hurriedly took their leave.

"Young Master," once Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard had left, an elder behind Xiang Chu hesitated for a moment and said, "Why are you being so polite to that young man? He seems somewhat extraordinary, but he doesn't deserve for you to hold back like this."

Xiang Chu smiled faintly and slowly rose. "From the first moment I saw him, I knew he was strong. Did you not realize that he was utterly fearless today? Even with both of you appearing, his momentum was fierce. His demeanor was indifferent; clearly, he is not an ordinary person. I can't gauge his background yet, so I prefer to hold off on dealing with him for now. Perhaps in a few days."

"But after a few days, once that decisive battle is over, we'll have to return. Young Master, don't you have your sights set on the sisters from the Hu Family?"

Xiang Chu nodded with a smile. "Yes, that’s right. So before we leave, this matter needs to be resolved; otherwise, once we part ways, meeting again will be difficult."

Today's events were also due to the closeness between the sisters from the Hu Family and Yang Kai. Xiang Chu intended to eliminate Yang Kai by inciting Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard to provoke him. Once Yang Kai was dead, he would naturally reprimand Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard, which would lead to the sisters from the Hu Family being grateful.

Little did he expect things wouldn't go as planned, for Yang Kai turned out to be so formidable.

Yawning, Xiang Chu said, "Let’s leave it at that for now. I’m tired; I’ll go rest."

The two guardians exchanged glances, both confused about their young master's intentions. Tonight's actions seemed so urgent, yet he now appeared indifferent—truly perplexing.

The following days passed peacefully.

Although the standoff with the Cangyun Evil Land continued, everyone on both sides was focused on the final battle, so no conflicts could arise.

After the significant losses from that night, Leiguang and the experts from Feihong Courtyard dared not provoke trouble again, and even other forces, when meeting the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower, would avoid them.

Yang Kai had been in seclusion, seizing the rare quiet environment for cultivation without interruptions from outside affairs, and naturally, he would not slack off.

After half a month of cultivation, his True Yuan Realm at the Sixth Stage had continually stabilized and improved, closing the gap to the Seventh Stage.

Half a month later.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er rushed into Yang Kai’s place of seclusion.

"What’s going on?" Yang Kai looked at the two sisters and asked.

"We have to go out," Hu Jiao’er said with a charming smile. "Xiang Chu said this is the last mission. Once we complete it, we can go home."

Mentioning returning home excited the two sisters immensely.

"I’ll go with you!" Yang Kai exclaimed, rising.

Hu Jiao’er’s expression darkened, and she quickly said, "You can’t go."

"Why not?"

Hu Mei’er explained, "Your identity is unclear. If you go with us, it will only raise others' suspicions."

Hu Jiao’er nodded slightly. "Thanks to Xie Rong's mishap, many now suspect you are a spy from the Cangyun Evil Land!"

Yang Kai furrowed his brow slightly, pondering as he looked at them. "How many people will be going this time?"

"Everyone is going, leaving just a few to guard this place. You should stay here and wait for us to return; it will be short, at most two to three days," Hu Jiao’er teased, "Once this mission is completed, I'll take you home!"
