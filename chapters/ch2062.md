## Chapter 2062 — Negotiation

The Jiang Family head, Jiang Lin, and many elders came out together to greet them, clearly showing Yang Kai great respect; seeing this, Yang Kai cupped his fist without arrogance and said, "A late-night visit was truly unavoidable; I apologize for troubling the head of the Jiang Family and all of you, please do not blame us."

"What kind of words are those? If Pillmaster Yang can come to my Jiang Family, it is our good fortune — we should be thanking you, not the other way around," Jiang Lin replied with extreme warmth, laughing heartily as he stepped aside and gestured, "Pillmaster Yang, please come inside and speak."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and exchanged a look with Mo Xiaoqi; under Jiang Lin's lead they walked straight into the Jiang Family compound.

In a short while they arrived at the Jiang Family's reception hall; hosts and guests took their respective seats, and servants who had received the news presented fragrant tea one by one.

Under Jiang Lin's enthusiastic hospitality, Yang Kai sipped several mouthfuls of tea and absentmindedly offered a few polite remarks.

Jiang Lin chuckled and said, "I have long heard of Pillmaster Yang of the Spiritual Pill Shop, though fate has never allowed us to meet. Who would have thought Pillmaster Yang would personally come to my Jiang Family today—it is both a surprise and a delight for me, Jiang."

Yang Kai showed a trace of astonishment and asked, "The head of the Jiang Family has heard of me?"

He had originally assumed Jiang Lin's earlier remarks were mere politeness and did not expect that he truly knew of him.

Jiang Lin smiled, "Pillmaster Yang's reputation is known to anyone of some standing in Fenglin City; to be frank, my Jiang Family has purchased quite a number of the Origin Condensing Pills you produced — many disciples have benefited. And I heard you alone saved the Spiritual Pill Shop from having to close its doors; that has long reached my ears."

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally understood.

Although he had kept a low profile during the months he refined pills at the Spiritual Pill Shop, events inside the workshop could hardly be kept from the local bigwigs' inquiries; it was not surprising they had discovered Yang Kai's existence.

"There are not many alchemists in Fenglin City, and those who can produce an Origin Condensing Pill are even fewer. Even if Pillmaster Yang did not want fame, others would have spread your name," Jiang Lin laughed, then suddenly changed tack and asked pointedly, "However, I heard Pillmaster Yang has now left the Spiritual Pill Shop? No longer refining pills for them? Is that true or not..."

Yang Kai did not try to hide it; he nodded, "That is correct. I had an agreement with Shopkeeper Kang: to refine pills for the Spiritual Pill Shop for only two months, and that term has long since expired."

"Really?" Jiang Lin cried out with joy.

Not only did Jiang Lin display delight, but the Jiang Family elders sitting nearby also reacted; each of them looked at Yang Kai with heated eyes, as if gazing upon an extraordinary beauty, as though they wished to swallow him whole.

Seeing this, Yang Kai frowned and said, "Refining pills is not my main discipline, so I have no intention of remaining in this field."

"Is that so..." Jiang Lin, crafty with age, could read the implication in Yang Kai's words and said disappointedly, "If Pillmaster Yang chooses so, it is regrettable. Erm — may I ask, what brings Pillmaster Yang to my Jiang Family this time? If there is anything we can help with, the Jiang Family will not refuse."

Although Yang Kai spoke like that, he was after all a Void King-Grade alchemist, and cultivating good relations with such a person could only benefit the Jiang Family; Jiang Lin would not miss this chance to ingratiate himself, and he suspected Yang Kai must have some request of the family.

Yang Kai contemplated for a moment and said, "Since the head of the Jiang Family asked directly, I will be frank: I came to your clan mainly to look for someone."

"Look for someone?" Jiang Lin frowned, and the other elders all looked puzzled, not knowing whom Yang Kai sought in the Jiang Family.

Jiang Lin asked, "May I know whom Pillmaster Yang seeks?"

"A young girl, about sixteen or seventeen years old, cultivation at the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm..." Yang Kai briefly described Zhang Ruoxi's appearance and some distinguishing features.

As he spoke, the ruddy-faced elder seated to his left had his eyelids twitch ever so slightly, then smoothed over at once as though nothing had happened.

Yang Kai's divine sense immediately caught that tiny detail; his mind stirred and he glanced at the elder, who promptly lowered his gaze and appeared motionless.

After hearing Yang Kai's description, Jiang Lin looked around the assembled people in turn and asked, "Does our Jiang Family have such a young girl?"

An elder seated below Jiang Lin immediately rose, cupped his fists, and said, "Replying to the family head: our Jiang Family may indeed have such a young girl, though I do not know whether she is the one Pillmaster Yang seeks."

"Very well, then bring her up for Pillmaster Yang to see; if she truly is the one you seek, my Jiang Family will of course not keep her against you," Jiang Lin declared decisively.

"No need." Before Yang Kai could speak, Mo Xiaoqi, who had been silent beside him, waved her hand and said, "The person we seek is not here."

Jiang Lin frowned, glancing at Mo Xiaoqi and then at Yang Kai with suspicion: "Pillmaster Yang, what do you mean by this? Since you came to my Jiang Family to look for someone, why say the person is not in my clan? I am truly confused by you."

"Could it be that you secretly investigated my Jiang Family beforehand, and so are so certain?" an elder suddenly remembered something and his face darkened as he spoke sternly.

The others fell silent too, their expressions icy as they looked at Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi with displeasure.

Mo Xiaoqi instantly realized she had misspoken, shrinking her head and feeling like a thief caught in the act.

Yang Kai, however, remained calm and said, "Please do not misunderstand. I placed some restraints on that young girl; as long as the distance is not too great, I can sense her through the power of those bindings, which is why I am sure."

"I see!" Jiang Lin nodded, suddenly enlightened, then asked, "If that is the case, why did Pillmaster Yang come to my Jiang Family to look for her?"

"It is like this..." Yang Kai sighed, "Someone earlier saw that young girl follow people of your Jiang Family into the Jiang Mansion, so I took the liberty of coming to inquire, but I do not know the reason; now she is not here. If any of you present know her whereabouts, please do me the favor — I would be deeply grateful."

"Someone saw her? Who saw her?" the previously speaking elder demanded sharply.

"That I cannot disclose!" Yang Kai shook his head — he could not reveal that young woman's source, and he estimated she had likely already left Fenglin City.

"A pure slander!" the elder swept his sleeves in anger, "If our Jiang Family truly had that young girl, why would we hide her? The Jiang Family would not do anything shameful."

"No one said your family would do anything shameful," Mo Xiaoqi snorted.

"You..." the Jiang elder, the First Brother, was furious.

"Enough." Jiang Lin frowned, waved his hand, and shot the elder a glare before turning to Yang Kai, "Pillmaster Yang, the claim that the young girl entered the Jiang Family was hearsay, not your own eyewitness account — how can it be trusted? Moreover, since you have that binding connection to her, you should be better positioned than anyone to know whether she is in the Jiang Mansion."

Yang Kai nodded, "I understand this may put you in a difficult position, but that young girl is very important to me."

"Very well, Pillmaster Yang, since this matter involves my Jiang Family, I cannot stand idly by. The Jiang Family has some standing in Fenglin City; we can inquire on your behalf. If we can find her whereabouts and clear our family's name, all the better — what say you, Pillmaster Yang?"

With those words Jiang Lin looked at Yang Kai with burning eyes.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; after a moment he nodded lightly, "Then I will trouble the head of the Jiang Family. If the Jiang Family can bring that young girl safely before me, I will agree to refine Spiritual Pills for the Jiang Family for one month. Ah — I forgot to tell the head of the Jiang Family: I am currently a Void King-Grade, Upper-Level alchemist; if luck is with me, producing Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills will not be impossible."

Since the day he refined the Dao Origin Pill, Yang Kai was already an alchemist of Dao Origin-Grade.

Even in the Star Realm, Dao Origin-Grade alchemists were exceedingly rare, so Yang Kai could not casually reveal that, and identifying himself as a Void King-Grade, Upper-Level alchemist was more than enough.

Sure enough, as soon as he said this, the Jiang Family members' expressions brightened.

"Void King-Grade Upper-Level?"

"Refine Spiritual Pills for one month?"

Even Jiang Lin himself grew hot-eyed; he had known that becoming a Spiritual Pill Shop alchemist required at least Void King-Grade, but he had never expected Yang Kai to be Upper-Level!

Such an alchemist was an enormous draw for any clan; if they could win his friendship and assistance, it would greatly benefit the family's future.

If he were to ascend to Dao Origin-Grade later, the Jiang Family could not hope to attach themselves to him.

For a moment Jiang Lin and many of the elders breathed faster.

"But if that little lass has suffered even the slightest harm, heh heh… whoever laid a hand on her, I’ll see their clan thrown into chaos and their entire bloodline erased."

At Yang Kai's words, the Jiang Family members' faces suddenly changed and they all turned cold and severe.

Jiang Lin’s face twitched slightly before he forced a smile and said, “If the ones who took that little girl knew she had such a connection with Pillmaster Yang, they wouldn’t dare show her the slightest discourtesy; they’d be scrambling to treat her as an honored guest.”

"Let us hope so." Yang Kai gave a slight nod, then rose and cupped his fists. "We’ve imposed enough. I, Yang, will take my leave—please, don’t trouble yourselves to see us out."

With that he gave Mo Xiaoqi a look, and the two, under the watchful eyes of the Jiang Family members, left swiftly.

The atmosphere in the reception hall grew heavy; long after Yang Kai left no one spoke, and the Jiang Family's senior figures merely exchanged looks, their eyes conveying messages that quickly passed between them.
