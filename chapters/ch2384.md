## Chapter 2384 — Leaving the City

Stepping out from Ice Heart Pavilion, Yang Kai headed straight for the location of Ling Yinqin and the others’ residences. He was going to return the repaired Purification Array to them.

He hadn’t walked for long when he suddenly sensed someone watching him. Yang Kai became highly alert and immediately turned his head to look.

Over there, a man was staring at him with wide eyes, looking as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight—utterly comical.

Pang Guang!

Yang Kai was also stunned for a moment. He hadn’t expected to run into the City Lord of Gao City here in Tongtian City.

Back when the Great Jixu Whirlpool appeared, both he and Yao Changjun were swallowed into the Jixu Secret Realm, and Pang Guang, who had been tailing them all the way, was caught up as well. At that time, however, Yao Changjun was eager to settle scores with Yang Kai, but wary that Pang Guang’s presence might pose a threat. So, he simply blasted Pang Guang away to avoid any complications.

Yang Kai had thought Pang Guang was most likely doomed. Even though he was at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, it would be hard to survive on the endless Jixu Sea.

But now it seemed he’d been mistaken. Pang Guang’s luck was truly extraordinary—he’d actually escaped the Jixu Sea and, like Yang Kai, arrived on Tongtian Island. Judging by his travel-worn appearance, he hadn’t been here long. Yang Kai had no idea how he’d managed such a feat.

Yang Kai was shocked that Pang Guang was still alive, but Pang Guang was even more shocked to see Yang Kai!

After all, when he’d left that mud island, only Yang Kai and Yao Changjun remained. Judging by the murderous look in Yao Changjun’s eyes, how could Yang Kai possibly have survived? He was certain Yang Kai would be torn to pieces by Yao Changjun’s fury.

Yet now, upon meeting again, Yang Kai was perfectly fine—full of energy and vigor!

Yao Changjun couldn’t possibly be weaker than Yang Kai, so for this brat to still be alive, there must be another reason. Or perhaps Yao Changjun had simply let him go.

Just as Pang Guang was wondering if Yao Changjun had also come to Tongtian Island, Yang Kai grinned wickedly at him, raised his thumb, and drew it across his neck — a mocking beheading gesture.

Pang Guang’s face darkened, anger surging in his heart. He thought, this brat is truly arrogant! If he weren’t unfamiliar with this area, he’d have taught Yang Kai a lesson already.

Though they saw each other, neither had any intention of speaking. They simply stared for a moment before passing by without a word.

Yang Kai wasn’t particularly wary of Pang Guang. With the power he now wielded, a First Stage of the Emperor Realm was no real threat. Besides, this was the inner city, where security was excellent. Yang Kai had stayed here for many days and had never seen anyone fighting or causing trouble. In contrast, the outer city was like a completely different world.

If Pang Guang dared to make a move in the inner city, the law enforcement team of Tongtian City wouldn’t let him off easily, even without Yang Kai fighting back.

Before long, Yang Kai found the residence where Ling Yinqin and the others lived. It wasn’t far from his own, both being mid-tier dwellings. After returning the repaired Purification Array to Ling Yinqin, he stayed as a guest for a while before leaving.

When Yang Kai returned to his own residence, Liu Qianyun hurriedly greeted him, her face full of worry.

Yang Kai had been gone for a whole day and night, making her worry that something had happened. On this unfamiliar Tongtian Island, Yang Kai was the only person she knew. If even he disappeared, she truly wouldn’t know what to do.

It felt like time had turned back several years, to when they were both forced to join Biyu Sect.

Back then, she and Yang Kai were both in the same predicament—relying on each other to survive.

She hadn’t expected that, after a few years, they’d find themselves in a similar situation again.

“Junior Sister, I’ll be leaving the city in two days.”

“Leaving the city? Where to?” Liu Qianyun exclaimed in surprise, quickly asking.

“I don’t know where yet. But yesterday, when I went to find that artifact craftsman to repair the Purification Array, he told me he had a way to leave the Jixu Secret Realm and needed my help to retrieve something.” Yang Kai didn’t hide anything from Liu Qianyun, explaining his agreement with Sangde in detail.

Hearing this, Liu Qianyun’s expression was mixed with joy and worry. She was glad Yang Kai had found a way to leave so quickly, and from Sangde’s tone, it seemed highly likely to succeed. But she was also worried, since no one could confirm if Sangde was telling the truth, and even if he was, it might be very dangerous.

“Senior Brother, do you really have to go?” Liu Qianyun asked, gently biting her red lips.

Yang Kai chuckled, “When hope is right in front of me, of course I have to seize it. Don’t worry, even if Sangde has some scheme, I’m not afraid. If his method to leave is fake, so be it. If it’s real, all the better. But you… will you leave with me, or stay here?”

The reason Yang Kai told Liu Qianyun all this was to ask about her plans.

Liu Qianyun immediately understood what Yang Kai meant. If she wanted to go with him, he’d surely take her into that mysterious space and bring her along.

She’d spent some time in that space before and knew that, while it was empty and lonely, the Spiritual Qi was extremely rich, and there was no transforming force—it could be absorbed directly. It was a truly wondrous place.

After thinking it over, Liu Qianyun said, “I’ll stay here.”

Yang Kai was surprised; her answer was unexpected. He’d thought she would choose to go with him.

Liu Qianyun smiled, “This is the inner city, so there’s no real danger. Senior Brother, you don’t need to worry. Besides, if Sangde’s method doesn’t work, I can get used to the environment here. Maybe I’ll end up living here long-term!”

Seeing that she wasn’t anxious to leave this place and even seemed to like living here, Yang Kai didn’t know what to say. He could only nod, “Just be careful. Ling Yinqin and Jiao Yi live nearby—you can spend more time with them. They’ve lived here for many years and have a lot of valuable experience.”

Liu Qianyun smiled sweetly, “I know, Senior Brother. You must come back soon. I’ll… be waiting for you here!”

As she spoke, she couldn’t help but lower her head, her cheeks flushing slightly.

Yang Kai felt the atmosphere was a bit off. He’d come to ask Liu Qianyun about her plans, but it felt like a couple saying goodbye. He quickly responded, then went to his bedroom to rest.

Two days passed in a flash.

On the morning of the third day, Yang Kai opened his eyes early, used his Divine Sense to check, and found Liu Qianyun meditating in another room. He didn’t disturb her and left the residence directly.

Everything that needed to be said had already been said—no need for more words.

As soon as he left the inner city, Yang Kai felt he was being followed.

He released his Divine Sense and detected that his stalker was just a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Although the man had cultivated a decent concealment technique, it was ineffective against Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense.

Yang Kai frowned slightly. He hadn’t been in Tongtian City long and hadn’t offended many people, except for a guy named Yu Leping, whom he’d beaten up.

At the time, a young matron had warned Yang Kai that Yu Leping was connected to the City Lord’s mansion and told him to be careful.

Now it seemed Yu Leping really had some tricks up his sleeve. As soon as Yang Kai left the inner city, he was targeted—almost certainly by someone sent by Yu Leping.

The inner city was absolutely safe, so even though Yu Leping was from the City Lord’s mansion, he wouldn’t dare make a move there. If he wanted revenge, he’d have to do it in the outer city or wait until Yang Kai left Tongtian Island.

Yang Kai didn’t pay it much mind. By now, he had a solid grasp of Tongtian Island’s situation—aside from the Island Master and Ice Heart Pavilion, whom he treated with caution, no one else here was worth worrying about.

So, even knowing he was being followed, Yang Kai pretended not to notice and headed straight for the city gate.

Meanwhile, in a teahouse in Tongtian City, Yu Leping sat with a gloomy expression. His previously injured arm had mostly healed, thanks to some Spiritual Pills. Suddenly, he took out a message bead, checked it, and his eyes lit up. Grinning wickedly, he said, “Trying to leave the city? Good! Heaven has a road you won’t take, but you insist on entering hell. I hope you’ve found a decent burial place for yourself!”

As he spoke, his Divine Sense surged, sending out a message.

As soon as he left Tongtian City, Yang Kai knew Yu Leping didn’t plan to attack him in the outer city. He could have, but the outer city was still part of Tongtian City, and it would be much easier to act freely out on the Jixu Sea.

He arrived at the dock, stood beneath a palm tree, leaned against it, and quietly waited while observing the surroundings to see who might be Sangde’s helpers.

The dock was bustling, with multi-deck ships coming and going—some returning with a good harvest, some eager to head out to sea, and some coming back empty-handed and battered.

All kinds of people, showing the full spectrum of life.

Yang Kai soon noticed a flamboyantly dressed married woman. Like him, she was alone, standing near the dock as if waiting for someone. She was plump and voluptuous, with a fiery figure, but her red lips were a bit sharp, and her eyes were cold and fierce, making her look hard to approach. Many cultivators shrank back from her aura as they passed.

She seemed to notice Yang Kai watching her. Turning to look at him, she didn’t get angry—instead, she smiled sweetly.

Yang Kai casually looked away, but both knew the other was likely one of Sangde’s invited helpers. In other words, they’d be working together soon.

Aside from this woman, Yang Kai didn’t see any other likely candidates. Or perhaps the others were just hiding—Sangde surely hadn’t invited only the two of them; there must be more.
