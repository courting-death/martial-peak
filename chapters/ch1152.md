## Chapter 1152 — Black-Hearted Money

For a time, spatial fluctuations in Tianyun City rose and fell in quick succession; never before had the Space Array been used this frequently.

At the first ripple of spatial energy, Qian Tong had barely paid it any mind—he had been preparing to walk over to Yang Kai to say a few words: next time you find something good, don’t put it up for auction; I can buy it myself.

But as the space-waves came three, five times in succession, Qian Tong’s expression slowly hardened. He stood there thinking for a moment, his face changing color, then vanished in an instant and rushed toward the palace where the Space Array was located.

Inside the main hall, the Yingyue Hall disciples tasked with guarding the Space Array wore baffled looks; they didn’t understand why so many people were using the Space Array—wasn’t the auction about to begin? Why were these people not attending the auction and instead in such a hurry to return to their own sects?

Each newcomer was a master from a major power: Leitai Sect, Battle Sky Alliance, Liuli Gate, Shuangxin Valley, Lihuo Cult… every force here rivaled Yingyue Hall, some even exceeding it.

Moreover, they all seemed mutually displeased, each one on high alert, which made the entire hall feel oppressive and tense.

The Yingyue Hall disciples feared these people might start fighting in the hall at the slightest provocation, so they dared not ask many questions; they quickly collected Saint Crystals and then let them pass.

Even so, people kept urging them to hurry up.

Dozens of people represented dozens of powers; even moving quickly took time—the Space Array’s operation, rearranging Saint Crystals, and fixing destinations weren’t matters solved in a few breaths.

Just as the disciples were scrambling, a surging aura suddenly struck from outside, causing the dozens of experts in the hall to knit their brows. They all looked toward the entrance; upon seeing who had come, they quickly cupped their fists in greeting: “Elder Qian!”

Qian Tong’s face was as dark as water as he strode in. He had originally come with a sliver of suspicion to investigate, but seeing so many waiting to use the Space Array, there was no longer any doubt about what had happened.

“Old bastard Yan, I’ll remember this! From this day on, our friendship is severed!” Qian Tong roared through gritted teeth.

Yan Pei had just claimed he’d seized the initiative, but in an instant that edge had vanished—had Yan Pei not sounded the alarm, how would all these people have gathered here?

The gathered crowd heard Qian Tong’s words and inwardly found them laughable, but no one dared to show it; Elder Qian was plainly displeased, and no one wanted to be the one to provoke him.

“Elder!” The Yingyue Hall disciples, who had been running about in a daze, all breathed sighs of relief when their elder arrived.

Such a spectacle was truly beyond what they could handle alone.

“How many have already left?” Qian Tong drew a deep breath to calm his anger and asked in a measured tone.

“Six have left already,” a Yingyue Hall disciple hurriedly answered.

“Hm.” Qian Tong nodded—six houses; his own arrival wasn’t too late. He looked over at the sixty or seventy people in the hall, snorted, and asked, “You’re all going back to your sects to gather Saint Crystals, right? You got the news from that old curmudgeon Yan, didn’t you?”

The sixty or seventy people looked sheepish—scratching ears, glancing up at the domed ceiling, whispering among acquaintances…

But no one answered Qian Tong.

“Fine. If you want to go back to raise Saint Crystals, I won’t stop you. But this repeated usage of Tianyun City’s Space Array is causing great harm to the array; it might even be ruined! I’ll have to increase the fee you pay to use it.”

Sixty or seventy masters immediately erupted in uproar, staring at Qian Tong in astonishment. Everyone knew he was talking nonsense—the Space Array was an ancient relic that had been used for years without trouble; even frequent use wouldn’t wreck it. This was merely an excuse for Qian Tong to raise the price.

Though they knew it was nonsense, no one wanted to be the first to challenge Elder Qian. After all, this was Tianyun City, Yingyue Hall’s domain, and the Space Array belonged to Yingyue Hall; unless they intended to stop using it, they wouldn’t risk offending him. All of them bore heavy duties and wanted only to come and go quickly.

Qian Tong chuckled and announced, “The price isn’t that high—five hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals per person!”

“Elder Qian, that’s unreasonable!” someone immediately shouted. “Normally it only costs ten thousand per use—you’ve raised it fiftyfold all at once. Isn’t that a bit much?”

“Yeah, yeah, five hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals is way too much!”

“Elder Qian, you can’t take this kind of black-hearted money!”

“……”

The crowd clamored, voices rising—who could afford five hundred thousand Saint Crystals for a single use?

The Yingyue Hall disciples watched the scene teetering out of control and felt alarmed—their elder had spoken such things; had he gone mad?

“You don’t have to use it; I’m not forcing you,” Qian Tong said imperturbably. “But let me warn you: the auction will begin soon. If you can’t return before those items appear, hehe…”

Before Qian Tong finished, a burly man strode forward and tossed a Spatial Ring to the Yingyue Hall disciple guarding the array: “I’ll use it—here’s five hundred thousand Saint Crystals!”

The disciple accepted it, swept his divine sense over it to confirm, and nodded to Qian Tong.

“Open the array!” Qian Tong waved his hand, and amid flashing white light the burly man’s figure gradually vanished.

Even then, the Yingyue Hall disciples were somewhat baffled; they couldn’t understand how five hundred thousand Saint Crystals had been produced so easily.

The Space Array’s maintenance and use had always been for facilitating travel and contact between the great powers on Dark Star, never treated as a revenue tool—yet today their own Elder Qian had started a precedent, and it seemed to work well.

Five hundred thousand Saint Crystals per use, with sixty or seventy people here and more on the way…

How many Saint Crystals would that bring in? The Yingyue Hall disciples trembled with excitement—if this became the norm, Yingyue Hall would no longer need to run shops; simply charging for the Space Array could make them the wealthiest power on Dark Star.

Once the precedent was set, after the burly man left the crowd hesitated only a moment before surging forward to hand over five hundred thousand Saint Crystals and use the Space Array themselves.

The Yingyue Hall disciples beamed, assigning someone to count the Saint Crystals; each time a count was verified they opened the array to send the payer away, counting crystals until their hands cramped.

“Elder Qian, next time you come to Haomiao City, Piaomiao Hall will host you warmly!” a middle-aged man, whose crystals had just been extorted by Qian Tong, said a ceremonial line as he left, implying the five hundred thousand would be recouped next time Qian Tong used Haomiao City’s Space Array.

Qian Tong put on a shameless look and said, “Then this old man will just grow old and die in Tianyun City — I’m not going anywhere ever again.”

The middle-aged man left still seething as the Space Array transmitted him to Haomiao City.

The hall buzzed with activity as person after person paid crystals and was sent away; Qian Tong felt considerably more vindicated.

Yan Pei had made the first move; you can’t blame him for opening his palm! In any case, since it had come to this, better to take a windfall first.

Never before had an auction prompted such sudden efforts by the major powers to gather vast amounts of Saint Crystals; before the auction even began, Tianyun City had already been swept by a surge of open and covert rivalries.

Nor had any auction ever brought so great a profit to the local powers.

Just from charging for usage of the Space Array this time, Yingyue Hall collected over thirty million Upper-Level Saint Crystals; and that was with some less-wealthy forces deeming their bidding hopeless and choosing not to use the array—otherwise Yingyue Hall’s take would have been even greater.

While the Space Array continued to operate here, the auction at Jubao Tower was already underway.

Yan Pei schemed with vicious intent and deliberately let certain hints leak to make the final bidding fiercer; in truth he had achieved that, but it didn’t stop the auction from proceeding, nor did he delay its timing.

The most valuable items would naturally be saved for last, and at least six or seven hours would be left in between—there should be more than enough time for the factions to gather substantial Saint Crystals.

Yan Pei was more eager for the progress of this auction than ever before. Sitting in one of the top-class private rooms, he sipped spirit tea and quietly awaited the final outcome.

Musical instruments sounded, drums and gongs clamored, and the noisy auction hall fell silent in an instant. On the high platform, a dozen young maidens descended like fluttering butterflies, each carrying a small basket and scattering petals; the light from the ceiling stones made the platform as bright as day, drawing every eye.

The air was filled with the fragrance of flowers. A dozen young maidens stood there with gentle smiles and graceful figures, looking like goddesses descended from the heavens.

With long sleeves and graceful posture, their dance was beautiful; expressions ranged from coy to joyful, enthralling the crowd. After their performance they bowed and withdrew.

A voluptuous, curvaceous mature beauty then strolled onto the platform—skin white as snow, flawless, dressed decently but in a fitted gown that could not contain her proud bearing; her jade arms were exposed, and the neckline revealed a pale cleavage, her mature allure palpable.

Her hair was pinned into a bun, revealing a long, fair neck—she appeared elegant and dignified.

Her entrance outshone the dozen maidens; she exuded a captivating aura and a faint halo of light seemed to shimmer around her—her beauty was beyond compare.
