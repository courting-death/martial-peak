## Chapter 702 — Ice Heart Snow Lotus

"Get out!" A furious roar tore through the sky; every sound fell instantly still, ears rang with a buzzing so intense some weaker cultivators even bled from their ear canals — the uproar at the stall had clearly enraged the vendor.

"I won't say the same thing twice. If you cannot meet my terms, leave." The vendor's voice cut low and steady.

"Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!" a low shout came from the crowd.

From the vendor there issued a faint aura; those present immediately recognized his nontrivial strength, and several who had hoped to take advantage of the situation shook their heads and withdrew.

The vendor plainly looked like a burly, battle-hardened man — the kind who licked the blade's edge and bled with a grin. To try and cheat someone like him would end badly.

Still, many lingered, pleading and bargaining in earnest.

The vendor shook his head without relent, insisting the price was ten Saint-Grade pills and would not budge.

Gradually the crowd in front of the stall thinned until the place was nearly deserted.

Yang Kai and Fei Yu finally reached the stall, and when they saw what lay before them both faces changed.

Before the vendor sat a palm-sized lotus of ice — seemingly carved from ice crystals yet brimming with life; the flower had opened, its leaves fresh and beaded with dew. A faint, pure fragrance drifted from the lotus, and both Yang Kai and Fei Yu felt their bodies relax and their minds sharpen considerably.

An exotic treasure! Yang Kai decided at once.

"Ice Heart Snow Lotus?" Fei Yu cried out, then crouched to inspect it. Her beautiful eyes scanned the lotus and she inhaled a cool breath aloud: "This must be ten thousand years old, right?"

At that remark Yang Kai's expression shifted.

Ten thousand years — any medicinal herb that managed to live to ten thousand years, even the lowest grade, would be worth a fortune; let alone this lotus, which plainly was no ordinary item.

The vendor's once-impassive face stirred; he glanced at Fei Yu and gave a slight nod. "At last, someone who knows how to look."

Fei Yu pursed her lips and smiled. "It's not that I alone can tell. There were several who recognized it earlier, but they wouldn't admit it."

Those who wanted it naturally wouldn't praise its value; they all hoped the vendor was blind and could be cheated.

"Really only in exchange for ten Saint-Grade pills?" Fei Yu asked softly.

The vendor gave a small nod.

Fei Yu shook her head with a sigh — ten Saint-Grade pills were beyond her reach. Saint-Grade pills were not produced by everyone; even Saint-Grade alchemists faced high failure rates when refining them.

Thus every Saint-Grade pill was precious; ten of them could buy a city.

The average cultivator might never, in a lifetime, see ten Saint-Grade pills.

"Senior Aunt, this thing can nourish the spirit, right?" Though Yang Kai had some knowledge of heaven-and-earth treasures, his exposure was limited and there were still things he did not recognize.

Fei Yu was different — having lived many years, her eyes and experience were broader than Yang Kai's, so it was no surprise she could identify the Ice Heart Snow Lotus and estimate its age at a glance.

"Yes, it's an exotic treasure that nourishes the spirit." Fei Yu nodded. "No need to refine it into a pill; ingesting it directly will unleash its full effect. With one Bingxin Xuelian, anyone's Divine Sense power will surge. Strange — if it is so rare, why don't you take it yourself instead of asking for ten Saint-Grade pills?"

"I have my reasons," the vendor said, unwilling to explain more. "Do you have enough Saint-Grade pills? If you do, we can trade now; if not, don't waste my time."

Fei Yu scoffed and immediately took a dislike to the vendor.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then asked, "Can you give me a few days to prepare?"

"How long do you need?" the big man asked, glancing at Yang Kai.

"Three days."

"I can grant you time, but I cannot promise I won't sell it before then," the vendor said in a low voice.

Yang Kai frowned. "But I only have one Saint-Grade pill right now."

"Then that's your problem."

The vendor's curt tone stung, and Yang Kai had no words to spare. He also wanted such a spirit-nourishing exotic treasure, but ten Saint-Grade pills were required, and given his current alchemical skill he needed time to prepare.

At minimum he would have to gather some materials no lower than Spirit-Grade Upper-Level, and preferably Saint-Grade items.

With the aid of a spirit formation and Wan Yao Ling Milk, Yang Kai was confident he could refine ten Saint-Grade pills within three days.

Naturally the cost would be enormous; he might waste countless materials in the effort.

As he weighed whether to do this, someone suddenly squatted down beside him. Yang Kai turned and found himself facing a handsome young man about his own age.

The newcomer glanced at Yang Kai; their eyes met and each saw a flicker of astonished admiration in the other's gaze.

Both felt that the other's strength was not low.

Fei Yu's pretty eyes brightened with a strange light as she stared at the young man.

The man smiled gently, an almost devilish charm in his expression, as if the whole world had suddenly grown a little sunnier.

"This Ice Heart Snow Lotus is indeed fine." The young man withdrew his gaze and began to inspect the exotic treasure.

"Ten Saint-Grade pills!" the vendor repeated coldly.

"Yes, I'll take it." The young man inclined his head slightly.

Yang Kai and Fei Yu were stunned. The vendor looked at him in disbelief and frowned. "Give me ten Saint-Grade pills first, then it's yours."

He clearly did not trust such a young man could produce ten Saint-Grade pills on the spot.

The young man smiled faintly and casually tossed out a Spatial Pouch. "Check for yourself — exactly ten. If you want more, there's nothing I can do."

The vendor released his Divine Sense to examine it, and his face suddenly lit with joy. He rose and strode away, disappearing quickly and decisively, not wasting a word.

Yang Kai and Fei Yu were left gaping.

The young man smiled, carefully picked up the Ice Heart Snow Lotus with a hand as slender as a girl's, placed it into another Spatial Pouch, and nodded pleasantly to Yang Kai. "Friend, sorry — I didn't snatch it from you on purpose. Good things are coveted by all."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded faintly, not meaning to make an issue of it.

His capital was insufficient and someone had been quicker — there was nothing to argue about.

"Farewell." The young man said, then melted back into the crowd.

Fei Yu stared after him in a daze for a long time before finally taking a breath. "What was that fellow's background? Ten Saint-Grade pills without so much as a blink."

"He must have backing," Yang Kai said, eyes fixed on the direction the man had gone. "And... he is a very skilled alchemist."

"How do you know that?" Fei Yu asked in astonishment.

"There is an alchemical fragrance clinging to his fingertips — the scent of Spirit-Grade pills. It's the kind of smell that comes from years of refining."

Fei Yu covered her small mouth. "Isn't that similar to you?"

To be so young and yet able to refine Spirit-Grade pills was not common. Mi Na, though a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, was older than Yang Kai.

The man just now, however, appeared to be about Yang Kai's age.

"No." Yang Kai shook his head, his face grave. "He may well be stronger than I am."

Fei Yu was struck dumb, astonished beyond words.

She had always thought someone like Yang Kai — a prodigy — was a once-in-a-century occurrence, yet here in Fuyun City another such figure had appeared.

"But... he has a pretty little face, which I don't!" Yang Kai suddenly grinned, taking a bit of malicious pleasure.

Fei Yu shook her head in surprise. "You... he just happens to look handsome."

"If he let his hair down I'm certain he'd be a beauty in the making, haha!" Yang Kai laughed a few loud bursts. A man growing up looking like that was, in its own way, a sorrow.

"Let's go and keep looking. If we don't find anything good we'll head back." Yang Kai waved his hand and Fei Yu hurried to follow, complaining, "You promised to buy me wine — did you lie?"

"I'll buy the wine and we'll drink it back at the inn."

As if their earlier luck had been exhausted, the two wandered the trading quarter for two hours without finding anything worthwhile.

Just as they prepared to leave, someone set up a new stall and began continuously pulling fine, rare medicinal materials from his Spatial Pouch.

Yang Kai felt a spark of expectation. The man appeared to be an alchemist, an alchemist token hung at his chest, though his true rank was unknown; the materials he displayed were all rare and precious.

"Let's take another look." Yang Kai told Fei Yu, and they stood before the stall to wait quietly.

Others noticed the difference as well, and soon a large crowd gathered. The alchemist's materials were snatched up fast and business was booming.

When onlookers saw his Spatial Pouch was empty, disappointment spread.

"Wait a moment, my partner will be here soon. He has many good items," the seller called out.

Upon hearing that, the departing crowd lingered, watching expectantly.

"Friend, where did you and your partner get these treasures? They must have some years to them," someone asked curiously.

"Hehe, might as well say it — we stumbled upon a Small Xuan Realm. There wasn't much there except some herbs; everything here came from there."

"You two are lucky," the questioner said with obvious envy.

Small Xuan Realms vary in size; the Small Xuan Realm where the Ancient Demon Clan resides is relatively large, while others are tiny and have extremely concealed entrances. They are a form of secret realm; within a Small Xuan Realm one might find relics left by ancient people, naturally grown heaven-and-earth treasures, or nothing at all — it all depends on the luck of the discoverer.
