## Chapter 7 — Body Tempering Fourth Stage, Birth of Qi Sense

Though only fifteen, Yang Kai had matured far beyond his years ever since the calamity three years ago. It was that ordeal that had forged his tenacious and unyielding character.

Calmness soon settled within him. Sitting at the edge of his bed, he held the Wordless Black Book carefully, examining its first page.

After confirming the first page no longer held any use, he slowly turned to the second page.

With prior experience, his movements were now practiced and confident. His wide eyes fixed on the dark page. After a moment, just like the first page, gilded characters began to slowly appear again:

“Proud Bone Golden Body: Body Tempering Chapter!”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred. Indeed, as he suspected, each page of the Black Book likely concealed some secret.

Without hesitation, he focused all his attention on the second page.

In an instant, the golden letters seemed to leap like live fish from the page, transforming into a cascade of golden light that drilled toward Yang Kai’s head. As the golden glow faded, he felt as if new knowledge had been implanted in his mind—clear, complete, effortlessly understood.

Calming his racing thoughts, Yang Kai closed his eyes to digest the knowledge.

Yet no digestion was truly needed; the knowledge came clearly into his mind, ready to be summoned with a thought and fully comprehended.

“This is the Body Tempering chapter,” he murmured. It was a fist-and-foot technique.

Though it appeared simple, it was profoundly deep. What’s more, the technique required strict timing—it could only be practiced at sunrise.

In other words, only half an hour each day.

It was only early night now, and dawn was still five or six hours away. Yang Kai had spent the day toiling, eaten only a roasted sweet potato, and was stomach-growling hungry. Though his body was weak and tired, possession of the Wordless Black Book filled him with unparalleled vigor.

Unable to sleep, he tried to study the third page.

But to his disappointment, no matter how he examined it, the third page remained unchanged. As he stared, sleep eventually claimed him.

When Yang Kai awoke again, it was just before sunrise. The darkness before dawn was deepest and quietest, with Lingxiao Pavilion bathed in stillness. Occasional chirps of birds were the only sounds—early risers hunting for food.

With a purpose in his heart, Yang Kai hurried out of bed, stood silently before his hut, and took deep breaths to relax himself.

A sliver of fish-belly white light suddenly appeared in the east. Opening his eyes, Yang Kai assumed the Body Tempering stance he had rehearsed countless times in his mind.

His palms formed soft, slow motions, pushing outward then drawing in, embracing heaven and earth. His feet stepped on the vast land, inhaling the sun, moon, and stars.

One step forward spanned an immeasurable distance; the other moved lightly as if stepping into the underworld. With each breath, life stirred, like a thousand flowers blooming in spring—verdant and full of vitality. Spring passed into summer, blazing heat mixed with lotus fragrance.
Autumn’s golden fruits and chilly winds followed, then the silver-white snow of winter, all cycling through his deliberate movements.

Yang Kai’s expression grew serious as though a massive weight pressed down on his slow movements, making it impossible to move freely.

Suddenly, a sharp crack sounded. His face paled and he staggered, nearly falling to his knees.

Though he had mentally rehearsed the set countless times and knew it was not simple, he never expected such profundity in the Body Tempering chapter.

For that brief moment, it felt as though the entire universe rested upon him, yet within that great pressure, he could sense every nuance of mortal life.

This Body Tempering chapter was not merely training fists and feet—it trained the vicissitudes of time and nature: birth and death, joy and sorrow, union and separation, waxing and waning. Every slow punch and kick tugged at the power of heaven and earth, filled with mysterious laws.

Yang Kai had only thrown out six palms and walked three steps—less than one percent of the entire form—yet he could barely continue. The crack had come from his spine, making him fear his bones were broken.

He hurried to check and found only soreness, no serious injury.

Gathering his resolve, Yang Kai assumed the stance again and continued the Body Tempering form.

Previously unprepared and distracted, he now focused fully, moving slowly and deliberately. The earlier vision returned, clearer than before.

His chest was filled with a myriad of emotions, indescribable in words. As the form continued, his movements grew heavier, as if submerged underwater, difficult and obscure.

Bones cracked repeatedly like firecrackers; sharp pain stabbed throughout, but his steadfast will manifested fully.

In moments, sweat poured like rain, limbs trembling as if bearing the weight of heaven and earth.

A surge of perseverance rose in his heart.

Suddenly, warmth radiated from within, gradually spreading. The pain eased considerably, and Yang Kai’s spirit surged. He concentrated harder, knowing the warmth came from the Proud Bone Golden Body now merging within him. After all, the Body Tempering chapter was designed to be paired with the Golden Body.

As the sun rose, in Lingxiao Pavilion’s most remote hut, the youth sweated profusely, slowly practicing his fists and feet. His long path of martial cultivation had begun.

Half an hour passed swiftly. When Yang Kai suddenly felt his body lighten, no longer burdened, he knew he could no longer practice the Body Tempering chapter.

The chapter clearly stated that this technique could only be practiced during the half hour before sunrise.

Drained of strength, Yang Kai collapsed to the ground, breathing deeply. A thread of violet qi accompanied his breath into his mouth, vanishing instantly. Suddenly, clarity filled his mind; something stirred inside.

Startled, he carefully sensed himself and was shocked.

Qi Sense!

He had already born the Qi Sense, meaning he had broken through Body Tempering Third Stage and stepped into the Fourth Stage.

This joyous news filled him with delight. Since entering Lingxiao Pavilion three years ago, he had only reached Third Stage. Now, after half an hour practicing this form, he had advanced further.

Body Tempering had nine stages, training the body. The first three strengthened the physique without special effects, but at Fourth Stage, Qi Sense formed in the meridians.

Only with Qi Sense could one advance deeper.

Though Qi Sense was born, genuine Primordial Qi was absent until Seventh Stage. At Ninth Stage, the great cycle completed, Primordial Qi would awaken, the bridge between heaven and earth formed, and breakthrough to Open Origin Realm attained—the true start of a warrior’s path.

Everything in Body Tempering laid the foundation for the future path. This foundation was flexible and evolved as one’s strength grew. Tendons, bones, and skin were repeatedly tempered until they reached their peak.

Yang Kai had just entered Fourth Stage, just born Qi Sense. To outsiders, this seemed trivial, but for Yang Kai himself it was momentous news.
