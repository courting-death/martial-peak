## Chapter 7 — Fourth Stage of Body Tempering Realm, Qi Sense Emerges

Though Yang Kai was only fifteen this year, ever since enduring that great calamity three years ago, his temperament had matured far beyond his peers. It was precisely because of that trial that his resilient and unyielding character had been forged.

Thus, Yang Kai quickly calmed himself, sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the Wordless Black Book carefully as he examined the first page.

After confirming that the first page held no further use, he slowly turned to the second page.

Having already gained experience last time, Yang Kai’s motions were now practiced and confident. He widened his eyes and intensely stared at the dark pages. After a moment, just like the gilded characters on the first page, golden words gradually appeared again.

“Indomitable Golden Body: Body Tempering Chapter!”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred with emotion. As he had suspected, each page of the Black Book hid some secret.

Without a second thought, Yang Kai focused all his attention on the second page of the Wordless Black Book.

In an instant, the gilded words on the black pages seemed to transform into swimming fish, leaping off the page and forming countless golden shadows that swarmed toward Yang Kai’s head. When the golden shadows faded, he felt as if something had been added to his mind. That something was precisely the knowledge those golden images brought.

Calming his racing thoughts, Yang Kai closed his eyes to digest the knowledge.

In truth, digestion was unnecessary. The knowledge that came with those golden shadows was already vividly clear in his mind, emerging with a flicker of his consciousness, and he comprehended it fluently, understanding its essence completely.

“So this is the Body Tempering Chapter,” Yang Kai murmured. He realized it was actually a set of fist and kick techniques.

A seemingly simple yet profoundly intricate set of martial arts, and this set had strict time requirements. It could only be practiced at dawn, at the break of the rising sun.

In other words, at most half an hour each day.

It was only just past nightfall now; to wait for dawn meant at least five or six hours more. After toiling all day and eating only a roasted sweet potato, his stomach growled. Though weak and fatigued, the treasure of the Wordless Black Book kept his spirits extremely high.

Unable to sleep for the moment, he began studying the third page of the Wordless Black Book.

However, to his disappointment, no matter how he scrutinized it, the third page showed no change, and he soon fell asleep while staring at it.

When Yang Kai awoke again, it was just before dawn. The darkness before daybreak was most profound and silent. The entire Lingxiao Pavilion was still and quiet, with the occasional chirp of early birds seeking sustenance.

Having matters on his mind, Yang Kai hastily rose from the bed and stood quietly outside his small room, taking several deep breaths to steady himself.

A faint trace of pale light appeared in the east. Yang Kai opened his eyes, and the fists and kicks of the Body Tempering Chapter, which his mind had already rehearsed countless times, flowed smoothly and naturally as he assumed his stance.

His hands opened into palms, moving with gentle slowness—pushing forward, one and then the other, then softly drawing back. He gathered heaven and earth into his chest, twisted the myriad things between his hands, trod firmly upon the vast land beneath the heaven, and breathed in the essence of sun, moon, and stars.

He took a step with his left foot, covering an immeasurable distance; his right foot moved lightly, crossing into the netherworld. His breathing was filled with vitality, as if a hundred flowers bloomed in spring, full of life and hope. Spring fades to summer, scorching sun above, sweet fragrance of lotus.

The autumn wind whispered, golden fruits abounded, refreshing the heart. Bone-chilling wind howled past, white snow draped over the land like silver.

Yang Kai’s expression steadily grew grave. The slow movements of his fists and feet seemed pressed down by a weight of ten thousand jin, impossible to fully unleash.

Accompanied by a crisp cracking sound, Yang Kai’s face turned pale. He staggered suddenly, nearly collapsing onto the ground.

Though he had rehearsed this set of techniques countless times in his mind and knew it was far from simple, Yang Kai never expected the Body Tempering Chapter to be so profound.

In that brief moment, he felt as if the entire world pressed down on him, yet he sensed all the feelings of mortal life within this immense pressure.

This Body Tempering Chapter was not merely the training of fists and feet—it was the tempering of the vicissitudes of heaven and earth, of birth and death. It cultivated the full flavors of life: sour, sweet, bitter, and pungent; the full range of emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. It embodied the patterns of parting and reunion, of waxing and waning. Within each slow punch and step, heaven and earth were stirred, brimming with the wondrous mysteries of cosmic law.

Just after six palm strikes and three steps, less than one percent into the Body Tempering Chapter’s full process, Yang Kai was already struggling to continue. That cracking sound had even come from his spine, causing him to believe momentarily that his bones had shattered.

He hurriedly tested and found only pain in his back, with no grave harm.

Settling his mind, Yang Kai again assumed his stance and commenced the Body Tempering Chapter’s forms.

Lacking psychological preparation earlier, his mind had been unsteady then. This time, having learned from experience, he held his breath and focused his spirit. As he moved the slow fists and feet, Yang Kai once again felt the earlier profound state, but this time it was far clearer.

His chest was filled with mixed feelings, indescribable in taste. Furthermore, as the form progressed, his limbs grew heavier and heavier, as if immersed underwater—arduous and obscure, difficult to execute.

Crackling sounds burst forth unceasingly, like firecrackers igniting within his bones. Agonizing pain surged through his body, yet Yang Kai did not waver—the toughness of his will was laid bare in that instant.

In the blink of an eye, sweat poured from him like rain, his hands and feet trembling as if the weight of heaven and earth pressed heavily on him, unbearably burdensome.

But inside, a surge of tenacity stirred.

Suddenly, a warm sensation arose within his body, slowly radiating outward. His pain lessened greatly. Yang Kai’s spirit brightened and he concentrated even more on his fists and feet. He knew this warmth must be the Indomitable Golden Body within him stirring to life. After all, the Body Tempering Chapter was designed to pair with the Golden Body.

As the sun rose, outside the most remote small room of Lingxiao Pavilion, the youth sweat-soaked and slow in his movements, practiced his martial forms. From this day onward, he set out on the long path of martial cultivation.

Half an hour passed swiftly. When Yang Kai suddenly felt lightness through his body, and the oppressive weight had vanished, he knew he could no longer practice the Body Tempering Chapter.

The Black Book had clearly stated that this set of techniques was only to be practiced during the half hour before the sun’s rising.

Exhausted, Yang Kai collapsed onto the ground, gasping deeply. A purple aura shimmered with his exhale and was drawn into him, vanishing. Instantly, Yang Kai felt remarkably refreshed; something seemed to have awakened within.

Astonished, he carefully focused inside. This time, Yang Kai’s surprise knew no bounds.

Qi Sense! He had actually birthed Qi Sense within himself. This meant he had broken through the Third Stage of Body Tempering and stepped into the Fourth Stage.

This tremendous news filled Yang Kai with delight. Since arriving at Lingxiao Pavilion three years ago, it had taken him all this time to reach the Third Stage of Body Tempering. Yet today, after only half an hour of practicing these martial techniques, he had broken through.

The Body Tempering Realm contains nine stages, focused on strengthening the body. The first three simply build physical power and hold no special significance. But from the Fourth Stage onward, Qi Sense arises within the meridians.

Only with the emergence of Qi Sense can one cultivate more deeply.

Though he now had Qi Sense, he still possessed no Yuan Qi within his body. That would only appear at the Seventh Stage of Body Tempering, in small amounts. Only upon completing the Ninth Stage would the great cycle inside open, Yuan Qi begin to flow forth, bridging heaven and earth, breaking through to the Open Origin Realm.

Open Origin Realm was truly the starting point of a martial artist’s path.

All within the Body Tempering Realm merely laid the foundation for what was to come. That foundation was not fixed, as one's power would repeatedly refine muscles, bones, and skin until reaching perfection.

At present, Yang Kai had only just stepped into the Fourth Stage of the Body Tempering Realm, with the faint stirrings of Qi Sense beginning to emerge. To outsiders this was nothing worth mentioning, yet to Yang Kai it was a joy that shook the heavens.
