## Chapter 1440 — Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect

After half a year of recuperation, Jin Shi finally recovered; though missing an arm, his strength was hardly affected. As he passed by Yang Kai, the sight of his enemy so near made his eyes burn with hatred.

Without a word, he unleashed his Demon Blood Threads, forming a pitch-black beam that sliced straight toward Yang Kai’s head.

He was certain Yang Kai could not possibly defend himself and would die without fail!

He had, however, sorely underestimated the force of the Imperial Might present here.

The black radiance formed by the Demon Blood Threads had barely surged forth when it was enveloped by Imperial Might; its speed crawled like a tortoise, utterly unable to serve as any kind of sneak attack.

At that moment, Yang Kai seemed to sense something and glanced in his direction. A mocking smile curved his lips, and they moved slightly, as if uttering a curse. The distance was too great for Jin Shi to hear clearly, and soon after, Yang Kai withdrew his gaze.

The other paid him no heed at all.

Snap……

With a light crack the black beam aimed at Yang Kai burst apart, and a thick stench of blood rolled through the air, sickening to the senses. The Demon Blood Threads Jin Shi had nurtured for countless years were crushed under Imperial Might and ground to powder.

"Pft…" Jin Shi’s face went deathly pale; he spat a spray of blood, staggered, and looked terrified—clearly badly wounded.

Demon Blood Threads were peculiar—akin to a Secret Treasure, yet linked to the cultivator’s mind; when they were destroyed, the practitioner would inevitably suffer backlash.

Jin Shi’s strike not only failed to kill Yang Kai but cost him one of his Demon Blood Threads, something he regarded as dear as life itself. He seethed with fury, his face livid.

Mo Xiaosheng, Old Woman Feng, and the others who had been watching were all shocked; the eager, predatory expressions on their faces dimmed, replaced by extreme gravity.

They had intended to strike at Yang Kai themselves, but Jin Shi had moved faster.

Now, it seemed fortunate they hadn’t acted rashly—otherwise their ends would have been no better than Jin Shi’s. Each of them showed signs of lingering dread and restraint; after glancing at Yang Kai, they rose without a word and flew upward.

"Boy, if I meet you again in the Imperial Garden, I’ll skin you alive and tear out your tendons—only then will my hatred be soothed!" Jin Shi roared in madness.

Yang Kai turned to look at him, painfully raised one hand, clenched it into a fist, then lifted his little finger upright…

“Infuriating!” Jin Shi’s eyes blazed with killing intent, his posture that of a man ready to fight Yang Kai to the death right then and there. He was, after all, a long-established figure—one of the Great Elders of the Demon Blood Sect. When had he ever been treated with such disdain, so openly provoked?

Those who had dared treat him so had long ago been sacrificed by his secret rites and turned into blood to bolster his Demon Blood Threads’ power.

Yang Kai’s gesture sent him into a fury.

Beside Jin Shi, a voluptuous beauty in a pink dress with revealing clothes parted her lips to soothe him: "Elder, it’s better to enter the Imperial Garden first; that boy will surely go in—there’ll be time enough to deal with him later."

She wore herself boldly—two white, jade-like arms and a pair of long, shapely legs exposed to the air. The pink dress could hardly contain her proud figure; her pair of full twin peaks strained at the fabric, threatening to burst free, and the deep, fair cleavage at her bosom seemed to possess a strange allure that drew every man’s eye and devoured their reason.

Most arresting were her ruby lips, gleaming like polished gems, vivid and dripping with temptation.

She looked like a ripe honey peach—squeeze her and she would weep juices.

She seemed young, perhaps only around thirty, yet radiated the formidable aura of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert.

Though Jin Shi was resentful, he dared not be wanton in her presence; he nodded and replied, "Sect Master is right!"

This beauty was none other than the Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect! Those ignorant of the sect’s nature would be hard-pressed to believe such a woman could hold high office; but anyone who’d heard her name would fear her like a viper.

The Demon Blood Sect was not a benevolent force—its disciples were mostly scoundrels, murdering, looting, and bullying others; plunder was routine.

As the saying goes, “When the upper beam is crooked, the lower ones will slant as well.” Since the disciples of the sect were like this, the beautiful woman who served as their Sect Master could hardly be any better.

Rumor held that she took a new man every night and had an appetite for handsome bodies. Any man of some looks who fell into her sights could not escape her grasp; even several elders within the sect were said to have entanglements with her.

Each year many strong, striking male warriors were seized and brought into the Demon Blood Sect, then vanished without a trace.

Rumor claimed they were drained of their essence and blood and met a cruel death on her belly.

Though the Demon Blood Sect committed all manner of wickedness, they remained untroubled—because their victims were small fry with no powerful backers, no major power bothered to take them on.

Furthermore, on Dark Star the Demon Blood Sect was a first-tier force; only if Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance joined together and marshaled help could anyone hope to uproot them.

At that moment, the beautiful woman looked toward Yang Kai, her alluring eyes rippling with strange charm. Her delicate tongue slid over lips redder and glossier than rubies, her breathing faintly quickening.

Where there’s smoke there’s fire—the outside rumors were largely true; this beauty did delight in robust men!

It wasn’t loneliness or emptiness that drove her. As the master of a sect and a powerhouse of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, how could she possibly feel lonely? What she loved were strong men—because the power of Qi and blood within them far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators!

While coupling with such men she could, through secret arts, absorb their qi and blood to nourish and strengthen her Demon Blood Threads!

Yang Kai’s ability to resist Imperial Might with his body alone—without relying on Imperial Jade—revealed how hardy he was; naturally the Sect Master’s heart leaped at the prospect.

Moreover, Yang Kai’s cultivation was no weak thing—he had the level of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If she could swallow his qi and blood, she could hope to advance her own power!

At her level of cultivation, making further progress was nearly impossible. On other stars within the Star Domain, she might still hope to ascend to the Void King Realm, but in a special place like Dark Star, such a realm was nothing but a fantasy. All she could do was find ways to enhance the power of her own secret arts.

Yang Kai’s body would make the finest nourishment!

The more she looked, the more delighted she became. The beautiful woman could hardly restrain the urge to rush forward, seize Yang Kai, and drag him somewhere secluded to thoroughly savor him. Yet the earlier scene of Jin Shi making his move had set off alarms in her heart—she knew this was not the right time to act.

With a soft giggle, the beautiful woman looked at Yang Kai and said, “Young man, hurry up and enter the Imperial Garden—this Sect Master will be waiting for you inside!”

Having said that, she and Jin Shi swept past Yang Kai from not far off.

Yang Kai snorted coldly at their retreating backs and paid them no mind.

He had long known this trip into the Imperial Garden would be uneasy; the factions he’d clashed with back at Dragon Lair Mountain certainly wouldn’t let him off.

But so what?

Now that he had reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his own Shi had taken some shape; even facing them he felt no fear. As long as he wasn’t encircled by four or five top experts at once, he could always escape if defeated.

So he was untroubled, even eager to test the might of his Shi.

Light after light streaked past from near and far—those on Dark Star who possessed Imperial Jade heading toward the Imperial Garden—and in time everyone qualified to enter passed through the space array in the sky and entered the Imperial Garden.

In midair only Yang Kai’s solitary figure remained, yet he continued climbing upward slowly.

Far from anxious, he grew steadier.

With everyone gone, he had no worries and could freely temper and strengthen his Shi here.

He would not miss so rare an opportunity!

Time passed; three days later Yang Kai stood in some region of the void, pale and gasping, his legs trembling as if exhausted.

He had reached a point where no matter how he strove, he could not take another step upward. The viscous, oppressive Imperial Might had grown so intense it chilled him to the bone; one more step felt like being smashed to pieces.

Those three days of toil had granted him riches ordinary martial artists would never obtain in decades or centuries.

That treasure was an understanding of Shi!

His Shi had not only taken shape but greatly strengthened—he could now match many long-established experts.

"Is this the limit?" Yang Kai’s eyes dimmed. Though he wanted to press higher, human strength had limits and he felt helpless.

Soon, however, he seemed to recall something and fell into thought.

After the time it took a single stick of incense to burn, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened; a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth as he slowly and painfully lifted a foot to step onto the invisible rung above.

Boom……

A pressure that nearly shattered his body and soul descended, enveloping him.

At the same time a hissing chorus rose.

A strange force burst forth from Yang Kai, forming invisible blades that cut at the Imperial Might surrounding him!

His body instantly felt much lighter; Yang Kai staggered and mounted another step.

The hissing intensified, and to his astonishment the space around him itself began to distort, as if constantly collapsing and self-repairing in endless repetition.

The power of space!
