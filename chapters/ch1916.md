## Chapter 1916 — Opening the Lecture on Pillcraft

The environment on the Eighth Stage of the Medicine Master Hall resembled that of the Ninth Stage, but the force of the terrestrial flames was not as intense as on the Ninth; the attendants were not overly formal, merely sitting cross‑legged in the main hall facing Yang Kai and listening as he expounded the mysteries of pillcraft.

Had this been before, asking Yang Kai to lecture so many alchemists would have been a heavy task — even if his pillmaking surpassed theirs, he would have been hard‑pressed.

Being able to refine pills was one thing; elucidating the art and dispelling doubts for others was quite another, and the latter required one to have attained an exceptionally high realm to possess that capability.

But now it was different; the Great Dao Pill Tone had resounded beside Yang Kai’s ear for a full day, and the secrets of pillcraft it had spoken had been branded into his mind like a searing imprint — his understanding of pillcraft had reached a brand‑new unprecedented height.

Teaching and resolving doubts for these Saint King‑Grade and Origin‑Grade alchemists was still effortless.

Yang Kai lectured on pillcraft for three days, covering everything from how to select medicinal materials and judge the quality of prescriptions, to refining medicinal essences, controlling the flame, inscribing spirit arrays, and finally the techniques for extracting finished pills — a comprehensive sweep of the art.

All the alchemists listened entranced, utterly oblivious to the passage of time.

From time to time expressions of astonishment crossed their faces; clearly problems that had long plagued them were enlightened in a single moment by Yang Kai’s instruction.

Yang Kai himself reaped great benefit; by explaining the art to these alchemists, he added a higher layer of comprehension to everything the Great Dao Pill Tone had engraved upon his mind.

At first he paused now and then to ponder, but as time wore on his speech flowed without interruption, words tumbling forth; he revealed techniques that ordinary alchemists, even if they spent a lifetime, could not hope to glimpse.

Some alchemists who had awakened on the Ninth Stage came down to the Eighth Stage, sat quietly cross‑legged, and listened intently.

After experiencing the opportunity of the Great Dao Pill Tone, they once again gained tremendous benefit from what they heard from Yang Kai.

After three days, every one of the more than five hundred alchemists on the Eighth Stage sat before Yang Kai, faces solemn as they looked up to him; even Zong Ao was no exception.

Yang Kai had long since seen him enter; he merely inclined his head slightly in acknowledgement and continued his exposition without pause.

Suddenly Yang Kai’s voice ceased.

In the Eighth Stage Medicine Master Hall one could hear a pin drop; everyone had suppressed even their breathing to the utmost. When Yang Kai fell silent, they knew the lecture had come to its end.

Not one person failed to display a look of reluctant satisfaction.

Yang Kai rose with a smile, cupped his fist and said, “That will be all for today. I thank you all, fellow practitioners, for your attention.”

Over five hundred alchemists rose as one, faces solemn, cupping their fists and bowing as they intoned in unison, “We disciples thank Master Yang for dispelling our doubts—Master Yang, you have worked hard!”

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, then quickly relaxed.

Zhan Yuan had, because of a few casual pointers from Zuo De many years ago, always called himself a disciple and referred to Zuo De as his benefactor.

Having taught these more than five hundred alchemists for three days, Yang Kai had become their teacher who dispelled doubts and imparted the way; they could call themselves disciples even if they lacked his explicit permission to call him “teacher.”

In the line of alchemists, heritage and lineage were held in the highest regard.

Yang Kai had been so magnanimous, pouring out his alchemical experience and understanding without reserve; though it would not make them masters overnight, it was undeniably a great kindness.

Especially those wondrous techniques for extracting pills — if all these people could fully comprehend them, it would bring an immense transformation to the art of alchemy across the Star Domain.

Traditionally, alchemists believed that one batch of materials could only yield a single spiritual pill; with that special extraction technique, however, one batch could produce two, three, four, even five pills, greatly reducing costs and increasing output.

If that became widespread, warriors across the Star Domain would no longer fear a shortage of spiritual pills.

In any case, from now on those more than five hundred alchemists of Saint King‑Grade and above would be counted as Yang Kai’s disciples, Zong Ao included.

That alone would be a force to shake the entire Star Domain.

Who could guarantee that among those five hundred there would not be several who later rose to become Void King‑Grade alchemists?

Yang Kai was not pretentious and returned the salute with cupped fists, “You are too polite.”

“Master Yang, a thing you said before has weighed on me,” a middle‑aged female alchemist with a pleasant smile said as she looked at Yang Kai. “I have a doubt—may I ask it?”

“Madam, whatever you wish to ask, ask freely; if I can answer, I will not keep it from you,” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

“Master Yang’s character is surely trustworthy, but… before you competed in pillcraft with Master Zuo De you once said there existed an alchemist whose skill surpassed Master Zuo De’s and even exceeded yours. That… cannot be true, can it?”

At those words others chimed in, “Yes, yes, I heard that too, but how could that be? Master Yang’s alchemy has reached perfection — who in the world could surpass him?”

“You said it casually at the time, and yet they believed you!”

“It was not said casually,” Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. “There truly is such a person whose attainment in alchemy outstrips mine.”

“Impossible.”

“Such a person exists?”

“Master Yang, you are far too modest.”

The alchemists below argued loudly, unwilling to accept Yang Kai’s words; they presumed he was merely being humble, for his temper was well known — amiable and unassuming.

“I am not being modest,” Yang Kai said seriously. “The situation is difficult to state; perhaps I am a little more skilled than that person now, but in the past she was definitely better than me — and in the future… she will surpass me.”

“Who is this person?” The alchemists were astonished; from Yang Kai’s expression they knew he did not exaggerate and all wanted to know who this formidable figure could be.

“As far as I know, Master Zuo De’s alchemy ranks among the top in the Star Domain; even if someone were his equal, they would hardly exceed him — the person Master Yang speaks of…”

"Do not speculate. She's not famous — just a senior sister of mine, as obscure and nameless as I am," Yang Kai explained.

“Master Yang’s Senior Sister?”

“No wonder she possesses such ability.”

“Could Master Yang hail from an alchemical sect? Both Senior Sister and you have reached the Void King‑Grade…”

“Master Yang, where is your sect? May this disciple seek apprenticeship?”

At these words many alchemists looked toward Yang Kai eagerly. A sect capable of cultivating two Void King‑Grade alchemists would be a sacred place in every alchemist’s mind — to enter such a sect would surely aid one’s future achievements.

Their only thought now was to ask where Yang Kai’s sect lay; even if they could not join, visiting to observe might yield insights.

Yang Kai chuckled, “If Chairman Ai Ou heard you say that, he would not let me off lightly!”

If Ai Ou knew these more than five hundred alchemists desired to join the Lingxiao Sect, he would surely wage war over it.

These were the elite forces of the Hengluo Commerce Guild; the guild relied on the spiritual pills they produced — if such talent all left, the guild’s business would suffer a severe blow.

“Do not press the matter. If there is an opportunity in the future, I welcome you all to visit. That is all for today — you should each return to secluded meditation and comprehension.” Yang Kai, fearing the matter would spiral further, hurriedly brought it to a close.

Hearing this, the crowd relented; they too needed to close themselves off and digest what they had just learned. One after another, the alchemists dispersed in haste to their abodes to begin seclusion.

Zong Ao, however, did not leave; he remained until the Medicine Master Hall fell silent with only himself and Yang Kai remaining, then said with a curious expression, “Shall I call you benefactor, or Master Yang?”

"Master Zong Ao, you honor me too much — I'm at a loss," Yang Kai said with an embarrassed smile.

“Enough,” Zong Ao rolled his eyes. “Such a title makes me embarrassed — who among us dares call themselves Master in your presence?”

“Then let us be as before; neither of us belittle the other.” Yang Kai patted Zong Ao’s shoulder and then grew serious, lowering his voice to ask, “This time, can you ascend to Void King‑Grade?”

A flash of sharp light glinted in Zong Ao’s eyes as he looked at Yang Kai in surprise. “So you noticed…”

“When the Great Dao Pill Tone sounded, you were the first to sit; during my lecture you seemed to gain much. Clearly you have progressed.”

“Indeed, I grasped many things. Though the Great Dao Pill Tone has vanished, it allowed me to hear numerous mysteries; combined with your exposition I have made many connections. However, an alchemist’s promotion differs from a warrior’s — it is not merely a matter of accumulated strength. I must seclude myself thoroughly; if upon emerging I can refine a Void King‑Grade spiritual pill, then I will be a Void King‑Grade alchemist.”

“I will await your good news,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Yang Kai, thank you,” Zong Ao said suddenly, his expression grave.

Yang Kai paused briefly, then replied, “This is your own opportunity; no thanks are needed. Go and seclude yourself — may the Star Domain gain another Void King‑Grade alchemist when you emerge.”

“I hope so!” Zong Ao nodded. “I will take my leave now.”

Yang Kai nodded and watched Zong Ao leave.

After Zong Ao’s figure disappeared, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense for a moment and discovered that Long Tianshang’s aura in the void had already vanished.

Yang Kai did not take it to heart; with a flicker he vanished from where he stood.

When he reappeared, he was already outside the Medicine Master Hall.

A familiar figure stood outside, anxiously waiting; seeing Yang Kai suddenly appear, he was startled but soon relaxed, for Yang Kai’s depth of power made such feats unsurprising.

He hurriedly cupped his fists. “Brother Yang.”

“Why are you here?” Yang Kai looked at Shen Tu in surprise.
