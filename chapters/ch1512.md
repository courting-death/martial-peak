## Chapter 1512 — Breach

The warship made its show of force, and warriors within Battle Sky City surged like a tide, rushing outward.

For an event of this magnitude, the Battle Sky Alliance naturally already had some understanding.

Inside the inner city, within a certain palace, Qu Zheng slammed his palm against the table after hearing his subordinate's report and barked, "This is beyond insolence! Relying on a single warship and daring to look down on my Battle Sky Alliance — I'll see how that brat plans to level my Battle Sky City to the ground."

Saying that, he strode out in haste, as if to meet the enemy.

Qu Changfeng had been brutally killed by Yang Kai, and these recent nights Qu Zheng could scarcely sleep; now that he learned the enemy had actually come to his doorstep, he was of course frantic to avenge his son.

Mo Xiaosheng frowned lightly at his side but did not stop him; after all, the Battle Sky Alliance had been humiliated, and if they did not strike out to meet the enemy it would only make the world look down on them further.

Before Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng could even leave the palace, a disciple came running in in a panic; still some distance away, he half-kneelted to the ground and cried out, "Alliance Master, Great Elder, something terrible has happened."

"What is it to be so alarmed about? Has that Lingxiao Sect done something again?" Qu Zheng roared.

"Alliance Master is wise — Second Elder has fallen!"

"What?" Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng were stunned; from the moment they received word that the Lingxiao Sect had come with a warship to attack the city to now, less than ten breaths had passed, and yet Second Elder Lu Feng had already perished?

That speed was simply too astonishing.

Lu Feng had held the position of Second Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance and his strength was plain for all to see; had Mo Xiaosheng not cultivated the Spatial Force, a niche art, he might not have been a match for him.

In such a short span of time, Lu Feng had truly perished — what trickery could the other side have used?

"How did Second Elder fall? Speak in detail!" Mo Xiaosheng urged without delay.

The disciple naturally dared not hide anything and related everything he knew.

After listening, Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng exchanged glances and saw fear mirrored in one another's eyes.

A single strike from the warship had reduced Lu Feng and a dozen or so of the Alliance's elites to nothing but bones and dust — how terrifying must that attack have been? Could a Void King-Grade warship truly be so formidable?

The news utterly overturned Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng's prior notions and understanding of warships.

They had always believed a warship was too large, too unwieldy in action, too slow to turn, and exceedingly fragile — useful only for transporting supplies or mining near the Meteorite Sea by Dark Star.

Moreover, their cost was exorbitant; with one careless mishap, a warship could be destroyed.

Therefore, although the Battle Sky Alliance was one of Dark Star's two great powers, they possessed no more than five warships. Over the years those five warships had only shuttled between the outer meteorite seas and Dead Stars to extract minerals, and had never been used in combat.

Yet today, the Lingxiao Sect’s warship had sailed straight to Battle Sky City—and its display of might was nothing short of overwhelming.

Was the gap between an Origin-Grade, Lower-Level warship and a Void King-Grade warship really so great?

If even Lu Feng could not withstand such a strike, then the two of them surely stood no chance.

"Alliance Master, if the disciple's words are true, we cannot sally forth; we must hold the inner city!" Mo Xiaosheng said anxiously, his brow knotted.

"I understand what the Great Elder means, but if we do not strike back and instead cower, the whole of Dark Star will mock us, thinking Battle Sky Alliance's people are mice, cowardly and useless!" Qu Zheng's face hardened.

“This must not be done, Alliance Master! Let the outsiders say what they will. The Lingxiao Sect stands alone and dares storm into Battle Sky City with such bluster only because they rely on that single warship. Once it’s destroyed, they’ll be nothing more than a tiger with its fangs pulled—hardly worth fearing. But to bring down that warship by sheer manpower would be impossible; we can only depend on the formation!”

"The Great Elder means…?" Qu Zheng stared at him.

"Indeed." Mo Xiaosheng sneered coldly, "Our Battle Sky Alliance has stood here for thousands upon tens of thousands of years and will not be insulted easily. Since the Lingxiao Sect seeks to attack, we shall take them at leisure. Since ancient times the victor becomes king — if we win this battle, who shall not fear our sacred alliance's renown?"

Qu Zheng drew in a deep breath, forcing down the anger boiling in his chest. After a long pause, he finally said calmly, “What the Great Elder says is true. In that case, pass down my order—activate the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array! I’d like to see whether that brat’s warship is mightier, or if my Alliance’s grand formation will prevail!”

……

Inside the warship, Yang Kai and the others waited for a quarter of an hour.

After fifteen minutes, the entire outer city of Battle Sky City lay deserted; over ten million warriors had all withdrawn, the normally bustling streets and shops were now icy and empty, and even the formerly dazzling goods had been carried off.

Truly, one could call the outer city an empty city.

Those warriors had not gone far; though a single strike from the warship had slain Lu Feng and made the Lingxiao Sect seem threatening to the Battle Sky Alliance, no one yet had a clear read on the outcome.

If the Lingxiao Sect were to win this battle, judging by their style, they would likely not harm the innocent.

If the Battle Sky Alliance won, they would simply return to their affairs.

Either way, the ordinary people would suffer no consequence.

Besides, such grand battles were bound to be spectacular; no one who loved a show would willingly miss it, and many stayed to watch until the end.

For a time the area around Battle Sky City for ten li, both underground and skyward, was ringed three layers deep with countless warriors, all eyes glued to the warship and the inner city.

Many expected the Battle Sky Alliance, having suffered this affront, would not be able to contain themselves and would pour out to repel the invaders; but to their disappointment, even as the warship slowly moved toward the inner city there was no sign of action from the Battle Sky Alliance.

For a moment, scorn rose like a tide.

The Battle Sky Alliance had been arrogant and tyrannical during its years of power; warriors who ran shops in the city had been extorted and held grievances, so seeing the alliance now shrink and cower, they could not help but jeer.

Some who were close to the alliance immediately retorted, and the two sides quickly descended into a furious quarrel that sparked full-scale fighting.

The fighting began small, but as time passed more and more warriors were swept up; vendettas were settled and old grievances avenged.

Before the Lingxiao Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance's contest had even properly begun, those driven out of the outer city had already descended into a chaotic brawl, with cries as people fell and blood flowing.

At least a million warriors were drawn into the fray, with casualties beyond reckoning.

At this moment, the warship had already arrived outside the inner city.

Its approach had been smooth and steady; Yang Kai had not bothered to attack the outer city's buildings — venting on them would serve no purpose.

"Sect Master, they seem to have activated a formation!" Ye Xijun's Divine Sense flickered as she probed, then reported.

"I see it." Yang Kai grinned, "I heard there is a Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array in the inner city whose power is boundless — this must be it."

"What should we do now? Sect Master, please advise!"

"No matter. Force the formation!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

The warship hesitated only slightly, then plunged straight into the inner city.

Inside the inner city a mist swirled, but careful observation revealed it was in fact an extremely cold, chilling breath.

The Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array took the Condensed Jade Ice Springs within the inner city as its cores—and there were not one but three such springs. Over the course of a thousand years, each had accumulated a vast reserve of chilling Yin energy—so potent that even an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, if careless enough to fall in, would be frozen solid into an ice sculpture.

Now the bitter cold from the three springs was being unleashed madly, shrouding the entire inner city and cloaking it like a mist; even the warship that pressed deep within quickly vanished from sight.

"This is troublesome — this cold can freeze Divine Sense. The Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array lives up to its name!" Qian Tong frowned; when he had tried to probe the surroundings with Divine Sense a moment ago he had felt a chill run through him, and had to withdraw quickly or risk that sliver of Divine Sense being frozen.

Inside the warship, without Divine Sense reconnaissance, everyone was effectively blind.

But the warship forged by Yang Yan did not lack compensations.

In the ship's hold a surveillance formation was in operation, and a Lingxiao Sect disciple watched its readings to report developments at any moment.

Soon the surveillance formation showed a reaction.

"Sect Master, a team of a little over twenty is approaching from the left, roughly ten li away."

"In ten breaths, fire three shots from the crystal cannon over there!" Yang Kai grinned.

Qian Tong and the others sniffed and privately offered a moment's funeral for those intending to ambush them.

Ten breaths later, three columns of pure white light shot toward the left, silent and swift, and all the enemies detected by the surveillance formation vanished.

"Too presumptuous." Ye Xijun shook her head slowly. The warriors on Dark Star had far underestimated the terror of a Void King-Grade warship; even she, were she not intimately aware of this vessel's mechanisms, might have lightly dismissed it.

After all, on Dark Star no one had ever used a warship in true battle.

"Sect Master, more are coming." the disciple reported again.

"Mm, handle them the same way." Yang Kai replied indifferently.

He had never encountered such effortless combat — relying on the warship's might he need not personally act to annihilate foes unseen.

The sensation was peculiar, and he rather enjoyed it.

The Battle Sky Alliance sent three waves, but none could approach within a li of the warship; all were wiped out halfway.

Three waves totaled sixty or seventy people, not lacking in Origin Returning Realm practitioners, yet they had so foolishly died — upon learning this Qu Zheng nearly vomited blood.

Realizing such ambushes were impossible, the Battle Sky Alliance refused to waste more lives in vain.

"Sect Master, they seem to have stopped moving." Ye Xijun frowned.

"If they don't move, we will — smash this inner city to pieces, and preferably destroy the array eyes of the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array." Yang Kai sneered.

Once the array eyes are broken, the Battle Sky Alliance will be like fish on the chopping block.

After a moment, the hull of the warship began to hum softly as wave after wave of pure white beams, with the power to obliterate heaven and earth, shot forth in all directions with no fixed aim.
