## Chapter 1729 — Unintentional Discovery

The Stone Puppet was released by Yang Kai and allowed to move about on its own.

Over the past year, Yang Kai would occasionally descend to some dead stars, and whenever he did, he set the Stone Puppet loose to explore and see if it could turn up any other finds.

The Stone Puppet did not disappoint him; blessed with an extraordinary knack, it often managed to locate some rare minerals. The quantities were never large, and Yang Kai did not pay them much mind, merely ordering it to refine and absorb whatever it found.

By absorbing the essence of those minerals, the Stone Puppet could strengthen itself and grow ever more powerful.

The Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao's small body soon disappeared from Yang Kai's sight, and only then did he take various items from his Spatial Ring and begin laying out a space array.

The valley he chose was not small; viewed from the void above, it looked like a hole on this dead star.

Yang Kai fixed the spot near a rock face. Materials and minerals in his hands began to melt and reform into various shapes; one by one, components of all sizes appeared and accumulated at his side as time passed.

These items formed the foundation of the space array; once the forging was complete and the pieces were assembled, he only needed to pour in Spatial Force and inscribe the array pattern to finish the job.

Yang Kai had done this more than once; before leaving Dark Star he had even personally set up a cross-stellar, extreme-distance space array, so none of this was particularly difficult for him.

What was required was only time.

Without anyone's help and handling it all alone, the time consumed was indeed a bit longer.

It took Yang Kai roughly fifteen days to complete the construction of the Space Array. Once finished, it was set right against the rock wall—so well hidden that, without a careful search, it would be nearly impossible to find.

Yet concealment alone could not guarantee the safety of the array.

As a Saint Yuan of his was driven into the array, it began to shift color, and before long it looked exactly like the surrounding ground.

At first glance, the space array seemed part of the earth itself; only by coming close and looking carefully would one notice the clues.

Before departing, Yang Kai had requested so many pieces of Thousand Illusions Glaze from the Liuli Sect for a reason: he intended to incorporate them into the space array to enhance its concealment.

After all, though this was a dead star, who could guarantee that no cultivators would come here? If the array were too conspicuous and someone discovered it, trouble would follow.

With Thousand Illusions Glaze refined into the array it was different; that glaze could already transform into myriad forms. By blending it into the array, enhancing the array's concealment was extremely simple.

Moreover, the incorporation of Thousand Illusions Glaze greatly increased the array's sturdiness, so even if meteors or storms occasionally ravaged the surface, they would not destroy it.

After inspecting it, Yang Kai confirmed his arrangement had no problems and was greatly satisfied.

Only then did he begin engraving the array pattern inside. As the pattern was completed, Yang Kai poured Spatial Force into it once more.

The array hummed loudly in an instant.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and showed a look of delight; the sound meant the array he set up had linked with the one at Lingxiao Sect, though whether it could transport someone there still needed testing.

Such a task naturally required his personal involvement. He was skilled in Spatial Force, so even if a transfer went wrong he had no fear—he could always tear the void with Spatial Force and force his way out through a rupture.

Calling the Stone Puppet to him mentally, Yang Kai stood and waited quietly.

A full day later the Stone Puppet arrived sluggishly.

Had there not been a special mental link between them, allowing Yang Kai to know it was safe, he might have thought the creature met with some accident and perished here.

Yang Kai glared at it and was about to scold it when his gaze suddenly fixed on the Stone Puppet's belly; he stared at it without ceasing.

Its belly was round and swollen, showing at once that it had ingested a great many minerals in the past half month—an immense quantity, otherwise its bottomless-looking belly could not have become like this.

Yang Kai was greatly astonished.

Along his travels, the dead stars he had encountered were extremely barren; some held not a scrap of value and were desolate wastes.

Yet the Stone Puppet had obtained so many minerals from this dead star; though there was no Spiritual Qi here, this place clearly contained mineral riches.

Minerals that attracted the Stone Puppet were certainly not worthless.

"Spit them out so I can have a look," Yang Kai ordered the Stone Puppet.

It scratched its head without hesitation and opened its mouth; minerals of various sizes and colors appeared and piled up, gradually forming a small mountain.

After it finished spitting them out, it patted its shrunken belly with an innocent expression.

"This is…" Yang Kai brightened, staring at a silver-glowing stone about the size of a basin. He stepped forward, touched it, and sent out Divine Sense to examine it, whispering, "Tiansuo Silver?"

Yang Kai was no longer the rash youth he had been; years of wandering and trials had given him discerning eyes and broad knowledge. He could not claim to know every cultivation material across the Star Domain, but he recognized most of them.

A basin-sized silver ore like this was clearly an Origin-Grade Upper-Level material: Tiansuo Silver! If blended into the forging of a Secret Treasure, it could greatly increase the treasure's flexibility, making it far harder to break in combat.

In simple terms, Tiansuo Silver was an auxiliary material that could be added when forging Secret Treasures; any Secret Treasure could use it. Martial artists treasured their Secret Treasures highly, and any material that could improve a treasure's performance would spark competition.

Tiansuo Silver was that kind of material and was not cheap!

A quail-egg-sized piece of Tiansuo Silver could be sold for at least one hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals.

A basin-sized chunk would be worth at least several million!

Yang Kai had not recovered from his surprise when a golden-glowing ore caught his eye.

"Profound Steel Essence!"

"Five-Colored Sand!"

"Phoenix Tear Azure Iron!"

…

"And so many Saint Crystals?"

Yang Kai inspected them one by one, and after a moment he was completely stunned by the Stone Puppet's half-month haul.

He silently calculated the value of the pile before him and found that the Stone Puppet's earnings in half a month almost equaled the entire stores of a medium-sized sect on Dark Star.

Every mineral before him was suitable for forging Secret Treasures; some even reached Void King-Grade. What puzzled Yang Kai most was that the Stone Puppet had swallowed a great many Saint Crystals.

It was understandable for this dead star to produce so many minerals, but there was no Spiritual Qi here—how could Saint Crystals appear?

Saint Crystals generally formed only on cultivation stars that possessed Spiritual Qi and living beings; they would never appear on dead stars.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered as two starkly different guesses surfaced in his mind. He did not hesitate, ordered the Stone Puppet to take the items back into its belly, and said, "Where did you find these? Take me to see!"

The Stone Puppet said nothing; it set off ahead, using hands and feet to lead the way.

Ten thousand li from the valley where Yang Kai had set the space array, there was a pit-like cave; the Stone Puppet jumped straight down when it reached that place.

Yang Kai followed closely behind.

When he had set the space array earlier he had scanned a range of three hundred thousand li and found no dangers, so he had not paid this sort of cave much heed.

Clearly, the Stone Puppet had found something good inside!

The cave seemed deep. As they went down, the only sound was the whoosh of strong wind. Yang Kai did not fear; he spread his Divine Sense to probe below, and even in the pitch dark he could see clearly.

They descended roughly three thousand zhang before reaching the cave's bottom.

Once his feet touched solid ground, Yang Kai immediately expanded his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

The results of that probe shocked him.

Underground was not the desolate earth cavity he had imagined, but an immense space far beyond measure, one his Divine Sense could not sweep to the end of!

The air was somewhat dry but breathable; under his Divine Sense he was astonished to find collapsed walls and ruins of buildings extending without break as far as he could sense.

This place was a ruin!

Judging by the architectural style of the buildings, the ruins were obviously ancient—probably left behind tens of thousands of years ago.

And that ruin area was clearly the main headquarters of a major sect.

"Just as I thought!" Yang Kai's face showed surprise, but his heart was calm.

All of this matched his conjecture well enough.

After seeing the Stone Puppet bring back so many Saint Crystals, Yang Kai had considered two possibilities.

One possibility was that this dead star was beginning to gestate its own laws and was close to forming; such a dead star would show no sign on the surface, but internally it could produce Saint Crystals.

Those Saint Crystals would emit Spiritual Qi over countless years, gradually filling the dead star's heaven and earth and making it suitable for life.

That was the process by which a dead star evolved into a cultivation star; such a dead star would be a newborn among the stars.

But in Yang Kai's senses he had detected no trace of any law.

Thus that possibility seemed unlikely.

The other, and more probable, hypothesis was that this dead star had long ago been a true cultivation star but due to some catastrophe its laws collapsed and Spiritual Qi dissipated, leaving it as it now appeared.

If Tongxuan Continent did not change, in a few thousand or ten thousand years it too might become one of the dead stars.
