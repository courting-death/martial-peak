## Chapter 633 — You Really Are a Beast

In the forest, Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu leaned against a large tree, both utterly spent.

Yun Xuan had been grievously wounded; Ruan Xinyu, having tended to her for a time, also felt exhausted. She rested by the tree for a long while before gradually recovering her spirits.

A great question churned in Ruan Xinyu’s mind: how could an Enchantress capable of easily killing Sun Ying have ended up dying so carelessly?

At that time she had been unconscious, and Yang Kai and the others had been enveloped by the sealing array the Enchantress had unleashed, so they had no clear idea what had occurred inside.

Once everything had been settled, Ruan Xinyu finally voiced the doubt that had been gnawing at her to Yun Xuan.

Yun Xuan hesitated for a moment, then briefly related what had happened before. Ruan Xinyu was instantly stunned: "He killed her?"

"Yes." Yun Xuan nodded slightly, staring at Yang Kai, who sat meditating not far off, her beautiful eyes clouded with confusion.

"That shouldn't be possible." Ruan Xinyu quickly sensed something amiss. "Even if the Enchantress’s physical body wasn't formidable, her Divine Sense power was unrivaled. Before she died, if she had unleashed a final Divine Sense strike she could have slain him. How could he have avoided such an attack?"

"I don't know." Yun Xuan shook her head. "All I saw was the scene of him killing the Enchantress; the rest I hardly remember."

"And you and him…"

"Don't ask." Yun Xuan's face flushed with embarrassment. Although she couldn't clearly recall exactly what had occurred, those blurred, chaotic images still passed through her mind from time to time, and the sensations in her body were real — the lower parts of her body still ached as if torn, even now.

The memory of that feeling brought Yun Xuan crimson-faced and trembling.

"What a strange man." Ruan Xinyu had begun to take an interest in Yang Kai. "Just a Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage cultivator — how could he have slain an Enchantress? And... even Zhou Luo couldn't withstand a single blow from him."

Zhou Luo was a squad leader of the Duao Alliance. By strength, neither Ruan Xinyu nor Yun Xuan could match him; that Yang Kai could easily slay Zhou Luo meant he could kill both of them as well.

"You've found a treasure. If we could recruit him into the alliance..." Ruan Xinyu’s eyes brightened as she thought of a good plan.

"What good would that do? Ji Hong and the others are dead..." Yun Xuan's expression darkened. She had known the squad members for at least three years, yet now they had died without any clear reason; before dying they hadn't even seen what had struck them. The thought pained her. "And I don't know whether he would be willing to join the Duao Alliance."

"If you won't recruit him, then I will." Ruan Xinyu leapt at the idea, a look of expectation and excitement on her face. "All the squad members are dead; it's the perfect chance to replenish our numbers."

"You are not to make a move on him!" Yun Xuan immediately warned.

"Tsk tsk, you woman... how interesting — you won't recruit him yourself but you won't let me? What kind of logic is that?"

"In any case, you are not allowed!" Yun Xuan said sternly.

"Fine, fine, I won't bother you; you're injured and I don't want to offend you." Ruan Xinyu laughed.

Although the two women usually clashed, after enduring this recent crisis their enmity seemed to have eased; old grievances subsided, and their relationship had grown more harmonious.

As they spoke, a long breath came from the other side. Both women snapped to attention and looked toward Yang Kai; indeed, he had opened his eyes. His wounds were not yet healed, but his spirit had much improved.

As if sensing their gaze, Yang Kai lifted his head and looked over. Yun Xuan and he met each other's eyes; Yang Kai’s expression was slightly awkward, and Yun Xuan quickly averted her gaze, her voluptuous form trembling subtly.

She remembered those fierce collisions and felt a heat rising in her body.

Ruan Xinyu took in their expressions and smiled, beckoning to Yang Kai with a coquettish curl of her finger. "Young brother, come over."

Yang Kai cleared his throat, rose, came to sit beside the two women, and faced them with an open expression.

Ruan Xinyu's eyes roamed over Yang Kai's bare torso with admiration. She couldn't help but praise inwardly — the young man's physique was impressive, his muscles evidently full of explosive power; no wonder he dared to entice the Enchantress close, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.

"How are your injuries?" Ruan Xinyu asked.

"Won't die." Yang Kai grinned.

"Not a bad body." Ruan Xinyu said, casting him a come-hither glance.

That display seemed to put Yun Xuan out of sorts; she lightly pinched Ruan Xinyu.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose awkwardly and mumbled, "Yesterday..."

"Nothing happened yesterday." Yun Xuan hurriedly cut him off, lying to save face.

Yang Kai was taken aback, then burst into laughter. "That's for the best."

He had expected the woman to cling to him and make a scene, but she behaved with such composure and declared she wouldn't mention yesterday's embarrassment — exactly what Yang Kai wanted.

The scene of yesterday had not been something Yang Kai had wished to happen either. Under the influence of the Enchantress's Divine Sense poison, both had lost some restraint; coupled with Yang Kai's deliberate temptation of the Enchantress to draw her close, the mistake was compounded and had to be carried through.

Facing an enemy like the Enchantress, if she was didn't come close, Yang Kai would have lost.

"Hey—" Ruan Xinyu immediately objected, glaring at Yang Kai. "What do you mean nothing happened? Do you intend to eat and deny it afterward? Yun Xuan can say that since she is shy, but why do you expose her like this?"

"So what do you want?" Yang Kai laughed. The woman in question had said she didn't want to dwell on it, yet Ruan Xinyu kept pressing him. Yang Kai found it inexplicable.

"Take responsibility, what else?" Ruan Xinyu puffed out her chest and said indignantly, "Yun Xuan preserved her chastity for nearly thirty years and you ruined it — if you don't take responsibility, who will?"

Yang Kai frowned, amused as he sized up Ruan Xinyu. "Aren't you two usually at odds? How come you're suddenly on the same side?"

Ruan Xinyu sneered. "What does how I get along with her matter to you? Now we're both women; it's right and proper that I help her get justice from you."

"You are a virgin too, aren't you?" Yang Kai said with a nasty laugh.

Ruan Xinyu's face stiffened. She snapped, "Bastard!"

She raised her hand to strike Yang Kai, then thought better of it — she was no match for him — and angrily withdrew her hand, teeth clenched, face flushed.

"Enough." Yun Xuan commanded. "Xinyu, this is my matter; I will deal with it myself. You need not speak further."

Ruan Xinyu had no choice. She shot Yang Kai a scowling glare and turned away in a sulk.

Yun Xuan looked at Yang Kai with eyes bright and unwavering; the gaze made Yang Kai feel somewhat embarrassed.

After a long moment, Yun Xuan finally spoke: "I will ask you a few questions. Given the loss I have suffered, answer me truthfully."

"Ask, then. If I can answer, I will not hide it." Yang Kai nodded lightly, his face open and sincere.

"Exactly who are you? And what is your cultivation?" Yun Xuan's expression grew serious; she wanted to learn more about the man who had taken her chastity.

"I told you, I come from a very remote corner; I can't clearly say what place it is. As for my cultivation, you can sense it — Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage. I haven't hidden that." Yang Kai replied honestly, then added, "However, my Seventh Stage is not like ordinary cultivators'; within the Divine Roaming Realm I’m practically invincible."

"What arrogance!" Ruan Xinyu curled her lips. Though she suspected he boasted, based on his earlier performance he did seem to have some strength.

"What is your relationship with Shui Ling of the Water Divine Hall? Why does she care about you so much?" Yun Xuan asked.

"My relationship with her... is not what you think; at most ordinary friends. She cares because I once helped her. That's about it."

Yun Xuan nodded slightly, satisfied, then pondered before continuing: "What did you intend when you followed us this time? Why, in the mine, did you not clearly explain the danger? Since you are so strong, why did you not act earlier when the Duao Alliance disciples were falling — why wait... wait... until she exposed a weakness?"

This time Yun Xuan had many questions, her tone slightly agitated.

Yang Kai shook his head. "Are you doubting me? Suspecting that I entered Duao City and approached you for some special purpose? Rest assured, everything I said to you is true; I have not lied. I came as I said to repay a debt: you gave me a Kongchan Jade, I saved your life. It seems our accounts are even. In the mine I warned you, but you didn't trust me and I had no proof. Saying more would only annoy you as we're not close; the fate of the Duao Alliance disciples is none of my concern!"

"As for why I waited for the Enchantress to reveal a flaw... if she hadn't, how could I have killed her? Had we truly fought, I might not have been her match; you have felt just how powerful her Divine Sense is. Using your chastity was a helpless measure and indeed my fault. Beat me, scold me — do as you wish. It's all already done." Yang Kai adopted an air of being unperturbed by consequence.

Ruan Xinyu seethed with indignation and disdain, but she also secretly felt fortunate that Yang Kai had chosen Yun Xuan; had he chosen her, she might have suffered the same fate, and at the thought she shuddered.

Though she rather liked the youth, they had known each other less than a day; had such a thing happened, Ruan Xinyu did not know whether she would have taken a knife to kill him.

Compared with that, Yun Xuan showed a much larger heart.

Yun Xuan was also quite angry — she had clearly been the one wronged, yet Yang Kai wore a look as if he had suffered injustice.

She drew a deep breath to calm herself. When she opened her eyes, Yun Xuan's expression was considerably more composed.

"Yang Kai..." Yun Xuan called softly.

"Hm?" Yang Kai answered in a low voice.

"You really are a beast!" Yun Xuan's voice remained gentle.

"Hm..." Yang Kai blushed.
