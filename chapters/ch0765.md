## Chapter 765 — Death Approaches

After a round of eating and drinking, the food was quickly consumed.

The demon looked at Yang Kai with no trace of mercy, his gaze full of contempt as if he were looking down on an ant.

"Anything you want to ask?" the man snorted; he too had noticed Yang Kai's attempt at ingratiation.

Yang Kai gave a light laugh, first introduced his own origin, then added, "May I ask your family name?"

The man frowned, seeming reluctant to give his name, but after a moment he replied coldly, "Gou Chi!"

Yang Kai sniffed and showed no reaction, but An Ling'er flinched, suddenly covering her mouth and letting out an exclamation.

"What is it?" Yang Kai turned to look at her.

"You're Gou Chi?" An Ling'er's face full of surprise as she stared at the demon.

"That's right."

"My heavens, you actually are Gou Chi. How did you end up captured here?"

"He's famous?" Yang Kai asked, surprised, looking at An Ling'er.

Gou Chi snorted and curled his lip, "You human kid originally looked sharp, how come you look so stupid now?"

"Sorry, I really haven't heard of you," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

An Ling'er pressed her lips together and said softly, "I've heard the name Gou Chi, but he's not too famous — the renowned one is his father, one of the Four Great Demon Generals, Gou Qiong!"

"Your father is a Demon General?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

He had long heard of the Demon Generals; in the Cangyun Evil Land's Bloodthirsty Evil Cave he had even slain a fragment of a Demon General. After arriving on Tongxuan Continent he learned from Shui Ling of the terrible power of a Demon General, so he knew well what such figures were capable of.

"My father is my father, I'm myself!" Gou Chi said proudly, unwilling to ride on his father's fame.

"With such a father, how could you be captured and brought here?" Yang Kai wondered.

Gou Chi's face turned awkward; he glared fiercely at Yang Kai, sighed heavily and said, "A screw-up in a gutter — better not to mention it. Once I'm out of here I'll gather forces and raze this place to the ground."

"May your wish come true," Yang Kai replied perfunctorily, then asked, "What do you know about this place?"

"Not much," Gou Chi shook his head. He no longer treated Yang Kai with such disdain, perhaps realizing that an enemy's enemy might be a friend. He intended to join forces with Yang Kai to seek a way out. "We only know that the people here call themselves the Yang Clan. They seem to have once been a human faction, but due to their cultivation methods and the presence of a certain Divine Tree, their bodies have become different from ordinary humans, so they gave themselves a new name."

"Divine Tree?" Yang Kai frowned; he vaguely remembered that when he first woke up a Yang Clan member mentioned a Divine Tree on the way to the main hall, saying they would turn people into nourishment for the tree.

"Yes, it's the root of the Yang Clan! Didn't you see a strangely different large tree when you arrived? The abundance of Yang attribute energy here is entirely because of that Divine Tree. Were it not for it, our demonic energies would not be suppressed so strongly."

The demons called the energy within them Demon Yuan, which was the equivalent of what human warriors called True Yuan.

Hearing this, Yang Kai slowly shook his head; he truly had not seen any Divine Tree, probably because he and An Ling'er had entered this Small Xuan Realm through a different entrance.

"That Divine Tree is strange; it can create Yang attribute energy by itself. But in recent years it's had problems and become unstable. To keep the tree healthy, the Yang Clan began abducting outsiders, and our Demon Domain happens to be the only entrance they use. So all those captured are my people. You two are strange — how did you get taken?"

"There is more than one entrance; we stumbled in by accident," Yang Kai explained casually.

"Oh, that explains it then," Gou Chi nodded, continuing, "You must have felt the unusual energy fluctuations earlier — that's the Divine Tree acting up. Whenever that happens they have to take some people out and use the blood and flesh of our kind to nourish the tree, calming it down."

"Those people taken away..."

"They're dead!" Gou Chi sneered. "And it won't be long before it's our turn. As you can see, there aren't many of my people left here."

Yang Kai's expression changed; the cells on both sides held only eleven or twelve people, and the other cells were also sparsely populated. Each time the Divine Tree acted up they took a few people for blood sacrifices; it really wouldn't be long before everyone here was gone.

The Yang Clan's habit of snatching demons from the Demon Domain must have drawn attention and caution; surely the Demon Domain would take countermeasures so they could no longer succeed so easily.

"The fruit you ate a few days ago came from their Divine Tree," Gou Chi explained with a frown. "You ate it with such relish, and your aura is irritating — you cultivate a Yang attribute method, right?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Then you can rest easy for now. As long as the people here haven't all been killed, they won't use you. The Divine Tree prefers people like you as nourishment; they'll keep you until the last moment," Gou Chi said with schadenfreude, laughing coldly, which made An Ling'er break out in goosebumps.

"Thanks for the warning," Yang Kai cupped his fist in thanks.

Gou Chi grinned slyly, looking meaningfully at An Ling'er. "If I were you, kid, I'd enjoy myself while I can. There's a beauty by your side and you haven't made a move — what's wrong with you? Don't tell me you have problems in that department. That won't do; you'll disappoint her."

As soon as he said that, the other demons burst into uproarious laughter.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he found the fellow irritating. An Ling'er tightened her clothes and glared at Gou Chi hatefully, then hid behind Yang Kai.

......

Since that day of candid conversation with Gou Chi, Yang Kai had a better grasp of the situation and was somewhat mentally prepared.

After sampling that fine wine, Gou Chi became even more shameless; whenever the Yang Clan brought meals he always took two jugs of wine from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn't mind and shared his food and drink.

After spending a dozen or so days together, Gou Chi was no longer as arrogant as before; though they weren't brothers, his attitude had grown considerably friendlier.

What left Yang Kai speechless was that the lecher kept egging him on to "take care" of An Ling'er. Every time the subject came up, An Ling'er's face would flush as she looked weakly toward Yang Kai.

Being imprisoned here kept everyone on edge, always fearing that life could be taken at any moment; these unrestrained demons naturally wanted some amusement.

In those ten-odd days Yang Kai twice felt unstable fluctuations in Yang attribute energy — no doubt another problem with the Divine Tree.

As always, each time this happened a number of demons were taken away and never returned.

As days slipped by, the number of demons left in the cells dwindled and the mood grew heavier.

The day of death was likely near; everyone realized this.

The atmosphere was tense, and only Yang Kai and Gou Chi seemed unaffected—one appearing unconcerned, the other seeming to have set life and death aside.

In his spare time Yang Kai kept cultivating, seizing every chance to strengthen himself.

He knew that when he was taken out he would have to fight with everything he had; whether he could kill his way to freedom within this Small Xuan Realm depended on these small accumulations of effort.

Anything below the Saint Realm he did not care for; if provoked he could release the Soul Devouring Worm, letting this entire Small Xuan Realm be devastated — the Yang Clan's higher-ups could hardly accept such a consequence, and under that threat there might be a chance to negotiate with their strong.

So he did not act panicked.

This was his trump card; he would not reveal it before the last moment.

A month passed, two months passed; roughly every five days someone was taken away. Over time Yang Kai felt the Divine Tree's unrest grow more frequent.

Few remained in the dungeon.

Besides Yang Kai and An Ling'er, only Gou Chi and two others remained in their cell.

The next time it would be their turn; the feeling of their life hanging by a thread left everyone trembling, and even Gou Chi could no longer remain composed.

One day, while drinking with Yang Kai, Gou Chi suddenly asked, "Friend, you're a man — if death comes, would you fight back?"

"You think I have the chance to?" Yang Kai gave a short laugh.

"They haven't sealed off your True Yuan; your chance is greater than mine."

"If that's the case, I certainly won't sit and wait to die."

"Good. When the time comes I'll help you. If you really escape, go to my father and tell him what's happened here so he can take revenge!" Gou Chi's expression turned ferocious as he spoke. "Let them know my kind aren't to be trifled with."

Yang Kai looked at him thoughtfully, suspecting the lecher hid other means and wouldn't be completely helpless when taken away.

But his methods were probably limited; his tone betrayed a lack of hope for escape.

If he truly threw himself into the effort, there might be a chance. Yang Kai's mind stirred.

As they spoke, a chaotic fluctuation rippled through the air.

Yang Kai, Gou Chi and An Ling'er's eyes flickered with astonishment as they glanced up.

"It's coming!" Gou Chi inhaled deeply and said in a low voice.

The Divine Tree was acting up again. Now, aside from them there was only one other demon in the cells; this time they likely faced certain doom.

Thud, thud, thud, thud...

Rapid footsteps sounded outside, and with a creak several Yang Clan members entered in cold silence.
