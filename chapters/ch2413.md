## Chapter 2413 — Supreme Sentiment Art

On the small island in the icy lake, Zi Yu was shocked beyond measure.

She had been imprisoned here, and following her master’s teachings, she communicated with the Secret Treasure left behind by the Ancestor years ago, hoping to summon the Ancestor who had been missing for thousands of years to uphold justice for her.

Her master had told her that if anyone in this world could save her from disaster, it would be the Ancestor alone.

But her master also said that ever since the Ancestor left Ice Heart Valley three thousand years ago, there had been no news or trace of her. Over these three thousand years, Ice Heart Valley had faced several calamities, and during those times, her master had also tried to communicate with the Secret Treasure, sending messages as the Ancestor had instructed, but never received a reply.

Many of the Sect’s upper echelons believed the Ancestor had likely perished somewhere in the Star Realm; otherwise, why had she never returned?

Even her master herself could not be certain whether the Ancestor was alive or dead.

Zi Yu’s attempt to send a message to the Ancestor through the Secret Treasure was truly an act of desperation, just a final effort.

She never imagined that someone would actually receive her message and come here. What surprised her even more was that the person who arrived was a man!

Wasn’t the Secret Treasure left by the Ancestor? Wasn’t the Ancestor a woman? What was with this man? Zi Yu was completely confused and couldn’t figure it out no matter how she tried.

As she puzzled over Yang Kai’s identity, his voice came again from the other side: “Miss Zi Yu, may I come over and speak? Talking like this might alert others.”

Suppressing the shock in her heart, Zi Yu replied calmly, “If you can withstand the cold here, then come over.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, and with a leap, rushed toward the center of the icy lake.

The next moment, he stood on the small island, and as he looked intently, a familiar face immediately came into view.

It really was her!

Yang Kai also found it very strange. He had only met this woman named Zi Yu a few days ago, when she was being besieged by people from Wenqing Sect. After he saved her, not only did she not thank him, but after hearing Fan Xin and the others explain their background, she warily fled.

He had no idea why she was now imprisoned in this forbidden place.

“It’s you!” When Zi Yu saw Yang Kai’s face, she couldn’t help but cry out in surprise. Realizing her voice was too loud, she quickly covered her red lips with her hand, her beautiful eyes trembling as she said, “How could it be you?”

She naturally remembered Yang Kai; after all, they had just met a few days ago, and he had saved her. What she couldn’t understand was how this man she’d only met once could appear in the forbidden area of Ice Heart Valley, and without being noticed.

“Miss Zi Yu, don’t be afraid. I mean you no harm!” Yang Kai saw her wary expression and quickly took a step back. “I came here at someone’s request!”

“At someone’s request? Who?” Zi Yu asked cautiously.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Take a look at this.”

As he spoke, he tossed a token to Zi Yu—the very one Bing Yun had given him.

Zi Yu took it suspiciously, glanced at Yang Kai, then carefully examined the token.

In the next instant, Zi Yu’s delicate body suddenly trembled, her beautiful eyes widened, shining with a strange light. She could hardly believe it and exclaimed, "This... this is the Ancestor's aura!"

Although she didn’t recognize what the token was, the aura lingering on it was unmistakable. It was exactly the same as the aura left on the Secret Treasure by the Ancestor years ago.

She suddenly looked up, staring at Yang Kai in shock, seeming both delighted and nervous. “The person who sent you here, could it be…?”

“Shh!” Yang Kai raised a finger to his lips, wearing a mysterious expression that could only be understood, not explained.

Zi Yu was overjoyed. Clutching the token tightly, she choked out, “I knew it, I knew it! Patriarch is safe and sound. Master, you can finally be at ease.”

She suddenly changed the subject and brought up her master again, though it was unclear who her master actually was.

As she spoke, she took out a message bead, her Divine Sense surging as she prepared to send a message.

Yang Kai frowned, “What are you doing?”

Zi Yu said, “My master has always worried about the Ancestor’s safety. If she learns the Ancestor is safe, she’ll be overjoyed.”

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, “Don’t tell your master about this just yet.”

“Why?”

Yang Kai replied, “Senior Bing Yun isn’t able to show herself right now. Give it a few days—she’ll come here in person, and your master will learn everything then.”

Hearing this, Zi Yu paused, thought for a moment, then nodded, “I was too excited. By the way, may I ask how to address Senior Brother?”

Yang Kai said, “Just call me Yang Kai.”

“So you’re Senior Brother Yang!” Zi Yu smiled radiantly, her whole demeanor relaxing completely. That smile nearly made heaven and earth lose their color. Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, but quickly recovered.

Zi Yu noticed his reaction and secretly praised him, since few men could remain unmoved by her beauty; countless men had looked at her with nothing but naked desire in their eyes.

Yang Kai was only amazed for a moment. To remain unmoved by beauty, he was clearly a man of great self-discipline.

"I was rude last time and I haven’t thanked Senior Brother Yang for saving my life. Please don’t hold it against me," Zi Yu said, a little embarrassed. Knowing Yang Kai was sent by the Ancestor, she felt a strong sense of closeness to him, so calling him Senior Brother came naturally, as if they really were fellow disciples. Although Ice Heart Valley had no male disciples and she’d never had a Senior Brother or Junior Brother, Yang Kai just felt extremely reliable to her.

“It’s nothing. Miss Zi Yu, you must be troubled by something, right?” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Zi Yu nodded sadly, forcing a smile, “Senior Brother Yang, you saw through me. I’ve indeed had some trouble lately.”

“Has something happened in Ice Heart Valley? If you don’t mind, you can tell me.” Yang Kai asked. He had come here to find the disciple who had sent a message to Bing Yun, and also to find out what had happened in Ice Heart Valley.

“Senior Brother Yang, just call me Junior Sister,” Zi Yu said softly. She had seen Yang Kai in action before—he had easily defeated Wenqing Sect’s Cao Yang with a single move, something she couldn’t do herself. So even though their cultivation was the same, Zi Yu felt she was no match for Yang Kai.

“It all started because of me.” Zi Yu’s face showed deep guilt as she spoke. After a pause, she looked up and said, “Senior Brother Yang, do you know about Wenqing Sect?”

Yang Kai nodded. Although he didn’t know much about Wenqing Sect, he at least knew it was a powerful sect in the Northern Territory, with many experts. In terms of status, it was comparable to Qingyang Shrine, Tianwu Sacred Land, and Wuhua Hall in the Southern Territory.

“Wenqing Sect has a technique called the Supreme Sentiment Art,” Zi Yu began softly. “It’s a very peculiar technique. Wenqing Sect has dominated the Northern Territory for so many years largely because of it. I’ve heard it was created by a Great Emperor-level expert named Wenqing. To cultivate this technique, one must use emotion as the path—the deeper the emotion, the faster the cultivation.”

Yang Kai was amazed, “Does that mean everyone in Wenqing Sect is hopelessly devoted?”

Zi Yu sneered, “Hopelessly devoted? Senior Brother Yang, you’re giving them too much credit.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Don’t you need to use emotion as the path? If you don’t fall in love, how do you cultivate the Supreme Sentiment Art?”

Zi Yu nodded, “You do need to use emotion as the path, and you must fall in love, experiencing a love that cuts to the bone. But Wenqing Sect’s elite disciples start learning the Supreme Sentiment Art from a young age, seeking out the woman they love, and using her as the focus of their emotions. Because of this technique, few women can resist the disciples’ tender affection; just a little contact and they’re hopelessly ensnared.”

“This technique is that strange?” Yang Kai was shocked. If it were just about using emotion as the path, that would be one thing, but the Supreme Sentiment Art even affected the object of one’s affection. That was truly bizarre—it was the ultimate tool for seduction. With this technique, what woman in the world could resist its charm?

“Because cultivating the Supreme Sentiment Art requires both the disciple and the object of their affection to fall in love. If the woman doesn’t fall in love, the disciple suffers backlash—the deeper the emotion, the stronger the backlash.” Zi Yu’s beautiful eyes filled with contempt. “If Wenqing Sect’s disciples could remain faithful, that would be fine; at least the two could be together and live happily. But the problem is, after cultivating this technique, the disciples progress rapidly, and few women can keep up with their pace. In just a few years, the gap in strength grows, and once it’s too wide, the woman is useless to the disciple. They need to find another woman of similar strength to fall in love with, and so on, climbing ever higher.”

Yang Kai swallowed, his face full of envy, “Does that mean every Wenqing Sect disciple has three wives and four concubines, and all of them are deeply devoted, never leaving?”

Zi Yu glanced at Yang Kai, annoyed, “Why do you look so envious, Senior Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai wiped the drool from his mouth and quickly waved his hand, “No, no, not at all. This technique is utterly depraved and outrageous. I despise such a heartless technique from the bottom of my heart!”

Whether Zi Yu believed him or not, she didn’t pursue the matter. She continued, “Among the Wenqing Sect’s elite disciples, anyone who cultivates the Supreme Sentiment Art rarely has only three wives and four concubines. Some have captured the hearts of dozens, even hundreds of women, all of whom are hopelessly devoted to them. I truly don’t know whether they’re fools or not.”

As she reached this point, Zi Yu clenched her teeth, her expression one of bitter frustration.
