## Chapter 2139 — Sea of Spiritual Qi

“Wuchang, you bastard, may you die a miserable death!” Xiao Baiyi roared in anger as he saw Wuchang and the one on the left flee, while the Flame Beast chased after him and the others.

Wuchang glanced back at him with a mocking look, said nothing, and fled the scene at top speed.

“Roar...”

That earth-shaking roar rang out again. The deafening sound crashed over the group, making them stagger, and the fiery pillar that followed was a deadly, soul-reaping strike.

Fortunately, everyone had already witnessed the terror of this Flame Beast, so at the first sound of its roar, they quickly changed direction, dodging the lethal attack together.

"Split up! Live or die as fate decides!" Xiao Baiyi barked, changing his escape route first and, even amid the chaos, found time to turn and launch an attack at the Flame Beast.

Clearly, he was trying to draw the Flame Beast away to give the others a chance to escape.

As the leader of the group, Xiao Baiyi’s actions were undoubtedly exemplary.

Unfortunately, his attack was rushed and feeble. It didn’t even reach the Flame Beast before being incinerated by the searing heat radiating from its body.

The Flame Beast paid him no mind and continued to pursue the others.

After Xiao Baiyi’s words, the others also tacitly scattered, turning into streaks of light and fleeing in different directions.

“No way, am I really this lucky?” Yang Kai managed a glance back in the chaos, only to see the Flame Beast chasing after him alone, ignoring everyone else. He had no idea what about him had attracted its attention.

“You really are blind, of all people to chase, you pick me. But... this might not be so bad.” He muttered to himself. Though he had no intention of fighting such a terrifying creature, he was confident in his ability to run away.

As long as the Flame Beast kept chasing him, the others would be safe.

Although Yang Kai had no real ties to the people from Qingyang Shrine, he had at least taken one of their spots to enter the Four Seasons Land. Doing what he could to help was within his sense of responsibility.

So, seeing the Flame Beast chasing after him, he actually slowed down a bit, keeping a certain distance between them—not so close that he couldn’t dodge attacks, but not so far that the Flame Beast would give up. In this way, he led it deeper into the Four Seasons Land.

Gradually, Yang Kai could no longer see anyone else. The Flame Beast, however, was relentless, constantly spewing scorching energy attacks from its mouth as it pursued him.

Its strength was formidable, but after all, it was just a demonic beast. Its ranged attacks were rather limited, so as long as Yang Kai was prepared, dodging them wasn’t difficult and he didn’t have to worry about being hit.

After half an hour, Yang Kai judged it was about time and suddenly surged his Origin Qi, boosting his speed.

The wooden boat Aunt Feng had given him was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level artifact. Aside from Imperial Treasures, it was the best flying Secret Treasure available, and its small size made it perfect for solo flight. With a burst of speed, the Flame Beast could only eat his dust.

Moments later, a frustrated roar echoed from far behind, but the Flame Beast was nowhere to be seen—Yang Kai had long since shaken it off.

Still, Yang Kai didn’t relax. He released his Divine Sense to scan the surroundings as he continued to fly.

Another half hour passed before he was sure he was safe. Only then did he slowly descend.

This was still the Summer Domain, the air scorching hot. Yang Kai found himself on a dried-up plain, with a clear view for thousands of li in every direction.

He took out a jade slip, checked the map of the Four Seasons Land, and compared it to the places he’d passed through before, finally determining his direction.

After a short while, he summoned the wooden boat again and sped off in a chosen direction.

His main goal in entering the Four Seasons Land this time was to find the Calamity Fruit.

The Calamity Fruit only grew in places of perpetual cold, so the Summer Domain was clearly unsuitable. He needed to reach the Winter Domain as soon as possible if he hoped to find this rare spirit fruit.

In this secret realm, he didn’t dare fly too high and had to stay alert at all times, which put a heavy strain on his Divine Sense.

An hour later, Yang Kai flew over a cracked canyon.

But soon, he circled back, hovering in midair and squinting down into the canyon below.

He couldn’t tell if the canyon was naturally formed or not. It was bottomless, pitch-black below, and fierce winds howled up from its depths.

The reason he’d returned was because, in that brief moment, he’d sensed something unusual.

Now, observing more closely, his eyes lit up and he muttered, “Could it be...?”

As he spoke, he dove down toward the canyon.

Strangely, though the Summer Domain was blazing hot, the inside of the canyon was completely unaffected. As soon as Yang Kai entered, he felt a chill, and the deeper he went, the less he felt the heat.

This made him even more certain that his earlier observation was correct.

The canyon was at least several thousand zhang deep. When Yang Kai reached two thousand zhang, he saw a thick layer of mist below, dense to the extreme.

“Haha, it really is a Sea of Spiritual Qi!” Yang Kai laughed aloud.

According to the information in his jade slip, there were places in the Four Seasons Land where the world’s Spiritual Qi was so abundant it formed a sea of mist—this was the Sea of Spiritual Qi.

The Sea of Spiritual Qi was filled with incredibly pure and dense Spiritual Qi, making it the best place for cultivators to train or break through.

But since the Four Seasons Land only opened for thirty-three days each time, cultivators who found a Sea of Spiritual Qi usually didn’t linger long. At most, they’d search for a while to see if they could find any heaven-and-earth treasures.

In such places, the chances of finding heaven-and-earth treasures were quite high.

Some people had found Emperor-Grade Spiritual Herbs in the Sea of Spiritual Qi, treasures of immeasurable value. Others had met with disaster there...

Demonic beasts also loved places rich in Spiritual Qi, so there was a good chance a powerful beast was lurking below.

The Sea of Spiritual Qi at the bottom of this canyon was even more abundant than when the Four Seasons Land first opened. The deeper Yang Kai went, the more he felt the astonishing Spiritual Qi.

In a place like this, even without circulating his cultivation, the omnipresent Spiritual Qi seeped into his pores, quickly restoring his strength.

After a full quarter of an hour, Yang Kai finally reached the canyon floor. It was a field of broken stones, messy but seemingly safe. Even after releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai sensed no signs of life.

He didn’t let his guard down, but searched the area thoroughly. After confirming that everything within a hundred li was safe, he returned to his original spot.

He opened his mouth and spat out the Xuan Realm Pearl, sending a stream of Origin Qi into it.

In the next moment, three graceful figures appeared together.

One sat cross-legged, apparently cultivating. One stood quietly, expressionless. The last sprawled on the ground in a large, lazy pose, looking utterly bored, her eyes vacant and lifeless.

Yang Kai glanced at the one lying on the ground and couldn’t help but chuckle.

“Sir!” Zhang Ruoxi, who had been meditating, opened her eyes at the sound, saw Yang Kai in front of her, and quickly stood up to greet him.

Liu Yan, who appeared with her, nodded gently to Yang Kai, then looked around, checking the surroundings with her beautiful eyes.

As for Hua Qingsi, who had been lying on the ground looking half-dead, she was stunned for a moment, not quite sure what was happening. But soon, she sprang up, surged her Origin Qi, and glared at Yang Kai. “You bastard, what are you up to now?”

She had been imprisoned by Yang Kai in the Small Xuan Realm, and the worst part was that he’d placed a restriction there, limiting her range to a hundred zhang.

In that wretched place, she was all alone, with no one to talk to. She was nearly driven mad.

Just now she’d been sprawled on the ground, only for Yang Kai to summon her out on the spot, thoroughly ruining her image. As a woman who cared about saving face, she naturally flew into a shame-fueled rage.

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes flashed with anger, her silver teeth clenched, and her gaze suddenly fixed on Zhang Ruoxi.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Before you try anything, let me give you a warning. If you so much as think of laying a hand on her to threaten me, I advise you to keep perfectly still. Otherwise... the consequences will be severe!”

Hua Qingsi’s expression changed, a trace of hesitation flashing across her face.

She had indeed been planning to target the weakest one, Zhang Ruoxi. She didn’t know what Zhang Ruoxi’s relationship with Yang Kai was, but she’d heard the girl call him ‘Sir’ just now.

If she could capture Zhang Ruoxi, she’d have some leverage to negotiate with Yang Kai.

Her expression shifted, but Yang Kai continued, “Trying to attack me would be even more foolish. If I dared let you out, I can just as easily put you back in! If you don’t want to suffer, just stand there and behave.”

Hua Qingsi gritted her teeth. “You demonic master, I curse you to die without a corpse!”

“Empty words like that mean nothing to me!” Yang Kai curled his lip, then ignored Hua Qingsi and turned to Zhang Ruoxi. “The Spiritual Qi here is very dense. Cultivate well—Liu Yan will protect you.”

“Yes!” Zhang Ruoxi didn’t ask any questions, simply obeyed Yang Kai’s arrangement, sat down cross-legged, and resumed her cultivation.

“But you don’t have much time—at most, two days.” Yang Kai added.

With that, he patted the Xuan Realm Pearl. A flash of light appeared on its surface, and a powerful suction erupted from within, drawing in the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

On the surface of the Xuan Realm Pearl, a visible wind eye appeared, spinning as it continuously sucked in Spiritual Qi.
