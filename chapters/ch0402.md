## Chapter 402 — Huo Family, Huo Xingchen

Out of the disciples that returned to the Yang Family, only Yang Wei reached the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Most others remained at the level of the True Yuan Realm.

It was not that the Yang Family disciples' aptitudes were inferior to Liu Qingyao's, but that over the years, they had been outside without the help and support of their family. The cultivation environment was slightly lacking, which led to this situation.

Had they been provided with the same resources, Yang Wei's cultivation might not be worse than Liu Qingyao's.

Nevertheless, Liu Qingyao's formidable strength and outstanding aptitude were indisputable. Winning him over would mean winning over the Liu Family.

Such a tremendous support drew the attention of many, but none had the capability to absorb it; hence, the frustration among them was palpable.

As for Qiu Yimeng, while she never voiced such opinions, those few Yang Family disciples who had interacted with her could discern that she seemed to show no interest in them and did not dare to force the matter. They could only set it aside for now and reconsider later.

At night, the sky grew heavy with clouds, pressing down ominously, as if a violent storm were about to arrive—so oppressive it made one feel slightly breathless.

On this dark night with the wind high, even the air felt infused with a faint coolness.

Yang Kai sat with his eyes closed in the courtyard, with invisible waves of Divine Sense power swirling around him. He manifested his own surge, striking out fiercely into the void.

The two elders were in closed-door cultivation. After days of intense training, Yang Kai's True Yuan Realm had reached the seventh stage, hitting a bottleneck.

Although he knew this bottleneck would eventually break through, Yang Kai did not want to wait. His True Yuan cultivation had made no progress, so he could only focus on refining his Divine Sense, hoping to find some inspiration from it.

Yang Kai had already mastered the cultivation of Divine Sense, but curiously, he had not yet cultivated a Sea of Consciousness.

Without a Sea of Consciousness for his Divine Sense, it was like a tree without roots or water without a source. Fortunately, with the aid of the Warm Spirit Lotus, the Divine Sense he had cultivated had not dissipated long ago.

Because of this, Yang Kai's soul techniques were somewhat lacking in power.

With only three stages left to the Divine Roaming Realm, Yang Kai was eager to know what would happen after he cultivated a Sea of Consciousness.

Thus, during this time, he cultivated more diligently than ever, ensuring that he would not waste any spare time.

Constantly employing soul attacks consumed Divine Sense power swiftly. After just over an hour, Yang Kai felt a wave of weakness wash over him.

He quickly ceased his practice and closed his eyes to rest.

In the latter half of the night, a light rain began to fall from the sky. The sound of wings beating entered his ears. Yang Kai frowned and looked up at the sky.

A flickering golden light shot down like lightning.

Once it landed gently on Yang Kai's shoulder, the Golden Feather Eagle let out a few soft cries.

Sensing the urgency in its calls, Yang Kai's expression changed slightly; he quickly soared into the air, flying towards the northern district.

The Golden Feather Eagle had been with Pang Chi at the Bamboo Segment Gang for the past few days, tended to by someone and only returning once a day to request Wan Yao Ling Ye. That it returned in the middle of the night clearly indicated that something had happened at the Bamboo Segment Gang.

The power of the Bamboo Segment Gang was not great, and their personnel varied in strength. Furthermore, with little benefit to be gained from them, usually, no one would set their sights on the gang.

But tonight was evidently different.

Remembering the previous internal conflicts within the Bamboo Segment Gang, Yang Kai already had a strategy in mind.

Ignoring the consumption of True Yuan, it only took him half an hour to reach the northern district.

Inside the Bamboo Segment Gang's lair, the sounds of killing filled the air, a chaotic din. Pang Chi led several powerful gang members, retreating under a group’s assault, as various martial skills and treasures flashed around them, with people falling to the ground one after another.

Blood flowed profusely while the rain streamed down, failing to wash away the crimson.

The Bamboo Segment Gang had a small number of members. Currently, the attackers outnumbered them by more than double, and not all the enemy’s experts had revealed themselves. There were even some standing aside spectating. In just a moment, the Bamboo Segment Gang suffered countless casualties, their defeat apparent. If it continued, everyone present would likely perish.

Pang Chi was also covered in injuries, gritting his teeth to hold on. While fending off attacks, he had already sent the Golden Feather Eagle flying away, hoping that his new master would come to their rescue.

After all, he was a young master of the Yang Family; surely he would have some powerful followers, right?

The only uncertainty for Pang Chi was whether Yang Kai would be willing to save him!

"Wu Qian!" Pang Chi shouted harshly at a middle-aged man in the enemy camp, "You from the Xuan Guang Association have always kept to your own business with our Bamboo Segment Gang. Why have you come to attack today?"

Wu Qian snickered coldly, the corners of his mouth as sharp as a blade, "Pang Chi, why bother feigning ignorance? My young master said that anyone who does not submit shall die!"

"Do you know who is backing our Bamboo Segment Gang, to dare to attack us?" Pang Chi roared, parrying blows.

Wu Qian sneered, "The Eight Great Families never interfere in disputes among small forces like ours. They relish our petty quarrels, as it offers them some entertainment. Do you really think that after your death today, your backing will seek vengeance? Dream on!"

Pang Chi's face fell; he knew Wu Qian wasn't lying.

For small forces like theirs, the Eight Great Families indeed would not intervene in conflicts. For them, the annihilation of such small powers was no big deal; they merely needed to support another.

Every year, countless small forces fell, yet they sprouted like bamboo shoots after the rain, endlessly emerging.

It was precisely for this reason he did not dare to hope Yang Kai would come to save him.

The two exchanged words when suddenly, atop the Tongtian Inn, a young master stood with a smile at the corner of his mouth, gazing down at the battlefield, his eyes gleaming with interest, as though enjoying a splendid performance.

Beside him, several other experts of the Xuan Guang Association stood quietly. These experts wasted their True Yuan to push away the raindrops headed for them.

Thus, even while standing on the roof, his clothes remained pristine and completely dry.

Noticing the exciting moments, the young man would even clap with glee, while the surrounding experts maintained a cautious demeanor, daring not to voice any discontent.

"Young Master Huo, the Bamboo Segment Gang is on the verge of collapse. Should we kill them or take them in?" the steward of the Xuan Guang Association, Mu Nandou, asked softly.

Upon hearing this, Young Master Huo's lips curled into a chilling smile, but he did not respond directly, only stating coolly, "I have a habit: whatever I desire, I must obtain at the first moment. If I cannot get it... I will no longer want it. Do you understand?"

Mu Nandou's expression tightened, and he quickly nodded, "Understood, honored one!"

The Xuan Guang Association was established during Young Master Huo's boredom. How could Mu Nandou dare disobey his orders?

Previously, Young Master Huo wished to recruit the Bamboo Segment Gang, but was rejected by Pang Chi, a clear sign of his displeasure. In that case, there was no need to keep them.

Mu Nandou slightly bowed, then his body shimmered with a green light, speeding downwards.

However, before he reached Pang Chi and the others, a streak of light shot down from the air like a silk ribbon. Sensing the destructive energy hidden within that attack, Mu Nandou's face changed drastically as he hurriedly shifted direction to evade.

Simultaneously, shouts rang out from the rooftop from several others in the Xuan Guang Association, "Young Master, be careful!"

By the time Mu Nandou landed and looked back, his eyes narrowed. He realized a young man had unexpectedly leaped in front of the Xuan Guang Association's experts, targeting Young Master Huo, who was encircled by them.

Recovering from his shock, he swiftly flew back, for it was naturally of utmost importance to ensure the safety of his master.

While still mid-flight, Mu Nandou's eyes widened because that young man was astonishingly powerful. He wielded a blood-red long sword, with sword energy surging destructively, releasing countless blood-red petals. Not a single expert from the Xuan Guang Association could withstand the onslaught, all retreating continuously, leaving only Young Master Huo standing still.

Liu Qingyao had arrived?

Mu Nandou barely had time to register this thought when he saw that young man approach Young Master Huo and effortlessly subdue him, as though pinching a snail between his fingers; Young Master Huo did not even have time to react.

At this moment, two powerful Divine Senses suddenly surged forth, and instantly, two imposing figures materialized in mid-air, their gazes as cold as ice.

Yang Kai held Young Master Huo's wrist with one hand while the other held the sword horizontally against his neck, not sparing a glance to the martial artists of the Xuan Guang Association, merely giving a cold smile to those two figures in the air.

They were both experts at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, their strength not inferior to Blood Servants!

The Huo Family was one of the Eight Great Families, and since this Young Master Huo was a member, it was natural he had experts guarding him.

Yet, in a small forces' battle, those two couldn’t be embarrassed by revealing themselves, believing that under their watch, no one could do anything to their young master. Thus, they quietly hid aside, not expecting Yang Kai to be so fierce, capturing their young master before they could react.

By the time they rushed over, it was already too late.

The two Divine Senses swirled around Yang Kai, briefly hesitating before they surged towards Yang Kai's mind.

As the Divine Senses crashed into his mind, it felt as though a stone had sunk into the sea, without even creating the slightest ripple.

Yang Kai's cold smile intensified!

The two men, their expressions shifting drastically, suddenly realized that this young man was no ordinary person.

As a martial artist of the True Yuan Realm, to withstand the attacks of their two Divine Senses, he must possess a Divine Soul Treasure. Someone of such caliber must have a significant background; thankfully, their earlier assault bore no killing intent; they merely sought to save their young master. Even if he resisted, it wouldn't bring him any harm.

Therefore, the enmity could still be mended, and there was potential for resolution.

Looking back at Yang Kai, the expressions of the two experts turned solemn, already tinged with caution.

At this moment, Young Master Huo finally returned to his senses. His courage was notable; he showed no sign of fear, only laughing coldly, "Daring to place a sword at my neck, you are indeed amusing, very amusing!"

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, "Oh really?"

“Do you know who I am?” Huo Xingchen smiled lightly, a playful look on his face.

"I haven't had the pleasure of asking."

"The Huo Family, Huo Xingchen!"
