## Chapter 1188 — Cui Luo Grass

Only that place in this world could produce such an earth-shattering prodigy, which is why Meng Hongliang panicked so at the last moment.

I had heard that people from that place behaved coldly and mercilessly, but now it seems that isn't always true — at the very least this fellow Yang Kai is a decent sort.

It looks like worldly rumors truly cannot be fully trusted.

Yang Kai did not mention the Fire Radiance Crystal Core, and Huang Xiran did not ask; the two tacitly understood one another.

For Huang Xiran, avenging his grievance was already enough; why would he press his advantage to demand the Fire Radiance Crystal Core from Yang Kai? After all, it had become the other's spoil.

Only after Yang Kai's figure had vanished did Huang Xiran hurriedly gather the scattered Spatial Rings from the ground, take out the Saint Crystals and Pills inside, and swiftly leave to find a hidden place to heal, while also hoping to contact other disciples to help guard him.

Five days later, Yang Kai passed through the Heat-Flame Zone and suddenly arrived at a place where the Spiritual Qi was extraordinarily dense. Here there were none of the pervasive heatwaves of the Heat-Flame Zone, nor the ever-present fire toxin invading the body; the trees and grass were lush, birds sang, flowers scented the air, and the atmosphere was crisp and refreshing — truly a paradise apart from the world.

The heaven-and-earth treasure zone!

Yang Kai's spirit surged; he knew he had finally crossed the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone and entered the Second Layer, the heaven-and-earth treasure zone.

The Flowing Flame Sandland is indeed strange, layered and sharply divided; the environments differ drastically, yet at each boundary the Heat-Flame Zone and the heaven-and-earth treasure zone are perfectly separated — the heatwaves and fire toxin cannot intrude here at all.

Since parting ways with Huang Xiran of that Jidao Sect, Yang Kai had been pressing onward these five days.

As he pushed inward he met groups of warriors from several forces — they traveled in packs, doing nothing but hunting Fire Spirit Beasts in the Heat-Flame Zone to slay them, and searching for fire-attributed Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine; of course, obtaining rare ores like Fire Radiance Crystal would be even better.

Essentially, among each major forces' entrants, more than half stay behind in the Heat-Flame Zone to do such work, while the remainder enter the heaven-and-earth treasure zone to look for Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine; those qualified to enter are the elite of their respective Sects.

It seems unfair. The weak and low-born fight outside while the strong and gifted search treasures in peace — the better your talent and strength, the better your treatment.

It's the same as the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.

If you want good resources, you must first raise your strength.

Yang Kai traveled without incident, encountering no troublemakers like Meng Hongliang; aside from being glanced at oddly by some warriors, everything else went smoothly.

Those warriors saw Yang Kai's low realm and that he walked alone in the Heat-Flame Zone, and assumed he was courting death. Most watched for a spectacle. A fair-looking young woman Yang Kai did not know ran over and urged him to turn back and stop seeking death.

Yang Kai gave a few casual replies to her well-meaning words. When she saw he insisted on going deeper, she stopped wasting breath, merely shaking her head in pity at how some fools had no regard for their lives.

The Heat-Flame Zone should have taken about ten days to traverse, but because of that strange valley and the maze delay, Yang Kai spent roughly a month.

By now many had surely already entered the heaven-and-earth treasure zone. Yang Kai calmly released his Divine Sense and leisurely began searching for Spiritual Herbs Medicines.

Wei Guchang once said that although there were no Fire Spirit Beasts in the heaven-and-earth treasure zone, many demonic beasts still existed there, so caution was necessary.

For several days in a row Yang Kai encountered no one.

His gains were small; whether others had already beaten him to it or the area was simply sparse, his expectation here slowly waned — after all, he had seen the riches of the Floating Continent.

The Floating Continent was truly abundant; Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine grew everywhere, and Origin-Grade and Void King-Grade items were countless.

Most medicinal materials in the heaven-and-earth treasure zone were Saint King-Grade Upper-Level, with some Origin-Grade mixed in — a huge haul for anyone else, but Yang Kai was somewhat indifferent.

He still hadn't found the several herbs he sought.

Once this trip through the Flowing Flame Sandland ended, he wanted to refine some Pills to strengthen Wu Yi and the others; after all, Wu Yi and Yu Feng's strength was too low.

One day as he walked, Yang Kai suddenly sniffed the air with a peculiar expression.

He smelled a familiar scent — a special, faintly piquant medicinal aroma.

The scent of Cui Luo Grass! Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

Cui Luo Grass was one of his goals on this trip. Dark Star did produce Cui Luo Grass, but once it appeared it would be seized by the major forces, because it was the primary ingredient for refining the Origin Condensing Pill.

Though the highest-grade alchemists on Dark Star could only reach Lower-Level Origin-Grade, they could still attempt to refine Origin Condensing Pills; ten furnaces might yield one, and that could mean a significant chance to birth an Origin Returning Realm expert.

For this reason Cui Luo Grass was impossible to buy on the market — it was one of the most sought-after medicinal materials.

If Yang Kai wanted some, he had to hope to find it on this Flowing Flame Sandland venture.

He had not expected to actually discover any.

That faint, piquant medicinal air could only come from Cui Luo Grass, and judging by the aroma's potency, there seemed to be quite a number of them; otherwise the scent could not have spread so far.

Yang Kai's spirit lifted; without needing Divine Sense he followed the herb's fragrance and hurried in that direction.

After about half an hour he finally arrived. He did not rush to harvest the Cui Luo Grass but concealed his aura and looked around.

He knew that where Cui Luo Grass grew there was a high chance of certain special demonic beasts coexisting.

He decided to first check for signs of demonic beasts.

Looking over, Yang Kai's heart thumped wildly; he could not contain his joy.

Because within that wide area, there were actually more than a dozen small green plants, each bearing seven tiny leaves.

Having seven leaves meant those Cui Luo Grasses were at least five hundred years old, fully mature. In Yang Kai's hands they would become a dozen or so Origin Condensing Pills.

Not far from those dozen herbs was a one-person-high earthen hole exuding a faint stench; the entrance had some slimy marks.

Seeing this, Yang Kai finally understood what kind of Demonic Beasts accompanied the Cui Luo Grasses.

Silver-Horned Electric Python!

The Silver-Horned Electric Python was a Seventh- or Eighth-Tier demonic beast; at peak growth it could become a jiao, a Ninth-Tier demonic beast. It loved the piquant scent of Cui Luo Grass, which is why it nested here.

Yang Kai had learned such information from the tomes Zong Ao of Rainfall Star had given him, otherwise he couldn't know so much about the herbs in this Star Domain.

Whether Seventh-Tier or Eighth-Tier, Yang Kai wasn't too worried; he believed he could harvest the herbs and flee quickly with his speed.

His Divine Sense swept the earthen hole and immediately detected two Silver-Horned Electric Pythons, both already at Eighth-Tier!

Those two beasts had no doubt lived here long enough to reach Eighth-Tier; it was not surprising.

What concerned Yang Kai was that he was not alone here — two other warriors had arrived ahead of him.

The two clearly knew there were dangerous creatures in the hole, so even though they came earlier than Yang Kai they dared not act rashly; they seemed to be discussing how to harvest the Cui Luo Grass.

The best plan, naturally, was for one to lure the snake from the hole while the other collected the herbs.

But both were only Second Stage of the Saint King Realm; one could handle a single Silver-Horned Electric Python and retreat if beaten, but facing two at once would be extremely dangerous. Neither wanted to risk their lives, so they hesitated.

Before they could decide, a man in a black tight outfit strolled out from not far away and briskly approached the dozen Cui Luo Grasses.

The two froze, then realized someone was about to snatch the treasure.

The man in black seemed oblivious to the danger, a smile of delight on his face.

After a brief daze, the two could no longer hold back. Whether that man could gather the Cui Luo Grasses or not, once he stepped forward and alerted the beasts, with their strength, they could forget about getting anything at all.

In a hurry both of them rushed out.

Yang Kai frowned; seeing their action he quickened his steps and in an instant arrived before the dozen Cui Luo Grass.

As swift as lightning, he gathered the herbs and tossed them into his Spatial Ring.

Only then were the two Silver-Horned Electric Pythons in the hole provoked; a pale blue arc of lightning flashed and suddenly shot out from the hole straight at Yang Kai's abdomen.

At the same time a table-sized python head probed out, its triangular eyes watching Yang Kai coldly; its forked tongue flicked, and a silver horn on its head radiated intense electric energy.

With a rumble the great body of the Silver-Horned Electric Python crawled out of the hole, causing the earth to quake; Yang Kai's act of harvesting had clearly enraged it.

The other Silver-Horned Electric Python quickly followed.

Yang Kai shifted and dodged the first lightning attack, about to flee, when he heard an urgent snarled shout: "Leave the Cui Luo Grass if you don't want to die!"

The voice unleashed a Saint Yuan surge, and a majestic tiger head lunged at Yang Kai, baring fangs and snapping.

He would never hand over what he'd gotten. Yang Kai knew these two were desperate, otherwise they wouldn't have charged out so recklessly. He shifted again and easily evaded the tiger-head attack.

Coincidentally, that tiger-head struck the second Silver-Horned Electric Python that had just emerged; a tiger roar echoed, electricity danced across that python's body — though not wounded, it was enraged by the blow.
