## Chapter 1055 — Ancient Ruins

Yang Kai unleashed his power without reservation; the Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle surged to its utmost speed.

A growing unease and sense of crisis gnawed at his heart.

Within half a day he reached the mountains where the branch office was located, and he went straight to the loft Halika had arranged.

From a distance Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to survey; he found the loft unchanged from when he left, with no sign anyone had come, and Xue Yue was not there.

He turned on his heel at once and sped toward the branch headquarters.

Moments later Yang Kai arrived once more before the palace where he had last seen Halika.

The guards posted at the palace gates saw him racing over in such a hurry and frowned, wondering what had put him in such a state.

They had met Yang Kai before and knew this young man had come with the Lady from the principal star, acting as that Lady's escort; his strength was modest, however, and they held him in contempt—secretly thinking that the main star’s envoy was no great matter.

“Has Branch Chief Halika returned?” Yang Kai landed before them and, wasting no words, demanded.

“What business do you have with Lord Halika?” one guard shot back instead of answering.

“Has he returned?” Yang Kai growled, his face grim, his manner like a beast choosing its prey.

The guard froze, a sliver of fear rising in his chest, and he instinctively shook his head.

“Do you know where he went?” Yang Kai pressed.

The guard who had shaken his head earlier, irritated by his own involuntary compliance, snorted coldly: “The Lord’s whereabouts are not for you to inquire about. Who do you think you are?”

Even if he came from the principal star, he was only a Second Stage of the Saint Realm escort; their tone and attitude were truly aggravating.

Yang Kai cast him a look and privately concluded his questions were futile. These people held lowly positions and likely knew little of the branch’s secrets.

Saying nothing more, Yang Kai turned and flew toward another palace.

Inside that palace lingered the aura of a powerful expert at Origin Returning Realm; he ought to know something of the situation.

“Damn, that brat…” Several guards bristled with anger and glared after Yang Kai. If not for his status as an envoy from the principal star, they would not have let him go so easily.

Moments later Yang Kai arrived before the other palace, landed, and strode to the guards at the gate. “I must see the Lord inside!” he declared.

“What is it?” one guard asked.

“Branch Chief Halika appears to be in trouble!”

The guard’s expression changed; he sized Yang Kai up with disbelief. “How do you know? Lord Halika is an Origin Returning Realm expert, one of the foremost on Rainfall Star—what could possibly—”

“Can you go in and inform him?” Yang Kai impatiently interrupted.

“Let him in!” a booming voice suddenly called from within; the commotion had already been noticed by the expert inside.

No sooner had those words fallen than Yang Kai stormed into the palace like the wind.

Much like Halika’s palace, in this hall a middle-aged man sat handling branch affairs. Seeing Yang Kai barge in, he looked up and asked, “Are you the escort who came with Lord Xue from the principal star?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded.

“I am Lin Mufeng of the branch.” The middle-aged man snorted. “I don’t care whether you’re an envoy from the principal star. Whoever you followed here, in this matter I decide!”

Yang Kai said nothing.

“Why do you say Halika is likely in trouble?” Lin Mufeng approved of Yang Kai’s cooperative tone and asked, “As far as I know, you have no qualification to be involved in this confidential operation. If you weren’t involved, how could you possibly know?”

Yang Kai frowned, an idea flashing through his mind. He produced the compass-shaped Secret Treasure and said, “Lord Xue sent a message. They ran into great danger.”

“What kind of danger?” Lin Mufeng’s color shifted; he began to believe Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I can’t contact Lord Xue now. Try to contact Branch Chief Halika and see if you can reach him.”

Lin Mufeng pondered for a moment, then took out a compass Secret Treasure of his own, pouring Divine Sense into it in an attempt to contact Halika.

After a moment his face turned grave. He barked, “Something’s happened.”

He had received no reply and immediately knew Yang Kai’s words were true.

“Come with me!” Lin Mufeng waved at Yang Kai and hurried outside.

Once outside Lin Mufeng produced a Star Shuttle and flew off in a certain direction; Yang Kai followed close behind.

While flying Lin Mufeng held the compass Secret Treasure and kept exchanging messages, issuing orders.

Soon from all directions shimmering cyan arcs flashed, rapidly converging—these were the Hengluo Commerce Guild warriors Lin Mufeng had summoned.

They swarmed around Lin Mufeng and sped onward with him without asking any questions about what had occurred.

Yang Kai watched closely, inwardly surprised.

Many of these warriors were Saint King Realm experts; there weren’t many cultivators at the Saint Realm, and among them were even several Origin Returning Realm figures.

“Mufeng, what happened? Why did you call us here in such haste?” a middle-aged woman asked as she approached Lin Mufeng.

“Halika and his party seem to be in trouble. I can’t get any response no matter how I call!” Lin Mufeng said anxiously.

The middle-aged woman’s face changed; she cried out, “Could there really be danger in those Ancient Ruins?”

“I don't know. When we discovered that ruin we reported it to the principal star and did not investigate on our own. Lady Xue came this time to probe the ruin; if there is danger, it’s not surprising.”

“Where is Lady Xue then?” the middle-aged woman asked.

“With Halika.” Lin Mufeng’s expression turned extremely grim. The woman glanced, then murmured, “She appears to be Young Master Xue Yue’s woman!”

The woman’s face turned pale; she quickly realized the matter was graver than she had imagined.

If others had met misfortune due to unknown dangers, it might not be the end of the world—though the branch would not be happy. But now Branch Chief Halika was involved; that was something the branch could not bear to see.

If Lady Xue truly was Xue Yue’s woman, matters took on a completely different hue.

No one dared bear Young Master Xue Yue’s wrath! If things went badly, the entire branch could be purged—rivers of blood, countless dead. No one could shoulder such responsibility.

Everyone knew full well how ruthless and heartless Young Master Xue Yue was.

As the two spoke, Yang Kai remained silent; they made no effort to hide anything, and he heard clearly about the Ancient Ruins. He also understood why Xue Yue had come to Rainfall Star this time.

Under normal circumstances Yang Kai would have been curious about the Ancient Ruins, but his mind was elsewhere now.

The farther they flew, the stronger Yang Kai’s unease became.

He did not know exactly what Xue Yue had encountered, but one thing was certain: Xue Yue was not dead!

Their lives were bound together; if Xue Yue died, Yang Kai would surely die as well.

He silently resolved that this time he must sever the Soul Chain no matter what—no matter if Xue Yue later caused him trouble, he could not stand the feeling of his life being out of his own hands.

After flying for a long while Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman suddenly descended.

Below was a mining area yielding unknown ores; the ground was pockmarked with deep pits, many bottomless and utterly black.

A party of dozens landed at the edge of the largest sinkhole.

Commerce Guild's warriors stationed nearby immediately came forward, cupping their fists: “Lord Lin, Lady Qi!”

Lin Mufeng inclined his head slightly and asked, “What happened here?”

The warrior looked bewildered. “Nothing has happened…”

He seemed still unaware of the situation.

Lin Mufeng shook his head and did not press further. He took out the compass Secret Treasure and tried to call again, but still received no response from Halika.

“Has Branch Chief Halika met with an accident?” the warrior finally asked, alarmed by Lin Mufeng’s expression.

Lin Mufeng nodded. “Probably. I’ll take some people down to investigate; you wait for my report.”

Saying that, he prepared to descend when the middle-aged woman surnamed Qi suddenly cried out, “Someone’s coming up…”

Lin Mufeng’s face sobered and he immediately released his Divine Sense to probe. At the same time, Yang Kai was scanning the situation.

Several wavering life signs were rapidly rising from the pit; judging by their fluctuations they had met danger and suffered injuries. One of them gasped faintly, life flickering as if it would be snuffed at any moment.

“It’s Halika!” the middle-aged woman shouted as she detected his aura.

Lin Mufeng’s face brightened and he waited in silence.

Moments later several cyan lights shot up from the pit as if fleeing some pursuing peril, streaking toward the sky.

Every one of those cyan lights flickered unnaturally—clearly the Star Shuttles within had been damaged and their stability compromised.

A dozen or so Commerce Guild warriors who had followed Lin Mufeng sprang up and pulled their companions aboard.

One of them was enveloped in a chilling aura like smoke; when an inexperienced guild warrior caught him, the chill spread over him and within moments he froze rigid and could not move.

The two seemed locked together, falling from the sky in tandem.

Boom…

A dull sound, flesh and bone cracking like ice, shattering—the two warriors were dead in an instant.

“Don’t get near them!” a furious shout rang out. Halika, pale-faced, struggled down from the sky.

At his command the guild warriors preparing to rescue their companions halted, not daring to approach.

Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman stared at Halika, and upon seeing his condition their eyes narrowed and a chill rose in their hearts.

Yang Kai also took in Halika’s condition, his expression turning grave.
