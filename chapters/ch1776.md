## Chapter 1776 — Shocked Ghost Ancestor

As the Seven Luminaries Divine Light receded, the Ghost Ancestor suddenly asked, "By the way, Boy Yang. I saw you seem to have a lot of knowledge about Spiritual Pills and medicines—could it be you practice alchemy?"

Although up to now the two of them had only obtained a Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit and a Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi, Yang Kai was always able to name, at the first opportunity, which Spiritual Pills could be refined from those materials, and he could also describe in great detail how to preserve them; he explained everything with such authority that it was easy for the Ghost Ancestor to draw certain conclusions.

"I can!" Yang Kai nodded, offering no denial.

“Oh?” The Ghost Ancestor looked at Yang Kai in surprise. “In just thirty or forty short years, for you to grow from the Saint Realm to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm is already astonishing enough—yet you even found time to study Alchemy? Aren’t you afraid of spreading yourself too thin?”

Yang Kai gave a soft laugh and replied, "My study of alchemy was always meant to assist cultivation. I have never abandoned the pursuit of the Martial Dao."

"That's right." The Ghost Ancestor regarded him approvingly. "The paths of pill-refining, artifact-forging, and array-craft are unpredictable in power, but compared to the great path of martial cultivation they still fall short by a degree. Those of us who cultivate should place the pursuit of the Martial Dao first; the rest must only serve as support."

He adopted a tone of kindly admonition and careful guidance, and Yang Kai naturally inclined his head in agreement.

"Still, that said, accomplishing anything in all three of those Domains would be remarkable." The Ghost Ancestor was satisfied with Yang Kai's attitude and smiled slightly, then asked curiously, "Tell me, what kinds of Pills can you refine now?"

Hearing the question, Yang Kai thought seriously for a moment before answering solemnly, "Since Elder inquires, I won't hide it. I am now, more or less, a Void King-Grade alchemist; I can refine Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills."

The moment the words fell, the Ghost Ancestor's body trembled with a great shock; he stood rooted and stared straight at Yang Kai, remaining silent for a long time.

"Elder?" Yang Kai gave an awkward laugh. The Ghost Ancestor's reaction had been within his expectations — after all, how many Void King-Grade alchemists existed in the Star Domain? Those alchemists were renowned across the world and were all elderly and white-haired; for someone of Yang Kai's age to be a Void King-Grade alchemist was virtually impossible.

The Ghost Ancestor was silent for a long while, then drew a deep breath and, voice trembling slightly, said, "You must be joking?"

He had thought Yang Kai was teasing him; he had been staring at Yang Kai earlier to observe any trace of a joke on his face, but he had seen none. He immediately realized that Yang Kai's words might be true.

"I'm not!" Yang Kai shook his head.

"You truly are a Void King-Grade alchemist?" the Ghost Ancestor exclaimed, then immediately glanced around as if fearful of anyone overhearing his voice.

"Why would I joke about that?" Yang Kai said. "Although I have only refined a handful of Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills, they were indeed refined. By the Star Domain's standards for ranking alchemists, I should count as a Void King-Grade alchemist."

The Ghost Ancestor sucked in a cold breath and stared at Yang Kai as if he were looking at a monster.

Yang Kai was so young — and on top of an astonishing cultivation level, he had also reached Void King-Grade mastery in alchemy! How had he achieved it? Even hammering day and night for years, most would not reach that level; unless he could split himself into dozens of clones to train simultaneously, such a feat seemed impossible.

The Ghost Ancestor was utterly baffled.

"Very few know I'm a Void King-Grade alchemist. Aside from the women by my side, only you know, so please keep it secret for me," Yang Kai said with a mischievous smile.

He had previously concealed his identity as an alchemist because his strength had been insufficient and he feared becoming a target.

But now, with his power increased, revealing his status would no longer invite trouble; it could bring him great benefits and assistance. Yang Kai therefore no longer intended to hide.

Hearing this, the Ghost Ancestor exhaled, his voice becoming grave. "I understand its value. I won't spread it around. Besides, I don't know many people and wouldn't bother with such things. But... why tell me the truth? Aren't you afraid I might harbor other intentions toward you? You must know how tempting a Void King-Grade alchemist is to people like us. If one could capture such an alchemist to make pills exclusively, improving one's strength would be effortless."

"Heh, Elder, you're not that sort of person, are you?" Yang Kai scratched his nose. "If I didn't trust you, I wouldn't be honest. Besides, offending a Void King-Grade alchemist against befriending one — which is better? I think you know the answer. Even if you captured me, I'd have to cooperate willingly to refine pills for you. What if the pills I made contained hidden poisons?"

As he spoke he winked at the Ghost Ancestor.

He had not confessed on a whim; Yang Kai had given his decision careful thought.

The Ghost Ancestor gazed intently at Yang Kai for a long while before suddenly bursting into loud laughter. “Hahahaha! This old man is truly honored. Who would have thought that the boy I once barely paid any mind to would not only have achieved such cultivation, but even become a Void King-Grade Alchemist! If word of this were to spread, it would bring great glory to this old man’s name.”

"You flatter me, Elder," Yang Kai said modestly.

"So you can refine the Great Brahma Heaven Pill and the Demon-Suppressing Pill?" the Ghost Ancestor asked urgently, his heart stirring.

The Great Brahma Heaven Pill could help him cultivate and boost his strength; the Demon-Suppressing Pill could suppress inner demons — both would be of great use. He had planned to seek out the few remaining Void King-Grade alchemists in the Star Domain and ask them to refine such Pills.

But that would unquestionably cost a fortune and might require years of waiting. Those few alchemy masters were busiest people imaginable. It wasn't simply a matter of offering materials and payment; it depended on their schedules.

The Ghost Ancestor, who had nowhere to go, was unfamiliar with such matters but knew some common sense: given his status and cultivation, he might have to agree to harsh conditions, like killing someone or taking a dangerous risk, before an alchemy master would act.

In short, the price to hire those masters could be one even a Void King-Grade expert might not be able to pay.

Yet here and now, there stood before him a Void King-Grade alchemist who was also on friendly terms with him.

The Ghost Ancestor was nearly ready to shout with joy.

He secretly rejoiced that he had not slain Yang Kai back then, that he had remembered Yang Kai's life-saving debt and formed a bond because of it, and that in this Lost Realm Yang Kai had looked after him in so many ways.

He felt that making friends with Yang Kai was the wisest decision he had ever made.

"The Great Brahma Heaven Pill and the Demon-Suppressing Pill are both Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills; they're not easy to refine, but if we gather the other required ingredients, we could give it a try," Yang Kai said after careful thought.

"What are the odds of success?" the Ghost Ancestor asked anxiously.

"At least sixty percent," Yang Kai replied.

"Sixty percent!" The Ghost Ancestor sucked in a cold breath; he realized he had underestimated Yang Kai. Refining Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills was extraordinarily difficult and prone to failure — even the few surviving masters dared not boast of a sixty percent success rate.

Yang Kai was not one to speak without cause, and the Ghost Ancestor could see this: the youth was steady by nature and would not casually claim something he could not deliver. If he said sixty percent, then sixty percent it was.

"However..." Yang Kai suddenly smiled.

"However what?" The Ghost Ancestor's heart skipped a beat.

"If you want to refine the Great Brahma Heaven Pill and the Demon-Suppressing Pill, I can recommend someone else. She is far more accomplished in alchemy than I am; if she were to take the lead, the success rate would be even higher."

"Hss..." The Ghost Ancestor inhaled sharply and gazed at Yang Kai in disbelief. "You know another Void King-Grade alchemist? Surely your alchemy must have been learned from someone — is this your master?"

As he spoke, the Ghost Ancestor's eyes shone like tangible light.

Having a teacher who was a Void King-Grade alchemist, and one stronger than Yang Kai, was an opportunity not to be missed; if he could befriend such a person, the benefits would be enormous — he could call on them later to refine Pills and stand to gain much.

The Ghost Ancestor secretly resolved that, after their Lost Realm journey concluded, he would accompany Yang Kai to pay his respects to this master.

How many Void King-Grade experts had longed to meet such alchemy masters but lacked the means? He had unexpectedly found two of them. The Ghost Ancestor felt as if he were about to burst with joy.

"No." Yang Kai shook his head. "The person I'm referring to is my Senior Sister."

He was, of course, speaking of Xia Ningshang.

When he had brought Xia Ningshang out from the Tongxuan Continent, her alchemical skill had been inferior to Yang Kai's, but years had passed since then. Within the Lingxiao Sect she had handled countless medicinal ingredients and had been taught the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy. With her special constitution and her comprehension, Yang Kai was certain her alchemy had long since surpassed his.

"Your Senior Sister is also a Void King-Grade alchemist?" The Ghost Ancestor was thunderstruck.

Good heavens... this master-apprentice trio — all three of them were alchemy masters at Void King-Grade. What kind of heaven-defying circumstance was this!

The Ghost Ancestor could hardly imagine what sort of Sect could boast three Void King-Grade alchemists at its seat. With such talent, the sect's disciples would surely never lack Spiritual Pills.

If such news spread, the Ghost Ancestor was certain the entire Star Domain would be thrown into chaos; titans like the Hengluo Commerce Guild, Purple Star, and the Sword Alliance would surely dispatch envoys to court Yang Kai's Sect.

After all, even among the three great forces, not all possessed a Void King-Grade Alchemy Grandmaster to preside over them. Of the three, only the Hengluo Commerce Guild and Purple Star each had one, while the Sword Alliance had none at all.
