## Chapter 2376 — Tongtian Island

"Big Sister Ling, I owe you an apology." Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly as he took out the set of advanced Purification Array flags and the Formation Foundation. "I broke this thing."

Ling Yinqin glanced over and saw that her Purification Array was severely damaged, completely unusable. A trace of sorrow flickered in her beautiful eyes, tinged with reminiscence and regret.

"If it's broken, so be it." Ling Yinqin forced a smile, comforting him, "It's just a set of advanced Purification Array flags; don't worry about it."

Yang Kai asked, "How much is this thing worth in Source Crystals? I'll compensate you."

Ling Yinqin waved her hand, "No need. It's a shame it couldn't help you at all." As she spoke, she took out two wooden plaques and handed them to Yang Kai.

"What are these?" Yang Kai asked in confusion.

"These are Tongtian Island identity tokens. You'll need them to enter Tongtian City."

Yang Kai took them and immediately realized, raising his brows, "Did you get these from those Xuanyun Pavilion people? Is there any problem using these to enter the city?"

"No problem. These two are just low-level identity tokens; they don't record any information. If they were high-level tokens, it would be different—no one could impersonate them." Ling Yinqin explained.

"Thank you so much." Yang Kai was overjoyed. He had been worried about how he and Liu Qianyun would safely sneak into Tongtian City, but he hadn't expected the Xuanyun Pavilion people to deliver identity tokens themselves. It was truly a timely gift.

"I'm a bit tired. I'll go rest first. Brother Yang, do as you please." Ling Yinqin said, then turned and walked into the cabin.

Liu Qianyun leaned closer and whispered to Yang Kai, "Senior Brother, that set of advanced Purification Array flags was left to Big Sister Ling by her partner. It meant a lot to her."

She had heard this from Jiao Yi. Seeing Ling Yinqin's expression just now, she knew Jiao Yi hadn't lied—the advanced Purification Array was indeed very important to Ling Yinqin, carrying her longing for someone.

Only now did Yang Kai realize he had damaged something so precious. He quickly called out, "Miss Ling, I'll definitely find someone to repair your Purification Array!"

The Purification Array was only damaged, not destroyed. Yang Kai had originally wanted to compensate Ling Yinqin with some Source Crystals, or buy her a new set on Tongtian Island. But now, knowing its significance to her, neither compensation nor replacement felt right—the best solution was to find someone to repair the Formation Foundation.

Hearing this, Ling Yinqin paused her steps slightly, but didn't turn back. She simply waved her hand gently, her figure looking especially desolate as she walked away.

"Senior Brother Yang, why don't you two go rest as well?" Jiao Yi came over with a fawning smile, his attitude no longer casual but rather cautious. "The ship will set sail soon. In less than a month, we'll be back at Tongtian Island. When we arrive, Old Jiao will tell you."

"Alright. I'll leave it to you, Brother Jiao." Yang Kai nodded and walked with Liu Qianyun toward the cabins.

Before long, the multi-deck ship set sail again.

Inside the cabin, Liu Qianyun wanted to ask Yang Kai about his current state several times, but swallowed her words each time. Yang Kai's failed breakthrough to the Emperor Realm must have hit him hard. Liu Qianyun felt that asking would only make him more upset.

She didn't know how to comfort Yang Kai. Sighing inwardly, she felt the heavens were truly unfair, letting Yang Kai find an opportunity to break through in such a wretched place.

The multi-deck ship traveled quickly. Occasionally, they encountered sea beast attacks, but the warriors on board handled them well. It was clear that Ling Yinqin's subordinates, regardless of cultivation, were all seasoned fighters with strong experience in repelling sea beasts.

The journey passed without incident.

About twenty days later, Yang Kai suddenly heard a commotion on the deck. He listened closely and, from the crew's excited chatter, learned they were nearing Tongtian Island.

The warriors on Tongtian Island often risked their lives searching for cultivation resources at sea. Every trip was dangerous—often, only half returned from groups of ten or twenty.

But this time, Ling Yinqin's multi-deck ship was different. Everyone who left returned, and they gained a huge harvest. The crew was naturally ecstatic.

Sure enough, before long, the multi-deck ship slowed down and soon came to a complete stop.

Noisy sounds filled the air. Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and found the ship had reached the edge of a massive island, docked at a pier-like place.

Before Ling Yinqin and her group arrived, several other multi-deck ships were already waiting to dock. Warriors frequently flew off those ships, landing ashore.

As soon as these warriors landed, crowds gathered around them, as if every returning seafarer was a hot commodity.

Yang Kai saw one returning warrior exchange a few words with another, then quickly leave with him.

"Senior Brother Yang, we've arrived at Tongtian Island." Ling Yinqin's voice came from outside the door.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged glances and quickly stood up.

On the deck, Jiao Yi and the others were already waiting impatiently. When they saw Yang Kai, they all nodded respectfully.

"Are those people selling their harvests from the sea?" Yang Kai asked Jiao Yi, pointing at the warriors in conversation.

Jiao Yi nodded, "That's right. Every trip out to sea brings some harvest. There are always buyers waiting at the pier. When the returning warriors arrive, they come forward to buy. If the price is right, it's a good deal—saves you the trouble of finding buyers in the city. Many shops have people stationed here, and every time we return, they swarm like madmen. The competition is fierce."

Hearing Jiao Yi's explanation, Yang Kai knew his guess was correct. He had suspected as much when he saw the scene earlier.

"Let's go." Jiao Yi called out, and the crew members flew toward the shore. Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun followed, while Ling Yinqin stayed behind, forming hand seals to put away the multi-deck ship.

As soon as the crew landed, many merchants surrounded them, offering good prices to buy their harvests.

Jiao Yi and the others were clearly experienced, each putting on airs and negotiating with the merchants. Soon, someone agreed on a price and went aside to make the deal.

This trip, Jiao Yi and the others gained a lot—not just the more than fifty thousand Cangyu Coral and the corpse of a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast, but also the spoils Yang Kai took from the Xuanyun Pavilion people, which far exceeded their usual gains.

The harvest was too great to sell all at once, so the dozen crew members split up, planning to first exchange some for useful cultivation resources like Source Crystals and Spiritual Pills, and sell the rest later. Otherwise, showing off so many treasures at once would surely attract trouble.

Source Crystals are hard currency everywhere, even in the Jixu Secret Realm. Another popular item here is Spiritual Pills—any useful pill can be exchanged for Source Crystals and used as trade chips.

While Yang Kai watched curiously, a beautiful middle-aged woman suddenly appeared before him. She wore a green dress, her figure voluptuous and eye-catching; her cultivation was not low—she was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Though she looked seductive, her demeanor was dignified and elegant. Perhaps she was a bit slow or simply disdained competing, so she hadn't managed to approach the returning crew. Seeing Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun standing alone, she came over, smiled, and cupped her fists, "Greetings, young sir."

"Madam, do you need something?" Yang Kai looked her up and down.

The woman smiled, "I am Deacon Fan Xin of Ice Heart Pavilion."

"Ice Heart Pavilion?" Yang Kai raised his brows, taking a closer look at Fan Xin.

Fan Xin asked suspiciously, "What? You don't know Ice Heart Pavilion?"

She found it odd. Ice Heart Pavilion wasn't large on Tongtian Island, but it was well-known. Anyone living here should know it. But Yang Kai's reaction seemed genuinely surprised, as if he'd never heard of it.

Yang Kai replied calmly, "Of course I've heard of Ice Heart Pavilion. I just didn't expect Ice Heart Pavilion to be buying things here."

This was a lie—he really was hearing about Ice Heart Pavilion for the first time. But Yang Kai knew his earlier reaction had made Fan Xin suspicious, so this explanation would put her at ease.

Sure enough, Fan Xin smiled bitterly, "Business is tough, competition everywhere. I'm just forced by circumstances." She changed the subject, "Did you gain anything on this trip? If so, could you show me? I'll give you a good price."

"His goods are with me. If you need to discuss anything, come to me." Ling Yinqin walked over from nearby, finally rescuing Yang Kai.

He didn't have any goods on hand. If he'd known the situation at the pier, he would've kept some loot in his Spatial Ring after killing the Xuanyun Pavilion people.

Hearing this, Fan Xin looked at Yang Kai in confusion, not understanding why he'd give his goods to Ling Yinqin. After all, everyone who got off the ship had brought something.

Yang Kai spread his hands and smiled, "I get a bit flustered around beautiful women. Big Sister Ling was afraid I'd get cheated, so she took charge. Turns out that was the wise choice."

Fan Xin covered her mouth and laughed, "Young sir, you're quite amusing."
