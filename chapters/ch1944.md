## Chapter 1944 — Protector Bian

Protector Bian wanted to see Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, so the two guards in the Bone Prison naturally dared not disobey; once they entered the Bone Prison they led the pair out.

"Kid, this old man's promise to you stands at any time; if one day you are driven into a corner with nowhere to turn, you can come find this old man."

Just as Yang Kai was about to leave the Bone Prison, Wu Mengchuan's voice sounded in his ear once more.

Yang Kai did not pause his step, as if he had not heard, and soon vanished, leaving behind a group of imprisoned cultivators in the Bone Prison staring after him with envy.

Once outside, Yang Kai immediately sensed a resentful, poisonous glare fixed on him; looking up, he discovered it came from Yan Xiuran, the very man who had tormented him before.

He was responsible for guarding the entrance to the Bone Prison, so of course he had always been stationed there.

Yang Kai had actually bitten the Treasure-Stealing Serpent to death; Yan Xiuran hated him to the bone, and all the torment Yang Kai had suffered in recent days had been at his instigation.

"Lucky bastard," Yan Xiuran sneered coldly, "Protector Bian even finds time to see you, but don't get cocky—one day you'll fall into my hands, and then I'll make your life worse than death!"

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent; inwardly he swore at Yan Xiuran's ancestors eighteen generations back, cursing his own lack of strength—if he had been strong enough he would have slaughtered these Biyu Sect disciples on the spot.

But he also knew their strength was too great; even if he risked everything, it would only end in a miserable failure, so he had to endure and ignore Yan Xiuran's provocations for now.

"Alright, alright, Senior Brother Yan, don't be angry," one of the Bone Prison guards said with a small smile, "Protector Bian wishes to see these two, so we won't detain you further," and he casually tossed something out.

It was clearly another flying Secret Treasure, though completely different from the tower-ship Senior Brother Kou had shown earlier; this device resembled a war chariot—its internal space was smaller than the tower-ship's but could still hold four or five people, and from its appearance it looked extremely ferocious.

The chariot's owner leapt aboard, waved a hand, and Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun were swept into it; in the next moment the chariot became a streak of light and shot toward a certain place on Biyu Mountain.

There was no conversation along the way.

Soon the chariot arrived at a mountain peak, atop which a huge palace stood; the chariot descended in front of the palace.

After Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun climbed down, the Bone Prison guard folded away his flying Secret Treasure and stepped forward to whisper a few words with the palace sentries.

"Go in; the Protector is waiting inside," the palace guard said, showing no intention of making trouble and readily letting them pass.

"Good luck to you both!" the Bone Prison guard smiled faintly at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, then summoned his chariot and returned the way they had come.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged a glance; they knew this might be fortune rather than misfortune, but if misfortune came it could not be avoided, so they braced themselves and silently prayed that Protector Bian would not be difficult to deal with.

At this moment both still had their strength restrained, and among the many masters within the Biyu Sect they could not make any waves.

Ignoring the curious glances of the guards on either side, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun walked step by step into the palace.

Inside the palace the space was vast, and in the front two people were waiting.

When Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun appeared, the gazes of those two people immediately fixed on them.

Instantly Yang Kai felt his skin tighten, an all-encompassing sense of being scrutinized spreading through him, making him extremely uncomfortable.

Following the gaze back, Yang Kai frowned.

He discovered one of the two was the Senior Brother Kou who had captured them; he stood beside the other person, and the second was a supple, bewitching beauty.

She lounged lazily in a chair, wearing a pale-blue palace gown, her hair piled in a bun, her neck fair and smooth; she toyed with something in her hand, a faint half-smile at the corner of her mouth as she regarded them with obvious amusement.

This woman was, without doubt, an extremely alluring, world-toppling beauty, yet Yang Kai could feel a power within her that made him dare not look directly at her.

Could this woman be Protector Bian? Yang Kai was astonished.

"Are these the two you brought back earlier?" she asked lazily as Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun approached.

Her voice was sweet and cloying, pleasant to the ear—as if an invisible hand plucked at the heartstrings, causing an involuntary stirring.

Her question was clearly directed at Senior Brother Kou.

Senior Brother Kou bowed quickly, lowering his eyes as if not daring to look at the beauty, and respectfully replied, "Reporting to Your Grace, it is indeed these two."

The beauty nodded slightly, an odd light gleaming in her lovely eyes; her red lips moved and she said calmly, "Release their restraints."

At her words, Senior Brother Kou formed hand seals, then pointed at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

Two streams of mysterious light shot out and flowed into the two of them.

In the next moment, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun both couldn't help but emit a soft hum as the long-restrained power began to flow through their bodies again, leaving them with a pleasant, buoyant ease.

"Heh heh..." the beauty suddenly chuckled, then, to Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun's stunned gazes, lifted one jade-like palm.

As her palm rose, both Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun sensed something about the surroundings change; a heavy, murderous atmosphere stole over them, and both their faces darkened.

Kou seemed to have expected this, showing no surprise as he watched their reactions with indifference.

The beauty's jade palm came down gently, compressing Heaven-and-Earth Energy into a terrifying attack that bore down toward Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

"What are you doing?" Liu Qianyun cried out in alarm; at the same time she bit her tongue, letting her essence-blood spill, and a mirror-like Secret Treasure was summoned forth.

The treasure split in two, then four, then eight; in an instant countless small mirrors appeared around Liu Qianyun, their surfaces like deep seas, throwing back layers of eerie light that chilled the heart.

She knew the other was an expert of the Dao Origin Realm, and likely not an ordinary one, so she used her most powerful Secret Treasure as her most reliable defense.

She had never intended to contend with the beauty; she only sought to withstand that strike.

Yang Kai roared, scintillating multicolored light bursting across his body; the Undying Five Elements Sword qi circled him, his ten fingers flicking, and Golden Blood Threads shot into the sky, meeting the descending, terrifying attack.

Hissss...

The faint sound of resistance rang out as the Golden Blood Threads, under Yang Kai's mind, transformed into varied attacks, yet like early-spring snow under a fierce sun they could not endure; the mighty force from above struck them until they flashed wildly.

Liu Qianyun cried out sharply as all the mirrors around her merged into one and stretched out above their heads.

Crash...

In the next moment the mirror shattered; Liu Qianyun's face went pale and she coughed up blood, the mirror-like Secret Treasure reverting to its original form and dimming.

Seizing the opportunity, Yang Kai shot into the air; the five-colored radiance signifying the Undying Five Elements Sword qi tore through the oppressive, dead silence and rent a gap in the attack, allowing him to break free.

He twisted midair and, face contorted with rage, lunged at the lazy beauty seated in the chair.

The beauty did not stir; the same aggravating smile remained on her face.

Senior Brother Kou standing beside her shifted his feet, swung across to shield the beauty, and thrust out a palm strike straight at Yang Kai.

The palm looked simple, but within its center a violent power swirled; when Yang Kai made contact he felt his defenses collapse like dry timber, an irresistible force bearing down on him.

He grunted and was sent flying backward.

Liu Qianyun's face panicked; thinking she was doomed, she gritted her teeth, poured out all her strength, and charged at the beauty and Kou.

She intended to die with them!

"Qianyun, fall back!" Yang Kai shouted from midair, then landed awkwardly.

At Yang Kai's shout, Liu Qianyun reluctantly stopped and stood on guard, eyes wary and ready.

The beauty chuckled again, her bright eyes lingering on Yang Kai with an appraising glint. She gave a faint nod and said, "Kou Wu, what did I tell you? As expected, they were able to withstand my blow, weren't they?"

Kou bowed and said, "Your Grace's insight is like a burning torch; Kou Wu admires it greatly!"

The beauty giggled, her chest heaving slightly, and with a puckered smile said, "Stop flattering me. Although I only used a touch of strength just now, it's still impressive that the two of them could block it."

"Your Grace is correct," Kou nodded again.

Their conversation had not been hushed, so Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun had heard every word; Yang Kai was unsurprised, while Liu Qianyun's brows knit with displeasure at being toyed with.

"You seem to have noticed something?" the beauty asked Yang Kai calmly.

Yang Kai wiped the blood from his mouth and grinned, "If Your Grace truly wanted us dead, why bring us here? That strike earlier was clearly only a test."

The beauty smiled, "You have some spirit. Do you know why I wanted to see you?"

Yang Kai frowned, replying in a low voice, "I await Your Grace's instruction."

The beauty nodded, reached to a table, picked up two Spatial Rings, and casually tossed them; they transformed into streaks of light and shot toward Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

The two grabbed the rings and scanned their contents with Divine Sense, their expressions turning strange.

They discovered these were the Spatial Rings Kou had taken from them earlier, and nothing inside had been lost—everything remained.

"What does this mean, Your Grace?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"If I am not mistaken, you come from some Star Domain below, yes?" the beauty smiled as she looked at them.

Liu Qianyun's expression changed in alarm; she instinctively glanced at Yang Kai, fearing his identity as a Star Lord had been exposed, feeling a wave of anxiety.
