## Chapter 44 — Su Yan

“After cultivating this technique, Second Junior Brother’s temperament changed drastically, and his strength suddenly surged. Even the Eldest Senior Brother was no match for him. The Second Junior Brother believed that with his newfound power, the Sect Leader would favor him. However, the Sect Leader eventually learned of his cultivation of a sinister technique. Heartbroken and furious, the Sect Leader resolved to strip him of his power. But before the Sect Leader could act, the Second Junior Brother had already received the news in advance. This revelation completely corrupted his mind with demonic energy, causing him to fall into the path of evil. That night, over a decade ago, Lingxiao Pavilion was drenched in blood! The Eldest Senior Brother died tragically on the spot, and the Second Junior Brother fled in shame.”

At this, Su Mu paused briefly, then turned to see that everyone was tense, holding their breath and listening intently. Satisfied, he continued, “Overnight, the Sect Leader’s hair turned white. His two most prized disciples—one dead, the other lost to darkness—dealt him a blow beyond measure.”

“Since then, the Sect Leader secluded himself, rarely seen by anyone. The world assumed his spirit was broken and that he had passed on. Yet, a few years later, he reemerged, traveling thousands of li to personally capture his Second Junior Brother and imprison him in Dragon Confinement Ravine!”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred suddenly, recalling the last words of that mysterious Elder Eleven.

“I did not come to see treasures; I came to see a person!”

What person? Undoubtedly, the one sealed beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Could it be that this Elder Eleven...

Su Mu went on, “But after that incident, the Sect Leader could no longer break through the Divine Roaming Realm and remained stuck at that stage. His heart knot unresolved, he could never find peace in this lifetime.”

The story concluded, and everyone sighed deeply, pitying the Sect Leader’s fate and cursing the Second Junior Brother who had fallen into darkness.

Yang Kai’s emotions surged as well. Was that Elder Eleven truly the person Su Mu described? If this story was true, then the old man very well might be him.

Just then, a lively clamor arose ahead. Yang Kai looked up to see a large clearing within the dense forest, bustling with voices like a grand marketplace. Disciples from the three sects gathered here, with countless stalls displaying a dazzling array of goods.

Nearby stood dozens of wooden huts, simple in construction, some large, some small. The smaller ones were likely for residence, while the larger provided shelter from wind and rain, accommodating many people.

Since it was a bright sunny day, the disciples had set up their stalls in the open space.

The Black Wind Trading Market—truly a world apart.

“Well, we’ve arrived,” Su Mu said. His main purpose was to bring Yang Kai here so he would know of this place and could come trade here if needed.

“This place is impressive,” Yang Kai said, watching the bustling crowd with some excitement.

Su Mu smiled. “Naturally. Here you can find anything a low-level martial artist might desire. And there’s no need to worry about safety; the three sects each have experts stationed here to maintain order. See those wooden huts? That’s where our Lingxiao Pavilion disciples are stationed. My sister is inside.”

“Your sister?” Yang Kai glanced at him, suddenly recalling that last time Su Mu caused trouble, he mentioned his sister was a Core Disciple—the future hope of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Su Mu immediately grew wary. “Just a warning: don’t even think about making a move on my sister.”

Yang Kai chuckled quietly.

Su Mu added, “But even if you wanted to, you probably don’t have the ability.”

“Your sister is very powerful?”

“Of course. She’s at the third stage of the True Yuan Realm. Few among the younger generation can match her.”

Yang Kai was slightly moved. For a young disciple, reaching the True Yuan Realm was already quite an achievement. Beyond that was the Divine Roaming Realm—the very realm the Sect Leader currently occupied.

“If your sister is so strong, why are you only at the Body Tempering Realm?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled as he looked at Su Mu.

As if struck in a sore spot, Su Mu’s face flushed awkwardly. After hesitating for a while, he said, “I was just too playful. But don’t worry, I’ll train diligently from now on. I can’t let you, a Trial Disciple, surpass me.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. It seemed the hardships Su Mu endured a few days ago had sparked his competitive spirit.

“Come, I’ll take you to meet my sister first. With her protection, it’ll be easier to conduct business here at the Black Wind Trading Market.”

At the mention of meeting Su Mu’s sister, everyone’s expressions turned serious. Even Su Mu tidied his clothes and brushed off the dust on his body.

It was clear that Su Mu both feared and revered his sister.

“What’s your sister’s name?” Yang Kai quietly asked Li Yuntian.

“Su Yan.”

A good name, though Yang Kai still wondered what kind of person she was.

Before long, they arrived at one of the wooden huts. Yang Kai looked up and noticed that not only this hut but several others nearby bore plaques inscribed with “Lingxiao Pavilion.” It seemed these huts were the posts of Lingxiao Pavilion’s experts.

Su Mu grew somewhat nervous, inhaled softly, and cautiously ascended the steps. Then, with a graceful demeanor, he raised a hand and lightly knocked, the sound gentle like a kitten’s meow: “Sister, I’ve come to see you.”

Li Yuntian and the others struggled to suppress their laughter, their shoulders trembling. Yang Kai also found it hard to hold back a smile.

Su Mu seemed aware of their amusement and shot a sharp glance behind him.

“Come in!” A somewhat cold voice came from inside, like a clear mountain spring refreshing to the ear.

Su Mu beckoned the group and stepped inside.

Once inside, Yang Kai glanced around quietly. The hut was even simpler than his own small wooden house—there was nothing inside. Yet, once inside, the outside noise and commotion were completely cut off, leaving an extraordinary silence.

This hut must possess some profound mystery; otherwise, such an effect would be impossible.

As Yang Kai was examining the room, Su Mu suddenly let out a sharp cry. Yang Kai focused and saw Su Mu crouched on the ground, clutching his head in grievance. Not far from him stood a woman dressed in pure white, her expression icy cold.

Her beautiful black hair was styled into a cloud bun, her eyebrows like crescent moons, slender and elegant. Her eyes were bright and delicate, her nose exquisite, cheeks faintly flushed, lips like twin cherry petals, and her skin as smooth and radiant as snow-white jade. Her figure was slender and graceful, indescribably enchanting.

Yet her aura was chillingly cold, causing the entire room’s temperature to drop noticeably.

At this moment, the woman sat cross-legged on the floor, gazing coldly at Su Mu. There was no doubt—this was Su Yan.

“Do you know why I hit you?” Su Yan asked.

Su Mu shook his head. Seeing the fierce light in his sister’s eyes, he quickly nodded again.

“Speak,” Su Yan’s voice was soft but carried an irresistible authority. Yang Kai now understood why Su Mu feared his sister so much. Anyone with such a sister would find it unbearable, even though she was undeniably a great beauty.
