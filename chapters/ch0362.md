## Chapter 362 — Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle

A golden eagle spread its wings wide, measuring over a zhang in length, with claws as hard as steel, surpassing that of ordinary secret treasure weapons.

Moreover, it seemed to possess innate beast techniques, as the golden radiance it emitted was quite formidable.

Although Nan Sheng was an exceptional figure within the True Essence Realm, he could not guarantee an easy subjugation of such an aerial Demonic Beast. After witnessing its prowess, he immediately called upon the two experts he had brought for assistance.

Without hesitation, those two from the Divine Roaming Realm launched their attacks simultaneously, sending forth two streaks of light toward the golden eagle. While their power was not overwhelming, it was enough to prevent the eagle from soaring high.

"Not good!" Elder Xu from the Xiang Family suddenly changed his expression, remembering where the golden eagle originated from. In a state of panic, he quickly shouted.

Nan Sheng and the two Divine Roaming Realm cultivators frowned, unsure of Elder Xu's sudden outburst. Yet, despite their confusion, they did not pause their movements.

With two sharp sounds, the golden eagle was struck by the residual force of the two Divine Roaming Realm techniques, causing its massive body to spin several times in the air, nearly plummeting down.

Though it was a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, it was still only equivalent to a martial artist in the True Essence Realm. How could it withstand the assault from experts in the Divine Roaming Realm?

As the golden eagle was momentarily delayed, hope sparked in Nan Sheng's heart. Laughing heartily, he darted forward like lightning, extending a large hand to grasp the eagle.

Elder Xu, feeling a rush of urgency, leapt in front of Nan Sheng and called out, "Young Master Nan, wait!"

As he shouted, he gently pushed Nan Sheng back.

The sharp cry of the eagle rang out once more, but this time, its call was filled with anger and urgency as the golden figure shot straight into the sky, quickly ascending hundreds of zhang high.

"What is going on?" Nan Sheng was enraged at being thwarted at the last moment when he could have easily captured the golden eagle alive. After coming down, he glared fiercely at Elder Xu, then turned to Xiang Chu, saying, "Xiang, don't you think an explanation is in order?"

Xiang Chu also frowned, bewildered by the sudden madness of this Divine Roaming Realm expert from his family. He asked, “Elder Xu, what is happening?”

Elder Xu, with cold sweat pooling on his forehead, looked up at the eagle in the sky. He clasped his hands and said, "Young Master Nan, I apologize."

"Hmph!" Nan Sheng snorted coldly, his face displeased. "Now speak. Why did you stop me?"

Elder Xu wiped the sweat from his brow and replied, "This eagle has an owner."

"An owner?" Nan Sheng was taken aback, then suddenly began to laugh coldly. "Even better! My Nan family and your Xiang family are both first-rate families. Is it impossible for us to acquire this eagle? Come, tell me, whose eagle is this that they can offer it to me?"

Elder Xu's face turned pale, his expression becoming increasingly frightened.

Xiang Chu seemed to have realized something and took a deep breath. "Elder Xu, do you know something?"

Elder Xu wore a sorrowful expression, glancing around at the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower disciples present. This time, his look was no longer one of disdain and contempt for the young people; rather, it was filled with seriousness and fear.

Turning back, Elder Xu looked at the three Divine Roaming Realm experts and said with a pained face, "Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast. Golden Eagle. Don't any of you remember anything?"

The three Divine Roaming Realm experts, upon hearing this, all appeared confused.

Elder Xu, feeling helpless, said, "Should I say your knowledge is too limited or that it's been a long time since you forgot? Nearly twenty years ago, several of these eagles appeared in the Great Han region..."

Twenty years ago...

The memories resurfaced in the minds of the three Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, and suddenly, their faces changed simultaneously.

One member from the Nan family, almost bursting with excitement, exclaimed, "Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle?"

Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle!

As this name echoed across the scene, a chill ran down the spines of all the Divine Roaming Realm experts present.

Elder Fang looked utterly dazed, murmuring, "Is it the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family?"

Elder Xu nodded heavily and said solemnly, "Indeed, it should be the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family!"

"But... but how could it appear now? Isn't there still a few years to go?" 

"It is feared that... something has happened to the Yang Family, prompting the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle to appear early!" Elder Xu boldly speculated.

The experts in the Divine Roaming Realm did not conceal their discussion, nor did they lower their voices intentionally. Thus, everyone present could hear them clearly.

The young disciples from the second-rate sects were left perplexed, but Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng understood, exchanging a glance with a hint of dread.

"What are they talking about?" Fang Ziqi asked, frowning.

"Uncle Le, do you know?" Hu Jiao’er looked curiously at Guan Chile.

Guan Chile thoughtfully studied Yang Kai before he could only manage a bitter smile and nod. “The older generation should understand."

"Then tell us.” Hu Jiao’er did not understand why a mere Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast overwhelming the Xiang Family and Nan Family would cause such alarm.

Even if a peak expert from the Divine Roaming Realm were to arrive, it shouldn't provoke such a reaction, should it?

"Fine." Guan Chile knew that a conflict would not arise now. The emergence of this eagle meant a storm was brewing for the entire Great Han in the future. His expression relaxed as he began, “You should know about the Yang Family from Zhongdu?”

Everyone nodded in unison. The Cuckoo Bird Yang Family, leading the Eight Great Families; who hadn’t heard of them?

"The Yang Family has a rule that when the direct descendants are still young, they send all of them out to experience the world, and this period lasts for ten years. During this time, no Yang Family disciple can utilize any strength from the clan or reveal their identity, allowing them to strive and hone their skills entirely independently."

“Only after the ten years are up will these direct descendants be summoned back to compete for the next head of the Yang Family. In ten years, a person can change drastically, especially the young. The Yang Family's sons, after ten years of training, often would become hard to track. Hence, the Yang Family devised a special method to find and recall the scattered direct descendants."

“What method?”

“That is to use Demonic Beasts!” Guan Chile pointed to the sky. “The Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family! This type of flight Demonic Beast is raised on the pure blood of the Yang family since they are young and are thus very sensitive to the Yang family bloodline; they can pinpoint any direct descendant of the Yang family within a certain range.”

Upon hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but feel a shift in their feelings.

With the appearance of the Yang Family's Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle here, did it not mean there was a direct descendant of the Yang family scattered among them? Who could it be?

Guan Chile looked meaningfully at Yang Kai before continuing, “The Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle is rare, with only about a dozen existing worldwide, all of them belonging to the Yang Family. The Yang Family treats these extraordinary beasts as treasures; besides when recalling important descendants, they never release them. Yet once the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle emerges, it means the Yang Family is calling back its scattered descendants, more importantly… the competition for the head of the Yang family is about to begin!”

“The competition for the head of the Yang Family?” Fang Ziqi raised an eyebrow, seemingly intrigued.

“Yes, the various sons of the Yang Family, based on their ten years of experience, gather supporters, amass factions, and strive for the head position of the Yang Family! The last contest for the head of the Yang Family happened eighteen years ago, resulting in many deaths and even more who became famous overnight. The contest for the head of the Yang Family is a major upheaval in the world, and many will participate. If you are interested and deem yourselves capable, you can join the fray.”

As Guan Chile spoke, the members of the Xiang Family and Nan Family did not interject, and the disciples of the second-rate forces gathered here listened intently.

Such a significant and confidential matter was not something one could hear casually.

Once Guan Chile finished speaking, a heavy silence fell over the vast area, lingering for quite some time, without anyone daring to speak.

Nan Sheng's face turned ashen; just a moment ago, he had shamelessly declared that he would have the owner of the golden eagle offer it up. Now, upon learning that it was a beast nurtured by the Yang Family, how could he possibly entertain any greed?

No wonder Elder Xu had been so anxious to stop him; it turned out he had recalled the past.

Nan Sheng silently rejoiced, thankful that he and the elder members of his family had not harmed the golden feather eagle. If it had attracted the attention of the Yang Family, who could say what issues might arise?

These extraordinary beasts were rare and precious, and the Yang Family was domineering and ruthless. If they were truly harmed, it would not simply be a matter of compensation.

After a moment, Elder Xu finally turned to Guan Chile and cupped his hands in salute, saying, "This friend has explained everything in great detail; there are many nuances even I am not well aware of. I've learned a lot."

Guan Chile sneered, "Who does not know the events of years past?"

After this unexpected turn of events, Elder Xu intended to diffuse the tense atmosphere on both sides, so he offered a compliment; something Guan Chile was aware of would be known by Elder Xu as well, but he didn’t expect Guan Chile to brush aside his words, his cold reply causing Elder Xu to roll his eyes in exasperation.

Xiang Chu murmured, "But... I remember the Yang Family dispatched the current direct descendants five or six years ago; is it not still short of ten years?"

It was precisely because it was still short of ten years that initially, no one had recalled that this eagle was the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family.

If a few more years passed and the entire world was focused on the movements of the Yang Family, the instant the golden eagle appeared, it would surely be recognized.

Nan Sheng nodded slightly, "I’ve heard of this. Perhaps this is just another Demonic Beast that happens to resemble the Golden Feather Eagle?"

Elder Xu sighed, "That is why I said, something must have happened to the Yang Family, which led to an early summons of the direct descendants. Do not doubt it; this is indeed the Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family."

"Then..." Xiang Chu’s gaze wandered among the crowd, and when it landed on Yang Kai, he couldn't help but freeze momentarily before quickly looking away, pinching his nose. "So, there is a Young Master Yang present here?"

Countless hearts began to race, and everyone started looking around nervously. 

The two factions were in conflict and were on the verge of fighting to the death, and at such a critical moment, they found out that among them was a character they absolutely could not offend.

If this Young Master Yang was a friend, it would be easy to deal with him, but if he was an enemy... (To be continued...)
