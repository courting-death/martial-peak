## Chapter 1998 — Sneak Attack

The sudden scene froze everyone on the spot.

"Don't retreat—if you fall back you'll trigger the sealing formation and die on the spot, everyone be careful!" someone suddenly shouted.

"Damn it, it's a trap!"

"The damned Star God Palace..."

"W—what am I supposed to do?"

Many of the weaker treasure-seekers, trapped between advance and retreat, began angrily blaming the Star God Palace as if it had laid this trap specifically for them.

The more they pushed forward, the fiercer the oppressive dragon might became; one careless step could blow a skull apart and kill a man outright—those earlier gruesome deaths were the best example—and even if they wished to leave they could not fall back; the more than thirty corpses that had just dropped were a harsh lesson.

Some warriors truly found themselves unable to move either forward or back, frozen in place.

Yet not everyone—those truly powerful experts who had confidence in themselves still braved the dragon-might's pressure, stepping toward the Dragon Ascension Altar, their eyes burning as they fixed on the dozen or so unknown objects arranged atop the altar; each step seemed arduous, but after taking it their faces lit with delight as if they had gained something.

Fortune was sought amid danger; everyone knew that truth—these fighters had all endured considerable life-and-death trials, and most possessed resolute temperaments.

Moreover, putting aside whether one could seize the dozen or so unknown treasures, the benefits gained simply by walking toward the Dragon Ascension Altar were enough to send these warriors into raptures.

With every step they took, those cultivators could feel their temperament and will increasing markedly; under the oppressive supreme dragon might, many in the Void King Realm found their internal power rapidly converting into Origin Qi.

The speed of that conversion was not something even the Origin Condensing Pill could match.

Yang Kai naturally noticed this.

He could have ignored the altar's dragon-might pressure—after all, he harbored the Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power; though the altar was forged from Dragon Bone and carried innate supreme dragon might, that force could not affect him in the slightest before the Golden Sacred Dragon's Origin Power.

Legends said that in ancient times the True Dragon clan had countless kin, yet bloodline hierarchy among them was obvious. The Golden Sacred Dragon held extremely high status within the True Dragon clan, and from the strange phenomena that had appeared around the altar earlier, the Dragon Bone used to construct the altar might be from a fire dragon, for the phantom of a true dragon that had manifested was a massive red dragon.

Red dragons commonly employed fire-type power.

The Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power was sufficient to suppress the altar's dragon might on all fronts, preventing it from approaching closer than three zhang to Yang Kai's body.

When Yang Kai realized this, he even felt a reckless urge to rush forward and snatch the treasures from the altar.

But after thinking it through carefully, he did not act so rashly.

There were, after all, hundreds of Void King Realm warriors here; leaving aside whether he could escape their pursuit after seizing the treasures, even if he did manage to get away, departing the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda would likely bring its own troubles.

Once outsiders learned he had gained so many benefits from the Dragon Ascension Altar, he would become a marked man.

A common man may be innocent, but bearing a treasure invites blame. Yang Kai had no illusion that the Dao Origin Realm cultivators wouldn't covet the treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar; if any Dao Origin expert fixed their gaze on him, his days afterward would be hard indeed.

So he did not do it.

Now he threaded through the crowd, approaching the Dragon Ascension Altar step by step, converting Origin Qi under the supreme dragon-might's pressure, while casually observing the surrounding situation.

Before long he had silently noted many powerful Void King Realm cultivators in his mind.

These men were without a doubt those who had fully converted all their Origin Qi; under the crushing dragon might they felt far less strain than the others, so they moved ahead more swiftly and had already opened up a noticeable gap over those behind them.

Yang Kai quickened his steps slightly, pondering how to take away those treasures without anyone noticing.

As he fell into thought, a teeth‑gnashing voice spat from the side, "How dare you overtake this Young Master—die!"

As soon as the word "die" left that mouth, a palm imprint shot toward Yang Kai, the rushing wind howl carrying considerable destructive force.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he raised his hand in an instant, pouring a mighty force into his palm and striking the incoming palm imprint.

Smack...

A light crack sounded, and then two violent forces collided, sweeping outward with tremendous power.

Yang Kai's body rocked slightly and then grew still; the man who had attacked him let out a startled cry, seeming unable to withstand Yang Kai's blow—his figure faltered and he was about to be thrown backward.

The man's face changed, instantly growing deathly pale.

After all, those who had tried to retreat earlier were sliced down on the spot by the mysterious light fired from the altar; he could not be certain that being driven back would not bring the same fate.

If that were the case, he had no confidence he could resist the altar's attack.

With that thought, he gritted his teeth and sank his body down as if nailed to the ground, refusing to move.

He would rather let all the force surge into his body than shift his feet an inch.

Crack, crack, crack...

Bursting sounds erupted within his body; his face drained of color and blood began to pour from his mouth and nose, his features suddenly turning hideous and terrifying.

"Young Master!" someone shouted, rushing forward two steps to stand behind him and divert the last of the force, at last allowing him to remain standing without retreating.

Yang Kai turned and looked back with a cold, sinister smile, and, seeing a familiar face, sneered, "So it's Young Master Jiang..."

The one who had tried to sneak-attack him was none other than the earlier speaker, Jiang Chuhe.

When Yang Kai had first seen him he had thought the man handsome and refined, with the bearing of a noble youth, but after discerning Jiang Chuhe's intent to turn his attention to Qin Yu, Yang Kai knew the man brimmed with ill intent; now it was clear he was not only scheming but also small-minded.

He was utterly a detestable petty fellow!

He had attacked Yang Kai simply because Yang Kai had been a bit faster and had overtaken him.

"Who are you?" Jiang Chuhe demanded.

Jiang Chuhe had suffered a heavy loss and had narrowly escaped death; his heart brimmed with hatred for Yang Kai but also great dread—he had never imagined that he could not withstand a single move from a Void King Realm cultivator.

And that had only been a casual strike—if it had been a life-or-death duel, he would have stood no chance.

"Is he still even human, damn it?" Jiang Chuhe thought, panic and fear clashing in his heart.

When had Fenglin City produced such a character?

"Who am I?" Yang Kai sneered. "Just someone Young Master Jiang can't afford to provoke."

Seeing Yang Kai's arrogant words, Jiang Chuhe's face showed a trace of resentment, but then he thought the other might be from some major force—after all, Fenglin City had gathered many powerful figures from various forces recently—and his expression flickered.

He cupped his fist and said, "Earlier Jiang offended, please forgive me, sir."

"At least you have some sense—I'll spare you this time," Yang Kai said coldly, not bothering to further entangle with Jiang Chuhe, and turned to continue onward.

Jiang Chuhe stared at his back, his face shifting between green and red as he struggled to suppress his injuries and withstand the supreme dragon might, suffering greatly.

Far in the rear, Qin Yu moved slowly with many of her guards—her strength was low and she could not advance as quickly as the others.

Precisely for that reason she had been able to witness the earlier scene.

"What is this person's background?" Qin Yu asked, her dark brows knitting.

As a cultivator from Fenglin City, Qin Yu naturally knew Jiang Chuhe's level—though not exceptionally talented, with the Jiang Family's resources and many years of hard training he had already reached the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, his bodily strength entirely converted into Origin Qi.

In other words, Jiang Chuhe, among the Void King Realm, should not be someone who could be injured by a single blow.

Yet someone had managed it.

This both astonished Qin Yu and piqued her interest in Yang Kai.

"Miss, what's wrong with that man?" a guard asked, noticing her continued stare at Yang Kai.

"Has anyone seen that man before? Do you know his background?" Qin Yu asked softly.

The guards all shook their heads, indicating they had never seen Yang Kai before.

One guard who had spoken earlier said, "Miss, if you wish to know, once we leave the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda I will have people investigate."

Qin Yu nodded. "Remember, just investigate—do not offend him."

"Yes."

......

Near the Dragon Ascension Altar, as time wore on the differences in strength among the crowd began to show. Although most were of the Void King Realm — and many even at the Third Stage — the altar quickly revealed who was truly strong and who was not.

Those whose temperament, perseverance, and strength were outstanding undoubtedly advanced faster and farther.

The rest fell behind.

For a time, centering on the Dragon Ascension Altar, countless warriors divided into several tiers, each desperately closing in toward the center.

In the first tier alone there were over forty Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts, and the differences among them were not large—if nothing unexpected happened, these forty-plus experts would almost certainly reach the altar first; the second tier, third tier, and those further back had little hope.

Yet they dared not casually retreat for fear of summoning death; they gritted their teeth and pushed onward.

Increasingly more warriors could not endure the dragon-might's oppression and died suddenly; within dozens of zhang of the altar, one or two hundred headless corpses lay scattered in a ghastly mess.
