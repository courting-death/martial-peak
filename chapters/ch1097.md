## Chapter 1097 — A Mere Lift of the Hand?

The warriors shouted in celebration of their victory; Wu Yi's lips curled into a faint smile, and her beautiful eyes drifted over those of her subordinates she knew better than anyone, carrying an appraising air as if she tried to peer into their hearts to see whether they were hiding anything—her bewitching features wore a pensive expression, and only after a moment did she wave her hand and say, "Return!"

She strode ahead toward the warship and many fighters followed; the hatch of the ship opened slowly and those left behind poured out, standing in the corridor to welcome their companions' triumphant return.

They had never experienced a battle like this before—the Black Rock Beast pack they met this time was the largest they had ever encountered. Everyone aboard had given up hope, yet unexpectedly they prevailed in the end, and the cost was not great: only a dozen or so died in the fight, and the injured were few.

Such a victory was worth celebrating!

"Yu Feng, have someone patch the damaged parts of the warship, and gather everyone who took part in the fight in two hours; I have something to say." Wu Yi said lightly.

Yu Feng, who had been grinning and boasting to a companion about how brave he had been, instantly grew attentive upon hearing this and nodded, "Understood."

After sending a few familiar hands to repair the ship, Wu Yi walked toward her cabin. This victory had been muddled and confusing; she meant to find out exactly what had happened—first, though, she had to clean the blood off her body.

In Yang Kai's room he sat cross-legged, Divine Sense circulating within him as he examined the hundred drops of Golden Blood; even with his eyes closed, his face showed excitement and delight.

He had never imagined a single drop of Golden Blood could be so powerful.

When he had seen Wu Yi and the others fighting so desperately, he had on impulse used one drop of Golden Blood. He only intended to lend a bit of help and see what the Golden Blood could do, but the result exceeded his expectations and directly resolved the crisis for Wu Yi and the rest.

That single drop of Golden Blood condensed into the Heaven-Slaying Spear of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, containing subtleties of spatial power; even though Yang Kai was inside the warship, he could manipulate it with the same ease as moving his own limbs.

What pleased Yang Kai most was that, although that drop of Golden Blood had left his body, it still felt like a part of him—an extension of himself, like his hands and feet, like his eyes, with no obstruction in using it.

One drop of Golden Blood was the crystallization of three months of Yang Kai's arduous cultivation. The Saint Yuan obtained over those three months could only barely be converted into a single drop; such power made sense in light of that.

This Golden Blood was thousands upon thousands of times more precious than the Yang Liquid of before, and its power was not comparable to Yang Liquid.

But such things decrease drop by drop when used; unlike Yang Liquid, they could not be replenished at will, which made Yang Kai somewhat reluctant to part with them.

He wanted to know what else Golden Blood could do besides serve as an offensive tool. If the Great Demon God were still alive he might have gleaned insight from him, as the Great Demon God's study of Golden Blood would surely be deeper than Yang Kai's—unfortunately that fellow was dead long ago, so Yang Kai could only rely on himself to find answers.

While Yang Kai studied the Golden Blood, all the fighters who had taken part in the battle assembled in a hall of the warship. Many clustered together smiling, discussing what reward the miss might bestow, their faces full of expectation and excitement.

Only Yu Feng and Chang Qi exchanged looks and guessed why Wu Yi had gathered them all.

Before long Wu Yi arrived in a flowing green dress, radiating an otherworldly air that made everyone's eyes follow her; the faint smile at the corner of her mouth was bewitching, as if it could tug at a man's soul and make him fall helplessly under her sway.

Yu Feng did not hide the admiration in his eyes; he slapped the heads of his shameless companions and gritted his teeth, "Keep yourselves in check, you lot—look at what you fools have become!"

"Eldest Brother Yu Feng, you are no prize yourself—why are you hitting us?" someone cried, clutching his head in complaint.

"I'm appreciating her, unlike you lot. Do you even know what appreciation is?" Yu Feng snorted, then put on a smile and sidled to Wu Yi, flattering, "Miss, everyone's gathered; you may speak."

Wu Yi nodded lightly and her eyes swept across her hopelessly useless subordinates; each person she singled out straightened and suppressed their disgraceful mannerisms, suddenly looking upright and imposing.

Yu Feng courteously moved a chair for her and she sat; only then did she say, "You're all impressive—how did I never notice before? I always thought you were a bunch of layabouts waiting to die, but I see now how terribly wrong I was."

Many failed to catch the mockery in Wu Yi's tone and grinned broadly, responding that the miss was overestimating them and behaving with extreme humility.

Wu Yi gave a cold, soft laugh as she watched them boast, feigning modesty while their tails were metaphorically wagging to the sky; she suddenly banged the chair and bit out, "Don't think I really praise you—you're a bunch of brainless fools!"

Even after being rebuked like that, the crowd only giggled and showed no anger.

Being scolded by a beauty was an honor in itself, and everyone knew that although Wu Yi spoke like that, she did not truly mean it.

“Whoever it was, step forward and show yourself! Don’t think you’ve hidden that well—this Lady already knows who you are. Don’t imagine you can play tricks before me,” Wu Yi shouted, her beautiful eyes sweeping across the crowd. Everyone she looked at felt as though her gaze had fallen squarely on them.

Faces grew serious at once as everyone recalled the golden spear seen in the battle and understood why Wu Yi had summoned them.

The miss clearly wanted to find the owner of that golden spear!

Rattle—

A dozen or so people stood up at once, each wearing a sheepish expression and hesitant to speak; the brazen ones stammered, "Miss, I didn't want to say, but since you discovered it, I can't hide it anymore."

Wu Yi pressed her hand to her brow with a look of helplessness—among those dozen she even found Yu Feng; she realized she had underestimated this group's shameless audacity.

Chaos broke out as those dozen each insisted the golden spear was their handiwork and would not yield, shouting over one another.

The elderly Chang Qi approached Wu Yi with hands tucked in his sleeves and a twitch at his mouth, "Miss, don't you know what sort of riffraff these people are? That golden spear cannot possibly be their doing."

Wu Yi sighed, "Then who would it be? On our warship, aside from these disreputable fellows, there's only Yang Kai. But during the fight Yang Kai was still inside the ship, and his strength is only Third Stage of the Saint Realm—he couldn't possibly be the one."

Chang Qi thought for a moment, "Perhaps some expert passed by and lent a hand without meaning to."

"An expert?" Wu Yi frowned. "Chang Qi, do you know of any expert on Dark Star who uses that kind of treasure?"

Chang Qi shook his head, "Miss, that golden spear does not seem to be a Secret Treasure."

"Not a Secret Treasure? Could it be a Martial Skill?"

"It doesn't seem like a Martial Skill either. When I watched the spear in battle I noticed a shocking force of qi and blood; though it took the form of a spear, I had the impression it was flesh and blood itself."

"I noticed the qi-and-blood force too," Wu Yi nodded, "but why would this person help us and not say a word? At the very least let us know who is intervening."

Chang Qi smiled faintly, "Many masters prefer to act anonymously—perhaps to them it was only a small favor."

"Yet his small favor saved dozens of lives."

"Miss need not worry. If that person is from our Dark Star, we'll find out sooner or later and thank them. Our family knows the value of gratitude; only be careful if you come into contact with such a master later—these people are capricious, and perhaps he did not take this matter to heart."

Wu Yi nodded and cast a look at those still squabbling over credit—their faces so puffed up she could hardly stand it—and snapped, "If you continue this shamelessness, all your rewards for this trip will be confiscated!"

At her words the room fell silent; no one dared to make a sound, and they looked at one another in embarrassment.

"We're due to return to Dark Star in a month—be careful and don't cause trouble!" Wu Yi warned, then rose and left.

After she left, Yu Feng sniffed, cast a sidelong look at everyone and said, "Alright, no one argue anymore. You bunch of stupid pigs—why did so many of you step forward at once? Couldn't you just let me take all the credit? Being seen as one of you is a disgrace to me!"

The dozen rolled their eyes and ignored the indignant Yu Feng, each going about their tasks.

In the room Yang Kai continued to sit in meditation when Wu Yi stormed in, showing no courtesy as she plopped into her usual chair; her ample chest rose and fell spectacularly.

Yang Kai lifted his eyelids to glance at her, then shut them and returned to his cultivation.

After waiting a moment and seeing he remained motionless, Wu Yi finally spoke up, "You're infuriating."
