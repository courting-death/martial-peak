## Chapter 2572 — Rather Die Than Submit

"What good would it do me to lie to you? You're about to die anyway." Yang Kai looked at him calmly.

The Yao King said, "You humans... hmph..." The implication was clear: humans were deceitful and not to be trusted.

Without another word, Yang Kai turned and walked away. "If that's how it is, then forget it."

"Wait..."

As expected, Yang Kai had barely taken a few steps when the Yao King called out from behind.

After all, when one's life is at stake, even a sliver of hope is worth struggling for.

Yang Kai turned sideways, glancing back with a slanted gaze.

The Yao King muttered something under his breath—perhaps a curse, perhaps not—then, after a moment, said, "Get me out of here first. Then you can ask whatever you want, and I'll tell you everything."

"Scram!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, no longer bothering with him.

Seeing Yang Kai really leaving, the Yao King panicked, no longer interested in bargaining. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Fine, someone did leave here before!"

Yang Kai stopped again, turned back, and looked at him with a cold expression. "Don't try any tricks, or I'll leave right now."

The Yao King's face darkened, but he dared not say more.

Yang Kai asked, "What did the person who left look like?"

The Yao King replied irritably, "A woman, hair wild and crazy, acting insane. She even threw an Inner Core at my head! It infuriated me. If I hadn't fallen on hard times, she wouldn't have dared treat me like this!"

Yang Kai found it amusing. Such antics were exactly what the Third Disciple would do. He kept his composure and continued, "She left that way?"

"That's right!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally relaxed. He hadn't found the Third Disciple's trail and feared she might have met with misfortune here, since this place was dangerous and the countless beast souls were not to be trifled with. Stroking his chin, Yang Kai asked, "She managed to leave. Why are you trapped here?"

The Yao King answered with grief, "If I could leave, why would I be trapped? The Tomb of All Spirits greatly suppresses the ancient creatures. Making it here was already lucky, but leaving is impossible!"

"You don't look like you're at death's door. Why did you come here?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

Speaking of this, the Yao King looked miserable, sighing, "Misfortune comes unexpectedly. I took one wrong step and ended up in this damned place."

Many demonic beasts in the ancient land suffered the same fate as this Yao King. Not every creature who entered was at the end of its life, but once inside, death was inevitable.

Only because this Yao King was strong did he manage to escape the beast souls' pursuit and make it here. Otherwise, he'd have been utterly destroyed.

After finishing, the Yao King urged, "If you have more questions, ask quickly. I can't hold on much longer."

"No more," Yang Kai shook his head, his gaze lingering on the Yao King.

Sensing the ill intent in Yang Kai's eyes, the Yao King realized Yang Kai was about to burn the bridge. All that talk about helping him was nonsense. He felt a surge of grief. He'd always known humans couldn't be trusted, but still hoped for a miracle. In the end, he was to be hunted down. The Yao King felt utterly exhausted...

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai didn't kill him right away. After pondering, he said, "Hand over your soul imprint, and I'll spare your life!"

He had tasted the sweetness of this before—when he controlled Yang Youwei, it had made tracking down the Third Disciple a breeze. But Yang Youwei was merely a Yao General, with limited subordinates. If he could command a Yao King, not only would finding the Third Disciple be easier, even searching for Xiaoxiao would yield twice the results with half the effort.

With a Yao King's protection, moving about the Ancient Land would be far more convenient.

Hearing this, the Yao King reacted like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, sneering, "Dream on!"

As one of the thirty-two Yao Kings, he was noble and powerful. How could he submit to a human's control? This human wasn't even stronger than him; at his peak, he could crush him with a slap. To demand his soul imprint was laughable.

Yang Kai didn't press him, only said lightly, "If a person dies, everything is lost. Only by living is there hope."

The Yao King sneered, "Better to die than live as a slave!"

Yang Kai looked at him and said, "Yao King, you have children, don't you? If you die here, what will happen to them? The yao you oppressed won't be kind to your children. And you must have wives and concubines, all beautiful and alluring. After you die, they'll end up with others, suffering humiliation and torment. You'll never taste those pleasures again. What a pity—a group of widows and orphans, their days will be hard."

The Yao King listened, his already dim face turning pitch black. Every word struck home, forcing him to imagine the tragic fate of his children and wives after his death.

Especially those wives—if they were pressed beneath others...

He couldn't bear to think further. His eyes reddened, nostrils flaring with hot breath.

Zhang Ruoxi, listening nearby, felt extremely uncomfortable. Her cheeks flushed, thinking, "How can Sir say such things? It's so embarrassing."

The Yao King's expression shifted rapidly, and the radiant light flowing from his body suddenly accelerated, as if his emotions were hastening the onset of his decline.

To Yang Kai's surprise, after a moment, the Yao King turned his head and declared, "I'd rather die than submit!"

Even this didn't make him yield? Yang Kai was a bit stunned, and couldn't help but admire him. Most people, facing death, would agree to anything, like Yang Youwei, who handed over his soul imprint immediately. But this Yao King had integrity—truly impressive.

With no other choice, Yang Kai decided to play his trump card. He still hoped to make use of the Yao King, so killing him now was out of the question. Lifting his chin, he shot Zhang Ruoxi a meaningful glance and snorted coldly, "Show him what we're capable of."

Zhang Ruoxi was momentarily stunned, but quickly understood. She slapped the air, and the Myriad Beasts Seal appeared.

The Yao King let out a cold laugh. "If you're going to kill me, then do it. Spare me the pointless chatter." His fearless demeanor in the face of death was truly striking.

Yang Kai said nothing. Zhang Ruoxi formed seals with her hands, repeatedly striking the Myriad Beasts Seal. Instantly, the sound of beasts filled the air as countless beast souls of all shapes and sizes flew out, soon filling the vast space.

Each beast soul retained its former appearance, all imposing and dignified. Their auras rivaled the Yao King's, some even surpassing him.

The Yao King stared wide-eyed, dumbfounded.

Zhang Ruoxi said, "This is the Myriad Beasts Seal. It has immense power over the souls of demonic beasts. Yao King, will you submit to my master now, or wait until you die and I use the Myriad Beasts Seal to collect your divine soul, condemning you to eternal torment? The choice is yours!"

The Yao King's frail body trembled, raising a finger at Yang Kai, crying out, "You... this is outrageous!"

He could refuse to submit, unwilling to hand over his soul imprint just to survive. But so what? Once the Myriad Beasts Seal was unleashed, even in death he wouldn't find peace; his soul would be trapped within it.

At that point, he'd truly be better off dead.
Yang Kai chuckled and motioned for Zhang Ruoxi to put away the Myriad Beasts Seal. Only then did he step forward and pat the Yao King on the shoulder. "No need to make things sound so harsh. Your resolve to rather shatter like jade than survive as mere tile is admirable—your heroic spirit truly commands respect. But in the end, you and I walk different paths. If there’s nothing in it for me, why would I bother saving you?"

"You promised me just now!" The Yao King glared at Yang Kai, powerless to do anything.

Yang Kai stroked his chin and said, "Times change. As the saying goes, a wise man adapts! Honestly, Yao King, I won't make things hard for you. If you submit, I'll only ask you to do a few small tasks. Once they're done, I'll leave the Ancient Land and return your freedom!"

"Why should I believe you?" The Yao King looked at Yang Kai with contempt.

Yang Kai snorted, "Do you have any other choice now?"

This man's mood changed faster than flipping a page, leaving the Yao King stunned.

"No time to waste. Either hand over your soul imprint, or I'll kill you and collect your soul with the Myriad Beasts Seal. Decide!" Yang Kai waved his hand, his tone brooking no argument.

Zhang Ruoxi had already maneuvered the Myriad Beasts Seal above the Yao King's head, ready to act if he refused.

The Yao King was unwilling, but what could he do? He could only grit his teeth and growl, "Fine!"

His voice was full of grief and resentment. This was truly a tiger fallen to the plains, bullied by dogs; a dragon stranded in shallow waters, mocked by shrimp.

Yang Kai immediately smiled and reached out his hand.

The Yao King used a secret technique, and soon a strand of golden light appeared on his forehead. Yang Kai grabbed it and sealed it into his Sea of Consciousness.

This trip into the tomb might have cost him Yang Youwei, but in exchange he had gained a Yao King—hardly a loss.

Having handed over his soul imprint, the Yao King was now extremely weak, the light from his body dissipating, as if he might die at any moment.

Yang Kai seized him, turned, and headed for the gray-black portal, asking, "Is this the way out?"

The Yao King nodded lightly, his gaze complicated. He was freed, but lost his liberty, now a slave. There was no joy in surviving—only deep sorrow.

Soon, Yang Kai dragged the Yao King to the portal. He activated his Emperor Yuan, enveloping the Yao King and Zhang Ruoxi, then dashed inside.

Their vision blurred, and two humans and one yao left the Tomb of All Spirits, reappearing in a lush world.

Ancient trees towered all around, wild primordial power flowed everywhere. They were somewhere in the Wild Ancient Land.

So easy! Yang Kai was surprised.

It seemed the Tomb of All Spirits truly existed to target the native creatures of the Wild Ancient Land, not restricting outsiders from coming or going. Of course, once inside, one still had to survive the relentless pursuit of countless beast souls—otherwise, death was inevitable all the same.

Looking around, Yang Kai realized they were no longer in the mountain valley where they had first entered the Tomb of All Spirits. He had no idea what strange place this was now.
