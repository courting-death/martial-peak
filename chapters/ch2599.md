## Chapter 2599 — Kneel

In terms of true strength, Heaven’s Punisher was only marginally stronger than the other Great Emperors, if at all. However, her power was especially effective against Divine Spirits, making her the natural nemesis of nearly all Divine Spirits!

Even the Dragon and Phoenix were no exception. Back in the day, many members of the Dragon Race perished beneath her sword.

The Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land were also Divine Spirits, but compared to the Dragon Race, the gap was significant. Since even the Dragon Race was no match for Heaven’s Punisher, how could they dare face her head-on? So, when they realized Zhang Ruoxi was a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher, each of them turned pale as if the end of days had arrived, trembling in fear.

“Fan Wu... you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want.” Cang Gou swallowed hard, staring in shock at the now utterly transformed Zhang Ruoxi. He asked in horror, “Are you sure she’s a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher?”

Fan Wu gave a bitter smile and replied hoarsely, “You inherited your ancestor’s memories too. Can’t you recognize that sword?”

Cang Gou had no answer. The Heaven’s Punisher Sword was the divine weapon Heaven’s Punisher once wielded, and in their inherited memories, it had always been sealed within the Blood Gate. The reason they sealed off this place and kept everyone away from the Blood Gate was not because they feared some yao would enter and obtain Origin Power, leaping over the dragon gate to become a Divine Spirit.

What they feared most was the Heaven’s Punisher Sword reappearing in the world.

And now, that very fear had come true.

It wasn’t that someone had entered the Blood Gate and brought out the Heaven’s Punisher Sword, but that a human girl in her early twenties had summoned it forth.

The Heaven’s Punisher Sword could only be wielded by Heaven’s Punisher and her descendants. With the sword in hand, Zhang Ruoxi’s identity was clear for all to see!

“It’s over...” Cang Gou murmured.

The very thing they had feared most had come to pass—the Heaven’s Punisher Sword had reappeared in the world, and the bloodline of Heaven’s Punisher had awakened. From this day forward, the Divine Spirits under Heaven would likely know no more days of peace. And the first to bear the brunt of it would undoubtedly be the Four Great Saint Venerables present here.

“A descendant of Heaven’s Punisher...” Yang Kai was dumbfounded. He never imagined Zhang Ruoxi would be the descendant of the legendary Heaven’s Punisher, the nemesis of all Divine Spirits!

The news was so shocking that he stood there in a daze, unable to react for a long while.

But as his thoughts turned, he suddenly remembered something.

Back in the Four Seasons Land, when they entered the Time Temple, Ruoxi had suddenly disappeared for a while. When she reappeared, she was wearing the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress.

That was a defensive Imperial Treasure, its value beyond measure.

Ruoxi told him it was given to her by someone named Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi was a notorious beast among the Divine Spirits. Yang Kai had never understood why such a powerful being would give Zhang Ruoxi such a precious treasure. Now he realized Qiong Qi must have sensed the power of her bloodline and dared not trouble her, fearing that if he pushed her too far, her bloodline would awaken early. If that happened, even Qiong Qi would be in for a bad time.

Duan Hongchen must have noticed as well, but the matter was too serious for him to reveal.

All signs pointed to one thing: Ruoxi was indeed a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher.

“So it’s really like this...” Yang Kai gave a wry smile. The way things had developed was far beyond what he could have imagined. He never thought Ruoxi’s bloodline awakening would shock him so deeply.

“Big rock!” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly turned a cold gaze toward Shi Huo, her voice chilling. “How do you want to die?”

Shi Huo’s whole body trembled, his face filled with utter terror. The flames in his eyes flickered wildly, betraying his inner turmoil.

The previous Zhang Ruoxi hadn’t even registered in his eyes—a mere human girl at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, someone he could kill with a breath. But now, this Zhang Ruoxi filled him with dread and despair.

He had just expressed his intent to kill Zhang Ruoxi, and before that, he had tormented Yang Kai for so long. There was no doubt Zhang Ruoxi now hated him to the bone. Of all the yao and Saint Venerables present, anyone else might survive today, but his own prospects were grim!

Shi Huo clearly realized this as well. Black flames erupted from his body as he forced himself to sound fierce, “So what if you’re a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher? This Lord is a descendant of the Ancient Divine Spirits! Before you grow up, how could you possibly kill me?”

As he roared, he turned his head toward Fan Wu and the others and said, “Heaven’s Punisher is the common enemy of all Divine Spirits, and that power is especially suppressive to our kind. If you still wish to sleep soundly in the days to come, then join this Lord and strike now—before she has fully grown—so we may kill her here.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face darkened as he nervously glanced at the other three Saint Venerables.

Just as Shi Huo said, Ruoxi had only just awakened her bloodline, and her true strength was still unknown. But the strength of the four Saint Venerables was beyond doubt. If they really joined forces, who knew if Ruoxi could withstand them?

What he saw was Cang Gou looking eager, clearly tempted by Shi Huo’s words.

On the other hand, Fan Wu and Luan Feng showed little reaction, their thoughts unreadable. Their lack of response also affected Cang Gou, who frowned in thought for a while before shaking his head and suppressing his restless urge.

Seeing this, Shi Huo’s heart sank, and he shouted angrily, “You’re really going to let her grow stronger? Don’t you realize that if she does, there will be no place for Divine Spirits in this world?”

How could Fan Wu and the other two not know this? Back when Heaven’s Punisher rampaged, the surviving Divine Spirits all hid in fear, terrified of being found and killed by her, losing their Origin Power.

It wasn’t until Heaven’s Punisher mysteriously disappeared for tens of thousands of years that Divine Spirits gradually dared to show themselves again.

Shi Huo’s words weren’t without reason, but Fan Wu and the other two simply didn’t dare bring disaster upon themselves.

Facing the Heaven’s Punisher bloodline, there was a primal fear and dread. Even if they wanted to deal with Zhang Ruoxi, they didn’t have the courage.

Fan Wu even closed his eyes, acting as if he were uninvolved, unwilling to offend Zhang Ruoxi lightly.

Still, he did not mind letting Shi Huo probe her first. If Zhang Ruoxi’s name as a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher proved empty, the three of them could step in later. But if she truly wielded Heaven’s Punisher’s might, then Shi Huo would serve as the perfect trial.

“Fine, fine, fine!” Shi Huo laughed loudly, his eyes full of mockery as he glanced at Fan Wu and the others. “Since that’s the case, I’ll take care of her myself! No need to thank me!”

As soon as he finished, Shi Huo let out a furious roar. His already massive body swelled even larger, black flames coiling around him, his eyes blazing. The ground melted beneath him as scorching heat swept out.

Thud, thud, thud...

Shi Huo strode forward, and in just a few steps, he was in front of Zhang Ruoxi. He swung his right arm back, his enormous fist aimed at her, ready to strike.

“From now on, there will be no more descendants of Heaven’s Punisher in this world!” Shi Huo grinned savagely, his aura violent.

He had never been a benevolent soul. Thirty thousand years ago, he slaughtered every last member of the Black Tortoise Sect. The reason? A single disciple from the sect had offended him during his travels, failing to recognize his power. In retaliation, Shi Huo descended upon the Black Tortoise Sect and wiped it out in its entirety—ten thousand lives—without mercy.

His treatment of Yang Kai today showed his extreme cruelty. He was even more vicious than the infamous beast Qiong Qi.

The massive fist smashed toward Zhang Ruoxi, the resulting gale whipping her hair and dress, making them rustle loudly.

At that moment, Fan Wu opened his eyes, staring intently, wanting to see if Zhang Ruoxi, the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher, lived up to her name. Luan Feng and Cang Gou were also watching nervously.

The Third Disciple cried out, covering his eyes as if he couldn’t bear to watch what would happen next.

Yang Kai also shouted, “Ruoxi, be careful!”

Under everyone’s gaze, Ruoxi simply stood there. Her power didn’t fluctuate at all, nor did she dodge or defend. Facing an attack that could destroy the world, she was as calm as a gentle breeze, her expression serene. Standing before the gigantic Shi Huo, she looked as small as an ant, creating a striking visual contrast.

Shi Huo was overjoyed, attacking even more ruthlessly. He sneered, “So that’s all there is to it!”

He could already picture Zhang Ruoxi being smashed to pieces by his blow. If he really killed her, all the Divine Spirits in the world would owe him a favor.

That favor would be invaluable. In the Ancient Land, even Fan Wu and the others would have to treat him with respect.

“Kneel!”

Just as the massive fist was about to strike Zhang Ruoxi, she casually tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and softly uttered a word from her crimson lips.

“What?” Fan Wu was stunned.

Luan Feng and Cang Gou were also dumbfounded, exchanging glances.

Did they hear that right? Zhang Ruoxi actually told Shi Huo to kneel? Even if she really was a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher and had awakened her bloodline, she was still just a girl. Wasn’t this arrogance a bit much? She was facing the Divine Spirit Shi Huo, after all.

Buzz...

The Blood Gate suddenly hummed, and a mysterious power spread out from within.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou all let out muffled groans, their faces twisting in shock. Under the weight of that mysterious power, the Divine Spirit Origin Power within each of them trembled violently. A primal fear surged up from the depths of their souls, flooding their minds. For a moment, they nearly dropped to their knees, unable to resist the urge.

The three of them managed to hold themselves back at the last moment, avoiding embarrassment. But Shi Huo, who bore the brunt of that mysterious power, wasn’t so lucky.

His massive fist froze half a foot in front of Ruoxi, the flames nearly scorching her hair. But no matter how hard Shi Huo tried, he couldn’t bring his fist down.

Instead, as his expression shifted from shock to panic, his huge body suddenly dropped, and with a thud, he knelt before Zhang Ruoxi.

“Hiss...”

Fan Wu and the others gasped, their faces filled with shock.

They could sense that the power forcing Shi Huo to kneel didn’t come from Zhang Ruoxi herself, but from within the Blood Gate. Yet, that power was under her control.

For the mighty Divine Spirit Shi Huo to be so easily forced to kneel, it meant she could just as easily suppress the three of them.
