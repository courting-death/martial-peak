## Chapter 1168 — Intelligence

Inside the main hall, nearly fifty people wore Yingyue Hall disciple uniforms, looking neat and uniform; the other hundred-plus were not dressed the same.

Seeing Yang Kai's puzzlement, Qian Tong stepped forward to explain, “Including you, Yingyue Hall has fifty slots this time. The others are quotas belonging to families or Sects affiliated with Yingyue Hall; they also have some slots, though not many. There are also families and Sects unconnected with Yingyue Hall who came to Tianyun City and are travelling with us.”

Yang Kai suddenly understood; that explained why so many people had gathered in the hall.

The major powers on Dark Star had done this reasonably well — they were not trying to hog everything, and had allocated some quotas to the smaller powers and families. Whether those who entered would profit depended on their own efforts and means.

With that in mind, Yang Kai could see why Qian Tong had said last time that whenever the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, no fewer than ten thousand people entered.

Dark Star was vast; even if each family’s allotment was small, together they would amount to no fewer than ten thousand.

As he walked with Qian Tong toward the interior, Yang Kai suddenly turned his head and looked in one direction, where a resentful, poisonous gaze was fixed on him.

Yang Kai was very sensitive to such looks, and felt it at once.

Their eyes met; the man’s gaze flickered a few times and he quickly looked away.

Xie Hongwen!

He was actually here? Last time Xie Hongwen had gone to Dragon Lair Mountain to make trouble for Yang Kai; if Qian Tong had not arrived at the end, Xie Hongwen would have surely died. That spoiled Young Master was of terrible character; though he possessed cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, his true combat ability left much to be desired. Why had he come?

What made Yang Kai even more puzzled was that Xie Hongwen was not wearing Yingyue Hall’s uniform; two Saint King-Grade Third-Stage warriors accompanied him, clearly acting as his protectors.

“Senior, one can kill inside the Flowing Flame Sandland, right?” Yang Kai asked suddenly and calmly.

Qian Tong had seen the exchanged glances between Yang Kai and Xie Hongwen and understood immediately; he sneered and nodded, “Yes. So, nephew, be cautious and avoid needlessly making enemies, but if someone dares to bully you beyond bearing, do not hold back. Leave any trouble to me.”

“Thanks, Senior,” Yang Kai replied with a cold smile. If Xie Hongwen behaved and stayed inside the Flowing Flame Sandland, fine; but if he dared seek revenge, Yang Kai would show no mercy — last time he spared him only for Qian Tong’s sake.

Qian Tong looked somewhat annoyed. After all, he had gone to great lengths to save Xie Hongwen’s life; who would have thought the idiot would be ungrateful and cling to resentment?

If he wished to court death, that was his own doing, and Qian Tong could not force him otherwise.

“That idiot originally had no right to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland; Yingyue Hall would never waste a slot on a worthless man,” Qian Tong whispered to Yang Kai. “But his father spent some wealth to buy three slots from a small family affiliated with Yingyue Hall, which is how he managed to enter. Those two Third-Stage Saint King-Grade warriors are disciples of the Xie family, not of Yingyue Hall.”

In other words, it wouldn’t matter if he were killed.

Yang Kai was astonished that the entry slots could be transferred, and immediately asked about it.

Qian Tong chuckled, “Of course they can be transferred. Slot allocations are decided in advance by the great powers. Each family has a fixed number of slots, but who actually goes is up to them.”

“So does that mean that if one has the nerve and the means, a power could send more people into it than were allocated?” Yang Kai immediately began connecting dots.

“Though that may be said, the Flowing Flame Sandland is extremely dangerous. Which power would dare send too many elites in? If losses were heavy, that would create gaps in a power’s ranks and harm its development. But you’re right — Yingyue Hall did procure another twenty or so slots from some small families, so this time over seventy of those going are Yingyue Hall disciples.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“There are many things to watch for inside the Flowing Flame Sandland. Last time you left in haste and I had no time to tell you. You’ll be teleported along with Wei Guchang and Xuan’er; on the way they’ll explain things to you. If anything is unclear, ask them,” Qian Tong advised.

“Alright.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, knowing this was Qian Tong giving Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er a chance to ingratiate themselves with him, so he did not refuse.

While they spoke, the three had already reached the Space Array. Qian Tong waved to the side, and Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er immediately stepped forward.

“You two will be teleported with Yang Kai. Once you arrive at Ji'an City do not wait around; go directly to the Flowing Flame Sandland. Your senior uncles Wang and Yan are waiting there; they will tell you what to do when you get there. I will lead these people and join you later.”

“Yes.” Wei Guchang bowed respectfully, gave Yang Kai a grin and said, “Greetings, Brother Yang.”

His attitude this time was far better than before, clearly due to Qian Tong’s careful instructions; Dong Xuan’er also gave a gentle salute.

After exchanging greetings, the three stood on the Space Array.

The Space Array had long since been prepared and only needed people to activate it.

The Yingyue Hall disciples guarding the array saw the three stabilize and quickly activated the formation. A white light flashed and the three disappeared from view; Qian Tong then busied himself arranging others to use the array.

The Space Array could teleport at most five people at a time, so sending nearly two hundred people required an hour or two.

Yang Kai felt a slight dizziness; when his vision cleared he found himself in another great hall.

This hall also had a Space Array. The disciples guarding it did not appear to belong to any particular power; when the three appeared one of them asked, “Are you from Yingyue Hall?”

Wei Guchang nodded, produced a token from his bosom and handed it over. The man examined it and returned it, giving them passage.

Outside the hall, Wei Guchang said, “Brother Yang, follow me. This is Ji'an City, a hundred thousand li from Tianyun City. We need to detour from here; it will take a day or two’s flight to reach the edge of the Flowing Flame Sandland.”

“Lead the way, Brother Wei,” Yang Kai nodded; unfamiliar with Dark Star, he naturally deferred to Wei Guchang.

Wei Guchang said nothing, produced his Star Shuttle and offered his hand to Dong Xuan’er.

Dong Xuan’er’s face flushed slightly; she scolded him with a look, as if reproaching his boldness at acting so in public.

Wei Guchang laughed heartily, “Brother Yang is not a stranger; what is there to be shy about?”

Dong Xuan’er could not resist him; she took his hand and allowed him to pull her onto the Star Shuttle.

Yang Kai could not help but smile; the scene warmed him, and his impression of Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er improved. He promptly summoned his own Star Shuttle.

Two streaks of azure light flashed and the three sped off in the same direction, quickly leaving Ji'an City behind.

Wei Guchang’s Star Shuttle, like Yang Kai’s, was an Upper-Level Saint King-Grade craft, so even with a passenger aboard the speeds were similar.

Once clear of Ji'an City, Wei Guchang said, “Elder Qian mentioned that Brother Yang knows little about the Flowing Flame Sandland. Is there anything you wish to learn? If I know, I will tell you.”

Yang Kai was about to ask questions when Wei Guchang spoke first. Yang Kai replied, “I only know that we must pass through certain special places to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland. I don’t know what it’s like inside or what to watch for; please instruct me, Brother Wei.”

Seeing Yang Kai’s courtesy, Wei Guchang smiled broadly, “I cannot claim to instruct you; I merely have older benefactors who informed me, so I know a bit more than you. It’s nothing — you can discover most of it by looking around yourself.”

He had learned from Qian Tong that Yang Kai came from the outside world and likely knew nothing of the Flowing Flame Sandland, so he patiently shared what intelligence he had.

Dong Xuan’er occasionally interjected with a sentence that hit straight to the point.

The pair worked together and quickly gave Yang Kai a comprehensive understanding of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

The Flowing Flame Sandland was shrouded in scorching flames all year round — Origin Returning Realm experts could not enter, and Saint King Realm cultivators ordinarily had no qualification to do so. Only at times like this could Saint King Realm cultivators venture inside to explore.

The Flowing Flame Sandland was not uniformly hot everywhere; think of it as a large circular region divided into multiple layers.

The outermost region was the Hot Flame Zone, where heat reigned; the deeper one went, the more dangerous it became.

In the Hot Flame Zone some heaven-and-earth treasures could be found, but more commonly rare ores — stones baked by the unrelenting heat for countless years until supremely refined. Some ores could be mined and forged into implements straightaway, and their quality surpassed anything from elsewhere by several degrees.

The dangers of the Scorching Zone were not limited to its unbearable heat — there were also Fire Spirit Beasts and Flowing Flame Fireblazes. Those two were the truly deadly threats.

Fire Spirit Beasts were creatures formed when fire-type Spiritual Qi condensed to a certain degree, taking various demonic beast forms. Their bodies were half-real, half-illusory; the more solid their bodies, the stronger they were. They had no intelligence. Ordinary physical attacks were useless, divine sense attacks equally ineffective; only Saint Yuan attacks could destroy them.

It was best to use ice-type Secret Treasures if possible; almost everyone entering the Flowing Flame Sandland prepared one.

Fire Spirit Beasts contained within them rare Fire Crystal Stones, which were excellent for refining certain special Pills and Secret Treasures, greatly enhancing their quality.

Alchemy and forging on Dark Star were only at Origin-Grade Lower-Level, so to concoct Origin-Grade Middle-Level Pills and Secret Treasures, Fire Crystal Stones were indispensable.
