## Chapter 1480 — True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy

Half an hour later, Yang Kai wore an expression of deep, knotty worry and sighed helplessly.

Given his attainments and insight in pill refinement, he still could not determine the exact variety of this Spiritual Pill; he had no real idea what kind it was, only vaguely discerning from its medicinal scent that it was used for cultivation and posed no harm.

Could it be a Spiritual Pill lost since the ancient age? Yang Kai frowned and guessed inwardly that if that were the case, it would be understandable he could not recognize it—after all, pills crafted by cultivators tens of thousands of years ago would surely differ somewhat from those of today.

Unable to identify it, Yang Kai was not anxious; he solemnly set this Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill aside for now and would verify it later when he had the chance.

In any case, the Spiritual Pill would not be used carelessly while it was in his possession; sooner or later he would figure it out.

With that thought, Yang Kai took out another item to examine.

It was a fragment of a finger bone.

Speaking of which, this trip to the Imperial Garden had yielded enormous spoils just from that hidden valley alone: hundreds of specimens of ten-thousand-year Spiritual Medicine, dozens of Spiritual Pills bearing Pill Patterns, a Void King-Grade refining furnace, and a Void King-Grade Pill that formed a Pill Cloud—every single item of considerable value.

That fragment of finger bone had likewise come from the hidden valley; it was the only bone left behind after the valley's master died.

Yang Kai had merely felt respect for that Master of Pill Refinement and wished to bury him to give him peace, but when he interred the remains he accidentally discovered this chunk of unweathered bone that had not decayed to dust—good deed rewarded in kind.

What secret the finger bone hid, Yang Kai did not know; he could only begin investigating it now.

Holding the fragment, Yang Kai examined it carefully. Though it had endured tens of thousands of years, the bone remained smooth and jade-like, pure and flawless, as if in life its owner had used some special secret art to sanctify it.

The notion surged up, and Yang Kai immediately became thoroughly excited.

He had never before seen a cultivator treat part of his body as if it were a Secret Treasure to be sanctified, but if someone had done so it must have been for a profound reason—perhaps the finger bone truly concealed some earth-shattering secret.

Saint Yuan surged; Yang Kai tentatively poured his own Saint Yuan into the finger bone. To his great disappointment, the fragment did not accept any of his Saint Yuan. Nothing changed.

After a moment, Yang Kai withdrew his Saint Yuan; since the bone would not accept it, further probing with that method was pointless.

If it does not react to the infusion of Saint Yuan, what about Divine Sense?

Thinking so, Yang Kai immediately urged his Divine Sense. In an instant his vast, sea-like mind manifested like a mist and wrapped around the finger bone.

The Divine Sense took shape!

Only when Divine Sense attains a certain standard will the formless power undergo this miraculous transformation and manifest traces perceptible to the naked eye.

Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness had been nourished by a Warm Spirit Lotus; even without deliberate cultivation his Divine Sense was constantly strengthening. So although his cultivation stood at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the sheer intensity of his Divine Sense had barely reached the standard required for manifestation!

This was something even many Void King Realm experts could not accomplish, and it was a point of pride.

Moreover, his Divine Sense was a deviated kind, possessing the massively destructive Divine Sense Fire, so that mist-like presence appeared fiery red.

This time Yang Kai's guess was correct: the finger bone did not accept Saint Yuan, but it was extremely sensitive to Divine Sense.

When the crimson Divine Sense wrapped it, a dazzling white light suddenly burst from within the bone, and instantly a tremendous pulling force sprang forth that sucked Yang Kai's Divine Sense into the fragment.

Yang Kai remained calm; though he did not know what would occur next, the pull posed no great danger, and if he wished to resist he could withdraw his Divine Sense.

With that in mind, he did not struggle but let his Divine Sense follow the tug and pour into the finger bone.

In an instant, Yang Kai felt as if he had entered another world.

Under the scrutiny of his Divine Sense, the surroundings were gray and misty, devoid of anything else, save for wondrous runes swimming about like fish.

"This..." Yang Kai's face showed astonishment.

From those magical runes he could sense fluctuations of Divine Sense power; those runes were, in fact, the materializations of Divine Sense.

Needless to say, it was obviously the Divine Sense of that Master of Pill Refinement.

Not only had that man reached great heights in pill refinement, his cultivation was likewise impressive; to cause his Divine Sense to take such a manifest form he must have reached at least the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

Upon detecting Yang Kai's arrival, the runes seemed to activate and surged toward him, instantly merging with his Divine Sense.

Yang Kai's body trembled and his eyes flashed; he allowed the runes to fuse into his Divine Sense and began to carefully ponder the mysteries they contained.

At first Yang Kai was bewildered, but as time passed and more runes merged with his Divine Sense, he gradually understood the profound secrets harbored within that finger bone.

The runes rearranged and combined until what remained for Yang Kai was, astonishingly, a Pill Scripture passed down from antiquity!

True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy!

Yang Kai had read many Pill Scriptures before; it had been a compendium obtained back in Yao Wang Valley that first set him on the path of pill refinement.

But no scripture he had encountered compared to this True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy. The knowledge and refining techniques contained within the True Alchemy Formula were mere child's play before this treatise—utterly insignificant.

This Pill Scripture was not created by the valley's master; he had likewise obtained it by chance from a ruin. It was precisely thanks to this True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy that the valley master had achieved the pinnacle of pill refinement and become the most renowned alchemist of tens of thousands of years past.

When his time drew near, unwilling that this world-shattering book should be buried with him yet fearing it fall into ignoble hands and be sullied, he expended effort to convert its information into Divine Sense and leave it within his finger bone.

He also sanctified his finger bone through secret rites so it would become like a Secret Treasure, immune to the erosions of time.

Thus, even if he died, the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy could be transmitted by this special means.

Had some scoundrel discovered his corpse, they would surely have ignored it, and so the chance to obtain the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy would be lost.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had felt the impulse to bury him, and by that twist of fate he obtained the finger bone and thereby the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Learning that this information had been left by the Master of Pill Refinement, Yang Kai was greatly surprised, thinking his luck truly excellent; but soon he cast aside such distractions and immersed himself wholly in the ocean of alchemical knowledge.

Although the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy originated in antiquity, long before the valley master's era, what Yang Kai now possessed was not purely authentic—the valley master had woven his own unique insights and personal experiences into it, rendering it even more precious than a mere authentic text.

It could be said the valley master had infused his lifetime of pill-refining experience into the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Yang Kai read entranced; for a long time many problems that had baffled him in pill refinement found answers here.

In pill refinement, Yang Kai had natural advantages, but he had been advancing largely by his own trial and error, seldom guided by others. When he was on the Tongxuan Continent he occasionally consulted the venerable Tianzang Elder Li Rui, but since arriving in the Star Domain for everything he had to rely on himself.

Moreover, Yang Kai did not dare to expose his proficiency in pill refinement casually.

As his strength increased, he sensed his understanding and skill in pill refinement approaching a ceiling; that limit was not absolute—if he worked hard, he could eventually break through.

Only the time frame for that breakthrough might be ten years, twenty years, or even longer.

But now things were different: possessing this True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy was equivalent to having a master to teach him pill refinement, available anytime and anywhere to be consulted.

In only a short while he already felt his comprehension of alchemy deepen by several degrees.

Yang Kai grew more and more attached to the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy, losing all sense of time as he greedily absorbed its knowledge.

Only half a month later did Yang Kai slowly exhale and withdraw his Divine Sense from the finger bone, his face lined with fatigue.

Sustaining his Divine Sense in outward projection for half a month had drained a great portion of his power.

Yet his eyes shone brilliantly, appearing immensely uplifted and bright.

Half a month could not allow him to fully master the entire True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy; he had merely skimmed it, but even so his gains were tremendous. It was hard to imagine how far his pill refinement would advance if he could completely internalize it.

"Does a pill have a spirit in order to be called a Spiritual Pill?" Yang Kai stroked his chin and murmured, his face contemplative.

The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy contained many novel concepts that inspired him; merely the idea that a pill might possess spirit could lead to a qualitative leap in his pill refinement.

After some careful reflection, Yang Kai slowly shook his head and let the thought go.

The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy could be studied fully later; there was no rush. However... regarding that Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill that formed a Pill Cloud, Yang Kai now had a rough idea what it was.

The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy not only contained wondrous concepts, but also the valley master's lifetime of insights and many pill prescriptions long lost to the world.

Each recipe was priceless, many extinct.

From those prescriptions and their descriptions he vaguely understood the type and use of that Spiritual Pill.

Yang Kai took that Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill out again, placed it in his palm to observe, and after a long while his face broke into a smile.

No doubt about it—judging from the pill's color, size, scent, and the internal traces it left, this Spiritual Pill should be the Dragon-Flame Purple Marrow Pill!
