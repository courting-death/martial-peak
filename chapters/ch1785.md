## Chapter 1785 — What If I Call You Grandpa?

Zi Long truly could no longer bear the sight of Yang Kai’s smug, arrogant face—the look of a petty man drunk on his own success. So he decisively shut his eyes, refusing to look at the maddening scene unfolding a hundred zhang away.

But... Yang Kai had no intention of stopping there.

"Hey, why isn't this Wudao Flower as big as the first one? These petals are too meager, each looks like a malformed fruit, malnourished—the medicinal effect must not be very good. Whatever, whatever, I'll put it away for now; it's better than nothing," Yang Kai kept saying.

Zi Long's body trembled slightly, his Saint Yuan nearly ran rampant.

On the other side, Xu Wei's forehead was threaded with veins; obviously Yang Kai had infuriated him thoroughly.

But unlike Zi Long, he did not close his eyes; instead he fixed his gaze on Yang Kai's movements, praying that after the big pieces of meat were taken there would be some soup left for him to drink.

After watching for a while, he found something was wrong.

That brat was too cruel; when collecting the Wudao Flowers he even pulled up the roots together, leaving nothing behind.

Xu Wei sighed deeply in his heart, knowing that these five Wudao Flowers would probably not be his; he inhaled sharply and, imitating Zi Long, closed his eyes—out of sight, out of mind.

Yang Kai shouted, "Wow!" as if he had discovered a new continent; his voice was filled with surprise and excitement.

Xu Wei, who had just closed his eyes, scrambled to open them, widening his eyes and staring toward Yang Kai to see what was happening.

Even Zi Long, this time, could not hold back; he narrowed his eyes and looked forward.

But there was nothing special on Yang Kai's side; he simply chuckled, placed the third Wudao Flower into the jade box, and muttered to himself, "That was close, nearly put it in the wrong box and almost wasted its efficacy."

Xu Wei opened his mouth as if to say something, but in the end did not speak; he merely turned his gaze aside with a cold face.

Then came the fourth, the fifth...

Yang Kai was like a bumpkin fresh out of the countryside who had never seen the world—every time he picked a Wudao Flower, he couldn’t help shouting and chattering endlessly, commenting on it from every angle. His incessant rambling made Xu Wei and Zi Long’s moods rise and fall with irritation.

Those words felt like a stick constantly poking at their hearts... they were unbearably uncomfortable.

When Yang Kai had collected all five Wudao Flowers and secured them, Xu Wei and Zi Long both exhaled softly, inexplicably feeling a sense of relief at last.

At that moment, it seemed the world had grown noticeably brighter.

Yang Kai patted his Spatial Ring and beamed, "Not a bad haul!"

Xu Wei let out a sinister laugh. “Let’s see if you can actually take those things away.”

Although they knew Yang Kai was proficient in Spatial Force and could even teleport a hundred zhang in an instant, Yang Kai was only an Origin Returning Realm warrior while he and Zi Long were Void King Realm; the gap in strength was enormous. He would not allow Yang Kai to leave easily, and he trusted Zi Long would not either.

When the Seven Luminaries Divine Light dissipated, that would be the moment for him and Zi Long to strike Yang Kai!

Only then would it be truly determined who the Wudao Flowers belonged to.

For now... that brat was only responsible for safekeeping, not true possession.

"Whether I can take them, just watch and see," Yang Kai replied lightly, showing no concern for the impending danger. He shaded his eyes with his hand in a distant-looking pose, scanned the surroundings, fixed his gaze on a direction, and called out loudly, "Hey, those Questioning Heart Orchids look good too. Can't let them go."

It was hard to say what was wrong with this region—there were numerous spatial rifts, and it had produced more than just the Wudao Flowers as heaven-and-earth treasures.

When the three sides had been stalemated earlier, everyone had already noticed this: besides the Wudao Flowers there were several Questioning Heart Orchids and a single stalk of Heavenly Infant Grass.

The Questioning Heart Orchid was an extremely rare treasure used to temper a cultivator’s mental state, while the Heavenly Infant Grass was one of the main ingredients in refining the Void King Pill—a Spiritual Pill that could greatly increase the success rate of Origin Returning Realm cultivators attempting to break through to the Void King Realm. Its value was immeasurable.

However, among these three treasures, the Wudao Flower's value was undoubtedly the highest, so everyone's attention had been focused on it rather than on the orchids and the grass.

Now that the Wudao Flowers were in Yang Kai's pouch, he naturally shifted his focus.

Fortunately, those Questioning Heart Orchids, like the Wudao Flowers, grew behind a certain spatial rift and were not covered by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; the lone Heavenly Infant Grass, however, was currently wrapped tightly by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

So when Yang Kai said this, Xu Wei's heart involuntarily sank.

It’s over—the Questioning Heart Orchid won’t escape that brat’s clutches either! Xu Wei’s face darkened.

Indeed, after speaking Yang Kai had already activated his spatial power and arrived at where the orchids grew.

As he had done earlier with the Wudao Flowers, he broke through the spatial barrier and shifted a few dozen zhang in an instant.

Zi Long had been staring intently at Yang Kai, trying to glean some clue from his movements, but he soon helplessly realized spatial force was too abstruse—he could not see how Yang Kai moved.

He only felt a strange fluctuation envelop Yang Kai, and then he vanished; when he reappeared, he was already at the spot.

Space was indeed profound—Zi Long frowned deeply, feeling powerless.

Yet it only strengthened his resolve to kill Yang Kai: if that brat lived, his son Zi Donglai would surely develop a heart demon, and this dispute between them had already been unpleasant; if such a young man truly rose to Void King Realm, the danger to Purple Star would be enormous.

How terrifying would a Void King Realm master of spatial force be? Zi Long could hardly bear to imagine it.

He had to snuff out such a danger at its bud!

"Hello there," Yang Kai called cheerfully.

While Zi Long was lost in thought, Yang Kai smiled and greeted him and Zi Donglai.

The Questioning Heart Orchids were only forty zhang from where they stood, so Yang Kai was comparatively close.

Zi Donglai glared at Yang Kai and ground his teeth, "You brat, go on and be arrogant—later this Young Master will make you see."

Having been humiliated by Yang Kai so many times, he seemed to have learned nothing; he only kept spouting fierce words to show his impotence.

Yang Kai responded with a meaningful chuckle and ignored Zi Donglai, squatting down to carefully collect the Questioning Heart Orchids.

To Zi Long and Xu Wei's silent relief, this time Yang Kai did not make a show; throughout the entire collection he remained silent.

It seemed that as time passed the brat was growing uneasy too, the two guessed inwardly.

Before long, the orchids were properly stored and placed into his Spatial Ring.

"Haha, brat, you can't do anything about that Heavenly Infant Grass, can you?" Xu Wei laughed from afar; having been angered earlier, he finally found an excuse to taunt Yang Kai and would not miss the chance. He looked at Yang Kai with derision and mocked, "If you're so capable, try to pluck that Heavenly Infant Grass for this old man to see!"

Both the Wudao Flowers and the Questioning Heart Orchids grew in excellent positions and had not been covered by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, so Yang Kai was able to use his spatial secret art to collect them with ease.

But the Heavenly Infant Grass was different—it was completely shrouded by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; even if he had tremendous ability, he could not hope to collect that Spiritual Herb.

Xu Wei's provocation was clearly meant to needle Yang Kai, to use his own tactics against him.

Zi Long smiled faintly and echoed from the side, "Elder Xu, why trouble him? There's no way he could do that."

"If he could do it, I'll immediately sever my meridians!" Zi Donglai blustered arrogantly.

Hearing him say that, Zi Long couldn’t help but frown, secretly feeling that his foolish son was looking for trouble. Mocking or provoking Yang Kai was one thing—venting some anger was understandable—but saying something as reckless as severing one’s own meridians was simply far too thoughtless.

Words like that were not to be tossed about casually.

Still, Zi Long did not reprimand him, because in his view Yang Kai truly could not gather the Heavenly Infant Grass.

The three bantered back and forth, as if all eager to see Yang Kai make a fool of himself.

Yang Kai stood where he was, glancing at Xu Wei, then at Zi Long and his son. He gave a faint chuckle. “Looks like you people remember the beating but not the pain. Seems I was still far too soft-hearted.”

Earlier, when collecting the Questioning Heart Orchids, Yang Kai had not provoked them because he found it meaningless—some things could be done once or twice, but too much became tiresome. He had not expected them to provoke him now.

In that case, let them pay the price, Yang Kai snorted coldly in his heart.

Xu Wei barked, "Don't talk nonsense—anyway you can't take the Heavenly Infant Grass. If you have the nerve, take everything here and leave none for me."

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and said, "And what if I can take them?"

Xu Wei was momentarily stunned, then laughed loudly, "Empty boasts! If you can, then do it."

Yang Kai twisted his lips and shook his head, "Old man, if you want this Young Master to enter in there and collect the Heavenly Infant Grass, it won't come without a price. The Seven Luminaries Divine Light is not something to barge into recklessly; I'd be taking a huge risk."

Xu Wei's eyes narrowed and he shouted, "If you can really take it, I'll call you 'grandpa' without hesitation!"

Yang Kai was taken aback—he had never imagined Xu Wei would go so far to provoke him; the old man's hatred ran deep, as if he were itching for Yang Kai to rush into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light and seek death.

Yang Kai sniffed and smiled lightly at Xu Wei, "You said it."

Xu Wei's neck stiffened and he snapped back, "So what if I said it?" his tone was resolute.
