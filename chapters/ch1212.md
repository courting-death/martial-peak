## Chapter 1212 — Ugly Woman

Having transferred everything into his Spatial Ring, Yang Kai sat cross-legged beneath the huge rock and briefly regulated his breathing.

He had been cultivating in that canyon for over a month straight, and had just been through another fierce fight; although it hadn't cost him much, Yang Kai still wanted to keep himself in the most perfect condition to guard against any sudden situation.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai had returned to his former condition.

Just as he was about to leave the hollow beneath the huge stone, a gray figure suddenly flashed before his eyes; the figure was small and agile, moving with extreme speed. It wasn't as monstrously terrifying as Flowing Flame Fireblaze, but it was far from ordinary.

The instant Yang Kai detected the figure, his Divine Sense swept over it, and after confirming what it was he couldn't help but reveal a look of surprise.

It turned out to be a demonic beast, somewhat fox-like in appearance, its eyes lively to the extreme and full of cunning; a wind-attributed aura swirled around its body, its four paws moving like the wind, and in the blink of an eye it had bounded far away.

What caught Yang Kai’s attention was that this Demonic Beast held in its mouth a fruit overflowing with Spiritual Qi. The fruit was a vivid crimson, and within it surged an intense, scorching heat.

Golden Sun Fruit? Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, immediately stood up, and swiftly gave chase after the fox-like little beast.

The Golden Sun Fruit is an Origin-Grade Upper-Level spiritual fruit, a top-tier ingredient for refining certain Origin-Grade Pills. Since he planned to refine some Pills to raise the cultivation of Wu Yi and the others, he naturally wouldn't let such a fruit slip away.

Moreover, the demonic beast's power was not high — only Sixth-Tier — it seemed to be merely fast; he believed that with his own skills he could easily catch up with it.

Snatching a spiritual fruit from a demonic beast's mouth was somewhat shameless. But what concerned Yang Kai was that if one Golden Sun Fruit appeared, then a Golden Sun Fruit tree must be growing nearby; catching the beast might lead it to that tree.

If he could transplant it to Dragon Lair Mountain, that would be perfect. Yang Kai believed that with the vitality contained in his Golden Blood, transplanting a Golden Sun Fruit tree would be no problem.

This was the Heat-Flame Zone of the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, where all the Spiritual Herbs and Medicines were of ancient age and their value could not be compared with those on the outside market.

Yang Kai's speed was not slow. The moment he noticed the little beast pass by he gave chase. Still, he had underestimated the creature's ability; when he finally rushed out, the other was already over three li away.

Frowning, Yang Kai displayed his Wind-and-Thunder Wings, gradually closing the distance between himself and the little beast.

Half an hour later, just as Yang Kai was about to catch up with the little beast, a fierce clash of combat suddenly came from not far ahead. Intense energy fluctuations emanated from that direction; the battle looked to be in full swing.

Yang Kai had no intention of seeking trouble and had planned to avoid the fight, but the little beast's path was heading straight toward the source of the clash.

Having chased for so long, Yang Kai naturally didn't want to give up halfway, so he continued the pursuit.

A moment later he showed a stunned expression, for he saw with his own eyes that the little beast he had chased suddenly turned into a streak of light and dove into the chest of one of the two fighters.

So the little beast was someone else's pet? Yang Kai's face darkened with displeasure.

Had he known this earlier he would never have made such a blunder. If it was indeed a demonic beast kept by someone, then its master had surely released it to search for Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine, and it had merely been discovered by him on its return trip, chased all the way here.

This could easily cause a misunderstanding, and might even lead to a fight.

Yet the little beast truly had skill — it had actually procured a Golden Sun Fruit for its master, and from the way it moved so confidently it seemed to have done this many times.

The one fighting the beast's owner was a man clad in dazzling golden garments; when Yang Kai saw the clothing he couldn't help but feel disgusted deep in his heart.

How many Battle Sky Alliance cultivators had come here was unknown; you could run into them anywhere. When he had gathered Cui Luo Grass two had died; in the canyon Yang Kai had killed four, and not long after leaving the canyon he had encountered another — truly unlucky.

The sight of the little beast diving into the woman's chest with the fruit was naturally seen by the Battle Sky Alliance disciple, who couldn't help exclaiming, "Golden Sun Fruit?"

As he spoke, greed flared in his eyes and his attacks grew even more ruthless.

After Yang Kai arrived, the woman seemed to become cautious about inviting trouble, frequently casting her attention toward Yang Kai's direction. This caused her, who had been evenly matching her opponent, to instantly fall behind, nearly overwhelmed by the other's long halberd-like Secret Treasure and plunged into grave danger.

Yet that disciple of the Battle Sky Alliance didn’t take Yang Kai seriously at all. While attacking with full force, he kept shouting taunts to provoke the woman: “You ugly wench! You’re hideous and can’t even stand being called that? Hahaha! Since you’re so ugly, you should stay locked up in your room instead of showing your face and sickening others. My mouth’s my own—I’ll say whatever I please. What, you gonna bite me?”

Sure enough, under the man's venomous tongue the woman's delicate body trembled and her eyes flashed with cold killing intent. Though she continuously urged her Saint Yuan to resist and wanted to tear the other's mouth apart, in her fury she could only fight at under eighty percent of her peak, making her already dire situation even more precarious.

Only then did Yang Kai notice the woman's appearance, and upon seeing it a wave of sorrow passed through him.

Although the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator's words were extremely vicious, it could not be denied that the woman indeed did not look pleasant.

Saying she didn't look good was putting it mildly — Yang Kai's compassion softened the phrase. Her appearance was simply unbearable to behold. She clearly had a petite, full figure that invited imagination, yet her pretty face was covered in pits and blemishes; some of the spots even sprouted yellow pus and gave off an unpleasant smell. Furthermore, the skin on her face was dark yellow, making her look malnourished.

This contrasted sharply with her fair arms and tender neck.

Someone with a weak disposition would likely be startled on seeing her face.

Without those defects her looks would probably not be bad — her features were delicate and well arranged.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, uncertain whether she had been born that way or whether something else had caused it, but her appearance was clearly a raw nerve; the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator's constant taunts had successfully hit that nerve.

Otherwise, with her strength, she might even have slain that Battle Sky Alliance cultivator.

She wielded a Secret Treasure resembling white silk threads—extremely sharp and strangely elusive. As it danced through the air, white light flashed madly within a radius of more than ten zhang, accompanied by the constant sound of slicing. With it, she was barely able to hold her ground without defeat.

Originally these two were fighting and Yang Kai had no intention of meddling. Though he disliked Battle Sky Alliance cultivators, he wouldn't act unless provoked; those who provoked him had all perished.

And since the little beast that could find and gather spiritual fruit belonged to this woman, Yang Kai had no intention of pursuing it further.

But contrary to his hopes, the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator, for reasons unknown, while fighting the woman loudly called to Yang Kai, "Kid, tell me — isn't this woman hideously ugly? Say it and I'll reward you well later."

He was obviously trying to use Yang Kai to further provoke the woman.

Hearing him, Yang Kai frowned; he had been about to leave but instead stood his ground and looked at the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator with an amused expression.

The woman, intentionally or not, glanced over in their direction; Yang Kai seemed to detect a trace of worry in her eyes, her red lips paling as she bit them tightly.

So she was so sensitive about her appearance? She was clearly afraid Yang Kai would echo the Battle Sky Alliance disciple's words, hence her anxiety.

Yang Kai couldn't understand a woman's thoughts, but he felt that even if she were a little ugly... even if she were hideously repulsive, there was no need to be so concerned, right?

Yang Kai said nothing, which made the woman secretly relax. The white silk-like Secret Treasure in her hand moved even more fiercely and instantly bound the other's long halberd. The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator was startled and hastily tried to retract his Secret Treasure but could not; he struggled against the white-silk binding as if it might be taken from him, and his face changed as he hurriedly urged his Saint Yuan to stabilize the situation.

The two sides suddenly reached a stalemate, frozen in place and no longer advancing, only desperately pouring Saint Yuan into their Secret Treasures and continuing the struggle through them.

"Kid, are you mute? I'm asking you a question — why aren't you answering?" The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator, stung by being rebuffed by the woman, was angry and roared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai still looked at him with a wry smile; after a brief pause he actually stepped forward toward the two locked in standoff.

Both the woman and the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator showed stunned expressions, staring blankly at the approaching Yang Kai, unable to understand what a mere First Stage of the Saint King Realm intended to do.

Very quickly the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator thought of a ploy and shouted at Yang Kai, "Kid, whether you're mute or not, hurry and kill this woman for me. Kill her and I'll give you ample reward."

At these words the woman's expression changed drastically. Now that she and her opponent were locked in a stalemate, any outside interference would inevitably break that stalemate.

Although she did not fear an attack from a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, if he struck the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator would take the opportunity to free himself from her white-silk Secret Treasure, and the hard-won advantage would instantly evaporate.

So she was truly nervous.

Fortunately Yang Kai appeared unmoved, merely slowly shaking his head, which eased her heart and brought a look of gratitude to her eyes.
