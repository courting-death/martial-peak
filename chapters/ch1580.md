## Chapter 1580 — Xue Lian

In the pavilion, Xia Ningshang concentrated on refining pills while Yang Kai schemed how to extract those Void King-Grade ingredients from Chi Yue's storeroom.

He thought and thought; there was only one way.

Use the Stone Puppet!

Stone Puppets can move through the earth without a sound, and because they are an extremely peculiar lifeform, it is exceedingly difficult for others to detect any flicker of life from them. Back when he visited the Liuli Sect on Dark Star, Yang Kai used a Stone Puppet to steal a large amount of Thousand Illusions Glaze, the primary material for forging a Void King-Grade Warship.

But this time the situation was somewhat different from back then.

The Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, though tightly guarded by Liuli defenses, still had exploitable opportunities; the experts of the Liuli Sect could never have imagined that any living being would be able to steal Thousand Illusions Glaze right under their noses.

Chi Yue's storeroom, however, likely did not compare in terms of how tightly it was guarded.

The Stone Puppet was useful, but its intelligence was low — recklessly sending it in now might very well alert the snakes in the grass.

He would have to act personally!

With that thought, Yang Kai no longer hesitated; he waved a hand and a single golden Stone Puppet appeared before him. This Stone Puppet was the only one of its kin, and due to various reasons at its birth its soul had been left incomplete, making the already dim-witted creature seem like a lifeless thing.

It was perfect for Yang Kai to use as a sort of avatar.

It had also absorbed a large amount of Yang Kai's pure Golden Blood, so its color had taken on a faint golden hue.

Studying the golden Stone Puppet before him, Yang Kai nodded slightly, and a growing strand of his Soul Incarnation shot out from his Sea of Consciousness and poured into the Golden Stone Puppet's body.

The next moment, the puppet's dull eyes regained some light and it seemed far more responsive.

Yang Kai closed his eyes; his expression shifted minutely.

No matter how many times he had done this, he still found it wondrous — injecting his Soul Incarnation into the Golden Stone Puppet and making it his avatar. At that moment he felt as if he were split in two.

He could sense all the emotions and sensations of his true body, and he could also take in everything the Golden Stone Puppet saw and heard.

It was an extremely strange, ineffable feeling.

He did not rush to act; first he tested controlling the Golden Stone Puppet with his Soul Incarnation, and after he grew familiar with that peculiar body he shifted his form and suddenly dove into the earth.

To the solid ground the Golden Stone Puppet was as if nothing — its strange body could perfectly meld into the earth, moving beneath with no obstruction, like a fish swimming through water.

No one in the palace noticed.

Yang Kai had already asked Shan Qingluo about the location of the storeroom, so he did not need to search; he fixed the direction and headed straight for it.

Estimating distance and position, it did not take long before the Golden Stone Puppet arrived beneath the storeroom.

Yang Kai quietly sent out his Divine Sense to peer upward.

As he expected, even in the deep foundations of the storeroom there seemed to be restrictive arrays; when his avatar's Divine Sense probed forward, it soon encountered an invisible resistance blocking the way.

That invisible barrier did not seem very strong. Yang Kai's mind stirred and he slightly increased the power of his Divine Sense, condensing it into a burst and striking into the void.

To be fair, this was only an experiment. Yang Kai kept his force as small as possible and did not dare act wantonly; he believed such a light probe would not attract anyone's attention.

But the instant his Divine Sense touched that resistance, a terrifying aura suddenly spread from somewhere within the palace.

The strength of that aura made everyone tremble.

In the boundless void it was as if a pair of invisible eyes had opened, looking down upon the entire palace and scrutinizing every movement; under their gaze no one dared make the slightest rash act.

That aura rippled quickly across the palace and then vanished.

Many people collapsed to the ground in a sorry heap, sweat beading on their brows; even those experts at the Origin Returning Realm were suddenly weak-limbed and dazed.

"What is the Lady looking for?" someone asked.

"I don't know — perhaps someone did something in the palace that offended her?" another guessed.

The crowd murmured, puzzled and unable to make sense of it.

Everyone knew that aura belonged to Lady Chi Yue; only she could silence the palace with a single thought.

Yang Kai was also startled. He had not expected Chi Yue's reaction to be so swift; if not for the Stone Puppet's special constitution allowing it to perfectly blend with the surrounding earth, his avatar would have been exposed.

With such an uproar he dared not continue his operation near the storeroom and hurriedly withdrew his avatar.

In her bedchamber Chi Yue frowned, a puzzled expression upon her face, murmuring, "Strange — the storeroom arrays were triggered but nothing was discovered?"

She could not understand it.

No one could act wantonly on her turf, and nothing could escape her scrutiny; she thought perhaps the storeroom's arrays had fallen into disrepair, causing the recent anomaly.

At that thought, she no longer felt the urge to probe further. Instead, a faintly intrigued smile curved her lips as she murmured softly, “Still, Yu Xiong has gotten quite a bit smarter this time—he actually knows how to kill with a borrowed knife. I shall see just how capable that human truly is!”

She then sent her Divine Sense toward the pavilion where Xia Ningshang stayed to observe what was happening there.

In the pavilion, Yang Kai had just withdrawn the Golden Stone Puppet back into the Black Book Space when he suddenly felt as if something had noticed him; he glanced at some point in the void, brows knitting.

At that moment he felt watched, yet when his Divine Sense probed carefully there was nothing to be found.

Could the earlier incident have been exposed, causing Chi Yue to surveil him now?

Yang Kai's face darkened.

"Eh... this little fellow actually noticed something?" Chi Yue exclaimed in surprise.

With her formidable cultivation of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm she could have watched a Second Stage disciple of the Origin Returning Realm effortlessly and secretly, but Yang Kai's single glance into the void plainly showed he had already sensed her surveillance.

Yet that was as far as it went — he could not have truly detected her Divine Sense.

At present he could only harbor a suspicion; Chi Yue saw this from Yang Kai's expression.

That was rather interesting. Chi Yue's interest was suddenly piqued.

Yang Kai knitted his brow and sat motionless, inwardly feeling the matter prickly.

After a moment his expression smoothed. He pretended nothing had happened and closed his eyes to meditate.

Just then voices came from outside.

"Sorry, Young Masters, you can't come in — this is Master Xia's pill-refining place. The Lady has decreed that during the Master's pill refinement no one may disturb her!" a green-robed maid cried.

Yang Kai's expression shifted and he listened; the speaker seemed to be the same green-robed maid who had earlier delivered ingredients to Xia Ningshang, and she was now stopping someone from barging into the pavilion.

"I know this is Master Xia's place. That's why I came — if not, why would I be here? Step aside; I have matters to discuss with the Master!" a coarse, unfamiliar voice growled.

“Please, Young Masters, have some respect! The Lady has issued strict orders—this servant begs you not to make things difficult for me!” The green-robed maid pleaded earnestly while invoking Chi Yue’s name, trying both persuasion and firmness.

"Get out of the way!" the owner of the coarse voice snapped, anger flashing. "Don't use Lady Chi Yue's name as a shield to bully me. I'll go explain things to her myself. Who are you to block my path?"

“Little girl, you’d best step aside. This Young Master and Brother Xue Lian came here only to request Master Xia’s help in refining a pill. We mean her no harm. Brother Xue Lian has a bit of a temper—if he’s offended you in any way, this Young Master apologizes on his behalf,” another voice sounded.

Yang Kai sneered inwardly.

He recognized that voice — it belonged to the Evil-Eyed Young Master, Mi Tian!

Since entering the palace he had not seen Mi Tian again, but someone as proud as him would never let go of the affairs of Huiyue City. Shan Qingluo had warned Yang Kai to be cautious against any revenge from him.

This visit did not bode well.

But who was the other person? Mi Tian called him Xue Lian, which suggested the fellow had some standing; otherwise they would not be on such familiar terms.

Yang Kai was curious.

“Ask Master Xia to refine pills?” The green-robed maid paused, then quickly replied, “No — the Master is under the Lady’s protection. Without the Lady’s order, she may not refine pills for outsiders.”

"She's not allowed?" The yao expert called Xue Lian sneered. "Why not? A mere human maid — my asking her to refine pills is me doing her a favor. What business is it of hers? If she dares refuse, I'll consign her to a fate from which she can never recover."

The green-robed maid turned pale with fear; though intimidated by Xue Lian's savage aura, she steadfastly stood her ground to prevent him from rushing into the pavilion.

"I'll give you three breaths. If you don't step aside, prepare to die! Given my identity, killing a little maid won't bring blame from Lady Chi Yue — think carefully," Xue Lian said coldly, his gaze ferocious and his expression brutal.

"Miss, move aside — that delicate skin will mar if anything happens to you," Mi Tian still smiled smoothly, his eyes emanating a wicked charm.

At the touch of his gaze the green-robed maid's eyes dulled and grew distant; the struggle on her face melted into submission, a blush rising as she shyly bowed and stepped aside.

Xue Lian snorted and pushed the maid further away, then strode toward the pavilion.

Mi Tian followed him with a smiling air.

When the two were less than ten zhang from the pavilion, the pavilion door creaked open and Yang Kai stepped out, casually closing the door behind him. He turned and regarded Mi Tian and Xue Lian with a cold, indifferent gaze.

Xue Lian and Mi Tian halted at once; the former glanced Yang Kai up and down with disdain and curled his lip.

Mi Tian's eyes narrowed and a hateful, wary hate flickered in his wicked eyes.

He would never forget Yang Kai's terrifying display in the Red Moon Domain's city — a foe worthy of his respect.
