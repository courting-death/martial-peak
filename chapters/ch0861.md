## Chapter 861 — He Has Returned

Exchanging a glance, Li Rong and Han Fei transformed into two streaks of flowing light and shot off into the distance.

At the same time, in a certain corner of Mogu Castle, Hua Mo—who was instructing the two newly promoted commanders on entering the Saint Realm—suddenly rose to his feet, released his divine sense, and after sensing for a moment his aged face brightened with excitement as he cried out, "You two, follow me!"

Saying so, he hurriedly dashed outside.

The two new commanders bowed slightly and followed closely behind Hua Mo.

The entire Mogu Castle was swept by sudden commotion.

Members of the Ancient Demon Clan stationed at various points turned their gazes toward the direction of the anomaly; seeing several commanders mobilize together, they couldn’t help but whisper among themselves.

Every time Senior Coffin-Servant captured someone and brought them in, scenes like this would occur, so when they witnessed it now, they immediately realized that an outsider had entered this Small Xuan Realm.

The commanders were clearly going to deal with the matter.

But how powerful must this intruder be to have alarmed five commanders?

The Ancient Demon Clan’s people were full of suspicion, except for a girl named Guan'er, who clenched her fists excitedly and muttered, "He's back! He's back—we're saved!"

Apart from the few commanders who knew, only Guan'er fully understood the relationship between Yang Kai and the Great Demon God, so she could be certain that the one who had entered this Small Xuan Realm this time was none other than Yang Kai.

Besides him, Senior Coffin-Servant would not let anyone else into this place.

A few dozen li away, Yang Kai and Wu Jie descended along the red light; once they steadied their footing, Yang Kai immediately sensed several mighty auras rapidly approaching from this direction.

He smiled faintly, thinking that Li Rong and the others must have been anxiously waiting, hence their impatient charge.

What puzzled Yang Kai a little was that the newcomers included five Saint Realm cultivators, and both Li Rong and Han Fei seemed to have made noticeable improvements in strength.

These potent auras naturally did not escape Wu Jie’s perception; after confirming the newcomers’ cultivation levels, his expression changed: "Saint Lord—what is this place?"

"A Small Xuan Realm!" Yang Kai replied casually, then called to Wu Jie, "Come with me."

Wu Jie’s expression flickered but he asked no more, instead following Yang Kai step for step.

That this place turned out to be a Small Xuan Realm was something he could never have imagined. He clearly remembered being dragged into that Blood Coffin by Yang Kai.

Could the mystery behind the Coffin-Bearer’s Blood Coffin, which had troubled the world for countless years, actually be a Small Xuan Realm?

Moreover, the aura within this realm made him uneasy—there seemed to be many demonic folk active here, staining the world’s energies with traces of demonic qi.

The demonic qi on the five experts charging over was particularly obvious.

What on earth was the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land doing? Had he stepped into some grave trouble? Wu Jie felt deeply unsettled.

A moment later, the two dazzling figures leading the group descended from the sky and landed before Yang Kai.

"Master!" Li Rong hurriedly called out, her beautiful eyes flashing with an unfamiliar light as if she hadn’t expected Yang Kai to actually come.

Just a short while ago she had been complaining with Han Fei that Yang Kai seldom came by to check on them, yet unexpectedly he now stood before her.

"Han Fei pays respects to the Master!" Han Fei remained as cool as ever; while greeting Yang Kai, her eyes scrutinized Wu Jie.

Under her gaze, Wu Jie unexpectedly felt a thread of nervousness rise, the jade-green aura coiling around him wavering like a spirit snake as it inhaled and exhaled.

He subtly edged closer to Yang Kai, as if searching for a sense of security.

As they spoke, Hua Mo arrived with the two new commanders; upon seeing Yang Kai, he put on a tearful countenance: "Master, you’ve finally returned. I always knew you wouldn’t abandon our clan."

Yang Kai gave a soft laugh. "Commander Hua Mo, you flatter me. Since I promised to bring you all out, I will not go back on my word. Well, I’ve come this time."

Han Fei cast a glance at Hua Mo and gave a light snort, thinking to herself, And who was it again that kept droning in my ear every day about how our Lord probably wouldn’t be coming back?

"Oh? You’ve gained two more Saint Realm cultivators?" Yang Kai glanced over the two following Hua Mo; though somewhat familiar-looking, he didn’t know their names.

"We pay respects to the Master," the two promptly cupped their fists.

Li Rong pursed her lips and smiled: "Thanks to the supplies the Master left us, these two were able to reach their current achievements. This one is Commander Yinya, and this one is Commander Xueji."

After the introduction, Yang Kai managed to remember their names with some effort.

Han Fei’s pretty eyes changed as she looked at Yang Kai and murmured, "Master, your growth has been fast—how are you already at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm? Have you been away for many years?"

Hearing this, Li Rong and Hua Mo recalled to check Yang Kai’s cultivation; in an instant they were stunned and overjoyed.

"Not long—about five or six years," Yang Kai calculated and replied. "Well, there isn’t time to chat. We’ll talk as we go."

Seeing his grave expression, Li Rong and the others fell silent and their faces turned serious, sensing that something might be amiss.

While moving toward Mogu Castle, Li Rong glanced at Wu Jie and leaned toward Yang Kai to ask softly, "Master, who is this person?"

Yang Kai replied casually, "A friend from outside—ask him about the specifics later. I came this time to refine pills."

"Refine pills?" Li Rong exclaimed, "Could it be—"

"Yes. Someone is searching for Senior Coffin-Servant, and others are hunting me, so I must get you out quickly or things will get troublesome."

"Who dares do such a thing?" Li Rong’s aura suddenly shifted, turning exceedingly grim.

"A demon general named Xueli!" Yang Kai frowned. "Long ago she seemingly obtained some Demon God Golden Blood by accident and has since fixed her eyes on my blood."

"A demon general?" Han Fei raised an eyebrow. "Then I’d like to see for myself—let’s see what level today’s demon generals have reached!"

"There will be a chance," Yang Kai said with a look at her and a faint laugh.

As they walked side by side, Wu Jie—whether intentionally or not—hung back to quietly observe the terrain and the cultivation of the five ahead; the more he looked, the more alarmed he became.

He couldn’t tell what place this was, but all five were in the Saint Realm; the most formidable of them, the beautiful woman, seemed to be only at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm. The pressure she exuded when she took offense just now was in no way inferior to the pressure Xueli had once brought upon him.

Wu Jie even suspected that this woman might not be inferior to Xueli at all.

The other four were all First Stage Saint Realm cultivators; the second beautiful woman and the old man appeared to have reached the limit of First Stage—both their internal strength and aura were far more refined than his.

If he had to fight any of them, Wu Jie reckoned his only option would be to flee.

The remaining two had probably only just broken through; this had been confirmed by Yang Kai’s earlier conversation with them.

Yet it was precisely these two recently advanced Saint Realm experts that made Wu Jie feel inferior—he could inexplicably sense pressure emanating from them.

Who exactly were these people that felt so strange?

Their manner of addressing Yang Kai also piqued Wu Jie’s attention.

Full of questions in his heart, Wu Jie knew silence was prudent and followed the group without a word.

Before long, the party returned to Mogu Castle.

From afar, Yang Kai saw many Ancient Demon Clan members standing before the castle, peering in this direction.

Among them a girl waved excitedly and shouted, "Yang Kai! Yang Kai!"

Turning toward her voice, Yang Kai smiled faintly and raised a hand in greeting.

This girl, Guan'er, had been the one to care for him since he was first captured; she was also Li Rong’s personal maid.

"This little wench is too presumptuous!" Li Rong bit her teeth and scolded, then told Yang Kai, "Master, don’t mind her. I’ll teach her a lesson when we return so she remembers her place."

Yang Kai forced a wry smile. "No need for that, and you can all be more relaxed—don’t keep calling me ‘Master’ every other word; it makes me uncomfortable."

"Then what should we call you?" Li Rong asked, surprised.

"How did you call me at first?"

The three old commanders looked at each other and, recalling, couldn’t help but blush.

When Yang Kai was first captured, they had addressed him as a human brat, despicable human, stinking kid, and the like…

Who would dare speak so now?

Upon entering Mogu Castle, Guan'er dashed over, first saluted the commanders, then followed Yang Kai excitedly, chattering nonstop.

It was as if she had been speechless since Yang Kai left.

Li Rong smiled and shook her head; seeing Yang Kai showed no displeasure, she refrained from scolding Guan'er.

After chatting for a while, Li Rong suddenly turned to Wu Jie and asked, "Who is this strange fellow who’s neither human nor ghost—why did you bring him in?"

Wu Jie’s face darkened.

Yang Kai shook his head without answering, instead looking at Li Rong: "I need to use the underground chamber for at most two or three days. Ask Wu Jie about the situation outside—he can explain it to you."

"Alright." Li Rong and the others nodded solemnly.

"Saint Lord…" Wu Jie hurried forward and pulled Yang Kai to one side, looking thoroughly uneasy. In a low voice he said, "I, Wu Jie, am here… there won't be any danger, will there?"

Yang Kai laughed in surprise, "No, don’t worry."

"But I feel these people are demonic folk," Wu Jie said, puzzled.

"They are demonic folk—and not ordinary ones at that!" Yang Kai chuckled and patted Wu Jie’s shoulder. "That’s that. I have little time; I’ll go attend to things—do as you please."

Saying this, Yang Kai left.

Wu Jie shook his head helplessly.

Li Rong and the others stayed where they were, not following Yang Kai; remembering what he had said, they watched with eager anticipation.

Two or three days—only two or three days—and the prison that had confined the Ancient Demon Clan for countless years could be broken; the clan would once more set foot upon the long-desired earth and gaze upon the sun, moon, stars, and all the wonders of the world.
