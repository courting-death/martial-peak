## Chapter 1688 — Many

After things inside the Sect had settled, Yang Kai began attending to other matters.

The first thing to do was, of course, to heal Ye Xijun and the others; the original Lingxiao Sect contingent did not include only Ye Xijun as an injured party—nine out of ten of the Origin Returning Realm experts had wounds both light and severe.

These wounds were all sustained in battles against experts of the Corpse Spirit Sect. Injuries tainted by Corpse Qi were notoriously difficult to heal — that sinister and corrosive energy disrupted the flow of Saint Yuan within Lingxiao Sect’s experts, hindering their recovery.

Only a specialized antidotal Spiritual Pill could work.

Previously their injuries could not be cured, so they had to suppress them with their powerful cultivation and then use Saint Yuan to slowly dissolve the toxins—a very lengthy process.

But after Yang Kai returned, everything changed.

He and Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang joined forces to specially concoct a pill that removed corpse poison; every injured person took one, and in an instant the calamity of the corpse poison was dismantled.

With the corpse poison no longer rampaging, given their own cultivation it was not hard for them to recover, and moreover Yang Kai had refined large quantities of miraculous Spiritual Pills for them to take.

So in roughly ten days the problems that had plagued the Lingxiao Sect’s experts for countless days were solved, and the sect’s high-end combat strength was renewed.

In this matter, because of Ye Xijun’s wise decision there were no personnel losses for the Lingxiao Sect, and before she left she also took away some of the sect’s valuable treasures, including Red Candle Fruit, Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree—basically, except for the headquarters being seized by others, the Lingxiao Sect suffered little else.

After Ye Xijun returned, the Red Candle Fruit, Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, and Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree were once again placed in their designated spots.

The first was the key ingredient for refining the Void King Pill, while the latter two were tremendous aids for cultivators seeking breakthroughs. Together, they held immeasurable importance and value for the entire Sect.

After more than ten days, the Lingxiao Sect was completely stable.

In the council hall, Yang Kai summoned all the Lingxiao Sect elders and high-ranking members.

No one knew what he intended, but they all gathered on time to listen to his speech.

Yang Kai didn’t really have much to say — he simply thanked the Elders for their years of silent dedication, then spoke a few words envisioning Lingxiao Sect’s bright future. It was all rather perfunctory talk, nothing of real weight.

At the end, Yang Kai suddenly smiled mysteriously and, looking at the crowd, said, “On this trip I brought you some good things. Although these items might not exert their greatest effect on Dark Star, they will surely allow you to glimpse the barrier of the Void King Realm. I believe that with enough accumulation, once freed from Dark Star’s suppression of heaven-and-earth laws in the future, you can smoothly ascend to the Void King Realm!”

At once the hall fell silent. Everyone stared at Yang Kai, dumbfounded, as if unable to digest what he had announced.

Even Ye Xijun was stunned, looking at Yang Kai with curiosity, not knowing exactly what he meant.

The Void King Realm has always been a legend on Dark Star, a barrier even Ye Xijun could not break through. Although she had chosen to remain on Dark Star instead of following Yang Kai away, that did not mean she lacked desire for that realm.

On the contrary, her desire for the Void King Realm was stronger than anyone’s, because she already possessed the qualification to ascend to Void King-Grade—her Shi has already reached perfection!

She had chosen to stay only to guard Yang Yan, so the Sect would not be left without someone in charge and suffer accidents.

Hearing Yang Kai now, she naturally paid great attention.

“Sect Master, what exactly is this wondrous thing?” Gong Aofu asked with a smile.

Although she had only recently joined the Lingxiao Sect as an elder, she integrated quickly, and she was not truly a wicked person; in less than half a month she had already won the recognition of the original Lingxiao Sect elder group.

So in such a council she had some right to speak.

The others also looked at Yang Kai with curiosity, eager for his explanation.

“This!” Yang Kai wasted no time and reached into the void, pulling out something like a crystalline stone.

The moment the crystal appeared, a soft, mysterious power permeated the hall. All the Origin Returning Realm experts’ expressions changed; they showed suspicion and puzzlement. Though they could not discern the true nature of this power, they sensed it was a higher, more profound, more mysterious version of the Shi field—an upgraded form, it seemed.

“Domain Stone!” Yang Xiuzhu, quick-eyed and quick-tongued, called out and revealed the origin of the crystal.

Chu Hanyi and Lin Yurao recognized it too and both exclaimed, joy lighting their faces.

“What is a Domain Stone?” Ye Xijun asked, her brows slightly furrowed. Among those present her cultivation was the deepest and she naturally perceived the indescribable wonder stored within the crystal. From a slight sensation she felt as if her soul had been cleansed; one could imagine what benefits a long-term practice with this crystal would bring.

Yang Kai smiled at Yang Xiuzhu, signaling him to explain.

Yang Xiuzhu did not shirk and promptly explained the origin and function of the Domain Stone.

Upon hearing that such things were formed when a Void King Realm expert fell and a Domain Field condensed into a treasure, everyone's eyes gleamed.

And hearing that by sensing the wonders within a Domain Stone one could glimpse the power of Domain, the elders in the hall all breathed heavily and stared fixedly at the Domain Stone in Yang Kai’s hand, like a pack of lechers who had seen a woman stripped naked.

In everyone’s eyes there flickered naked desire.

“Domain Stones are rare products from the Blood Prison, and only the Blood Prison of Cuiwei Star produces them. Each is worth a fortune. Although I entered the Blood Prison, I had no luck with such treasures; Elder Lin was fortunate enough to obtain one,” Yang Xiuzhu said with envy toward Lin Yurao.

Lin Yurao laughed and took a Domain Stone from her Spatial Ring, lightly shaking it.

Chu Hanyi watched enviously from the side.

When they first ventured into the Blood Prison the three of them separated. Though their powerful cultivation spared them great calamity, they did not gain much; by contrast Qian Tong had advanced ahead of them and upon leaving the Blood Prison had broken his own barrier and ascended to the Void King Realm.

If one could have a Domain Stone, one could recklessly comprehend the power of Domain; this was an irresistible attraction to any Origin Returning Realm expert.

“Elder Lin truly has luck!” Chang Qi murmured beside them.

By contrast, people like Chang Qi, Hao An, Ning Xiangchen, and Huang Juan didn’t seem to care much. After all, their cultivations were only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — even if they obtained a Domain Stone, their current strength wouldn’t allow them to comprehend the true power of the Domain any time soon. At best, the Domain Stone could help them refine and strengthen their Shi.

After all, Domain is the evolutionary upgrade of the Shi; studying the mysteries inside a Domain Stone is very helpful to Shi cultivation.

That said, this does not diminish the Domain Stone’s effect on Origin Returning Realm experts!

After a long silence Ye Xijun suddenly spoke, “Sect Master, if convenient, I would like ten Domain Stones.”

A collective intake of breath was heard; Yang Xiuzhu and the others turned to stare at Ye Xijun with incredulous looks.

Others might not know how precious Domain Stones were, but Yang Xiuzhu and the others knew all too well. The three of them had gone into the Blood Prison and only Lin Yurao had the luck to obtain one; yet Ye Xijun now asked for ten at once.

That was simply asking for the lion’s share!

It did not match the demeanor expected of a Great Elder!

Is she still the respected and beloved Great Elder? How could she look no different from a street ruffian?

Yang Xiuzhu and the others were taken aback.

Ye Xijun lightly hummed, “Do you think the Sect Master has only this one? Given his nature, if he had not gained much, would he openly display it in public? He is not a child who enjoys showing off.”

Once she said that, Yang Xiuzhu and the others came to their senses and all turned toward Yang Kai with burning eyes, full of expectation.

Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, “Great Elder, you know human nature well; I cannot hide it from you.”

“Sect Master…” Yang Xiuzhu swallowed and felt his lips go dry.

“Indeed! On that trip into the Blood Prison I did acquire a number of Domain Stones… yes, many!” Yang Kai did not hide it, stood, and smiled at everyone.

“Many…how many?” Chu Hanyi asked in a trembling voice.

“Enough to give each of you ten!” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Hiss…” Yang Xiuzhu and the others gasped, looking at Yang Kai with almost worshipful eyes.

There were not many people in the hall, only about fifteen, including the recently joined elders Gong Aofu and Daiyuan.

Gong Aofu knew Yang Kai did not favor Yin Sudie and paid special attention to Daiyuan, so she had lately courted favor and kept Daiyuan by her side. As for Yin Sudie, she seemed to have fallen out of favor and had no right to be present.

“Hmm… it seems I underestimated the Sect Master’s ability; I asked for too few,” Ye Xijun said, her brows knitting slightly with a hint of annoyance.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, “If the Great Elder wants more, I will of course supply them, but given your cultivation and comprehension of the Shi, I think two or three would already be more than enough for you; more would be useless.”

“Even if I can’t use them, I could always keep them for others,” Ye Xijun said lightly. “But never mind—ten it is.”

Yang Kai said no more; with a wave of his hand ten Domain Stones flew toward Ye Xijun.

She made no visible movement; the Spatial Ring on her hand flashed and the Domain Stones were stored away.

It displayed the bearing of a true master.

“Sect Master…” Yang Xiuzhu blushed, rubbing his hands together as he looked at Yang Kai pleadingly.

He was not the kind to flatter or curry favor; when he had been at Star Emperor Mountain he had been upright and stern. After entering the Lingxiao Sect he remained so, but this time he would lower his pride.

As a Third Stage Origin Returning Realm expert, he valued Domain Stones more than others. Although he had not ascended to the Void King Realm this time, with a Domain Stone in hand to comprehend Domain power, the next time he left Dark Star he would have every confidence of rising.

And as the Lingxiao Sect now also had the capability to voyage afar, he believed Yang Kai would take them away from Dark Star again!
