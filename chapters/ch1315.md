## Chapter 1315 — Ransom

Qian Yue could become an elder of the Ice Sect and had even reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm on the Tongxuan Continent; naturally she was quick-witted. After hearing everything, how could she not see all the twists and turns?

After a moment of thought she said, "If that's the case, then your coming here truly had a reason. But that Wang Yuhan is indeed scheming — his plan links together perfectly, watertight. He must not be underestimated."

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said slowly, "If he set this up to smear me so Shen Shitao would look down on me, then fine. But if he harbors other malice, heh..."

He had guessed some of Wang Yuhan's intentions, yet had no notion of leaving; he originally stayed to stir up trouble and force Wang Yuhan's true purpose out. Unexpectedly seeing Qian Yue here, he naturally seized the chance and came to this Ice-Snow Pavilion.

"You're still so lawless." Qian Yue stared, momentarily dazed — the scene before her so resembled the time he had charged into the Ice Sect alone and caused a commotion. Whether then or now, Yang Kai's power was not top-tier, yet he dared what ordinary people would not. After thinking a moment she said, "But since you dare act like this, you must have some backing; I won't try to persuade you, but be extremely careful. I would hate to meet an old acquaintance here only to have to collect his corpse."

"Don't worry—if I can't win, I'll run." Yang Kai grinned. "But you must first tell me, what's the background of this Hehuan House?"

"Background?" Qian Yue frowned. "I don't know the specifics. Since I came here I haven't had much contact with outsiders, but I overhear the maids sometimes. I know that three Origin Returning Realm sit in guard here, and this Hehuan House seems to be a hidden enterprise of a sect called Quehe Sect, with the backing of the city lord."

"Quehe Sect?" Yang Kai blinked. He had the feeling he'd once crossed paths with disciples from that sect, but when he tried to recall he couldn't.

Since he couldn't remember, it probably wasn't important. Yang Kai didn't dwell on it; he stroked his chin and mused, "Three Origin Returning Realm on guard — the defenses are indeed strict."

Seeing the odd light flicker in his eyes, Qian Yue's expression changed and she snapped, "What are you scheming?"

Yang Kai waved a hand and smiled, "Not what you think. I bear no grudge with this place and wouldn't do anything untoward here. I only want to take you away."

"Take me away?" Qian Yue brightened, then quickly dimmed and forced a bitter smile. "To take me away—that's easier said than done."

"What's difficult about it?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"There are difficulties, of course—neither huge nor trivial. Since you could come to the Ice-Snow Pavilion you must have spent a great deal of Saint Crystal. I don't know where your Saint Crystals came from, but to spend that sum in a single night's pleasure is already astronomical. To take me away would require a price perhaps ten times that. Do you have that many Saint Crystals?" Clearly, in her eyes Yang Kai couldn't possibly pay such a sum; even the cost of a single night here was, to Qian Yue, an astronomical figure.

Yang Kai laughed happily, confident: "Don't worry about that, I can scrape together some Saint Crystals."

"Some Saint Crystals..." Qian Yue covered her red lips and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, as if seeing him anew; she could not have imagined he possessed such wealth.

“I just don’t know if Hehuan House will be willing to let you go. By reasoning, a woman like you — after entertaining an important guest once and losing her primal yin — shouldn’t hold much value to them anymore.” As Yang Kai spoke, he suddenly showed a hint of embarrassment and added, “My words may have been a bit offensive, Elder Qian Yue, please don’t take them to heart.”

A flush crossed Qian Yue's lovely face, lending a touch of coquettish charm, but she quickly regained composure and said slowly, "It's nothing; what you say is true. But do you think the people of Hehuan House wouldn't know whether I lost my Yuan Yin? If I am still intact, redeeming me will be much harder."

Yang Kai frowned, "That's true; I'm just afraid Hehuan House will jack up the price. But no matter, there's no deal that cannot be struck if one can pay. We're both from the Tongxuan Continent—it's fate we met here—and in any case I won't let you remain."

Qian Yue showed a trace of gratitude and said no more, though inwardly she grew hopeful. If she could leave, why would she still linger? Yang Kai's arrival finally offered a sliver of hope; miss this chance and she might spend her life here as a kept woman.

Yang Kai then asked more about Hehuan House's particulars; Qian Yue told him all she knew, but there were many things she didn't understand and could not help him with.

An hour later Qian Yue summoned a maid. After giving her instructions the maid glanced at Yang Kai in surprise, her expression complex, and then departed.

After about a cup of tea's time, the married woman who had dealt with Yang Kai earlier appeared on the balcony, smiling as she appraised him; a strange light shone in her beautiful eyes—she had clearly heard something from the maid.

Qian Yue personally served the tea and then stood by Yang Kai's side, a hint of nervousness showing.

The married woman sipped a few mouthfuls, then leisurely parted her red lips and said with scented breath, "I hear the young master intends to redeem Yue'er and restore her to freedom?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded plainly. "I'm very pleased with Yue'er, so I want to take her away. Will your house agree to release her?"

The woman chuckled, glanced at Qian Yue with surprise, and said, "If I'm not mistaken, Yue'er's Yuan Yin appears unpicked. Young master did not consummate—if you didn't take that pleasure, why must you take Yue'er?"

Yang Kai frowned, "I have my reasons. Does your house need to pry into them?"

"Pardon me, young master. It's just that Hehuan House rarely has girls redeemed; I must be cautious."

Yang Kai showed a trace of embarrassment and thought for a while before saying, "Then I should give your house an explanation. Indeed, Yue'er and I are innocent. What I want is her ice-attributed cultivation method; it would help my own cultivation."

"Ice-attributed method?" The woman was puzzled. "There are countless practitioners who cultivate that attribute; why only Yue'er?" Her eyes probed Yang Kai as if wishing to see into his heart.

Yang Kai gave a light laugh: "There may be many who cultivate that attribute, but few with whom I resonate. If I say I fell for Yue'er at first sight, would you believe me?"

The woman couldn't help but laugh, while Qian Yue at Yang Kai's side blushed a delicate red, appearing shy and charming.

"You seem not to believe, but it's the truth; I have nothing to hide." Yang Kai didn't argue—he stated this reason plainly.

The woman's brows knit and she rose slowly, coming to Qian Yue's side and affectionately taking her arm. Smiling brightly, she said to Yang Kai, "Please do not be offended, young master. It's not that I'm merely cautious; Yue'er was raised by our Hehuan House from childhood at great expense, and I am like a sister to her. I cannot bear to let her go; I want her to stay and keep me company."

"Raised from childhood, like sisters..." Yang Kai gave a half-smile; the woman's smile did not waver as she met his gaze.

If Yang Kai had not already known Qian Yue's background, he might have been fooled—this woman's talent for shameless lies was not small.

Suddenly Yang Kai's expression turned serious and he waved his hand: "State your price. Since you did not flatly refuse, there is room for negotiation. Name a figure and I'll see if I can meet it—we can talk. After all, it's just a transaction."

The woman curled her mouth and returned to her seat, saying calmly, "Since you speak plainly, I won't beat around the bush. We do have precedents of girls being redeemed, but never a Saint King Realm girl. You would be setting a precedent; if you insist, the price will not be small."

"Tell me." Yang Kai looked at her indifferently.

The woman frowned slightly, glanced at Qian Yue and said, "If Yue'er had already lost her Yuan Yin that would be different. As she stands intact now, the price would be much higher."

"Are you sure?" Yang Kai sneered. "I have already paid the Saint Crystals for tonight; by rights Yue'er's Yuan Yin should belong to me. Will you haggle over that?"

"That's true," the woman smiled coyly. "But you did not take Yue'er's Yuan Yin, correct? That's another matter. If you have second thoughts, you could consummate with Yue'er now—I wouldn't stop you. Afterward, we can discuss this business."

She spoke as if certain Yang Kai would not actually do such a thing, her demeanor calm and composed.

Yang Kai's face suddenly grew cold, and Qian Yue's expression was no better; anyone treated like merchandise and bargained over, especially concerning their chastity, would be furious.
