## Chapter 2183 — Origin Qi Contest

“Glad you understand, Brother Zhuang!” Yang Kai laughed heartily when he saw how agreeable he was.

“No need to say anything else, Brother Yang, come and fight!” Zhuang Bufan’s expression suddenly turned serious as he spoke.

“Huh?” Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then cried out, “So I explained for nothing just now… Brother Zhuang, did you not understand?”

Zhuang Bufan shook his head, “I’ve seen through everything. This fight isn’t to vent for Junior Brother or Junior Sister, nor is it about grudges. It’s only for that Spiritual Medicine!”

As he spoke, he had already activated his Origin Qi. His clothes fluttered without wind, his black hair flew, and his entire aura climbed higher and higher.

He continued, “Although Brother Yang found this Spiritual Medicine first and has been guarding it, since it hasn’t been picked, it’s ownerless. I don’t want to miss such a treasure either, so… we must fight!”

Yang Kai stared at him for a long while before giving a bitter smile, “Though I don’t want to admit it, Brother Zhuang, you really are an upright person. You state your intentions openly, much better than those who talk righteously but are full of schemes. I admire that. But I still have to ask, must we fight? Is there no other way?”

“If Brother Yang feels he can’t win, you can leave now! I don’t want to bully the weak either,” Zhuang Bufan replied with a frown.

“Alright!” Yang Kai sighed helplessly, “If that’s how it is, I have nothing more to say!”

At that, Yang Kai’s body shook, and his Origin Qi surged out like a vast sea. The wave of energy swept out like a storm, raging in all directions.

Zhuang Bufan’s eyes narrowed, and he shouted in a low voice, “Brother Yang truly is extraordinary. My Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters lost to you for a good reason!”

“Haha, be careful, Brother Zhuang! Don’t trip in the same place twice!” Yang Kai laughed as he charged forward, his fist wrapped in dazzling energy, as if to shatter the heavens, coming down on Zhuang Bufan’s head like a mountain.

“All of you, step back! No one is allowed to interfere!” Zhuang Bufan shouted. He turned his palm upward, where wind and clouds swirled, forming a tide of energy that struck back at Yang Kai. At the same time, he chanted, “Flying Cloud Palm, Command the Four Extremes!”

The visible energy burst from his palm, transforming into a Jiao, which whipped its head and tail, soaring into the sky and swallowing Yang Kai whole.

“Hm?” Zhuang Bufan showed no joy at his success, but instead revealed a strange expression.

Because he found that, under this move, Yang Kai didn’t dodge, but instead endured the attack head-on, falling toward him even faster.

“Brother Zhuang!” Yang Kai’s shout rang out, his voice drifting amidst the raging energies. “I must end this quickly! After all, you have only me as your opponent, but I have many enemies waiting. I don’t have the time or strength to tangle with you for long!”

As he spoke, he had already rushed up to Zhuang Bufan, turning his fist into a palm and pressing it directly against Zhuang Bufan’s palm.

Boom…

The instant their palms met, a massive burst of energy exploded, and visible halos swept out in all directions.

Zhuang Bufan was struck as if by lightning, his body sinking sharply. The ground beneath his feet caved in, forming a huge pit with countless cracks.

“Origin Qi contest?” Zhuang Bufan’s face changed dramatically, instantly realizing Yang Kai’s intent.

This opponent, only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, had abandoned any chance to use Secret Techniques or Secret Treasures, choosing a fierce, direct fight that forced him to compete in pure Origin Qi!

Admittedly, this way would decide the winner in a very short time, since no one could dodge or retreat. The one with the stronger Origin Qi would win quickly!

Was he really that confident? Competing in Origin Qi with just First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation?

Thoughts flashed through Zhuang Bufan’s mind, and a trace of anger appeared on his face at being underestimated. While keeping his palm pressed against Yang Kai’s, he spun his body and brought up his other hand, shouting, “Reverse Heaven and Earth!”

Though Zhuang Bufan was the top Dao Origin Realm expert of Wuhua Hall, he was different from Xia Sheng and Wuchang in one key way.

Although it hadn’t been proven, all disciples and elders of the great sects suspected Xia Sheng had a special constitution, but only the high-ranking members of Qingyang Shrine knew exactly what it was.

As for Wuchang, his bizarre Yin-Yang Twin Body made him much stronger than others of the same rank from birth.

But as the pillar of his sect’s Dao Origin Realm, Zhuang Bufan didn’t have such advantages!

His constitution was very ordinary, just talented, but he could still stand shoulder to shoulder with Xia Sheng and Wuchang, even having fought Wuchang several times without falling behind.

What allowed him to do this was his solid foundation and powerful Origin Qi!

He was the type to train diligently and work hard, making up for his innate shortcomings with effort, catching up to Xia Sheng and Wuchang!

Hall Master Lei Gu of Wuhua Hall once said, if Zhuang Bufan had the same constitution as Wuchang or Xia Sheng, his achievements would be far greater than they are now.

The words of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert carried great weight, and this also reflected Zhuang Bufan’s dedication to cultivation.

What Zhuang Bufan took the most pride in was his own pure and mighty Origin Qi! His Origin Qi, just like his very being, stood tall at the edge of an abyss, as steady and immovable as a mountain.

He felt this was his greatest asset, the foundation that let him stand alongside Xia Sheng and Wuchang!

And now, someone wanted to compete with him in what he was best at, and that person was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Even with his good temper, Zhuang Bufan was now truly angry. Without hesitation, he used his strongest technique, Heaven-Reversing Phantom Nether Art!

He thought, "Since you want to compete, I’ll grant your wish! And I’ll meet you with my full strength."

The moment his second palm reached out, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

Because what he saw wasn’t a palm, but a vast ocean, a bottomless abyss… rushing toward him, trying to swallow and tear him apart!

He shouted, and his body seemed to swell in that instant, explosive sounds coming from within…

With the sound, the pure Golden Blood stored in his body burst out in over ten droplets, all turning into pure Origin Qi that filled his limbs. His whole body shone with dazzling gold light.

Whoosh whoosh…

The wild wind howled like blades cutting through the air.

The martial artists from Wuhua Hall who had followed Zhuang Bufan here were all stunned…

In their eyes, Yang Kai and Zhuang Bufan pressed their palms together, one hanging upside down, one standing still, staring at each other, sparks flying between their gazes.

The place where they stood had become the source of the energy tide, golden and white light blooming and merging, clashing endlessly.

Time seemed to stand still at that moment…

“He can actually compete with Senior Brother Zhuang in Origin Qi?”

“Is this guy really First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Maybe he’s a Third Stage pretending to be weak?”

“He’s just showing off for a moment. Senior Brother Zhuang will deal with him soon!”

The Wuhua Hall group watched in awe, still muttering to themselves.

But things didn’t go as they expected. Zhuang Bufan didn’t push Yang Kai back quickly. The two kept their stance, pushing their Origin Qi against each other with all their might.

As time passed, Zhuang Bufan’s expression grew more serious, and Yang Kai’s eyes became more wild and fierce.

Only now did Zhuang Bufan suddenly realize that all of Yang Kai’s earlier explanations weren’t out of fear, but because he truly didn’t want to fight him.

As he said, Zhuang Bufan only had one enemy—Yang Kai. But Yang Kai had many. As long as he wanted to protect the unripe Spiritual Medicine, he’d have to face all the experts who came here, including Wuchang, Xiao Chen, and Lan Xun…

That was why Yang Kai chose to compete in Origin Qi to decide the winner quickly!

This method left no room for tricks. All secret techniques and Secret Treasures were useless. The only thing to rely on was confidence and cultivated strength!

Staring into those wild eyes so close, Zhuang Bufan knew that, in a sense, he had already lost!

Because the person competing with him in Origin Qi was two Stages lower than him!

If he suppressed his strength to match Yang Kai’s level, the fight would be over before it began!

There are monsters like this in the world… Zhuang Bufan was shaken to his core.

At a certain moment, the delicate balance was suddenly broken. The gold and white lights that filled the world abruptly shifted in strength. Under the watchful eyes of the Wuhua Hall disciples, the golden radiance actually began to press down, suppressing the white light bit by bit!

“How is that possible?”

“Senior Brother Zhuang is being suppressed?”

“Where did this kid come from?”

“No way, Senior Brother Zhuang must be holding back. He’s always been righteous. Yes, that must be it!”

Even seeing it with their own eyes, they couldn’t believe Zhuang Bufan was losing in an Origin Qi contest. The shock stirred up waves in their hearts, leaving them unable to recover for a long time.

Still, none of them tried to help, just watched from afar.

First, in this kind of contest, outsiders couldn’t help at all. If they interfered, it would only hurt both sides. Second, Zhuang Bufan had told them to step aside and not interfere.

The words of the Senior Brother always carried authority; no one dared disobey.

“Brother Zhuang, give up!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came, and with his words, the dazzling gold light grew even stronger, suppressing Zhuang Bufan’s white light even more. He said in a deep voice, “If you don’t stop, you’ll get hurt!”
