## Chapter 1943 — Mysterious Transmission

Time passed in the blink of an eye; ten days had gone by. Yang Kai woke from his meditation and silently checked the condition of his body, shaking his head with some dissatisfaction.

Too slow — the pace at which his internal power was converting left him displeased.

Among cultivators of the same Void King Realm, the more and purer the Origin Qi within one's body, the greater the strength one could wield.

At present, only a little over one fifth of his Saint Yuan had been transformed into Origin Qi; at this rate it would take at least one to two years to complete the conversion of his internal power.

When he opened his eyes, the three prisoners in the cell all put on ingratiating smiles, though none dared to speak.

Yang Kai's ferocity and prowess had sunk into their bones; in a place like this it would be effortless for him to take their lives, and with life and death not under their control, who would dare not flatter him?

Even Liu Qianyun had been fawned over by those three men these past few days.

Although Yang Kai despised these cowards who preyed on the weak, he had still gleaned some information from them in casual conversation.

About the Biyu Sect, about the Star Realm — various pieces of news, no end to them.

As Yang Kai had suspected, the Biyu Sect was hardly a reputable sect, but neither was it an evil one; its disciples simply acted with reckless impunity. Nearby there was a Cuiri Pavilion, which frequently clashed with the Biyu Sect—grievances between them were constant, and their strengths were roughly on par.

Beyond the Biyu Sect, the Star Realm was divided into Four Great Territories—Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern—each covering boundless territory; even a Dao Origin Realm expert, devoting an entire life of effort, might not be able to cross a single Great Territory, which showed how vast the Star Realm truly was.

Each territory was further divided into countless prefectures, and the Biyu Sect was a sect in Qizhou of the Star Realm's Southern Territory.

Qizhou spanned an area of eighty million li, and in the entire Southern Territory it ranked far from prominent—whether by number of experts, overall strength, or size.

Places like Qizhou contained countless sects similar to the Biyu Sect.

The information he had gathered made Yang Kai feel the grandeur of the Star Realm; it was absolutely far vaster than the Star Domain. The fragments the three men spoke unfolded before him like an epic painting, filling him with longing for the wider heavens.

Yet those three were not major figures—only First Stage cultivators of the Void King Realm. They themselves had never left Qizhou, so they could not clearly describe the situation beyond.

Even so, the intelligence was enough for Yang Kai to ponder for a long while.

At that moment he frowned, inspecting the changes in his internal power.

Suddenly, Yang Kai shot his head up and knit his brows.

“Heh heh heh… boy, you truly are unusual—you can perceive my Divine Sense!” a voice suddenly sounded by Yang Kai's ear, insubstantial and without a trace, impossible to grasp.

Yang Kai remained calm, glancing around; he could detect no flaw among the prisoners in the nearby cells.

“No need to look—I'm confined in the innermost layer; you cannot see me,” the voice sounded again.

Having been confined here for over ten days, Yang Kai knew that the more formidable a cultivator was, the deeper they were locked away. The owner of the sudden voice claimed to be imprisoned in the deepest part; clearly his strength could not be low—likely a Dao Origin Realm existence—otherwise he could not have hidden himself and transmitted sound to him with Divine Sense.

Yang Kai considered briefly and asked, “Who are you, senior? Do you require my help?”

"Of course I have business with you — and it's a good thing." The voice chuckled, a sound that left a slight chill. "Ever since you came in and killed Zong Qi, I've been keeping an eye on you. If I am not mistaken, you've been cultivating a most profound body-refinement art, haven't you?"

“What if I did?” Yang Kai frowned but did not deny it; since someone had been observing him, his physical condition would be difficult to conceal.

“If so, I wish to ask a favor of you.”

“Speak plainly.”

“Get me out!” the owner of the voice said.

Yang Kai couldn't help but sneer: “You jest, senior. I'm only a lowly prisoner here—what ability do I have to get you out?”

“If I say so, I have a method,” the man snorted coldly. “I can transmit to you a secret technique that will let you undo the seals within your body and restore your strength. With your skill, once your power is restored, no one in this Bone Prison will be able to stop you; freeing me will be effortless.”

At those words Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

The man went on, “You surely do not want your fate held in another's hands; my secret technique will absolutely help you remove the seals!”

His tone was low but carried an irresistible force. Yang Kai nearly blurted out an agreement, but in the next moment he was startled—this man had certainly used some method to influence his thoughts, and he snorted coldly, “Senior, using such tricks on me is somewhat improper, is it not?”

The voice laughed heartily: “You're sharp, boy—I'll admit my fault. How about I apologize?”

He actually apologized readily, leaving Yang Kai momentarily speechless.

After a short silence, Yang Kai said, “If you truly have a technique to restore strength, why don't you use it yourself? Why ask me?”

The voice replied, “If I could use it myself, would I need you? Not only has my strength been sealed, those bastards have shackled my joints with chains forged from Yanling Gold, rendering me unable to use any technique. And even if I did restore my strength, with these Yanling Gold chains here, I wouldn’t be able to rouse the slightest shred of power!”

“I see!” Yang Kai showed a look of sudden understanding.

Although he had never heard of Yanling Gold, from the man's words Yang Kai could judge that the stuff must be the nemesis of Origin Qi—otherwise a Dao Origin Realm expert could not be imprisoned here and unable to escape.

“One more question: among so many cultivators in this Bone Prison, why did you single me out? With your perception it's not hard to see I'm not powerful, right?” Yang Kai asked cautiously.

“I know your level,” the man said. “There are many here stronger than you. But… Yanling Gold is not affected by Origin Qi; only brute force can destroy it. I think you are suitable.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally understood why the man had asked at the start whether he had cultivated some high-level body-refinement art—because of the presence of Yanling Gold.

Yang Kai's mind began to stir with possibilities.

Although he did not know who he was speaking with or how strong the man truly was, being imprisoned here left his fate uncertain; if Protector Bian issued an order to kill him, Yan Xiuran would likely be only too happy to send him off.

If he could obtain the secret technique to lift the seals from this man, he would still have a fighting chance and would not be laid out on the chopping block like fish.

Whether he would rescue the speaker in turn would depend on his mood at that time.

Seeing Yang Kai deep in thought, the man hurried to press the point: “I won't hide it—I possess cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and I am but a step away from the Emperor Realm. If you rescue me, I will reward you greatly!”

Dao Origin Realm's Third Stage—Yang Kai shuddered inwardly.

The Senior Brother they had met earlier had been only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet had already made Yang Kai feel utterly outmatched; if this man reached the Third Stage, he could likely slaughter him with ease.

Before understanding this man's temperament, Yang Kai dared not agree rashly—he might end up trying to steal the chicken and losing the rice, and there would be no time to lament.

“I know your concerns, but rest assured, I am a man of my word and will not deceive you; if you remain doubtful I can swear by my soul!” the man said.

Yang Kai frowned, thought for a moment, and said, “I feel your sincerity, Senior, but this matter… let me consider it first, then I'll respond.”

“No rush—take your time,” the man chuckled without pressing him.

“By the way, may I ask your name?”

“Wu Mengchuan!”

Yang Kai silently noted the name and began weighing the pros and cons of agreeing.

Actually, in his mind he leaned toward agreeing first; no matter what, he needed to obtain the technique to remove the seals—restoring his own power was the priority.

Yet with his current strength, even if he restored his power he would still be unable to leave the Biyu Sect; he would then have to rescue Wu Mengchuan as well, relying on his Third Stage Dao Origin strength.

If that were the case, who knew what Wu Mengchuan would do to him afterward.

So Yang Kai hesitated for a time.

Just as he felt troubled, footsteps suddenly came from the corridor.

Yang Kai lifted his head in surprise, frowning slightly.

In recent days the two guards had taken him out daily to be tormented; the timings had been roughly the same, but this time it seemed their usual moment had not yet arrived.

He did not know why the guards had come in at this moment.

After a short while the two guards who had been torturing Yang Kai appeared at the cell door, wearing strange expressions. They opened the cell and waved to Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun: “Both of you, come out!”

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged a glance and offered no resistance, obediently rising to their feet.

Liu Qianyun's delicate body trembled slightly; she instinctively thought she would suffer the same fate Yang Kai had endured.

Yang Kai, however, asked thoughtfully, “Do you have instructions?”

One of the two guards measured Yang Kai up and down and grinned: “Consider yourselves lucky—Protector Bian wishes to see you.”

“Protector Bian!” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Having been imprisoned for over ten days without orders from Protector Bian, Yang Kai had thought the other side scorned dealing with him and Liu Qianyun, but he did not expect that only today the man would want to see them.

Whatever the reason, Yang Kai saw a sliver of hope for escape.

He and Liu Qianyun looked at one another and saw the other's eyes shining—obviously she too realized it.
