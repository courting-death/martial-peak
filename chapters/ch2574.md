## Chapter 2574 — The Big Guy

Xie Wuwei wore a disgruntled expression, spouting wild words that left his subordinates trembling in fear. They secretly thought that their lord truly had a fiery temper, and were grateful there were no outsiders present. If those few Saint Venerables had heard him, he would surely be in serious trouble.

“What is the Blood Gate?” Yang Kai, who had been listening for a while, finally couldn’t hold back his curiosity and asked.

He had heard Yang Youwei mention the Blood Gate before, and knew it was, like the Tomb of All Spirits, one of the two forbidden grounds in the Wild Ancient Land. He hadn’t investigated further, but seeing Xie Wuwei’s expression and words now, the Blood Gate seemed to be a matter of great importance—even the four Divine Spirits of the Ancient Land had intervened.

This was no trivial matter.

Yang Kai now had to search for Xiaoxiao and the Third Disciple in the Wild Ancient Land, so learning more about the situation here wasn’t a bad thing. As the saying goes, know yourself and your enemy, and you’ll never lose a hundred battles.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Xie Wuwei was momentarily stunned, suddenly realizing there were two outsiders present. His lips twitched; he’d been too agitated and had forgotten about them.

“If it’s inconvenient to say, just forget it.” Yang Kai smiled lightly, picking up the deep red tea the maid had served earlier. He sniffed it but still didn’t dare drink, afraid it might be brewed with fresh blood.

He spoke casually, but Xie Wuwei couldn’t just brush it off. Yang Kai was clearly interested, and who knew what he was thinking? So Xie Wuwei went along: “It’s not really inconvenient. The matter of the Blood Gate is useless to humans—it’s a forbidden ground for us creatures of the Ancient Land.”

Yang Kai said, “I’ve heard people mention that Blood Gate and the Tomb of All Spirits are the two forbidden grounds of the Ancient Land. Is that true?”

Xie Wuwei nodded, “That’s right. The Tomb of All Spirits is where our Ancient Land creatures go to die, but the Blood Gate is the place of rebirth. One is life, the other is death—two sides of the same coin.”

“Place of rebirth?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Xie Wuwei spoke in a deep voice, “There’s an ancient legend: enter the Blood Gate, gain new life, awaken ancestral blood, and transform into a Divine Spirit.”

“Transform into a Divine Spirit?” Yang Kai was shocked. “Does that mean entering the Blood Gate lets you become a Divine Spirit?”

Xie Wuwei nodded, “That’s the literal meaning. But who knows what it really is? Since the birth of the Ancient Land, the Blood Gate has existed as a forbidden ground. No one can approach it, no one can enter. But the ancient legend has been passed down through generations—even the youngest yao who’ve just gained intelligence know it. To be honest, all of us Ancient Land creatures carry the blood of the Ancient Land. Some more, some less; strength and talent depend on the thickness of that blood. If one could fully awaken their blood and restore the glory of their ancestors, they could naturally possess power equal to Divine Spirits.”

Yang Kai was amazed, “There’s actually such a place in this world? Does Blood Gate really have such miraculous effects?”

Xie Wuwei said, “No one can be sure if it’s truly miraculous, but the legend says a few Divine Spirits did emerge from the Blood Gate, though it was ages ago and can’t be verified. Regardless, Blood Gate is a tremendous opportunity for us Ancient Land creatures. It’s like the legend of the carp leaping over the dragon gate and becoming a dragon—Blood Gate is that dragon gate. Who wouldn’t want to try?”

“Even the Yao Kings want to go?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with curiosity.

Xie Wuwei sneered, “That depends on whether those lords give the chance. They’ve sent eight Saint Envoys to seal the area—who can get close? But doing this is a bit like hiding something in plain sight. If anyone knows the secrets of the Blood Gate best, it’s the four Saint Venerables.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Hearing Xie Wuwei’s explanation, he immediately understood the significance of the Blood Gate. If it could truly awaken ancestral blood in Ancient Land creatures, their strength would soar. Blood Gate was indeed the place of rebirth, the opposite of the Tomb of All Spirits, which was the place of death.

The world is vast and full of wonders. Yang Kai sighed inwardly; if not for Xiaoxiao, he wouldn’t have entered the Wild Ancient Land and could never have imagined such a magical place existed.

“The Saint Venerables have long-standing prestige. With the eight envoys deployed, no one dares make a move for now. But who can suppress the power of ancestral blood? In the end, it might backfire. Pass down the order—closely monitor the Blood Gate. If there’s any movement, report immediately. I don’t believe those thirty-odd old fellows will just sit quietly.” Xie Wuwei waved his hand.

The old fellows he mentioned were clearly the other thirty-one Yao Kings. Yang Kai listened and realized the Wild Ancient Land wasn’t a monolithic force.

“Yes.” The thin yao received the order and immediately went to prepare.

Xie Wuwei stood atop the platform, his expression shifting as he pondered for a while. Then he suddenly looked up at Yang Kai, “Young Master Yang, you said earlier you wanted this king’s help with something?”

“Looking for someone,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Who are you looking for?” Xie Wuwei asked in surprise.

“The crazy woman you saw before.” As Yang Kai spoke, he pointed in front of him, and a ripple appeared. The image of the Third Disciple materialized. Xie Wuwei’s face darkened.

He still remembered being struck by the Third Disciple’s Inner Core in the Tomb of All Spirits.

“I have some ties with this woman. Her mind is unclear now, and wandering the Ancient Land is dangerous. So I need to find her and take her away.”

That wasn’t difficult. Hearing this, Xie Wuwei relaxed. He’d worried Yang Kai would make him do something troublesome after taking his soul imprint, but it was just finding someone—a simple matter.

He looked down at a shifty-eyed man, “Shu Yu, pass down the order. Have the brothers keep an eye out for this woman. If she’s found, report immediately. Also, don’t let anyone harm her.”

The shifty-eyed yao called Shu Yu cupped his fists, “Yes.”

He turned and left.

Xie Wuwei turned to Yang Kai, “If this woman is still in the Ancient Land, as soon as she shows herself, my men will notice. Young Master Yang, just wait for good news.”

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, “Thank you, Yao King.”

Xie Wuwei’s lips twitched as he forced himself to say, “Young Master Yang’s business is this king’s business. No need to be polite. Someone, take Young Master Yang down to rest and settle him well.”

He couldn’t wait to send Yang Kai off. Truth be told, being with Yang Kai made him uneasy, afraid his subordinates would notice something and he’d lose face.

“No rush,” Yang Kai raised his hand to interrupt. “I still want to ask Yao King for some information.”

Xie Wuwei frowned slightly, looking at him. Yang Kai reached forward, about to conjure Xiaoxiao’s image, when suddenly a thunderous roar erupted from below. The ground shook violently, the entire hall trembled, and the maids screamed in fright. The four yao standing below also changed color.

“Roar…” A muffled roar came from deep underground, like a beast trapped for a thousand years, heavy and full of rage. Everyone could feel the anger in that voice.

Yang Kai stood unmoving, curiously watching Xie Wuwei, unsure what had happened here or what monster was suppressed beneath the mountain.

Xie Wuwei’s face was grim. He turned to the yao below and shouted, “That big guy still hasn’t submitted?”

One of the yao replied with a troubled look, “That thing is stubborn. We’ve tried many methods, but it won’t yield.”

“Useless bunch,” Xie Wuwei snorted. The yao were so chastened they couldn’t lift their heads.

“This king will go see for himself.” Whatever use the monster under the mountain had for Xie Wuwei, he swept his sleeve and strode over. After a few steps, he turned back, “Sorry to neglect you, Young Master Yang. Something’s come up here that I need to handle. Please follow my maid to rest, I’ll come apologize later.”

“No problem, I’ll join the excitement.” Yang Kai smiled.

Xie Wuwei rolled his eyes but couldn’t stop Yang Kai, so he just marched ahead.

The four remaining yao hurried after, muttering to themselves that the Yao King was being far too courteous to this human, even letting him in on such confidential matters.

Leaving the hall, they soon arrived at a cave entrance. The group entered one by one.

The cave seemed to be just the entrance, with a stone stairway winding downward into unknown depths. Luminous stones embedded in the walls cast a gentle glow, keeping the passage from falling into darkness.

Everyone moved quickly, descending the stairs.

They went down several thousand zhang before the terrain opened up. Below was a spacious underground palace.

Inside the underground palace, a crowd of yao had gathered. At this moment, however, every one of them looked as if facing a formidable enemy. Many had even revealed their true forms, gazes filled with terror as they stared toward a certain spot deep within the palace.

Seeing Xie Wuwei and his subordinates arrive, the yao quickly stepped aside, their expressions respectful and fearful.

Xie Wuwei glanced around, beckoned a small yao over, and asked sternly, “What’s going on?”

The small yao, pale-faced, stammered, “We don’t know. The big guy suddenly woke up and went berserk. We’re too weak to restrain him—several brothers have already died. If not for the Soul-Locking Chains you set up, he would’ve broken free.”

“Get out of the way. What use are you?” Xie Wuwei said impatiently, sweeping the small yao aside and heading straight for the depths of the palace.

“Roar…”

Another angry roar echoed, the sound sweeping through the palace like a storm, making everyone’s clothes and hair fly.

Yang Kai looked amazed, wondering what kind of monster was suppressed here to have such power.

Curious, he focused his gaze inward.

What he saw stunned him—he froze as if struck by lightning, trembling, “Xiaoxiao!”

Dozens of zhang away, a gigantic humanoid figure, five zhang tall, was chained in place by pitch-black chains. The massive figure was all sharp angles, as if carved from stone, its body gleaming with a stony luster. It had clear features, strong limbs, and radiated explosive power.

The big guy before him was clearly Xiaoxiao after transforming.
