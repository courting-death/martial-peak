## Chapter 1404 — Old Man Xie Li

Elder Du stared at him as if unaware of life or death, but Yang Kai was not alarmed and instead pleased; his left eye suddenly deepened like an ocean as a golden pupil manifested.

World-Ending Demon Eye!

That flawless golden pupil was narrow and slit-like, inspiring terror and extinguishing any thought of resistance, as if that eye had already become the ruler of heaven and earth.

Around that golden pupil there was, faintly, an inexplicable rosy radiance.

Glazed Light!

It was the Glazed Light born from fusing the Glazed Pearl that Daiyuan had given him; though the Glazed Light had not yet fully integrated with the World-Ending Demon Eye, Yang Kai could already draw upon some of its power.

The World-Ending Demon Eye is the innate divine skill of the Great Demon God, not earned by bitter cultivation but granted by birth, and it grows in potency as its bearer develops—so although the Great Demon God only reached the Saint King Realm in life, in Yang Kai's hands the World-Ending Demon Eye could continuously exert ever greater might.

A formless whirlpool faintly surfaced within the golden pupil, and a powerful suction emanated from it; Elder Du went pale—at that instant he felt his soul roil and an illusion of being drawn away seized him.

This realization made his face change drastically in fright. He hurriedly circulated his cultivation technique to suppress the tremor and panic surging in his heart.

But it was not over: the strange radiance swirling near the golden pupil now birthed an oddly malignant force, and under its influence Elder Du found his newly stabilized soul again thrown into turmoil—moreover, this time even his body seemed somewhat beyond his control.

The World-Ending Demon Eye naturally possessed the ability to devour a warrior's essence and soul; it was by relying on it that Yang Kai could prematurely grasp Martial Dao beyond his own realm, so even with rapid advancement his composure would not fray, nor would instability occur in his mental state.

The Glazed Light, moreover, had the power to bind the body and restrain the soul, overcoming the Five Elements; the two combined were by no means to be underestimated.

However, Yang Kai's strength was still not great—leaping a rank to deal with an expert like Elder Du would diminish the effect, and besides, Elder Du had already undergone demonization, making him far more troublesome than an ordinary Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

Thus, in the space of a single breath Elder Du shook off the dual deterrence of the World-Ending Demon Eye and the Glazed Light.

But it was enough: within that breath Yang Kai had flicked out a dozen-or-so Space Blades toward Elder Du; by the time his eyes cleared and his body regained freedom, those jet-black, blade-like strikes had just reached before him.

Elder Du's dying spirit surged; he roared as two layers of light screens flashed over his body. Stacked together they looked tremendously dense—one was condensed from his own pure Saint Yuan, the other was a manifestation of the Green-Eyed Blood Toad's demonic yuan.

Yet even those two layers of protection could not withstand the slicing of the Space Blades!

Soundlessly, the dozen-or-so Space Blades passed through where he stood, cut through his body, then flew out dozens of zhang before gradually dissipating into nothing.

Elder Du stood in place, his face a mask of stupefaction as he stared at Yang Kai; then he looked down at his own body and saw many blade-shaped holes—through those gaps he clearly saw his shattered organs and writhing entrails, crimson blood gushing from the wounds like fountains.

"Spatial power!" Elder Du muttered; with a ripping sound his body tore apart, becoming a pool of shredded flesh, his aged face frozen with eyes rolled wide, as if he could not bring himself to believe until death that he had fallen here.

Gazing at the corpse, Yang Kai exhaled slightly; this battle had not been easy. Although Yang Yan had maintained a formation to suppress the foe's strength, after employing the demonization secret technique that old man could still perform far beyond his usual level.

If it were not for the many stratagems at his disposal, Yang Kai might indeed have been unable to finish him off.

The suction from the World-Ending Demon Eye devoured Elder Du's soul—this was the soul of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior, and it would greatly aid Yang Kai's insight into Shi; naturally he would not let it pass.

After this fight Yang Kai had a rough sense of his combat strength: at his present level he could face a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator head-on without issue, though whether he could kill one depended on the opponent's ability; as for a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, that still seemed a stretch, but without actually sparring he would not judge rashly.

Elsewhere, with Elder Du's Divine Sense control broken, the black python that the single-handed axe Secret Treasure had transformed into revealed its true form and dropped to the ground.

Yang Kai waved and retracted the Purple Shield, then picked up the single-handed axe, toyed with it for a moment, and casually tossed it into the Spatial Ring.

Standing silently to probe the situation for a moment, Yang Kai quickly discerned the current state of affairs on Dragon Lair Mountain.

The intruders were basically all dead; somewhere a dozen-or-so li away another Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm enemy was locked in a bitter struggle, and his opponents were three First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

From their auras Yang Kai quickly judged that the enemy was likely a powerful expert from the Demon Blood Sect, while the three First Stage fighters were, of course, Chang Qi, Hao An and Ning Xiangchen.

Though the three were a realm lower, they had no trouble besieging that Demon Blood Sect middle-aged man within Dragon Lair Mountain; Yang Kai's perception showed the engagement one-sided, and the enemy's defeat and death was only a matter of time.

That Ning Xiangchen would wade into this muddle and stand on Dragon Lair Mountain's side surprised Yang Kai.

After all, he and that senior had little acquaintance—only a few exchanges back in the Imperial Garden—and though Yang Kai knew the senior's intention to befriend him for the sake of borrowing the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, he bore no resentment; the senior had no malice and simply asked, and in the end Yang Kai had readily agreed.

That casual, inadvertent act had now brought an ally to Dragon Lair Mountain—truly a fortuitous gain.

Otherwise, relying only on Chang Qi and Hao An, it would have been somewhat difficult to kill that Demon Blood Sect enemy.

Of course, Dragon Lair Mountain could manage without a Ning Xiangchen, but discovering his presence put Yang Kai in a noticeably better mood.

No longer concerned with that matter, Yang Kai turned his gaze elsewhere, a cold smile playing at the corner of his mouth, and then strolled in that direction.

In that eerie illusion without sun, moon, or stars, the world barren and desolate, Xie Li sat cross-legged on the ground, his expression calm as an ancient well; he had tried for a long time but still could not break the formation before him, and now decisively ceased wasting time and conserved his strength to await the opportune moment.

He knew the illusion posed no lethal threat; if the enemy wanted to slay him they would have to show themselves.

As the Xie Family's strongest, Xie Li had considerable composure, but the several Saint King Realm men around him did not share his calm; at this moment they stared at Xie Li, hoping he would point a way out.

But Xie Li remained silent, and they were helpless—none dared rashly question him, each like an ant on a hot pan, frantic and distraught.

Suddenly Xie Li rose from his cross-legged posture, and a terrifying light shot from his eyes as he concentrated on a spot not far ahead.

As he rose, the void ahead rippled, and then a figure strangely passed through as if through a transparent water curtain, effortlessly arriving before the Xie family members.

Seeing this man's face, Xie Li's eyelids narrowed and a flood of killing intent surged.

Of course he recognized Yang Kai—after all, his own son, Xie Hongwen, had met a miserable end at Yang Kai’s hands. The hatred of a son’s death was something Xie Li could never forget, burning for vengeance every waking moment. Yet, having weathered many storms in his life, he hadn’t recklessly rushed to Dragon Lair Mountain to seek revenge. After all, Yang Kai had Qian Tong standing behind him at that time. To act out of blind fury, even if successful, would have meant his own death as well—and that would have been far too great a loss.

So he had endured, always seeking an opportunity.

He had been lucky sometimes and failed other times, and finally had waited until this moment.

Now that enemy and avenger met, naturally emotions ran high—but Xie Li still kept his composure, simply staring hard at Yang Kai without making a rash move.

Entering the illusion, Yang Kai cast a cold glance, summoned the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, and the Fire Bird spread its wings—basin-sized fireballs rained down like a tide upon those Saint King Realm cultivators.

The poor Saint King Realm men had been trapped so long they were already on edge; struck by a surprise attack from a Fire Bird whose strength rivaled Origin Returning Realm experts, they had no room to resist.

The hastily produced defensive Secret Treasures could not withstand the force of those fireballs; under heat and impact they shattered into fragments, their protective Saint Yuan flashing wildly before being broken in the blink of an eye. They screamed and fell, burned to ashes.

In an instant all the Saint King Realm cultivators perished; none of them played any useful role.

Yet Xie Li's face remained unchanged, as if his clan's disciples had died for no consequence; he simply met Yang Kai's gaze coolly.

After a long moment he drew a deep breath and said in a deep voice, "This is the first time you and I have met, isn't it? I am Xie Li—surely you are not unfamiliar with me."

Yang Kai's mouth tipped in a wry smile as he said lightly, "I know you are Xie Li, and I know why you're here; but I only want to ask one question."

“Very well. Before you die, this old man can grant you that wish.” Xie Li let out a cold snort, seeming quite confident in his own methods.

"What an arrogant boast!" Yang Kai grinned broadly. "Forget it—I won't bicker. Just tell me where Lu Ye is, and I'll keep your corpse whole."

"Lu Ye?" Xie Li frowned—he had not expected Yang Kai to ask that at such a time; a strange, complex emotion flickered across his eyes, and then he shook his head: "Not sure. Probably dead."

"Dead, huh..." Yang Kai made no definite reply.

Lu Ye could not have died so easily—Yang Kai had once severed one of his arms in the Flowing Flame Sandland, yet when he had seen him again that arm had somehow grown back.

This was something Yang Kai simply could not comprehend.
