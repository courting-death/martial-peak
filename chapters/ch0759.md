## Chapter 759 — Warm Spirit Lotus

Within the archipelago, in the palace of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Qian Ning once again met with the Saintess and urged that they should set out and continue onward.

Since the Saintess's return he had asked twice already, but each time An Ling'er refused.

This time was no exception.

Qian Ning could not help feeling annoyed; although within the Sacred Land the Saintess ranked above him, he had accompanied An Ling'er on this trip not only to protect her, but to shoulder the responsibility of leading the entire expedition onward.

"Miss, finding the Saint Lord is your task; you should not be lingering here, whatever your reasons are!"

"I know," An Ling'er said, her dark brows knitting and her lovely face paling slightly. "But I don't know why—these past few days I've been plagued by an uneasy feeling, as if something major is about to happen."

"Major?" Qian Ning's expression shifted. "What kind of major event?"

An Ling'er slowly shook her head and murmured, "I don't know either; I can't put it into words..."

Qian Ning was stunned, looking at her with suspicion, and after a long moment slowly nodded. "Very well, then we'll stay a while longer—whenever you decide, Miss, we'll depart."

"All right."

Watching Qian Ning's retreating figure, huge beads of sweat suddenly formed on An Ling'er's forehead; what she had just said was not meant to deceive Qian Ning, but was an honest reflection of her concerns.

She did not know what was wrong—these days grotesque, bloody visions kept appearing before An Ling'er's eyes.

She had thought it was related to Yang Kai having stripped her of her soul imprint, but upon investigation she found there was no connection between the two.

...

In the sealed chamber, Yang Kai spent a full ten days in seclusion before he could finally absorb all the medicinal effects of that Saint Pill.

He gleaned some of the mysteries behind the pill's formation and the secrets of the Pill Cloud—though not much, it was still a gain that left him greatly satisfied and advanced his understanding of alchemy.

When the pill's effects finally faded, Yang Kai felt that his whole self had become somewhat different from before.

His body felt lighter; his Sea of Consciousness was clear, his Divine Sense undeniably much stronger than before, and within his Sea of Consciousness there was a strange sensation.

That sensation made the deployment of his Divine Sense easier and faster.

Frowning, Yang Kai sank his mind into his Sea of Consciousness and probed carefully.

The spirit body had only just manifested when Yang Kai froze.

During this seclusion he had been focused on probing the Pill Cloud's mysteries and had paid little attention to his Sea of Consciousness; now, seeing the enormous changes within it, he could scarcely believe it.

The spirit energy—like a sea of roaring flames—had grown denser, which was to be expected. The World-Ending Demon Eye and the Court of Divine Battle still hovered in midair, unchanged.

And the greatest change was the island conjured by the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus.

At this moment the island shimmered with multicolored lights, dazzling and extraordinarily beautiful.

Yang Kai examined it closely and was shocked to find that what should have been five colors had gained an extra hue—transforming into six!

The added color was paler than the other five, but it had truly been born.

Six-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus!

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then threw his head back and laughed wildly.

He had never expected, after acquiring the Warm Spirit Lotus, that it would grow and evolve within his lifetime—after all, according to Di Mo, that process was far too long.

Yet who could have imagined that absorbing the effects of the Saint-Grade Pill would directly elevate the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus by a grade—only one final step remained before it could advance to its ultimate seven-colored form.

With every additional color, the Warm Spirit Lotus's efficacy would multiply.

Yang Kai could feel that the Lotus's ability to nourish the spirit was now far stronger than before, and this effect was constant: as long as he possessed the Lotus, his spirit energy would continuously and unceasingly increase.

The magnitude of this gain was simply unimaginable.

The evolution from five colors to six had cost nearly ten years; over that span Yang Kai had consumed vast quantities of spirit-grade pills and elixirs, not to mention the nourishment provided by the Lotus's previous owner.

Yang Kai did not know whether, before his allotted span ended, he would live to see the Warm Spirit Lotus evolve to its final form.

Still, he was satisfied; gazing at the island radiating six colors, Yang Kai chuckled foolishly, unable to contain himself.

Just then a strange stirring came from within the spirit body.

Yang Kai frowned and probed, and after a moment his brow tightened.

It was not his own spirit that was in trouble, but An Ling'er's soul imprint, which sent out unusual fluctuations—this woman seemed to have encountered something terrifying and was inwardly trembling; the imprint radiated profound unease.

What danger could she possibly be facing? Yang Kai wondered in bafflement.

Although her strength was not high—on par with his own at First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—she was the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, a figure of lofty status; who among these overseas islands would dare to harm her?

Perplexed, Yang Kai strode outside.

After breaking through the chamber's seals and barriers, Yang Kai had barely stepped through the door when waves of wailing and screams reached his ears; not far off, immense sounds erupted, and the whole world seemed to tremble as a terrifying pressure descended.

Yang Kai's face changed; he hastily circulated his True Yuan to resist the overwhelming oppression.

The island was in chaos: countless people surged in one direction as if pursued by some terrifying thing.

Boom—

With a thunderous crash Yang Kai nearly lost his footing; the sealed chamber behind him cracked and, swept by the violent shockwave, collapsed into ruins.

Yang Kai scanned the scene but found no trace of an enemy; he extended his Divine Sense and detected an aura in the nearby sky that filled him with dread.

Looking up, he saw in the sky a giant sword hundreds of zhang long cleaving down from above with world-destroying force, almost tearing the fabric of space!

"Profound Heaven Sword?" Yang Kai's expression grew grave as he immediately recognized it as one of the Nine Heavens divine techniques.

He had also received a transmission of this move from An Ling'er and had used it before, but his version had been a soul technique; the manifestation now before him was a martial skill condensed from True Yuan, differing greatly in nature and power.

Crack—crack—

The great sword struck, splitting an island cleanly in two.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and fixed his gaze on the striking figure in the void.

It was this person who wielded the Profound Heaven Sword.

She was a woman in spotless white, delicately beautiful and graceful. Her aura resembled An Ling'er's—noble and pure—but overlaid with a faint deathly chill.

It seemed her life force had withered; she was but a walking corpse.

Yang Kai felt an unaccountable chill of horror.

The enormous Profound Heaven Sword rested in her small hand; with a few casual cuts—like slicing rice cake—a nearby island was shredded and sank into the sea.

The people on that island, beneath her terrifying attacks and overwhelming pressure, had no ability to resist; countless were killed or injured.

The azure sea was instantly dyed deep crimson.

The doomsday-like scene was terrifying.

The woman advanced and hovered above another island, swinging the Profound Heaven Sword again.

In an instant another island was destroyed.

In barely ten breaths, three islands had fallen to her hand.

Yang Kai's heart turned stern; seeing her nameless fury about to engulf his island, he dared not remain and immediately used his body technique to leap backward.

His movement seemed to catch her attention; a beam of light shot out like a fang-toothed serpent, swiftly closing on Yang Kai.

"Nether Heaven Lock!" Yang Kai cried in alarm—he was now certain the woman was from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and likely a high-ranking figure, for where else would she have cultivated such a Nine Heavens divine technique?

What disturbed Yang Kai more was her cultivation; this mysterious woman was undoubtedly an expert of the Saint Realm.

The Nether Heaven Lock pursuing him was astonishingly fast, its True Yuan thick and refined to the extreme—Yang Kai could not break free.

Without hesitation his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled with a rush; his speed leapt several levels and he vanished like a bolt of lightning.

The Nether Heaven Lock snared only the afterimage Yang Kai left behind from his rapid movement.

From afar the woman's beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai's retreating figure; a puzzled look crossed her delicate face, her body swayed, and she suddenly vanished from that spot.

When she reappeared, she was not far behind Yang Kai.

Feeling the murderous intent and chill at his back, Yang Kai's hairs stood on end; before she could act he vanished again, hurriedly suppressing his aura and slipping silently in one direction.

The woman hovered, tilted her head, her eyes flicking as she precisely located Yang Kai's position.

Having found him, she did not immediately strike; instead she glanced toward another direction, her brows knit and her expression pained.

Yang Kai was angered and baffled as to why such a powerhouse had singled him out, but An Ling'er should know something; the priority was to find the woman quickly and get an explanation.

In front of the palace, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's experts had gathered, staring dazedly at the woman standing in the sky and gazing this way.

"Grandmother Nan?" An Ling'er cried out, her body trembling; tears spilled from her beautiful eyes as she sobbed, looking utterly distraught.

"Saintess Nan is here—could it be... that the Saint Lord has fallen?" Qian Ning's lips quivered and his face went pale.
