## Chapter 1888 — Risking Everything

Hearing Yang Kai plainly speak the name of his greatest divine ability in a single breath, Qian Yan's expression shifted slightly, but when he remembered the connection with Chi Yue he quickly let it go.

He was called the Thousand-Eyed Lord because of the existence of the Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye; it was an innate talent unique to Qian Yan's race, something no living being could learn, and it was his greatest reliance.

It would be one thing if others did not know of the Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye, but since Yang Kai was so familiar with Chi Yue he would naturally have heard of it from her, so Qian Yan was not surprised.

Qian Yan appraised the four-colored halo around Yang Kai's body with a grave expression and, not hurried, said: "Does your secret art encompass the Five Elements? You already have four—why not show all five? Xue Jiao alone is no match; this Lord will join him. If you still refuse to reveal them, I'm afraid you won't have another chance."

Yang Kai grinned and said, "Then as you wish!"

With those words, the final layer of azure light rippled outward.

Yang Kai's already formidable aura swelled by a few degrees.

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao both stiffened at the same time.

Five-Element sword qi coiled about Yang Kai's body, mutually restraining and nourishing, the halos flowing; not only was it dazzling to behold, it also imposed an immense pressure.

A trace of fear flashed across the Xue Jiao’s eyes. Had Qian Yan not secretly aided him a moment ago, he would have been injured without a doubt. Only now did he grasp just how troublesome Yang Kai truly was. Though they were both at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, he was nowhere near Yang Kai’s match.

"Is that your strongest power?" Qian Yan asked solemnly, sneering as he spoke to strike at Yang Kai's Shi and confidence. "It's nothing special. If that's all you can do, you'd better obediently withdraw, lest we end up spoiling the mood."

“Spare me the nonsense. If I told you that both your sons died by my hand, would you really let me walk away?” Yang Kai stared ahead, eyes cold.

"What?" Qian Yan roared in fury. "What did you just say?"

Xue Jiao suddenly seemed to recall something and hissed, "So it was you! I knew you looked familiar. So it's you, you little scum!"

"Xue Jiao, make your meaning clear!" Qian Yan's silver eyes flashed with murderous intent as he turned to Xue Jiao.

"Haven't you figured it out? This is the human who, a few years ago, set out from Di Chen and went with Xue Lian and Mi Tian to take part in the Blood Prison Trial!" Xue Jiao ground his teeth and roared.

"Impossible!" Qian Yan's face changed drastically. "The Blood Prison Trial can only be entered by the Origin Returning Realm. It's only been a few years—how could he possibly have risen to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm?"

"I also thought it impossible," Xue Jiao admitted with a slight nod. "But the facts are right before us; I can't deny them."

Qian Yan paused, then looked at Yang Kai again and nodded. "Very well, very well. I was worrying I couldn't find the killer who murdered Mi Tian; since you came here of your own accord today, you need not leave!"

Yang Kai laughed uproariously.

"Xue Jiao, move—we fight to the death today!" Qian Yan exploded in fury. He swung his hand and charged at Yang Kai first, but midway through his body strangely vanished.

No one knew where he had gone.

Xue Jiao, however, seemed accustomed to such a trick and was not fazed by Qian Yan's disappearance; instead he charged at Yang Kai even more fiercely.

The enormous Jiao's body swayed as if stirring heaven and earth; before it reached close range it spat out a burst of bloodlight.

Yang Kai sneered, "That move won't work on me."

"No need for it to work!" Xue Jiao snorted. The moment the bloodlight was spat he shifted his position, leaping to Yang Kai's right, and the huge Jiao tail swept viciously.

The scales along that tail stood up like rows of knives—if they struck, it would be disastrous.

Yang Kai easily evaded, but before he could plant his feet his brow suddenly furrowed. He stood motionless as his Domain Field erupted, locking the space of ten zhang around him.

Behind him a ghostly figure appeared—it was the Thousand-Eyed Lord who had vanished earlier.

Qian Yan, finger like a blade, thrust straight for the back of Yang Kai's skull.

But Qian Yan's assault was halted for an instant by that Void King Realm Domain Field; he did not yield, however, and released his own Domain Field to counter and neutralize Yang Kai's, so the attacking momentum did not diminish.

Yang Kai flicked his wrist, and the Dragon Bone Sword materialized in his hand. With a backward sweep, he cut toward the space behind him.

Qian Yan frowned and had to abandon his motion, his figure retreating at speed.

He did not want to be struck by the Dragon Bone Sword—though it had no edge, anyone could see it was a Void King-Grade secret treasure, and being hit by such a thing would end very poorly.

"Thinking to run? Too naive," Yang Kai barked, suddenly amplifying the power of his Domain Field.

Hum...

Heaven and earth trembled. Within the ten zhang area he had locked, countless tiny cracks suddenly split the sky—dense and innumerable.

"This is..." Qian Yan was aghast; he had never expected Yang Kai's Domain Field to be so terrifying—more condensed and vigorous than his own, and even infused with a special power.

That power could make the void collapse, forming spatial rifts that dealt tremendous damage.

"Don't panic!" At the critical moment Xue Jiao roared, and his Domain Field burst forth to merge with Qian Yan's, opposing Yang Kai's spatial force.

Crackle...

The patch of void grew increasingly unstable, as if it could collapse at any moment.

Xue Jiao thrust out a claw, letting countless spatial rifts carve wounds across it, then snatched the Domain Field-wrapped Qian Yan and yanked him back violently.

A crisp, tearing sound rang out.

Within the area where the Domain Fields of the three Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts overlapped, space shattered like a mirror, revealing a vast swath of void—empty, dark, and bone-chilling.

The void hole did not last long; under the governance of Di Chen Star's heavenly laws it quickly repaired itself and in the blink of an eye returned to normal.

The two Yao Lords both staggered back, hearts reeling, faces full of horror.

Two against one—yet they were still being driven back. Such a thing was unthinkable in the past, but today it was unfolding right before their eyes.

"Are human Void King cultivators all this strong?" a terrifying thought rose in the minds of Qian Yan and Xue Jiao.

If that were so, where in this Star Domain would the yao have any foothold? A few human experts of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm could very well devastate Di Chen Star and drive the yao from their last sanctuary.

"Fight with everything you've got, Xue Jiao!" Qian Yan said in a low voice—he knew that without giving their all there would be no chance to overcome Yang Kai.

When Yang Kai had come here he had told Chi Yue he could protect himself. Qian Yan had thought his claim mere bluster, but now he knew the other was not arrogant at all—if anything, he was modest.

He was far from merely able to protect himself; he could seize absolute superiority.

"Very well!" Xue Jiao growled, then suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a pearl the size of a fist.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened. "An Inner Core!" He knew Xue Jiao truly intended to fight to the death.

All yao possessed Inner Cores, yet they never used them lightly. The Inner Core contained a yao's life essence and was the source of their combat power.

If an Inner Core is damaged or lost, a yao might not die immediately, but their strength would plunge; in severe cases they would never be able to advance again.

Therefore, no yao would release their Inner Core in battle unless absolutely forced.

Xue Jiao spat out his Inner Core, which meant he left nothing in reserve—the next move would be his strongest.

Xue Jiao was a Second-Stage Void King Realm expert, and his inner core was a rarity even across the entire Star Domain. Used as a Pill Guide, it could produce only the finest Void King-Grade spiritual pills.

Moreover, Xue Jiao's flesh could be refined into a Blood Beast!

A Blood Beast of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm carried the bloodline of ancient monstrous beasts and its strength was extraordinary.

Yang Kai was already mentally planning how he would boil down Xue Jiao.

Unlike Xue Jiao, Qian Yan did not spit out an Inner Core. Instead, he let out a bellow, and in an instant his whole body swelled fat. The once effeminate Qian Yan transformed, looking like a round sphere.

His upper garment burst apart, exposing his torso.

Yang Kai stared and felt a chill creep over his scalp.

For on Qian Yan's upper body there were many eyes, each emitting silver light, blinking from time to time, all fixing upon him with ill intent.

Counting them up, there were seventy or eighty, each radiating subtle waves of mysterious power.

“To force me to unveil this form—you may take pride in that much!” Qian Yan barked coldly. His hands flew through a series of seals, and his expression grew solemn and austere.

In the next instant, those eyes together with his original two burst forth with silver light. The silver light converged into a beam, and an image of a full moon suddenly rose behind Qian Yan.

After the silver light poured into the moon, the silver orb shivered as if it had come to life.

A hair-raising sensation swept through Yang Kai. He looked closely and found the surroundings emptied—only a silver moon hung high in the sky, like a gigantic eye looking down upon him.

The moonlight seeped into Yang Kai's heart and Sea of Consciousness, slowing his thoughts and causing his strength to ebb.

That silver moon's brilliance could affect not only the mind but even the body.

Yang Kai's face changed; he knew not to belittle any Void King Realm cultivator. He drew a deep breath, bit his fingertip, and smeared it across his left eye.

In the next instant dazzling golden light erupted from his left eye; that eye had completely transformed into a majestic golden vertical pupil, narrow and carrying an aura as if to annihilate all generations—terrifying to behold.

World-Ending Demon Eye!

Yang Kai poured Divine Sense into his left eye to unleash the World-Ending Demon Eye's might and locked his gaze with the silver moon hanging in the sky.

No matter how wondrous that silver moon seemed, it was a manifestation created from Qian Yan's power; as long as Qian Yan's power was suppressed, the moon would collapse of its own accord.
