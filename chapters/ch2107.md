## Chapter 2107 — Two-Colored Seal

In the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai slowly regained consciousness after an unknown span of time.

When he opened his eyes, the earlier scenes flooded back into his mind.

Yang Kai was startled. He sat up at once, frowning as he checked his body's condition.

What shocked him was that the Demonic Qi that had tormented him was now completely gone, without a trace.

Instead, there was an indescribable pain at his lower abdomen, a sensation that felt like both burning and freezing—utterly bizarre.

He hurriedly looked down and saw a strange gold-and-silver bicolored pattern on his lower abdomen, like a brand imprinted on his flesh.

"What is this?" Yang Kai muttered in confusion, staring at the brand.

But as soon as his consciousness sank into the brand, his vision went black. The world plunged into darkness, and within that void a violent aura roared in fury, struggling to break free from some shackle.

Startled, Yang Kai bit the tip of his tongue. The sharp pain brought his mind back to clarity.

Looking again, the endless darkness was gone; all he had seen was an illusion.

"A seal?" His brows rose, surprise and shock written on his face.

By now, he had completely figured out what had happened.

The gold-and-silver pattern on his lower abdomen was clearly a profound seal. All the Demonic Qi in his body, along with a trace of demonic intent in his Sea of Consciousness, had been completely suppressed by that seal, without a single leak.

"There’s actually such a thing in this world?" he exclaimed softly, his expression shifting unpredictably.

He knew better than anyone how dense Demonic Qi could be and how ferocious the demonic intent was.

Under the Ancient Demon’s will and wreathed in Demonic Qi, he had fought three First Stage Emperor Realm experts—showing the terrifying potency of that power.

But now, a naturally formed seal had suppressed it all. If he didn’t deliberately probe, he wouldn’t even notice the Demonic Qi and demonic intent within him. Just how mysterious and powerful was this seal?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai immediately turned to look at the gold-and-silver bicolored tree.

In the next moment, his expression froze.

The gold-and-silver bicolored tree, which had been thriving, now looked malnourished, its leaves withered and drooping. The gold and silver radiance it once had was completely gone.

It looked utterly depleted!

Clearly, the seal was formed from some mysterious power within the gold-and-silver bicolored tree. After that power was drawn out, the tree became like this.

The gold-and-silver bicolored tree had only existed in the medicine garden for about a year.

But the medicine garden in the Small Xuan Realm contained countless clumps of Heavy Earth, five Earth Vein Beads, and was extremely suitable for Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines to grow.

Surviving a year in the medicine garden was basically equivalent to a hundred years of growth in the outside world!

The essence of a hundred years from the gold-and-silver bicolored tree was completely drawn out by Yang Kai, forming a natural seal that suppressed the ancient Demonic Qi and demonic intent. It wasn’t too far-fetched.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s heart trembled, then he was overjoyed.

If he was right, he would never have to worry about being eroded by demonic intent again.

Although he didn’t know how long the seal at his lower abdomen would last, as long as the gold-and-silver bicolored tree was given another year, it could regenerate that mysterious power. By then, even if the seal loosened, Yang Kai could use the tree’s power to suppress it again.

He was very curious—just what kind of ancient exotic tree was this, to possess such formidable power?

With that thought, he reached out with his hand.

In the next instant, a flash of light appeared, and both the Incarnation and Hua Qingsi materialized not far from Yang Kai.

"The crisis is resolved?" The Incarnation gazed at Yang Kai, unable to sense any Demonic Qi from him, and couldn’t help but be greatly surprised.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. With a thought, he poured all sorts of information into the Incarnation’s body.

After a brief moment of contemplation, the Incarnation understood everything and nodded, "So that’s how it is!"

He also looked at the gold-and-silver bicolored tree, his eyes flashing with a brilliant light.

"Y-Young Brother, hello there." Hua Qingsi forced a smile, her expression a bit unnatural. Yang Kai’s earlier might had left her with a deep psychological shadow. A man of similar strength to her had been killed with a single palm by Yang Kai. Although he hadn’t killed her immediately, as a prisoner under his watch, she felt no sense of security. As she spoke, she deliberately showed a bit of charm and said, "Your previous state really worried me."

Yang Kai glanced at her indifferently, neither confirming nor denying, and said, "I have a question for you."

"Young Brother, ask whatever you wish," Hua Qingsi replied awkwardly.

"Do you recognize this kind of tree?" Yang Kai pointed at the Gold-and-Silver Bicolored Tree.

In his mind, since Hua Qingsi was from the Star God Palace and was quite powerful, she should be knowledgeable and might know something about it.

But to his disappointment, Hua Qingsi looked at the exotic tree with confusion in her beautiful eyes, clearly not recognizing it either.

Instead, it was the Everlasting Tree nearby, radiating a shocking aura of life, that caught Hua Qingsi’s attention. Her beautiful eyes flashed with a strange light as she looked at it several times.

"That’s the Everlasting Tree!" Yang Kai explained.

Hua Qingsi’s delicate body trembled, her face showing extreme shock. Then her expression changed drastically as she covered her ears with both hands, shaking her head and muttering, "I don’t want to hear, I don’t want to hear, I don’t want to hear..."

Yang Kai was stunned. He glanced at the Incarnation and asked, "Is this woman crazy?"

The Incarnation chuckled, "The more you know, the more dangerous your situation! She’s very smart."

"So that’s how it is!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, then looked teasingly at Hua Qingsi. "Whether you listen or not, you still can’t gain your freedom."

"You brat!" Hua Qingsi suddenly became furious, glaring at Yang Kai through gritted teeth. "Did I ever offend you? Why are you tormenting me like this? Have you forgotten who saved your life when you were in danger? It was me! If I hadn’t intervened in time, you would have died at Fu Sitong’s hands. Not only are you ungrateful, you repay kindness with enmity! I must have been blind to think of saving you. If I’d known, I might as well have let you die—at least I wouldn’t be suffering as a prisoner now!"

She looked utterly aggrieved, standing on the moral high ground as she berated Yang Kai with righteous indignation.

As she grew more agitated, her pretty face flushed with anger and her chest heaved violently.

Yang Kai said nothing, simply watching her with interest. When she finished, he slowly shook his head and said, "Whether you intervened or not, Fu Sitong couldn’t have harmed me. If he’d really dared to make a move, he’d have only suffered himself."

On this point, Yang Kai was absolutely confident.

Although he couldn’t control his body at the time, the boundless Demonic Qi surrounding him wasn’t so easily dispelled. If Fu Sitong had really attacked him, he would only have been devoured by the Demonic Qi.

"Even so... you can’t deny that I saved you. I’m your savior! You can’t treat me like this, locking me up here!" Hua Qingsi said through gritted teeth.

"Didn’t you have your own motives for saving me?" Yang Kai looked at her with a sly smile.

Hua Qingsi snapped, "I have no grudge or enmity with you. I didn’t even know you before. What motive could I have? Do you think you’re so handsome that I’d fall for you?"

"You’re from the Star God Palace, aren’t you?" Yang Kai suddenly asked out of nowhere.

"That’s right!" Hua Qingsi answered proudly, then threatened fiercely, "I am indeed from the Star God Palace. If you know what’s good for you, let me go at once. Otherwise, you’ll be in for a world of trouble!"

"Although I wasn’t the one who killed Han Leng, I was present when he died," Yang Kai said, his eyes narrowing.

"I don’t know what you’re talking about," Hua Qingsi replied evasively, looking guilty.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Fu Sitong appeared in Fenglin City to investigate the cause of Ning Yuancheng’s death. And weren’t you here for Han Leng’s death?" He looked as if he saw through everything, and said lightly, "Otherwise, I really can’t figure out why you experts would lower yourselves to come to a small place like Fenglin City."

"Just passing by, is that not allowed?" Hua Qingsi retorted stubbornly.

"So you really did come because of Han Leng’s death?" Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

If he’d only been guessing before, now he was completely certain. When he said those words, Hua Qingsi had a subtle emotional reaction.

Outside, Yang Kai might not have noticed, but here in the Small Xuan Realm, nothing could escape his Divine Sense.

"You’re tricking me?" Hua Qingsi blurted out, flustered and exasperated.

"The death of a discarded disciple actually brought you here to investigate. It seems Han Leng was either of extraordinary origin or harbored some secret, right?" Yang Kai mused, stroking his chin as if talking to himself, but in fact his Divine Sense never left Hua Qingsi. "The first seems unlikely. It’s said Han Leng was hunted countless times by your Star God Palace disciples. If he really had a background, he wouldn’t have been treated that way. So it must be the latter?"

"I’ll fight you to the end!" Hua Qingsi suddenly screamed, surging her Origin Qi as she prepared to attack Yang Kai.

Although Yang Kai’s earlier display had made her wary, at this moment, Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Hua Qingsi believed she could handle him.

But her thinking was clearly naive.

Yang Kai simply reached out and grasped, and the laws of heaven and earth shifted abruptly, freezing Hua Qingsi in midair. No matter how she struggled, it was useless. Helpless, she could only shoot desperate glances at the Incarnation.

Yang Kai looked at the Incarnation oddly and said, "You didn’t tell her that in this world, everything is under my control?"

"She never asked," the Incarnation replied with a chuckle.

"Then what’s with her glancing at you?"

"Probably inviting me to join in," the Incarnation said innocently.

"Hey, what are you two chatting so happily about?" Hua Qingsi cried out in alarm, shouting at the Incarnation, "Big Rock, don’t you want to regain your freedom? Now’s the perfect chance—aren’t you going to act?"

The Incarnation spread his hands and said, "I’m powerless. You’ll have to resign yourself!"

Hua Qingsi was helpless. Assessing the situation, she could only bite her red lips, her beautiful eyes brimming with tears as she looked pitifully at Yang Kai and pleaded softly, "Young Brother, I was wrong. Please let me down!"

The Incarnation exclaimed, "What about your integrity?"

"No one would mistake you for a mute if you kept quiet," Hua Qingsi glared angrily at the Incarnation, grinding her teeth. "Traitor!"

The Incarnation immediately looked embarrassed.
