## Chapter 252 — Don't Tease Me

Yang Kai furrowed his brows and asked, “Do you have a way to get them out?”

“Those are not the Control Soul Insects I planted!” Zi Mo slowly shook her head, her delicate brows furrowing as she continued, “Actually, it’s fine to leave them inside. They only absorb a little bit of Yuan Qi to survive. Without anyone commanding them, they won’t harm you. Once you each reach the Divine Roaming Realm, you can naturally use your Divine Sense to draw them out, or return to your sect and have your elders take action.”

This was merely the lowest-grade Control Soul Insect. Besides being afraid of heat, Divine Sense was also a sharp weapon against it.

Despite her words, everyone wore a troubled expression.

They all found it hard to believe Zi Mo.

Moreover, even if what Zi Mo said was true, anyone would feel uneasy with a bug alive in their Dantian. In the event of a life-and-death battle, if that bug moved even slightly, it could lead to some unpredictable and severe consequences.

Seeing the expressions on everyone's faces, Zi Mo sneered, “But if you insist on getting the bug out now, I do have a way. I just don’t know if you’re willing to let me try!”

The group’s faces turned bitter as they all looked at Yang Kai.

They didn’t really trust Zi Mo. What if this Tianlang’s little girl played some tricks and controlled them?

But if they didn’t agree, they also felt uneasy. Having a bug in their Dantian was just too strange.

Zi Mo chuckled to herself, satisfied with her teasing, and then said, “My master can help you.”

“Your master…” Chen Xueshu couldn’t help but cough lightly.

Yang Kai’s face also turned awkward as he shot a resentful glare at Zi Mo.

“Brother Yang, you really… took her as a maid?” Chen Xueshu looked at him with envy, while Shu Xiaoyu beside him pinched him hard. Chen Xueshu’s features twisted in pain, but he didn’t dare to speak.

“She’s talking nonsense! She wishes I were dead!” Yang Kai vehemently denied, sniffing and frowning, “However, I might really have a way, but I’ve never tried it on a person.”

Control Soul Insects were afraid of heat. His True Yang Yuan Qi was their nemesis. Now that he was free from Yao He and Yao Xi’s control, as long as he used his True Yang Yuan Qi, he could force the Control Soul Insects out of their bodies.

Previously, Yang Kai had used this method to extract a Control Soul Insect from the head of a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard, thus discovering the secret of the Control Soul Insects’ existence.

But if the target was a person, Yang Kai couldn’t guarantee anything. These individuals were all elites from their respective sects, and the presence of a Control Soul Insect in the Dantian, such a fragile and sensitive area, could lead to serious consequences with even the slightest mistake.

Seeing Yang Kai hesitate, everyone felt uneasy.

“Try it on me!” Li Xinyuan from Wen Xin Palace suddenly spoke weakly, a faint smile on his face, “Anyway, my cultivation has been wasted. If it helps Brother Yang practice, it’s also a contribution for everyone.”

Zuo Fang immediately said, “Senior Brother, don’t say that. Even if your Dantian is damaged, there’s still a chance to recover as long as you find good medicine. If someone is to try, I’ll go first!”

“Junior Brother.” Li Xinyuan shook his head with a bitter smile, “There’s nothing to worry about for Senior Brother. Even if Brother Yang fails, it’s just one life, right? Living like this is worse than death…”

“Don’t argue! I don’t have much confidence myself.” Yang Kai frowned, then waved his hand at Zi Mo.

“What do you want?” Zi Mo looked puzzled but still obediently walked over.

Her obedience made the Great Han group even more suspicious. They wondered if her relationship with Yang Kai was truly that of a maid and master?

That was just too bizarre.

“Tell me, what exactly needs to be done.” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

Zi Mo explained in detail, and the method was just as Yang Kai had used on the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard. However, the movements had to be more careful; either use a thunderous method to refine it without giving it any time to react, or use a gentle method to force it out, ensuring it felt no unease. Once it felt pressured, it might really break through the Dantian.

After understanding this, Yang Kai pondered and looked at everyone, asking, “Are you sure you want me to proceed?”

The group all nodded.

“Alright, I can only promise to do my utmost to help you resolve this, but… the consequences will be yours to bear!”

Yang Kai didn’t want to get into trouble over such matters.

Han Xiao Qi smiled, “That’s how it should be. We believe you can do it.”

The others had no objections and naturally agreed with his statement.

Yang Kai nodded. After pondering for a long time, he decided to choose the second method. The first method was indeed quick, but it had significant drawbacks. If not controlled well, it would only harm others.

Glancing at Li Xinyuan, Yang Kai said, “I’ll try it on you first!”

Li Xinyuan smiled and nodded. Zuo Fang wanted to say something but was shot a glare by him.

He lifted his clothes, revealing his abdomen. The four young women from Wan Hua Palace couldn’t help but blush, yet they dared not turn away, their faces red as they stared.

Yang Kai placed his hand over Li Xinyuan’s Dantian, took a deep breath, immersed his mind, and controlled his True Yang Yuan Qi, slowly pouring it into Li Xinyuan’s body.

Before long, Yang Kai sensed the presence of the Control Soul Insect. With a thought, he became increasingly cautious, and the True Yang Yuan Qi transformed into countless threads, encircling the Control Soul Insect before it could react.

Li Xinyuan’s complexion suddenly turned red. His Dantian was now wasted, and the scorching Yuan Qi surged in, making it hard for him to endure. However, his willpower was quite strong. Even though his abdomen felt like it was on fire, he still gritted his teeth and remained silent, with only the veins on his forehead bulging and sweat pouring down.

Yang Kai glanced at him and said, “Hang in there.”

As soon as he spoke, he manipulated the True Yang Yuan Qi, gradually forcing the encircled Control Soul Insect out. The Control Soul Insect was clearly struggling, which only intensified Li Xinyuan’s pain. As a Junior Brother, Zuo Fang felt uneasy watching from the side, his heart rising to his throat.

Soon, the Control Soul Insect was forced out from the position of the Dantian. At this point, Yang Kai finally let go of his restraints and increased the output of his True Yang Yuan Qi.

In less than a moment, everyone clearly saw a small bulge appear at Li Xinyuan’s side. Yang Kai’s hands moved quickly, making a small incision there, directly pinching out the Control Soul Insect and incinerating it to ashes.

At the same time, Li Xinyuan couldn’t help but let out a long sigh, collapsing weakly.

“Senior Brother!” Zuo Fang exclaimed in shock, rushing to support him.

After a moment, Li Xinyuan finally opened his eyes weakly and chuckled, “That was really uncomfortable… but I’m free now.”

Seeing him safe, everyone felt a huge weight lifted from their hearts.

Yang Kai’s confidence surged as he looked around, “Who’s next?”

“I’ll go!” Chen Xueshu shouted eagerly, then sat cross-legged in front of Yang Kai.

Having had a successful precedent, Yang Kai found it much easier to proceed. However, Chen Xueshu was different from Li Xinyuan; he still had True Essence within him. No matter how relaxed he tried to be, the True Essence would autonomously resist Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi. Reluctantly, Yang Kai had to increase the output of his Yuan Qi, and after a long while, he finally managed to extract the Control Soul Insect.

One after another, the Great Han group of seventeen or eighteen people wore Yang Kai out.

After dealing with them for most of the day, only a few women remained.

Ye Qingsi from Shura Sect, Feng Qianhen from Shui Yue Hall, Shu Xiaoyu from Yingyue Sect, and the four young women from Wan Hua Palace.

Aside from the most charming Ye Qingsi, the others all blushed, exchanging glances, feeling quite embarrassed.

The reason was simple; when Yang Kai was drawing out the Control Soul Insect, that hand was covering the position of their Dantian.

The Dantian was the lower abdomen, the delicate belly button…

Thinking of this, the girls felt extremely shy.

Ye Qingsi giggled, “I’ll go first. You little girls, why are you so shy? He won’t eat you.”

“Ahem…” Yang Kai said seriously, “Don’t tease me.”

The expressions of the surrounding men also turned strange.

Sitting cross-legged in front of Yang Kai, Ye Qingsi’s eyes sparkled like water, a gentle smile on her face as she boldly stared at Yang Kai, slowly unbuttoning her clothes.

Click, click…

A heavy sound of breathing filled the air.

Ye Qingsi was alluring and voluptuous, resembling a ripe peach, her beauty captivating, and her figure graceful. Such a mature woman had an immense allure for men.

Seeing her about to undress, a group of men naturally stared without blinking, unwilling to miss such a spectacle.

“Hehe…” Ye Qingsi not only showed no signs of shyness but instead laughed charmingly.

Little vixen! The men’s breaths became heavy.

“Hmm?” Han Xiao Qi’s expression turned cold as she scanned the surroundings.

“Close your eyes, close your eyes!” Shu Xiaoyu kept swatting at her Senior Brother’s eyes. Chen Xueshu’s face turned red, and he blinked repeatedly, feeling as if a cat were scratching at his heart.

Ye Qingsi halted her movements, smiling as she said, “You all… really intend to stay?”

“Hehe…” Zuo Fang, Chu Jingshan, and the others suddenly smiled awkwardly, licking their lips, “We thought you wouldn’t mind.”

“Shut up!” Ye Qingsi glared at them, “I’m just giving you face. You have no self-awareness at all, do you need me to chase you away?”

“Let’s go, let’s go!” Zuo Fang helped Li Xinyuan and quickly retreated with the other men.

After a long sigh of regret, they left reluctantly.

“Don’t pull me!” Chen Xueshu panicked, being held by Zhou Ba, the iron tower, and unable to resist as he was dragged out, “My Junior Sister is still there, I have to keep an eye on her…”

“Get away from me!” Shu Xiaoyu blushed furiously.

Once all the men had retreated a hundred zhang away, ensuring they couldn’t see anything, the women finally relaxed.

Yang Kai appeared calm and natural as he looked at Ye Qingsi and said, “Please continue.”

A hint of blush appeared on Ye Qingsi’s face as she took a deep breath, then bit her lip and continued to unbutton her clothes.

Ye Han’s eyes widened, her little face flushed as she stammered, “Do we… all have to do this?”

Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

Ye Han immediately covered her cheeks, “Can we not take off our clothes?”

Yang Kai frowned, “If you’re not afraid of any mistakes, you can. But direct contact makes it easier for me to control the Yuan Qi.”
