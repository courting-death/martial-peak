## Chapter 2164 — Come Forth and Battle

At the Stairway of Time, Yang Kai was burning with anxiety, desperately climbing upward.

Zhang Ruoxi suddenly vanished before his eyes, leaving him bewildered and at a loss, not knowing what danger the little girl had encountered, or if something terrible had happened to her.

He secretly blamed himself, thinking that if he hadn’t impulsively wanted Zhang Ruoxi to climb the Stairway of Time with him, none of this would have happened.

Just as he was growing frantic, a flash of brilliant light appeared above, and a figure materialized.

Yang Kai was stunned, raising his eyes in astonishment.

Zhang Ruoxi was actually standing at the very top of the Stairway of Time, smiling at him. Her hair, which should have turned snow-white, was still as black as ink.

“An illusion?” Yang Kai was confused. He had clearly seen Zhang Ruoxi vanish mysteriously, clearly seen the power of time erode her body and make her age, yet now she was perfectly fine before him, and had even reached the very top.

Everything felt so unreal.

Yang Kai quickened his pace, and after the time it takes an incense stick to burn, he finally arrived at the top, panting heavily.

The moment he set foot there, the power of time swirling around him instantly vanished. Looking back, the Stairway of Time now seemed ordinary, no longer possessing that miraculous, supreme power.

“What happened just now?” Yang Kai gasped, hurriedly asking.

“It was my recklessness,” Zhang Ruoxi answered in a guilty whisper. “I was so immersed in the joy of gaining power that I forgot your instructions… By the time I realized, it was already too late.”

“Then how did you…”

“A powerful demonic beast saved me…” Zhang Ruoxi replied timidly, watching Yang Kai’s expression, afraid he would be angry.

“A powerful demonic beast?” Yang Kai was astonished. “There are demonic beasts in the Time Temple? What kind of beast?”

In that instant, Yang Kai was startled. The Time Temple hadn’t appeared for tens of thousands of years, and he thought no living creatures existed here. Yet, from Zhang Ruoxi’s words, not only was there a powerful demonic beast, but it had rescued her from the Stairway of Time. Its strength was clearly extraordinary, enough to make him wary.

“I can’t really say…” Zhang Ruoxi thought for a moment, unsure how to describe it, then giggled, “But… it said its name was Qiong Qi!”

“What?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened instantly, cold sweat breaking out as he swallowed hard, his voice hoarse: “Qiong…qi?”

“Yes, that’s what it said.” Zhang Ruoxi nodded, then tilted her head, “Sir, what’s wrong? Why do you look so pale… Are you feeling unwell? You’re sweating so much…”

As she spoke, she took out a silk handkerchief, stood on her tiptoes, and gently wiped Yang Kai’s sweat.

“Heh…” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, not knowing what to say.

“Are you alright, sir?” Zhang Ruoxi asked softly.

“I’m fine, I’m fine… really.” Yang Kai replied instinctively, then looked at Zhang Ruoxi, “Are you sure it said its name was Qiong Qi?”

“Yes, that’s what it said.”

“It didn’t do anything to you?”

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head blankly, “No!”

She spoke again, her face lighting up, “Oh, it also gave me something.”

“What?”

Zhang Ruoxi smiled, her Saint Yuan surging. Suddenly, a glow burst from her body, dazzling the eyes.

Yang Kai squinted, his heart pounding wildly!

He saw that a pink, close-fitting treasure dress had appeared on Zhang Ruoxi. Light shimmered across its surface, beautiful and enchanting, with imperial aura flowing through it. The dress radiated pure Imperial Might…

An Imperial Treasure!

And it was actually a defensive Imperial Treasure!

What was going on? Zhang Ruoxi had mysteriously vanished on the Stairway of Time, and when she returned, she said she’d met a demonic beast named Qiong Qi, which not only hadn't harmed her but had even given her a defensive Imperial Treasure!

Yang Kai was utterly bewildered…

After Zhang Ruoxi activated the treasure dress, she was radiant and stunning, her beauty beyond compare. She looked timidly at Yang Kai, “Does this look good…?”

Yang Kai forced a laugh, “It looks good!”

This was an Imperial Treasure! How could ‘looks good’ possibly describe it? Yang Kai howled inwardly. He had five Imperial Treasures himself, but none were defensive types, showing just how rare they were.

“Qiong Qi said it’s called the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress!” Zhang Ruoxi explained, “I don’t really like pink, but as long as you say it looks good, sir, that’s fine.”

“Mm… It’s a gift, after all.” Yang Kai tried to steady himself. “Next time you see it, be sure to thank it properly.”

“I’ll remember.” Zhang Ruoxi nodded respectfully.

“Put it away for now. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, don’t activate its form. Otherwise, it could cause trouble.”

“Yes.” Zhang Ruoxi replied, and with a thought, she withdrew the dress’s glow. Light flashed, and the treasure vanished.

“By the way, Ruoxi… did Qiong Qi say anything else to you?” Yang Kai asked cautiously.

Zhang Ruoxi thought for a moment, “It told me to tell you that if you get a chance to reach the final place, you must choose the thing that seems most useless.”

“Choose the thing that seems most useless?” Yang Kai frowned, puzzled. “What does that mean?”

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head, “I don’t know. After it said that, it sent me back.”

Having spent so much time together, Yang Kai knew this little girl was pure and honest. She wouldn’t hide anything from him, nor would she lie, so he didn’t ask further. He just carefully inquired about her meeting with Qiong Qi, but didn’t learn much more.

The whole thing was unbelievable to Yang Kai. In the end, he could only think it was Zhang Ruoxi’s good fortune. Otherwise, how could a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, after meeting a fierce beast like Qiong Qi, not only return safely but also receive the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress, an Imperial Treasure?

Afterwards, Yang Kai let Zhang Ruoxi enter the Small Xuan Realm, then sat alone at the top of the Stairway of Time to calm himself.

After a long while, he finally stood up.

At the very top of the Stairway of Time was a large door. Yang Kai had noticed it before, and now, if he wanted to leave, it seemed he could only go through this door.

He reached out and slowly pushed the door open…

Dazzling light shone from ahead. Yang Kai squinted, released his Divine Sense to probe, and, confirming there was no danger, stepped inside.

A feeling of weightlessness came instantly, as if that step had brought him into another space.

Suddenly, a living aura appeared, faintly familiar and filled with hostility…

Yang Kai was startled, looking ahead. When he saw the situation before him, he was stunned again.

He now stood on a high platform, circular and more than a hundred zhang across. Around the platform, deep chasms loomed, with ghostly wails rising from below, sending chills down the spine. It was like a demonic abyss; once fallen, one would never escape.

Turning back to look, he found no path behind him—nor any trace of the great door from before.

On the platform, a man stood quietly with a sword, waiting.

The moment Yang Kai appeared, that man’s hawk-like eyes shot over, locking onto Yang Kai, brimming with intense fighting spirit.

Their eyes met, and both were surprised.

Yang Kai grinned, raising a hand in greeting, “Brother Xiao Bai, you’re here too? What a coincidence!”

He realized the man on the platform was Xiao Baiyi of Qingyang Shrine!

But for some reason, Murong Xiaoxiao, who was always with him, was nowhere to be seen.

As he spoke, Yang Kai strolled over, surveying the surroundings. But what puzzled him was that the platform seemed like a separate space, with no way in or out, as if cut off from the world.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, wondering what mysteries lay here. As he pondered, a buzzing sound came from ahead, and a flash of light appeared.

Yang Kai stopped in his tracks. The light slashed down right in front of his toes, nearly striking him.

He looked up at Xiao Baiyi, frowning, “Brother Xiao Bai, what’s the meaning of this?”

“Come forth and battle!” Xiao Baiyi flicked his long sword, pointing it at Yang Kai, his fighting spirit boiling over.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “Is this really necessary… If you want to fight, let’s do it after we leave the Four Seasons Land. Here… let’s not.”

Xiao Baiyi slowly shook his head, his face cold as ice, “It’s precisely because we’re here that we must fight!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai seemed to realize something, his face darkening, “Brother Xiao Bai, do you mean… only one of us can leave?”

Xiao Baiyi said, “Seems you’re not completely dense.” His voice rang out clear and cold, “This is the Platform of Discourse—only the victor earns the right to advance!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai noticed three large characters made of pure energy floating above the platform—Platform of Discourse.

In an instant, he understood.

Xiao Baiyi was clearly waiting here for his opponent in this Trial of Discourse—Yang Kai had simply run into him by unfortunate chance.

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn, “Looks like… there’s no choice but to fight!”

“Exactly!”

“The winner moves on, but what happens to the loser?” Yang Kai asked.

Xiao Baiyi shook his head, “Not sure. Most likely, just death!”

After speaking, he snorted coldly, “What, are you scared?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head, “No, it’s just… I don’t want to kill you, Brother Xiao Bai! We have no grudges, and though you seem to have some issues with me, we entered the Four Seasons Land together. If I really kill you here, how will I explain to Elder Gao and the others?”
