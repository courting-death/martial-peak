## Chapter 2269 — Source Crystal Mine

Of the three Upper-Level Spirit Sources, Yang Kai occupied one, the Eight Directions Sect took another, and the third was jointly held by disciples from two other sects.

The other fifteen Middle-Level Spirit Sources were also crowded with people.

In truth, the disciples of the Eight Directions Sect were not strong enough to seize an Upper-Level Spirit Source, but everyone was wary of Luo Yuan, that ruthless figure. No one dared provoke the Eight Directions Sect, for who knew when Luo Yuan might return? If he caught them, with his strength—enough to injure and drive off both Protectors Gao Shan and Liu Shui—no one could stand against him.

At the Upper-Level Spirit Source where Yang Kai was, he and Hua Qingsi had just finished collecting a batch of Source Crystals when Yang Kai’s expression shifted. He instructed Hua Qingsi, “I’m going down to take a look.”

Source Crystals could not possibly shoot up from below for no reason. Yang Kai guessed there must be some secret beneath this Spirit Source, so he was eager to investigate. Now, with his Golden Blood Threads forming a net above to block the flying Source Crystals, Hua Qingsi only needed to collect them as their momentum slowed. He no longer needed to stay here.

Besides, Liu Yan was also here. If any fool dared try to snatch the Spirit Source, the two of them could easily handle it.

Hua Qingsi didn’t try to stop him, but her expression grew serious as she cautioned, “Be careful!”

Yang Kai nodded, his figure flickering as he dove downward once more.

Just like before, as soon as he entered the Spirit Source, a tremendous resistance surged up from below, as if trying to push him back. Countless Source Crystals, mixed in, came whistling up and struck his body with crackling force.

Yang Kai’s whole body ached, but he gritted his teeth and urged his Origin Qi, using a space secret technique to ease the pressure.

He continued sinking downward, and the further he went, the greater the resistance became. The density and richness of the surrounding Spiritual Qi also increased.

Yang Kai reached out and took out the Xuan Realm Pearl, opening a rift in this Imperial Treasure. He placed the Xuan Realm Pearl in front of him, letting the surging Spiritual Qi and the Source Crystals within pour into the Small Xuan Realm.

He had no idea how far he had sunk. All around was a white haze, nothing visible. Even his Divine Sense could only extend about ten zhang to either side before being blocked by the boundless Spiritual Qi.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s body halted—he had touched solid ground.

This should be the very bottom. He stood still for a moment, quietly sensing. He could clearly feel the torrents surging below, and the space here was not as cramped as he’d imagined, but vast beyond measure.

With a strange expression, he stood in place, pondering for a while. Then he released his Divine Sense, cautiously probing his surroundings.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—chunks of Source Crystal, mixed with the surrounding Spiritual Qi, shot upward with the surging currents.

Yang Kai focused his gaze, seeing through the obstacles around him, and traced the direction from which the Source Crystals came, walking that way at a steady pace.

Along the way, the Xuan Realm Pearl continuously devoured the Spiritual Qi and Source Crystals here, reaping unimaginable gains.

Before long, he suddenly stopped, his eyes narrowing as he stared ahead.

In that white, misty world filled with liquefied Spiritual Qi, a colossal shadow seemed to stretch before him. Though separated by some distance, Yang Kai could still make out its vague outline.

That enormous thing showed no sign of life, and he had no idea what it was. But all the Source Crystals were shooting out from its direction.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then stepped forward.

Soon, he arrived before the dark shadow. Drawing closer, he finally saw what it was.

For a moment, Yang Kai stood there, speechless.

After a while, he burst out laughing, feeling utterly exhilarated.

He discovered that the massive object before him was actually a Source Crystal mine. Fist-sized chunks of Source Crystal broke off from the mountain, then, following the flow of Spiritual Qi, split into eighteen branches and shot upward.

The Source Crystals collected above clearly all came from this enormous mine.

The entire mine gleamed brightly, without the slightest impurity—its quality was pure. Such a vast and flawless Source Crystal mine could hardly be found anywhere in the Star Realm; only in ancient times could such a thing exist.

Silently sensing the eighteen surging branches of Spiritual Qi above the mine, Yang Kai fell into thought.

“Eighteen Spirit Sources… they’re actually connected? If that’s the case, if I take this mine away, then the people above…”

He frowned, thinking for a while, then could no longer suppress his excitement. His vast Divine Sense surged out like a flood dragon from the Sea of Consciousness, rolling forth as an invisible force to envelop the mine.

In the next instant, Yang Kai’s face changed, turning deathly pale. Beads of sweat the size of soybeans rolled down his forehead, and his whole body trembled.

He had underestimated the size of the mine. With the strength of his Divine Sense, he could barely wrap around it, but could not force it into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The Xuan Realm Pearl was a world unto itself and could take in anything, even living people. But to collect something, Yang Kai had to expend Divine Sense, and the amount required depended on the object’s size, the density of Spiritual Qi, and its resistance.

Just like the first time he put his Incarnation into the Xuan Realm Pearl—even though the Incarnation did not resist and even cooperated, its size still left Yang Kai instantly drained.

The same logic applied to the mine before him. Though much smaller than the Incarnation had been at first, it was a Source Crystal mine, brimming with energy. If he forced it, his Sea of Consciousness might be damaged.

With that thought, he sent a message to his Incarnation inside the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The next moment, the rift in the Xuan Realm Pearl widened, becoming a massive spatial crack before Yang Kai.

Veins bulged on Yang Kai’s forehead, his whole body trembling violently as his Origin Qi surged chaotically.

“Do it!” he suddenly shouted.

In the next instant, two giant arms reached out from the enormous spatial crack—unyielding and angular, they were clearly the arms of the Incarnation.

The Incarnation’s arms crossed realms, embracing the massive mine from both sides. With a mighty heave, it lifted the mine. Such a shocking scene was truly a feat of strength to move mountains and shake the world! Only the Stone Puppet race could possess such brute force.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged like a tide, coordinating with the Incarnation to push the mine into the spatial crack.

Rumble…

A tremendous noise rang out.

The mine slowly rose, moving bit by bit.

Yang Kai’s face grew even paler, his clothes soaked with sweat, and a stabbing pain like thousands of needles pierced his head.

Such reckless action had already damaged his Divine Sense.

The Warm Spirit Lotus radiated multicolored light, its gentle power soothing his wounded Divine Sense, making him feel much better.

Meanwhile, the Incarnation’s arms, crossing realms, creaked and groaned, bits of stone constantly falling from them. Even it seemed unable to bear the weight, making onlookers anxious.

It seemed to last only a moment, yet also like ten thousand years.

Just as Yang Kai was about to collapse, the Incarnation inside the Xuan Realm Pearl suddenly pulled its arms back, yanking the Source Crystal mine into the spatial crack, where it vanished.

At the same time, the Xuan Realm Pearl flashed wildly, and the rift snapped shut.

Yang Kai staggered, tasting blood and salt in his mouth and nose, his vision spinning as he collapsed to the ground.

Only then did a wave of fear wash over him.

Even with the Warm Spirit Lotus protecting his Divine Sense, such recklessness was still dangerous. If he overexerted his Divine Sense and caused chaos in his soul, he might never recover.

A cold sweat trickled down his forehead, leaving Yang Kai chilled to the bone.

Suddenly, Yang Kai whipped his head around, his eyes flashing with a frosty light as he glared in a certain direction and shouted, “Who’s there!”

In that instant, he heard footsteps.

Now completely drained, he could barely move. If someone meant him harm, he couldn’t even run. So Yang Kai grew wary, hurriedly wiping the blood and sweat from his face, then sat cross-legged, feigning calm.

After Yang Kai called out, the footsteps paused briefly, then quickly approached, growing faster.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, his gaze sharpening as he stared at the newcomer.

Soon, a graceful figure appeared before Yang Kai, stopping about three zhang away. She hesitated, then said, “Master Yang?”

Hearing her voice, Yang Kai frowned, his expression turning odd. “Why is it you?!”

He realized it was Ye Qinghan, the woman who clung to him like a leech and couldn’t be shaken off.

He hadn’t expected her to come down as well.

Yang Kai immediately grew wary, his voice cold. “Why aren’t you above collecting Source Crystals? What are you doing down here?”

He didn’t know what this woman wanted, but they had no ties, and he’d already rejected her clearly. Yet she still pestered him, which greatly annoyed Yang Kai.

Ye Qinghan replied, “I lack the strength, and I’m the only one from Chiyue Sect here this time. I can’t compete with others.”

Her words were full of bitterness and loneliness.

“Seeing Master Yang come down, I thought I’d take a look too…” As she spoke, she suddenly coughed lightly.

“You’re hurt?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“Just a small injury…” Ye Qinghan replied. “I was struck when I came down.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai more or less understood what had happened.

At this moment, everyone was occupying their own Spirit Sources. For Ye Qinghan to come down, she must have passed through one, and others likely thought she was trying to snatch Source Crystals, so they attacked her. With her Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, it was only natural she couldn’t escape unscathed.
