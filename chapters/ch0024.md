## Chapter 24 — Earth-Grade Low-Level Blood Lingzhi

Shopkeeper Meng sized him up, noticing the mix of anticipation and nervousness in his expression. Cautiously, he opened the package with gentle hands and squinted to peer inside.

The specimen was about the size of a bowl’s mouth, dark red in color, resembling a mushroom yet also a lingzhi. Its shape was quite impressive, exuding the aura of a rare treasure born of heaven and earth.

“Cough… cough cough…” Shopkeeper Meng cleared his throat a few times.

Yang Kai looked at him anxiously and asked softly, “What is this thing?”

Meng’s expression grew strange as he glanced at Yang Kai but did not answer. Instead, he asked, “Where… did you find this?”

“In a cave. There was a first-level demon beast guarding it, but I killed it and then harvested this,” Yang Kai replied.

Meng’s heart skipped a beat. “You encountered a demon beast? Didn’t I tell you not to venture too deep?”

“I didn’t go deep. I don’t know how it ended up on the outskirts of Black Wind Mountain,” Yang Kai said, feeling somewhat wronged.

Meng sighed inwardly. This young man’s current state was likely due to that battle with the demon beast. Given his strength, even facing a first-level demon beast would not be easy.

Poor boy. At such a young age, he had struggled for three days in Black Wind Mountain to earn a mere sixteen Contribution Points, and yet he had fought a first-level demon beast, barely escaping with his life. If he knew what this thing was… no, that wouldn’t do—it would only hurt him.

Well, rare is the chance to do a good deed. Consider it an act of virtue.

Seeing Shopkeeper Meng’s solemn expression but no answer forthcoming, Yang Kai grew anxious. Just as he was about to ask again, Meng took a sip of tea, smacked his lips, and forced a smile. “You’re quite lucky, young man.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s heart finally relaxed. He had worried that the item was worthless, which would have been a great embarrassment.

“Shopkeeper Meng, what exactly is this? How many Contribution Points is it worth?” Yang Kai rubbed his hands together eagerly.

“Hmm… this is called Blood Lingzhi! A rare medicinal herb, it’s a Common-grade…” Meng began, but seeing the disappointment flash across Yang Kai’s face, he hurriedly corrected himself, “No, no, no, it’s definitely Earth-grade Low-level! Yes, that’s right!”

His tone was so firm that even Meng almost believed it himself.

“Earth-grade Low-level?” Yang Kai brightened. “Shopkeeper Meng, are you sure you’re not mistaken?”

Meng’s face turned serious. “Nonsense. I have studied countless herbs in my life—cough, cough—and have trained my eyes to spot them. How could I be wrong?”

“How many Contribution Points can it be exchanged for?” Yang Kai was only interested in that.

“Let’s say twenty points.”

“That few?” Yang Kai felt a bit disappointed. He had expected that if it was Earth-level, it would be worth at least several dozen points.

“Not bad, young man,” Meng thought to himself. This was a freebie, after all; he couldn’t give too much. But outwardly, he offered an excuse, “Although this Blood Lingzhi is indeed Earth-grade Low-level, it is small and not very mature, so it’s only worth twenty points.”

“Oh.” Yang Kai didn’t argue and readily agreed, “Then twenty points it is.”

Meng nodded and recorded it.

This time, besides the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs he needed, Yang Kai had earned a total of thirty-six Contribution Points. Counting what he had saved before, he now had forty-eight points. He suddenly felt somewhat flush with wealth.

However, while venturing into the mountains to gather herbs could earn Contribution Points, it also took up valuable cultivation time and relied heavily on luck. It felt somewhat counterproductive. Despite his enthusiasm, Yang Kai decided that unless absolutely necessary, he would avoid doing this in the future.

The purpose of accumulating Contribution Points was to aid cultivation. Yang Kai could distinguish the priority between the two and was not blinded by this windfall.

He now had plenty of Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers—he had gathered thirty or forty in that cave alone. But the Desolate Deadwood Herbs were scarce, only five or six. If he wanted to use them for cultivation, it would not be enough; he would have to exchange some at the Contribution Hall as a precaution.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai said, “Shopkeeper Meng, give me ten Desolate Deadwood Herbs.”

Meng glanced at him, curious about the purpose but asked no questions. Instead, he leisurely said, “Ten low-grade Common herbs will cost ten Contribution Points. Are you sure you want them?”

Yang Kai frowned, suspicious. “Wait, didn’t you say earlier that two herbs could be exchanged for one Contribution Point?”

“The buying price and selling price are different,” Meng smiled brightly, exuding the unmistakable aura of a shrewd merchant.

Yang Kai was furious, pointing at Meng’s nose. “This is pure profiteering, taking advantage of the difference. It’s shameful. Have you no conscience?”

Meng waved his hand. “This isn’t profiteering; these prices are set by the sect. It’s not my doing. Everything in the Contribution Hall is clearly marked, fair to all. I’m just the caretaker. Otherwise, how do you think the sect supports three thousand disciples?”

Yang Kai was stunned but it made sense. Business is about making money. Without some means, how could the vast Lingxiao Pavilion sustain three thousand disciples? Although it seemed like profiteering, no one forced him to buy or sell.

“Do you still want the Desolate Deadwood Herbs?” Meng asked, seeing the pained look on Yang Kai’s face and feeling pleased.

“Yes.” Yang Kai gritted his teeth. He would need them sooner or later. Since he didn’t want to gather herbs himself, buying here was the only option.

Meng turned and went to the back room. Soon, he returned with ten Desolate Deadwood Herbs. Yang Kai counted them carefully, and Meng recorded the transaction.

“Hmph!” Feeling a bit cheated, Yang Kai was displeased but took the herbs and turned to leave.

“Come again anytime!” Meng called after him warmly.

“Come again to be fleeced,” Yang Kai thought, finally understanding why this Meng was nicknamed Skin-Peeler Meng.

He quickened his pace, hurrying out. At the entrance, a figure suddenly darted in, nearly colliding with him.

Both reacted swiftly; Yang Kai stopped abruptly, and so did the other. A refreshing fragrance wafted over.

Looking up, Yang Kai saw a pair of eyes as bright as the moon fixed on him, but the face was obscured by a veil.

It was a woman. Though her features were hidden, judging by her skin tone, she was likely young—probably his senior sister.

Yang Kai nodded to her apologetically and stepped aside, signaling her to enter first.

Unexpectedly, she hesitated, her ears flushing red, and her gaze became shy and evasive.

Seeing this, Yang Kai thought this senior sister was quite bashful. He quickly averted his eyes to avoid embarrassing her.

Xia Ningshang was mortified.

She had never expected to run into Yang Kai at the Contribution Hall’s entrance. Seeing his face reminded her of her own… and of him…

In an instant, her face flushed deeply, her ears burning. She hurried inside without raising her head.

Yang Kai found it amusing. Such a timid woman was rare. Many female disciples in Lingxiao Pavilion were straightforward, especially those who practiced martial arts. But she blushed just from a glance, no wonder she wore a veil.

This senior sister was rather endearing. Yet, why did her fragrance seem so familiar, as if he had smelled it somewhere before?
