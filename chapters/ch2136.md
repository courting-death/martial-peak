## Chapter 2136 — Reunion with Bian Yuqing

A fierce battle between dragons and tigers was resolved without a trace, all thanks to the intervention of an Emperor Realm expert.

"Is that enough?" Meanwhile, in a certain area of the Star God Palace residence, Xiao Yuyang looked at Gao Xueting and Chen Wenhao and asked.

Gao Xueting said, "Thank you for your trouble, Lord Xiao!"

Chen Wenhao also nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

Although the rising stars of the two great sects had a somewhat unpleasant encounter, it did not affect the relationship between their Emperor Realm elders. In their eyes, it was just the young showing off their competitive spirit.

Who hasn't gone through such a phase?

"No matter, but... those two youngsters are quite lively." Xiao Yuyang chuckled.

"Elder Gao has Xia Sheng under her tutelage, and Brother Chen has Wuchang. Truly enviable!" Feng Ming suddenly spoke sourly from the side.

Gao Xueting glanced at him and said, "Doesn't Wuhua Hall have Zhuang Bufan?"

Feng Ming smiled, "Bufan may have an extraordinary name, but he only has an ordinary physique. How could he compare to those two youngsters?"

"Brother Feng, didn't you pass down your Heaven-Reversing Phantom Nether Art to your hall?" Chen Wenhao looked at Feng Ming and said, "There's no need for excessive modesty at a time like this. Too much humility is just hypocrisy."

"Heh..." Feng Ming grinned in response.

"Enough, how long do you all plan to keep probing each other?" Xiao Yuyang couldn't help but roll his eyes. "It's good for the youngsters to be lively. Us old folks should just watch and not interfere. We're all from the Southern Territory, internal strife does no good."

"Lord Xiao is right!" Everyone nodded in agreement.

"By the way, Lord Xiao..." Gao Xueting suddenly said, "About the matter when the three of us went to Star God Palace for guidance... is there any reply?"

Hearing this, Feng Ming and Chen Wenhao both became serious and listened intently.

Xiao Yuyang frowned. After pondering for a while, he said, "Regarding that Ancient Great Demon... the Emperor said the demon was not destroyed, only lying dormant. But as for where exactly, the Emperor does not know."

"Even the Emperor doesn't know?" Feng Ming's expression changed.

"The Emperor only told me ten words!" Xiao Yuyang said solemnly.

"Which ten words?" Gao Xueting asked.

"Like death but not dead. Like life but not alive!"

"What... does that mean?" Feng Ming was confused.

Xiao Yuyang spread his hands, "I don't understand either. But rest assured, that Ancient Great Demon has been sealed for so many years, his powers are long gone. If he dares show himself and cause trouble again, this Lord will personally deal with him."

"With Lord Xiao's words, we can rest easy." Chen Wenhao breathed a sigh of relief and nodded.

Last time, he, Feng Ming, and Gao Xueting joined forces against the Ancient Great Demon. Unfortunately, at the final moment, they failed, and the demon used a powerful technique to trap them in a boundless world of darkness. By the time they escaped, the Demonic Master had vanished. Helpless, they went to Star God Palace to request an audience with the Radiant Moon Emperor, hoping for guidance.

Sadly, the three went to Star God Palace but did not meet the Emperor. In the end, they could only tell Xiao Yuyang and let him pass on the message.

Gao Xueting, upon arriving, immediately sought out Xiao Yuyang, wanting to know information about the Demonic Master.

"Alright, let's set aside the Demonic Master for now. Let's talk about this Four Seasons Land." Xiao Yuyang said.

Hearing this, everyone knew he was about to discuss the matter of the Star Seals, and their expressions became serious.

...

At the Qingyang Shrine residence, Yang Kai, who had been sitting cross-legged to rest and recover, suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes, looking in a certain direction.

After frowning and pondering for a moment, he stood up and walked that way.

"Junior Brother Yang..." Murong Xiaoxiao called out hurriedly when she saw this. "Where are you going?"

She had been bitten once and was now twice shy. She had just wanted to visit old friends at Star God Palace, but it unexpectedly caused a commotion, resulting in Xia Sheng being put in confinement. She felt very guilty.

Now, seeing Yang Kai about to leave their spot, she quickly asked with concern.

"Just taking a walk!" Yang Kai smiled.

"Then be careful." Murong Xiaoxiao didn't stop him, just reminded him.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and continued forward.

"Why care about outsiders' life or death?" Xiao Baiyi grumbled unhappily from the side.

Murong Xiaoxiao said, "Junior Brother Yang did come with us..."

"You still call him Junior Brother?" Xiao Baiyi glared at Murong Xiaoxiao. "He's not a disciple of our Shrine!"

Murong Xiaoxiao stuck out her tongue and said, "Senior Brother Xiao, you really don't like him, huh?"

"It's not that I dislike him," Xiao Baiyi snorted, "I just don't think much of him!"

Murong Xiaoxiao slowly shook her head and said no more.

On the other side, Yang Kai walked on until he left the valley and arrived at a dense forest, where he stopped.

The wind rustled, and the leaves made a soft noise.

Yang Kai sighed and said, "Since you called me over, why not show yourself?"

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard a burst of girlish laughter. Then, a beautiful figure suddenly appeared atop a tree, looking down at him with eyes full of curiosity and oddness.

She stared at Yang Kai, clicking her tongue, "I never expected that in such a short time, you've already advanced to the Dao Origin Realm. As expected of an expert from a lower Star Domain, your talent is truly extraordinary!"

Yang Kai looked up at her and grinned, "Protector Bian, it's been a while!"

The woman who had secretly sent him a message to meet here was none other than Bian Yuqing, one of the Four Great Protectors of Biyu Sect!

It was also this woman who had brought him into Biyu Sect.

That was Yang Kai's first stop after arriving in the Star Realm!

Bian Yuqing knew some of his background and understood he was a martial artist from a lower Star Domain. Because of this, she accepted him as a disciple. Otherwise, with Yang Kai's Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation at the time, Bian Yuqing probably wouldn't have spared him a glance.

This woman possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!

Seeing Bian Yuqing, Yang Kai remembered Liu Qianyun, who had come with him back then. Like him, she was also from a lower Star Domain, but from a place called Great Wilderness Star Domain, and was also accepted into Biyu Sect by Bian Yuqing.

Unfortunately, during their escape, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun were separated.

So much time had passed, and he didn't know how Liu Qianyun was doing.

"I'm glad you still remember me," Bian Yuqing said with a charming smile. As Yang Kai was lost in thought, she lightly pushed off with her feet and descended gracefully before him like a goddess from the heavens.

"Protector Bian, your great kindness is etched in my heart. How could I forget?" Yang Kai smiled.

Although Bian Yuqing may have had other motives for accepting him into Biyu Sect, she never mistreated him, nor did she go out of her way to help him. So Yang Kai's attitude toward her was rather neutral; he said the words, but didn't truly feel indebted.

Bian Yuqing looked at him and said, "Your skill at lying with your eyes open has improved! If you truly remembered my kindness, why did you come here so reluctantly?"

"How could I?" Yang Kai put on a wronged expression. "I just didn't expect to meet Protector Bian here." After a pause, he said, "Protector Bian, you didn't come alone, did you?"

As he spoke, he glanced to the side, intentionally or not.

Bian Yuqing raised her eyebrows in surprise, "You're quite perceptive, kid..."

She waved to the side, "Stop hiding. Come out."

As soon as she finished, another person's hearty laughter rang out, "Haha, Junior Brother Yang! It's been a while, and you're still as impressive as ever!"

Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists, "Senior Brother Kou!"

This man was none other than Kou Wu! He was Bian Yuqing's trusted aide. Kou Wu was the first Dao Origin Realm expert Yang Kai met after arriving in the Star Realm, and it was he who brought Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun before Bian Yuqing.

Unlike Bian Yuqing, who preferred to keep her hands off, Kou Wu had looked after Yang Kai somewhat during those days, so Yang Kai’s impression of him was still fairly good.

"Junior Brother Yang has already reached the Dao Origin Realm. Truly surprising," Kou Wu said, looking Yang Kai up and down in amazement.

After all, when he first met Yang Kai, the latter was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and knew nothing about the Star Realm. It hadn't been long, yet Yang Kai was now at the same level as him.

No wonder the rumors say that martial artists from lower Star Domains are all exceptionally talented and have extraordinary potential. He hadn't believed it before, but after seeing Yang Kai, he had to believe it.

"Just lucky," Yang Kai replied casually.

"But... what surprises me even more is that you've become a disciple of Qingyang Shrine? It seems Qingyang Shrine has invested a lot in you!" Bian Yuqing smiled.

She had just spotted Yang Kai while watching the commotion, so she secretly sent him a message to meet.

Since Yang Kai was at the Qingyang Shrine residence, she naturally assumed he had joined them. If so, it would explain his rapid advancement to the Dao Origin Realm.

Qingyang Shrine was not like Biyu Sect, a small sect without even a single Emperor Realm expert. Their resources were abundant.

"Protector Bian, you've misunderstood..." Yang Kai shook his head, "I'm not a member of Qingyang Shrine."

"Do you take me for a blind woman?" Bian Yuqing glared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said, "It's just that, for certain reasons, I came here with the people from Qingyang Shrine... Believe it or not."

"Is that so?" Bian Yuqing was surprised. Although she found it odd, she felt Yang Kai had no reason to lie about this, so she didn't press further.

"I'm curious, Protector Bian and Senior Brother Kou, which force are you representing here?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Kou Wu replied, "Of course, Biyu Sect!"

"You're still with Biyu Sect?" Yang Kai's expression changed, and he immediately thought of Biyu Sect's Sect Master, Wu Mengchuan.

That guy was a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Emperor. After Yang Kai released him from the Bone Prison, he turned Biyu Sect upside down. Miao Qi, Tong Cong, and Zhu Junshan, the three sect protectors, were no match for him and were killed on the spot.

Only Bian Yuqing escaped because she was away on business at the time.
