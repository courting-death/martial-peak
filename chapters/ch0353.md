## Chapter 353 — Who Dares Move

The members of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower had been enduring a tough time lately. Not only were they frequently assigned to the most dangerous positions in battles against Cangyun Evil Land, but even during their moments of rest at the camp, they often faced ridicule and taunts from others.

In this location, there were five or six forces gathered. Aside from the leading Xiang Family, a first-rate aristocratic family, the others were all second or third-rate sects.

These forces, in terms of combat prowess and manpower, were comparable to Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower, with some even being slightly inferior. Yet, they still dared to kick them while they were down, coming over to mock them when in good spirits and shouting insults when in bad moods.

It was as if the members of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower owed them something.

When Hu Man and Xiao Ruohan were still present, there was some apprehension among them, but since these experts had left and only a few young disciples remained, the situation became increasingly dire.

Among them, the personnel from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyards were the most malicious.

During these days, the people from Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang had been provoked and mocked by them on several occasions. However, given the numerous casualties among their disciples, with only a handful surviving, they could only endure.

Fang Ziqi and his group were already on edge and naturally did not want to attract any trouble.

The repeated patience and concession only made Leiguang and Feihong Courtyards think they were easy prey. Today, seeing them enjoying a bonfire, feasting and drinking, they could not let such an opportunity slip by.

Since there was no battle at this site, why not seek some amusement to pass the long night?

The menacing gazes of more than a dozen members from Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang did not affect Xie Rong and Li Fu in the slightest. The two continued to wear disdainful smiles, as if they did not even regard the others.

“Everyone sit down!” Guan Chile had a gloomy expression, rolling his eyes, and spoke sternly to the crowd.

More than ten young disciples clenched their teeth in hatred and made fists that cracked as they sighed but had no choice but to swallow their anger and slowly sat down.

Though they were brimming with youthful vigor, they understood that if a conflict truly broke out, they would ultimately be the ones to suffer.

Not to mention whether they could win a fight or not, even if they did, they would face scrutiny from the Xiang Family afterward. By then, the positions of the two sects would become even more perilous.

One by one the disciples took their seats. Fang Ziqi was the last to sit, his smile twisted and a bulging vein trembling on his face.

Even with a hundred grievances in his heart, he had to endure.

Yang Kai appeared unaffected, shaking off some dust from the meat he was roasting and calmly looking at the newcomers.

Some among this group had reached True Essence Realm, while many were at Separation and Union Realm, their strength not particularly high. Yet, under Yang Kai's sharp perception, he sensed several threads of Divine Sense enveloping their area.

Among them, two of the Divine Senses were filled with vigilance and hostility. They must belong to the elders of Xie Rong and Li Fu, watching for any signs of Guan Chile getting violent.

Additionally, there were two stronger Divine Senses, emanating from the two experts beside Xiang Chu.

Realizing this, Yang Kai grinned silently.

Usually, after the members of Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang endured provocations, Xie Rong and his group would not continue. But today, they clearly were not willing to let it go so easily.

Once the crowd had taken their seats, Xie Rong and Li Fu did not leave. Instead, Li Fu took a couple of steps forward, her small mouth covered as she smiled at the sisters from the Hu Family. She spoke, “Are the two sisters well? I heard you both escaped from Cangyun Evil Land. I’m quite curious—there are demons all around in Cangyun Evil Land, and both of you are so exceptionally beautiful, attracting attention. How did you manage to escape?”

Hu Jiao’er frowned slightly, looking at Li Fu with displeasure and said, “What are you trying to say?”

Li Fu chuckled, her voice playful, “What I meant was that I’m curious about how you two safely returned. If it’s convenient, could you share the story? For instance, what kind of people did you meet along the way, and how many times did you have to use your looks to survive those demons' hands…”

The expressions of Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er darkened at her words.

“Apologies, I misspoke,” Li Fu said lightly, but there was no sincerity in her expression.

The men behind her now looked at the sisters from the Hu Family with unusual gazes, as if they were viewing discarded shoes, their looks filled with disdain and concealed greed.

“I’m also quite curious,” Xie Rong chuckled sinisterly. “Not just us, everyone here is curious about how you two managed to survive that place.” 

Hu Jiao’er maintained a dark expression, her chest rising and falling, and suddenly smiled charmingly, “What does it have to do with you?”

“Of course it has to do with us,” Li Fu replied with a sly grin. “If the two of you hadn't relied on your allure to escape, then you must be colluding with the demons there. Otherwise, why would they let you leave? Perhaps you’re spies sent by those demons to spy on us. If you’re spies from Cangyun Evil Land, then there must be others monitoring you here!”

“Exactly!” Xie Rong's expression turned icy as his gaze suddenly landed on Yang Kai, staring intently. “This fellow here seems unfamiliar. Where do you hail from?”

Yang Kai, who was busy eating, furrowed his brows at the question, suddenly realizing the group had come for him.

All previous provocations were but preludes.

“Not convenient to say!” He shook his head, his expression indifferent.

“Is it inconvenient or you're afraid to say?” Li Fu shot back coldly.

Xie Rong, with a grave countenance, looked at the sisters from the Hu Family and said, “He was brought here by the two of you; you should know his origins!”

“Unknown, we met on the way,” Hu Jiao’er turned her head away.

How could Yang Kai casually divulge his background? Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang had faced misfortune merely due to being adjacent to Lingxiao Pavilion. If he disclosed his sect, it could lead to immense trouble.

Making up a random background was also unreliable, as it could be exposed immediately.

“Clearly there’s an issue!” Xie Rong shouted harshly and waved his hand decisively. “Seize him!”

“Who dares!” Fang Ziqi roared angrily, springing to his feet as vast True Essence erupted.

At his movement, others immediately responded, each of them keeping watch on Leiguang and Feihong Courtyards’ people. The latter would not back down either, weapons unsheathing in quick succession, True Essence secretly fueling.

In that instant, the tension in the air was palpable.

“Hehe!” Xie Rong grinned ominously. “If you dare to protect someone from Cangyun Evil Land, you’re all doomed.”

His smile was twisted and cunning, as though he had concocted a scheme that bore fruit. As he reined in his smile, he said in a lowered voice, “Attack!”

As his voice fell, the two Divine Senses that had been lurking in the area suddenly struck, transforming into sharp attacks directed straight at Yang Kai's mind with decisive killing intent.

Realizing something was amiss, Guan Chile's expression changed drastically, shouting, “Be careful!”

The two silent attacks penetrated Yang Kai's mind but became disoriented within the Soul Palace before delving deeper.

Yang Kai's expression darkened, his gaze turning cold.

He had thought this group merely wanted to provoke trouble, but it was evidently not the case.

Following the direction of the incoming Divine Sense, a flicker of purple light suddenly dashed across the night sky.

An intense, chilling sensation spread out but soon vanished, leaving everyone to think it was an illusion.

Two muffled thuds echoed from not far away, and the faces of the Divine Roaming Realm experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyards turned ashen, their eyes filled with bloodshot veins as they nearly collapsed.

In that moment, both were simultaneously attacked by a soul technique, laced with insidious malice and icy cold, which nearly sealed their Sea of Consciousness.

Fortunately, they detected something was wrong and immediately counterattacked to defend themselves; otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.

Recovering quickly, they exchanged glances, seeing the horror and dread reflected in each other's eyes.

Meanwhile, outside, Yang Kai had already moved.

After retaliating against the two Divine Roaming Realm experts' attacks, he became a gust of wind, arriving before Xie Rong in an instant.

Before the cunning and smug look on Xie Rong's face could fade, a large hand seized his neck, the scorching True Yang Yuan Qi crashing against him, causing immense pain in Xie Rong's throat.

Just as the scream escaped his lips, a powerful fist slammed into his eyes, plunging him into dizziness, rendering him unable to see.

“Ah…” Li Fu's complexion drastically changed, never having expected that Yang Kai could survive the assault of two Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Before she could react, Yang Kai's other hand had already grasped her slender neck.

With both hands exerting force inwardly, Xie Rong and Li Fu slammed together with a thud, the immense force making them feel numb on one side of their bodies.

Even the True Essence they hastily circulated suddenly dissipated with that collision.

Both were elites in their respective sects, but at this moment, in Yang Kai's grasp, they felt as fragile as children, utterly powerless to resist.

Thud… 

The two were hurled to the ground like meteorites, creating small craters in the earth, accompanied by the sound of bones cracking as they screamed in unison.

Only then did everyone present finally come to their senses.

Swish, swish, swish… 

The disciples of Leiguang and Feihong Courtyards watched Yang Kai warily, each mobilizing their techniques.

“Who dares move!” Yang Kai stepped on Li Fu's beautiful face, pressing it into the dirt, his brutish action making everyone’s eyelids jump.

In his other hand, the swirling True Essence nearly solidified, resembling a dagger pressed against Xie Rong's chest.

Under the night, the flickering bonfire illuminated Yang Kai's face, which was exceedingly grim and terrifying.

Members of Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang stood in shock, rooted to the spot, unable to believe their eyes.

“Who dares move!” Fang Ziqi was the first to regain his wits, angrily throwing a jar of wine into the bonfire.

With a loud explosion, the fire erupted into a dragon-like blaze, leaping high into the sky, intensifying the tension and excitement in the scene.
