## Chapter 2221 — Shaking the Emperor

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s heart instantly sank.

“Then, my lord, your subordinates…” Yang Kai asked again.

“They’ll be here soon!” Ban Qing replied impatiently, frowning. “This Lord prefers to act alone…” After speaking, he eyed Yang Kai suspiciously. “Why are you asking all this?”

“It’s nothing.” Yang Kai took a deep breath and said slowly, “It’s just that… I’m about to offend you!”

As soon as the words fell, his whole body turned into a stream of light, charging straight at Ban Qing.

Yang Kai understood very well that since Heavenly Yao Mountain was now sealed off, and besides Ban Qing, there were three other Emperor Realm experts searching elsewhere, and Ban Qing’s subordinates hadn’t arrived yet, now was the best time to deal with him.

Escape was unrealistic. Not only was Ban Qing skilled in stealth and assassination, with exquisite movement techniques—Yang Kai might not even be able to escape. Even if he did, where could he go in the vast Heavenly Yao Mountain? If he was unlucky, he’d run into someone else and be caught between them, with no hope left.

It was better to fight Ban Qing while he was alone. If he lost, he could still try to escape. If he won… there’d be no need to run.

“Oh?” Ban Qing raised his eyebrows, apparently not expecting Yang Kai to be so bold—not only bold, but also able to move freely under his pressure.

He hadn’t paid Yang Kai any mind before, because there was an absolute gap in strength between them. Once an Emperor Realm’s might was released, a Dao Origin Realm martial artist couldn’t move at all.

The middle-aged man lying on the ground was the best proof of this.

In Ban Qing’s eyes, Yang Kai’s strength was about the same as that man’s—both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Only Yang Kai’s soul was a bit more solid, almost at the threshold of the Emperor Realm.

But that still didn’t mean much. Without crossing into the Emperor Realm, there would always be a gulf between them.

He was certain that under his pressure, Yang Kai wouldn’t even be able to move a finger.

Yet when Yang Kai actually moved, he was as swift as the wind and as fierce as thunder, seemingly unaffected by the pressure at all.

This discovery surprised Ban Qing—and made him a bit angry.

With a cold snort, he stood still, unleashing his full pressure to envelop Yang Kai.

"Ugh…" Mid-charge, Yang Kai grunted as his body suddenly paused. In that instant, he felt as if the space around him had solidified, greatly restricting his movement.

“You’ve got courage, but… you’re utterly foolish!” Ban Qing looked at Yang Kai coldly, his eyes full of disdain.

“Is it really wise for you to look down on others like this, my lord?” Yang Kai shouted, unleashing all his soul power, which ignited into blazing flames around his body.

The flames burned and danced, making Yang Kai look like a man of fire. The temperature around him soared, and the lush trees withered in the blink of an eye. The ground turned to scorched earth.

“Divine Sense Fire!” Ban Qing’s eyes narrowed in shock.

Mutated Divine Sense power was rare anywhere, but undeniably powerful—especially fire-attribute Divine Sense, always known for its dominance and destructive force.

Crackle, crackle…

All around, a dense cracking sound rang out—the sound of Ban Qing’s Emperor Realm pressure shattering.

With the Divine Sense Fire unleashed, the pressure on Yang Kai was greatly reduced. He turned into a streak of fire, lunging at Ban Qing, fist blazing as he struck down hard.

“No wonder you’re so arrogant. Turns out you’ve got some skill.” Facing this terrifying blow, Ban Qing showed no panic, only commented blandly, then tapped his foot and drifted back.

With that step, he seemed to cross the barrier of space. When he reappeared, he was already more than ten zhang away from Yang Kai.

The fierce punch hit nothing but air.

“With the same cultivation, there are few in this world who could be your match. But…” Ban Qing sneered, “This Lord is at the Emperor Realm. Are you still dreaming? Hm?”

That last word was shouted, and the already heavy pressure suddenly increased.

The flames around Yang Kai flickered wildly, and he felt as if a mountain was pressing down on him, his body sinking.

Under the crushing pressure, Yang Kai let out a furious roar, gritting his teeth against the pain wracking his body. Forcing himself to move, he broke free from the suffocating force and, with a sudden burst of speed, charged at Ban Qing once more.

“Are you trying to die, boy?” For the first time, Ban Qing looked serious, shouting in a low voice.

Forcing his way through the pressure like this was extremely damaging to himself—one misstep and his soul could be destroyed.

But Yang Kai didn’t seem to care, showing no fear of such consequences, determined to risk his life!

Ban Qing had never met someone like this. The best way to describe him: a true madman!

“Since you refuse to see reality, I’ll make it clear for you!” Ban Qing shouted in anger, thrusting his palm forward. A surge of power erupted from his hand, sweeping Yang Kai up in a tide of energy.

Thud thud thud…

Yang Kai was blasted backward, pained groans and muffled cries escaping his lips, the flames around him dimming sharply.

Clearly, Yang Kai was injured by this blow!

The might of the Emperor Realm was extraordinary from the very first move.

However, with the Warm Spirit Lotus as his foundation, Yang Kai had little to worry about. Anyone else would have already wanted to retreat and find a place to heal.

But Yang Kai didn’t need to. As long as his soul wasn’t shattered or destroyed, the Warm Spirit Lotus could restore him over time.

He had the capital to be reckless.

Staggering, face dark, Yang Kai had barely steadied himself when Ban Qing suddenly vanished.

The next moment, Ban Qing’s voice sounded at Yang Kai’s side, cold and indifferent: “Now… do you understand?”

It had to be said that Ban Qing was truly skilled in stealth and assassination. His movements were completely without warning—there was no gap between disappearing and striking again.

In his hand was still that dagger condensed from soul energy, and this strike aimed straight for Yang Kai’s chest.

It was exactly the same move he’d used on the middle-aged man.

But at that moment, the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth curled up in a strange, subtle smile.

In the next instant, a purple light flared, and a barrier of light appeared around Yang Kai, enveloping him.

Ding…

A crisp sound rang out.

Ban Qing’s attack struck the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier. The protective screen formed by the Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level Divine Soul Secret Treasure couldn’t withstand the terrifying blow. It shattered at the point of impact, turning to motes of light and vanishing in an instant.

With just a casual move, Ban Qing broke through the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier’s defense!

This Divine Soul Secret Treasure was greatly damaged by the blow and would need to be nourished and repaired with soul power before Yang Kai could use it again.

But that was enough…

“What the hell is that?” Ban Qing looked stunned.

Though he was one of the four Deputy Commanders of the Divine Roaming Nation, he had never seen a Divine Soul Secret Treasure before. So after destroying Yang Kai’s Ziyang Profound Light Barrier, his first reaction was that something was off.

Before he could figure it out, a sudden buzzing filled the world.

With the buzzing, Ban Qing inexplicably felt his soul tremble—a fear and dread that came from instinct, the kind that only arose when facing an irresistible danger.

Ban Qing’s eyes widened as he stared at Yang Kai’s hand.

He saw that, at some point, a blade had appeared in Yang Kai’s hand.

It looked like an ordinary blade—nothing flashy or exaggerated, the kind you might see anywhere. But this blade filled Ban Qing with a deep, instinctive fear. The faint buzzing from the blade seemed to call to his soul, filling him with terror. The light swirling on the blade looked as if it could devour his very soul, casting him into eternal darkness.

Ban Qing immediately sensed danger and tried to retreat.

But it was already too late.

In that instant, the space around them froze.

The power of Spatial Law!

Though Yang Kai had entered this place as a Spirit Body, without a physical body and unable to use ordinary Secret Treasures or secret arts, his understanding and mastery of Law Power could still be used.

However, secret arts like Moon Blade and exile couldn’t be used, as they required both Origin Qi and soul power to perform—both were necessary.

He had already confirmed this in previous battles with demonic beasts.

These secret arts not only used Law Power, but also required the physical body as a foundation and source of strength.

With Law Power in effect, even an Emperor Realm expert like Ban Qing found his movements stalled.

In that instant, Yang Kai grinned savagely and slashed with his blade.

“Has my lord ever noticed? You seem to have a fondness for striking from your opponent’s right side, always aiming for the heart… Is it simply habit, or are you trying to show off your strength?”

Yang Kai’s words rang in Ban Qing’s ears, full of mockery.

But Ban Qing had no mind for such things. As the blade swept up from below, he felt the call of death—a terrifying aura rushed at him, making his heart tremble.

“Xuanlong Seal!” Ban Qing shouted, surging his soul power. In the next moment, a thick barrier of light appeared before him.

This was clearly a soul secret art, and a powerful one at that.

In the Divine Roaming Mirror world, martial artists had no Secret Treasures or physical bodies, so to grow stronger, they could only enhance their souls and cultivate soul secret arts.

For this reason, martial artists here had mastered soul secret arts to an extraordinary degree—far beyond what Star Realm martial artists could compare to.
