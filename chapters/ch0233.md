## Chapter 233 — Can You Escape?

Without the long sword, Qi Jianxing could still wield his sword techniques. Having reached the True Essence Realm, this level of skill was naturally within his grasp. However, the lethality was indeed reduced, only about ninety percent of his peak power.

Even with a ten percent reduction in power, it was still more than enough to easily defeat you! Qi Jianxing sneered repeatedly.

Just as he was about to make a move, he saw Yang Kai laughing heartily as he pushed out two palms.

Beast Soul Technique! After enduring for so long, he could finally display all his strength; Yang Kai was somewhat impatient.

The White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal were unleashed simultaneously.

A roar of a tiger shook the heavens, followed by the bellow of an ox that was deafening. Qi Jianxing's expression changed drastically as he saw two ferocious-looking Demonic Beasts pouncing towards him.

These two Demonic Beasts were lifelike, their fiery red bodies strikingly beautiful, and their scarlet eyes radiated a chilling killing intent.

In the midst of his shock, how could Qi Jianxing dare to be negligent?

With his fingers together, he transformed them into a sword, sword light flickering at his fingertips as he shouted, “Thunderbolt Sword!”

A sword light crackling with arcs of electricity shot out from his fingertips, striking one of the Demonic Beasts, dimming its color, but it could not stop it in the slightest.

“Wind Sword!” As Qi Jianxing retreated rapidly, he waved his sword, unleashing various techniques from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, yet he still could not defeat the two Demonic Beasts.

Seeing them about to reach him, Qi Jianxing was greatly alarmed, bending his legs and leaping upward.

Just as he jumped a zhang high, a fierce killing intent descended from above.

Looking up, he saw Yang Kai, grinning wickedly, swinging a fist down at him.

He had anticipated his move and blocked his escape route.

In a panic, Qi Jianxing gritted his teeth and pointed his sword skyward, sending three sword lights soaring.

Yang Kai swiftly unleashed three punches, shattering all three sword lights. However, this momentary delay allowed Qi Jianxing to twist his body, avoiding a fatal blow, but he was still struck on the shoulder.

Accompanied by a scream, Qi Jianxing fell towards the ground. In this life-and-death crisis, this elite disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect unleashed unprecedented potential and combat power, his hands moving rapidly as he utilized profound sword techniques to fend off the two attacking Demonic Beasts, nearly dispersing them.

The White Tiger and Divine Ox charged forward but could not harm Qi Jianxing in the slightest; his sword body was still reinforced. Countless small sword lights protected his body. Each attack from the White Tiger and Divine Ox was neutralized by these sword lights.

In a brief moment, the White Tiger and Divine Ox completely vanished.

After all, this was an attack refined from Yang Kai's own Yuan Qi. Once the Yuan Qi was exhausted, it would naturally cease to exist.

“Hehe…” Qi Jianxing let out a miserable laugh, looking at Yang Kai with pride. In his view, expending such vast Yuan Qi to refine these illusory Demonic Beasts was indeed a loss. With Yang Kai at the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, it was impossible for him to refine them a second time; he might as well have saved that Yuan Qi for his own battle.

Before his laughter faded, under Yang Kai's disdainful gaze, yet another Ox and Tiger charged out, identical to the previous ones.

“How is this possible!” Qi Jianxing exclaimed in shock.

“Even if I do not make a move, this technique alone is enough to grind you down!” Yang Kai looked at Qi Jianxing with a cold expression.

Qi Jianxing's expression changed; he understood that Yang Kai was not boasting. Those two Yuan Qi Demonic Beasts were extremely difficult to deal with, and his sword body was already on the verge of collapse. If he were to be struck again, it would surely shatter, and his True Essence would be greatly depleted. He no longer had the previous confidence.

“But I am different from you; I will not underestimate any opponent, so… I will still make my move!” As his voice fell, Yang Kai and the Ox and Tiger launched a combined attack towards Qi Jianxing. The latter would not sit idly by, roaring in anger as he once again wielded his sword.

This time, neither side held back, unleashing their full power. Any oversight or hesitation could lead to irreparable consequences.

The battle was intensely fierce and extraordinarily dangerous.

The two Demonic Beasts dispersed once more, and Yang Kai was struck by two of Qi Jianxing's sword lights, nearly pierced through, blood flowing from his wounds, staining his clothes red.

Qi Jianxing was in an even worse state; facing three opponents, his sword body had been thoroughly destroyed, and his True Essence was nearly exhausted. He gasped for breath, looking disheveled, one arm hanging limply at his side, the forearm a bloody mess from being bitten by the White Tiger.

His chest was also caved in, several ribs broken from the impact of the Divine Ox. The single horn on the Ox's head had nearly pierced him through.

The two men exchanged glances from a distance of over ten zhang. Yang Kai's eyes were cold and indifferent, while Qi Jianxing's face twitched uncontrollably. Though he could hardly believe he was about to be defeated by a martial artist of the Separation and Union Realm, the current reality left him no choice but to accept it.

The humiliation and unwillingness drove him nearly to madness!

Yang Kai did not strike him down; he was wary of the desperate counterattack from a True Essence Realm martial artist on the brink of death. He was waiting for Qi Jianxing's momentum to wane.

“Hehe…” Qi Jianxing showed no signs of worry, still sneering. After taking a few deep breaths, his expression darkened as he said, “I admit, you are indeed strong, stronger than the average True Essence Realm martial artist. But even if you defeat me, what of it? I am a True Essence Realm martial artist; you cannot kill me. If I wish to leave, you cannot stop me!”

Laughing heartily, Qi Jianxing pushed off the ground, leaping thirty zhang high, his body swaying as he hovered in mid-air, one hand hanging at his side and the other clutching his wound, looking down at Yang Kai with a smug expression. “This is the greatest difference between a True Essence Realm and a Separation and Union Realm! I can fly in the air, while you… cannot. So I can leave at any time!”

As he spoke, Qi Jianxing coughed up a mouthful of blood, wiping it away with difficulty, his eyes crazed as he looked at Yang Kai, saying in a low voice, “I will remember this humiliation. When we meet again, I will take your life! You better pray you can live to that day!”

With that, he squinted his eyes, as if to engrave Yang Kai's face deeply in his memory.

Below, Yang Kai's expression was indifferent as he met his gaze, unmoved.

After a moment, Qi Jianxing turned and staggered into the air, filled with hatred and humiliation.

This grudge, I will definitely repay! Qi Jianxing vowed in his heart.

Just as he flew less than thirty zhang, a sudden wave of heat surged from behind him, followed by a cold voice ringing in his ears, “You think you can escape?”

Qi Jianxing's expression changed drastically, fear gripping him as he hurriedly turned to look back, only to see that disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion was indeed chasing after him in mid-air.

And behind him…

Were a pair of dazzling, blazing giant wings!

The wings flapped like a great roc, exuding an overwhelming presence.

“You…” Qi Jianxing was filled with dread; he had never imagined that a martial artist could sprout wings from their back.

Before he could utter another syllable, Yang Kai had already rushed to his front, slamming a palm into his abdomen, then extending a large hand to grip his neck, plunging downward like lightning.

So close, Qi Jianxing saw the killing intent in Yang Kai's eyes, cold and devoid of any emotion.

Swish…

Their figures shot through the air like shooting stars, crashing down to the ground in an instant.

With only about ten zhang to the earth, Yang Kai exerted all his strength, forcefully throwing Qi Jianxing down, while he suddenly halted in mid-air.

Bang…

Dust flew as Qi Jianxing's body collided with the ground, creating a small crater, the sound of several bones cracking echoed within him.

Like a broken sack, Qi Jianxing rolled for a long time before finally coming to a stop.

Struggling to open his eyes, he saw Yang Kai flapping those ostentatious wings, slowly approaching him.

As Yang Kai landed, he folded his wings and walked up to Qi Jianxing, looking down at him coldly, just as Qi Jianxing had done moments ago.

His heart felt like dead ash! The last resort that Qi Jianxing had prided himself on was rendered completely ineffective before Yang Kai.

“You're still alive; no wonder you're a True Essence Realm expert!” Yang Kai mocked coldly, lifting a foot to step on Qi Jianxing's neck.

“Don’t kill me…” Qi Jianxing coughed weakly as he struggled, blood frothing at the corner of his mouth. “You wanted to learn the sword techniques of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, right? I can teach you; whatever you want to learn… I will teach you… I am also considered a rising star in the Jiu Xing Sword Sect. I have come into contact with many profound sword techniques… cough cough…”

“No need, I don’t trust you.” Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent.

The sword techniques of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect indeed made Yang Kai envious, but he did not believe that Qi Jianxing would genuinely teach him. Given this person's character and methods, once he regained his True Essence, he would undoubtedly become a variable. Therefore, he could not spare his life.

Hearing this, Qi Jianxing's already dim expression grew even grayer.

“Why must you make an enemy of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect? If you kill me… cough cough… my Senior Brother will know immediately. He will not let you go; with his strength, you cannot resist!”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, his expression cold as he said, “Wu Chengyi? You need not worry; even if he does not come looking for me, I will go find him.”

“Are you really going to be so resolute…”

“It is you who wish to eradicate me!” Yang Kai sneered, unwilling to waste more words. He stomped down hard, unleashing his Yuan Qi.

Accompanied by a crisp crack, Qi Jianxing's neck snapped, his head drooping to the side, devoid of life.

At the moment Qi Jianxing died, far away, dozens of miles away, Wu Chengyi suddenly felt a jolt, his expression astonished as he looked into the distance.

The three disciples of the Ghost King Valley could sense each other's positions and life or death through special means, and the disciples of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect could do the same.

What puzzled Wu Chengyi was how Qi Jianxing could have died?

Could it be that he encountered those people from the Tianlang Kingdom? If not, with his strength at the Third Stage of the True Essence Realm, there was no reason for him to suffer such a calamity.

A pained expression appeared on Wu Chengyi's face; he was not concerned about Qi Jianxing's life or death, but because Qi Jianxing possessed a treasure that had been obtained by several senior brothers during their travels and was allocated to him.

As far as Wu Chengyi knew, Qi Jianxing had never been willing to use it.

“Brother Wu, what’s wrong?” A martial artist from the Lie Huo Sect noticed Wu Chengyi's solemn expression and asked nervously, “Are the people from Tianlang nearby?”

“Perhaps!” Wu Chengyi reined in his expression and said softly, “We should speed up and find a safe place to hide.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s expression changed slightly, and they became even more cautious. Over the past few months, they had suffered greatly at the hands of those from the Tianlang Kingdom.
