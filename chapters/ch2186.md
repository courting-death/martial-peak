## Chapter 2186 — Let Me Give It a Try

“You all give me too much credit,” Lan Xun replied modestly, her tone calm and unhurried, without a trace of pride or self-satisfaction from the praise. “I just happen to know a little about it.” As she spoke, her beautiful eyes settled solemnly on the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, and she declared in a steady voice, “This Spiritual Medicine is... the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, secretly admiring that Lan Xun truly came from an extraordinary background and possessed broad knowledge.

If not for obtaining Gongsun Mu’s jade slip, he would never have recognized the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. In this world, there were not many who could identify such a Spiritual Medicine and know its effects.

"As expected!" Zhuang Bufan nodded lightly. It seemed he had guessed as much before, but hadn’t dared to be certain. Now, after hearing Lan Xun’s words, he immediately knew his earlier guess was correct.

Among the onlookers, after hearing the words “Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus,” most still wore blank expressions, showing little change. Only a few had their faces turn grim, clearly knowing something about it.

“Princess, what exactly is this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus? Can you eat it?” Xia Sheng suddenly asked with a cheeky grin.

“You idiot!” Beside him, Xiao Baiyi held his forehead and shook his head, looking as if he was ashamed to be associated with Xia Sheng. He muttered, “If you don’t know anything, just keep your mouth shut. You’ve embarrassed the entire Shrine.”

Murong Xiaoxiao also blushed furiously at the side, nodding vigorously, casting a look of disdain at Xia Sheng.

Xia Sheng’s performance as Senior Brother of the Shrine truly left the two of them feeling utterly embarrassed.

Xia Sheng immediately turned to Xiao Baiyi and asked, “Xiao Bai, you know about this?” Then, as if suddenly remembering something, he clapped his hands and exclaimed, “Right, among everyone in the Shrine, you’re the most well-read—maybe you really do know something. Come on, tell me, what’s so special about this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus?”

Xiao Baiyi’s face was iron-cold as he glared at him, taking a deep breath to calm himself before slowly saying, “The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is born of the fortune of heaven and earth, formed by absorbing the essence of sun and moon. It is a peerless treasure, the ultimate medicine. Its growth environment and conditions are impossible to predict, and it can appear in the most bizarre places. Anywhere in this world, whether there is Spiritual Qi or not, it might show up. However... there is only one Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus in existence. As long as there is one in this world, a second will never appear...”

Hearing this, Xia Sheng couldn’t help but whistle in surprise. “That really is unbelievably precious...”

Xiao Baiyi ignored him and continued, “As for its effects, to martial artists like us, it is nothing short of a great blessing—it can increase our chances of advancing to the Emperor Realm. And it’s an absolute increase! In other words, if you, Wuchang, or Brother Zhuang were to consume this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, within five years, you would definitely achieve the Emperor Realm! If it were me... it might take ten years or even longer!”

“And what about me!” Xiao Chen, feeling completely ignored by Xiao Baiyi, couldn’t help but shout in annoyance.

Xia Sheng grinned and said, “Even without this thing, I can still advance to the Emperor Realm. So it’s not that precious after all!”

“What do you know.” Xiao Baiyi shot him a cold glance. “Since ancient times, countless geniuses like you have thought advancing to the Emperor’s position was effortless, but in the end, they all got stuck at the final hurdle, never able to take another step for the rest of their lives! In this world, no one dares claim they can absolutely reach the Emperor Realm. Those who think so usually end up failing. On the other hand, some whose aptitude isn’t the best but have a resolute heart succeed... The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is a guarantee—a guarantee for advancing to the Emperor Realm!”

After hearing Xiao Baiyi’s words, Xia Sheng fell silent, frowning as he stood there deep in thought.

In contrast, the surrounding cultivators, after hearing Xiao Baiyi’s explanation, all revealed fervent expressions as they gazed at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. What they saw was not merely a rare Spiritual Medicine, but a broad and open road leading straight to the gates of the Emperor Realm.

All the martial artists who entered the Four Seasons Land were at the Dao Origin Realm, and some were even at the Third Stage. These martial artists were only a step or a few steps away from the Emperor Realm. Now, with such a great opportunity before their eyes, how could they not be tempted?

If not for the presence of those top sect experts holding down the fort, someone would have already lost control and tried to snatch it. At that point, the mountaintop would be awash in blood, with blades and swords flashing everywhere!

In the face of such a Spiritual Medicine, no one could remain rational. Once bloodlust took over, even if a Senior Brother stood in the way, they would carve a bloody path through!

“I understand the value and use of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, but... what does this have to do with Princess stopping me from taking it just now?” Wuchang suddenly spoke coldly. It was clear he still minded Lan Xun’s earlier intervention and insisted on an explanation.

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, “Brother Xiao Bai has already said quite a bit, so let me say a few words now.”

On the other side, Xiao Baiyi’s mouth twitched, and deep inside he felt immense grief. He thought his nickname ‘Xiao Bai’ would never be erased in this lifetime. Even someone like Lan Xun had called him that more than once. He couldn’t help but show a look of sorrow, as if asking the heavens in silence, tears streaming down his cheeks...

Over there, Lan Xun continued, “Although the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is incomparably precious, it is, after all, just a Spiritual Medicine—fragile by nature. If it is picked before it matures, its medicinal properties will not be full. If Brother Wuchang had recklessly picked it just now, its efficacy would have been greatly damaged, and it would lose its heaven-defying effect. I think Brother Wuchang wouldn’t want to see that happen, right?”

The last sentence, she asked with a smile as she looked at Wuchang.

Upon hearing this, Wuchang replied coldly, “Since Princess says so, I suppose I can wait a little longer... But, how much longer until the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is fully mature?”

Lan Xun was silent for a moment, observing the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, then said, “About a day or so!”

“Just in time before the exit closes...” Wuchang muttered to himself, then shouted, “Fine, I’ll wait until then. Before that, if anyone dares to make a move on the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, don’t blame me for showing no mercy!”

As he spoke, he looked around. The red and white hues in his eyes shone with a strange light, making everyone shiver involuntarily.

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief...

Although Wuchang looked as if he wanted to monopolize the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, at least before the Spiritual Medicine matured, there would be no more disturbances. When it matured, it would be a contest of skill and strength.

“I also ask everyone to wait a little longer. Once the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus matures, we can make plans,” Lan Xun said seriously. “But let me be clear... after it matures, if it isn’t consumed or refined into a pill within three hours, its medicinal effects will completely dissipate!”

“Is that so?” Wuchang frowned.

“The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is, after all, a heaven-defying item with heaven-defying effects. Naturally, the laws of this world will impose some shackles to restrain it!” Lan Xun smiled faintly.

“Then it’s simple. Once it matures, just eat it!” Xia Sheng grinned.

Xiao Baiyi turned his head and gave him a cold look. “Why do you only think about eating today?”

Xia Sheng chuckled, scratching his cheek.

Lan Xun suddenly let out a soft sigh and said, “If possible, it would be best to refine it into a Supreme Mystic Pill. There is only one stalk of this Spiritual Medicine—if we fight over it, blades and fists will show no mercy...”

After all, she was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Emperor. Many times, she considered things not from her own perspective, but from the interests of the entire Southern Territory. Just like when she only took the Quasi-Imperial Treasure from the Time Shrine, now, although she was delighted to see a Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus appear in the Four Seasons Land, she was also deeply worried about the battle that might break out over it.

Everyone present was an elite Dao Origin Realm cultivator from the Southern Territory. If many died or were injured fighting over a single Spiritual Medicine, it would be a loss for the Southern Territory...

“Princess, you must be joking. To refine such a Spiritual Medicine into a pill, you’d need an Imperial-Grade Alchemist! According to you, after it matures, it must be consumed or refined within three hours. Where would we find an Imperial-Grade Alchemist in that time?” Wuchang snorted coldly.

Lan Xun shook her head. "It doesn’t have to be an Imperial-Grade Alchemist. Dao Origin-Grade is enough... It’s just that all of us focus on martial arts—who has time to study alchemy? Dao Origin-Grade Alchemists aren’t easy to find either..."

She shook her head and smiled bitterly, secretly troubled. She felt this crisis was unsolvable, and that a great opportunity would be lost. There was only one Spiritual Medicine. If it was consumed, only one person would benefit. But if it could be refined into a pill, it would be different.

Just then, a voice suddenly rang out: “If Princess trusts me, why not let me give it a try?”

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was stunned and turned to look in the direction of the voice.

Lan Xun quickly looked over; when she saw who had spoken, she couldn’t help but wear a strange expression and murmured, “Brother Yang...”

“You?” Xiao Chen also looked at Yang Kai with a dramatic expression. After a moment, he couldn’t help but sneer, “Do you even know what you’re saying? Didn’t you hear what Princess just said?”

“Of course I heard.” Yang Kai smiled slightly. Even with everyone’s eyes on him, he remained calm and composed.

Zhuang Bufan, who was sitting cross-legged and recuperating, also looked at Yang Kai, a thoughtful expression on his face.

Xia Sheng suddenly tugged at Yang Kai’s sleeve and whispered, “Brother Yang, I don’t think this is a good idea... If you really want to monopolize the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, you’d better think of another way. Pretending to be a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist will be exposed quickly...”

Clearly, he thought Yang Kai had some ulterior motive, so he quietly advised him, lest he lose face and become the target of everyone’s ire. If that happened, no one would be able to save him.
