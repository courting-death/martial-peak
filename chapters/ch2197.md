## Chapter 2197 — The Falling Flower Has Intent

In the next instant, that massive hand clamped directly around the sword-wielding cultivator’s neck. Under the man’s terrified gaze, the owner of the hand grinned ferociously, his fingers tightening as a tidal wave of Origin Qi surged forth, unleashing a storm of death.

Crack—

With a crisp snap, the sword-wielding cultivator’s neck was crushed, his head drooping limply.

Hiss—

A chorus of sharp inhales rang out. All the cultivators charging toward the round-faced woman froze in shock, staring in terror at the owner of that massive hand, their faces full of disbelief.

They were all Dao Origin Realm cultivators, yet the owner of that hand had ended a life with a single reach and squeeze. Such savage, violent killing—absolute power crushing all resistance—naturally left everyone shaken to the core.

“Luo Yuan!” someone shouted.

If Luo Yuan of the Eight Directions Sect hadn’t been particularly famous before, then after this Four Seasons Land trial his reputation could stand alongside the top geniuses of any major sect.

And he truly had the strength and qualifications to do so!

In a sense, Luo Yuan and Wuchang were cut from the same cloth—both ruthless and violent, the kind of people everyone wanted to avoid provoking.

Now, seeing him standing in front of the round-faced woman and killing someone as a warning, who among the remaining cultivators dared make another reckless move? The Supreme Mystic Pill was precious, but one had to be alive to enjoy it.

“Luo Yuan, you want to snatch the Supreme Mystic Pill too?”

This was the question in everyone’s heart. If that was truly the case, then Luo Yuan would be their greatest enemy. Unless they dealt with him, there was no hope of seizing the Supreme Mystic Pill.

It was entirely possible. The Supreme Mystic Pill was so valuable that anyone would covet it. Luo Yuan making a move to seize it was only natural.

Xiao Chen, Wuchang, Xia Sheng, and the others hadn’t acted—partly out of concern for their Sects and reputations, and partly out of disdain for such behavior. But Luo Yuan was different. The Eight Directions Sect wasn’t a major Sect, so he had no such scruples. He hadn’t been famous before, so he could do as he pleased, without a care in the world.

For a moment, everyone’s expressions darkened, inwardly cursing their luck.

Yet—

The way things developed left everyone stunned.

“S-Senior Brother Luo…” came a timid voice from behind Luo Yuan—it was the round-faced woman, still shaken and pale.

“Senior Brother?”

“Could it be…?”

“No way!”

At that moment, all the cultivators who had attacked the round-faced woman broke out in a cold sweat, their faces ashen. A few timid ones even began to tremble.

From the way the round-faced woman addressed Luo Yuan, everyone realized the two were likely from the same Sect—in other words, she too was a disciple of the Eight Directions Sect!

To bully his Junior Sister right in front of Luo Yuan—how could this possibly end well?

Suddenly, everyone understood why Luo Yuan had intervened at that crucial moment with such ruthless force—killing someone outright…

In an instant, the dozen or so cultivators all looked uneasy, exchanging nervous glances.

“Brother Luo, I truly didn’t know this young lady was your fellow disciple. Please forgive my offense!” one man forced a smile, cupping his fists toward Luo Yuan.

“Brother Luo, it’s a misunderstanding, a huge misunderstanding…”

“Yes, yes! If we’d known she was connected to you, Brother Luo, we’d never have dared make a move.”

The group all began talking at once, desperate to avoid Luo Yuan holding a grudge.

Luo Yuan swept his cold gaze over the crowd and barked, “Scram! Useless trash!”

Though his words were harsh, the crowd acted as if they’d been pardoned, fleeing in disgrace.

“Senior Brother Luo…” The round-faced woman, instead of feeling joy at being rescued, watched Luo Yuan’s back anxiously, calling out softly.

“Didn’t I make myself clear?” Luo Yuan turned back and looked at her coldly. “Once we entered the Four Seasons Land, I go my way and you go yours. Don’t drag me into trouble. Have you already forgotten?”

“N-no!” The round-faced woman shook her head quickly, as if wanting to explain, but when she met Luo Yuan’s emotionless eyes, she lowered her head, biting her lip. “I’m sorry!”

“If it happens again, you’re on your own!” Luo Yuan snorted.

“I understand.” The round-faced woman kept her head down, nervously twisting her clothes like a child who’d done something wrong.

“Hmph, take care of yourself!” Luo Yuan snorted again, turning to leave.

“Wait!” The round-faced woman quickly reached out, grabbing Luo Yuan’s sleeve.

“What now?” Luo Yuan’s brows knitted in annoyance as he snapped.

“This… is for you!” The round-faced woman looked up, forcing a smile as she offered the Supreme Mystic Pill she’d gotten from Yang Kai to Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan froze, staring blankly at the round-faced woman.

A gentle breeze swept over the mountain peak. All eyes were on them, and silence reigned.

“So she wanted to give it away…” Yang Kai watched the scene, thinking to himself, “And she’s giving it to Luo Yuan…”

When the woman had traded for the Supreme Mystic Pill from him, she’d said it was for another purpose. Yang Kai hadn’t known what she meant, but now everything was clear.

She hadn’t wanted the Supreme Mystic Pill for herself, but for Luo Yuan.

And from start to finish, she’d never revealed her intentions. Even when surrounded and attacked, she hadn’t called out to Luo Yuan for help. Only after she was safe did she willingly offer the pill that every Dao Origin Realm coveted, showing not a trace of reluctance.

The way she looked at Luo Yuan was incredibly gentle. Her beautiful eyes brimmed with love and admiration, her expression and bearing making it clear to all: for Luo Yuan, she was willing to give up everything—a single Supreme Mystic Pill was nothing in comparison.

In that moment, the round-faced woman seemed to shine with dazzling light, so bright that Luo Yuan could barely keep his eyes open, his eyelids twitching as he struggled to look straight ahead.

“Ah… another woman hopelessly lost in love. Who could possibly save her…” Xia Sheng sighed with feeling.

Standing beside him, Murong Xiaoxiao was already moved to tears, her beautiful eyes sparkling as she fell into her own thoughts.

“Hmph, the world is full of trouble only because fools make it so!” Xiao Baiyi muttered coldly.

“Senior Brother!” Murong Xiaoxiao glared at him.

“Heh…” On the other side, Lan Xun smiled, “Who would have thought… even someone like Luo Yuan could inspire such devotion.”

“He must have used some underhanded trick!” Xiao Chen chimed in sourly, looking regretfully at the round-faced woman. “What a shame, to fall for someone like Luo Yuan. She must be blind.”

“Oh? So you think she should fall for you instead?” Lan Xun shot him a glance.

“That’s not what I meant, Your Highness.” Xiao Chen quickly straightened up, gazing at Lan Xun with deep affection. “If I could get a Supreme Mystic Pill, I would also…”

“I’ve already taken one.” Lan Xun cut him off impatiently before he could finish.

Xiao Chen scratched his head awkwardly and muttered, “That’s… exactly what I meant…”

“What do you mean by this?” After a long silence under everyone’s gaze, Luo Yuan finally spoke coldly.

“N-nothing special.” The round-faced woman, flustered by Luo Yuan’s anger, hurried to explain, “I just wanted to give you the Supreme Mystic Pill…”

“To me?” Luo Yuan sneered.

The round-faced woman nodded firmly.

“Ridiculous!” Luo Yuan showed no gratitude at all. Instead, he burst out laughing. “What, you think giving me a Supreme Mystic Pill here will tie me down?” His face turned fierce as he shouted, “Remember this: I, Luo Yuan, will never be bound by anything or anyone—not you, not the Eight Directions Sect, not anyone! I, Luo Yuan, will one day stand at the very peak of this world, ruling over all!”

“That’s not what I meant!” The round-faced woman panicked, tears welling up in her eyes. “I just…”

“No need to explain. I won’t take this Supreme Mystic Pill. Even without it, my talent is enough to reach the Emperor Realm!” Luo Yuan snorted. “You’d best not have any foolish ideas, or don’t blame me for forgetting our bond as fellow disciples!”

At this, the round-faced woman finally broke down in tears. Though silent, the tears streamed down her cheeks like broken pearls, her beautiful eyes full of innocence and heartbreak.

“Bastard!” Xia Sheng couldn’t help cursing at the sight.

The round-faced woman’s actions were truly moving. As a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, the Supreme Mystic Pill would have been of immense benefit to her. If she’d taken it, her chances of reaching the Emperor Realm would have greatly increased—this was a matter that would affect her entire future.

Yet she hadn’t thought of herself at all. After obtaining the Supreme Mystic Pill, she’d immediately tried to give it to Luo Yuan!

She even avoided calling out to Luo Yuan earlier, to avoid causing him trouble, despite being in danger herself…

To be so considerate of another, her love for Luo Yuan was obvious to all.

Any ordinary man would have been deeply moved by now… Even a block of wood would have softened.

But Luo Yuan showed only cruelty and harshness, leaving Xia Sheng extremely dissatisfied.

Honestly, even if Luo Yuan didn’t want the Supreme Mystic Pill, he didn’t have to be so heartless…

“Scum!” Murong Xiaoxiao shot Luo Yuan a look of undisguised contempt.

“What a dramatic turn of events!” Xiao Chen smiled faintly, clearly enjoying the spectacle.
