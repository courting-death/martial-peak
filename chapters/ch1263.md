## Chapter 1263 — Double Blessing Arrives

Thinking that, Yang Kai looked apologetic and said, "I've put you through a lot these years. When I brought you out from that Small Xuan Realm back then, I promised I'd one day find a place for you to settle, but I've been running all over these years and never given you a steady home..."

The Divine Tree, hearing him, actually waved its two palms in a dismissive gesture and said, "I know, you needn't worry about me."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded lightly, then grinned and said, "But it's better now. At last there's somewhere to stay. If you want, you can come out for a while; and if in the future I ever leave here, I'll take you with me. Of course, it's up to you."

The Divine Tree halted its movements; a trace of joy appeared on that subtle humanlike face as it asked, "May I go out?"

It seemed to have grown nostalgic for the outside sunlight after being kept in the Black Book Space for so long.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded heavily.

"Then let's go out. If you leave here later, I'll go with you."

Having settled matters, Yang Kai immediately stepped out of the stone chamber. Outside it was quiet; dozens of Haike Family disciples appeared to be in cultivation, and even Chang Qi and Hao An were nowhere to be seen. Only a few warriors charged with watching the movements around Dragon Lair Mountain were still on duty.

Seeing Yang Kai step out of seclusion, those men grew solemn and hurried over to pay their respects.

Although they had left the Haike Family with Wu Yi, they all understood who really held sway over this place.

"Where's Yang Yan?" Yang Kai glanced around but found no sign of Yang Yan, and even using Divine Sense he detected no trace of her presence; Wu Yi was likewise absent.

"Yang Yan and the young miss went to Haicheng City," one sharp-looking warrior replied hurriedly.

"Haicheng City — which power controls it, and why did they go?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Haicheng City belongs to the Qiantian Sect. They went to attend an auction at Jubao Tower."

"Another auction!" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. Seeing his confusion, the warrior hurried to explain. After hearing him out, Yang Kai realized that since he had put up many fine items at the last auction and left a strong impression on Yan Pei, Qian Tong had specially sent an invitation beforehand for this sale.

Dragon Lair Mountain happened to be short on Saint Crystals for purchasing materials, so Yang Yan had taken several Secret Treasures she forged to consign at the auction, intending to raise some funds.

After learning all this, Yang Kai secretly furrowed his brows. Yang Yan was spending Saint Crystals far too quickly — the several million Saint Crystals and materials he had brought back last time had likely already been exhausted. It wasn’t her extravagance that made him frown, though; even if Yang Yan burned through countless Saint Crystals and resources, it was all for arranging the defensive restrictions of Dragon Lair Mountain.

What worried Yang Kai was that raising Saint Crystals by consigning items to auctions was not a long-term solution.

Yang Yan could put up Secret Treasures she made a time or two to keep funds flowing, but if this continued it would inevitably cause problems. His pills couldn't be consigned forever either. After all, Dragon Lair Mountain had no major power sheltering it. Although Yingyue Hall had a good relationship with them, that was largely due to Qian Tong's influence; there was no guarantee someone inside Yingyue Hall wasn't eyeing this place and scheming.

If too many high-grade Secret Treasures and Pills spilled out from here, it would surely draw the attention of those with designs.

Not to mention, Xie Hongwen's father wouldn't relax his vigilance. Xie Hongwen died in the Flowing Flame Sandland; although his father didn't know who killed his son, he certainly wouldn't let the matter drop. If he found an excuse, he might very well come here to make trouble.

"How long have they been gone?" Yang Kai asked.

"Three days. Counting the time it's about due for them to return. Young Master Yang, do you want us to fetch them? We can go." one offered.

"No need." Yang Kai waved them off. "You all get on with your own duties."

"Understood." They acknowledged and began to disperse. Yang Kai suddenly added, "Tell them when they return not to send Secret Treasures out to auction anymore."

After handing down his orders, Yang Kai rose into the air and freely flew about Dragon Lair Mountain. He carried the token Yang Yan had given him; that token not only opened the restrictions inside the stone chamber but could open and close all the major formation arrays of Dragon Lair Mountain. With it in hand, the mountain's defensive formations were powerless against him.

He saw the astonishing arrays Yang Yan had laid out — the Mirage Stone had even been placed at the formation's eye. Had he not held her token, once he entered he might not have been able to come back out.

The area where the Blood Sword Grass grew was likewise shrouded in a confounding maze, obscuring its interior; any outsider foolish enough to rush in would be torn apart by the grass's frenzied shredding.

In another region that looked plain and unremarkable, Yang Kai noticed a massive Crystal Stone tightly protected within layered arrays, halos of light swirling nearby and a gigantic array etched into the ground.

Although he couldn't discern the exact formations and restrictions in that sector, Yang Kai guessed it was not a place to be blundered into.

A wild array of other formations and restrictions glittered everywhere; even as the master of Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai was unsettled by the layers of defenses and hidden perils here.

Yang Yan was clearly turning this place into an impregnable stronghold! Still, Yang Kai understood she was using such measures to unravel the seal in his mind, so a touch of extravagance was acceptable.

As Yang Yan mastered more, the formations and restrictions she laid out would only grow stronger.

After flying about for a while, Yang Kai returned to a patch of open ground dozens of zhang away from the pavilion — an area with no signs of prior arrangements, plainly an empty space.

Landing, Yang Kai reached out with Divine Sense to the Black Book Space and conversed with the Divine Tree; his Divine Sense burst forth like a tide.

The next moment the power in his Sea of Consciousness suddenly diminished; golden light flashed before his eyes and the seven- or eight-zhang-tall Divine Tree abruptly appeared.

Yang Kai was secretly startled and showed surprise on his face — he had underestimated how much Divine Sense it would take to release the Divine Tree.

Back when he sealed the Divine Tree into the Black Book Space, his Divine Sense had been entirely drained and his Sea of Consciousness thoroughly dried out. If not for treasures like the Warm Spirit Lotus, his mind would surely have been harmed; even so, it took him a long time to gradually recover.

Now his strength was worlds apart from those days, and he had thought releasing the Divine Tree would be easy. He hadn't expected the Sea of Consciousness's power to instantly fall by half — it gave him quite a shock.

Yet after a moment he smiled. He had grown over the years, and the Divine Tree had grown too. Naturally the Divine Sense required to bring it out would be much greater than before; there was nothing surprising about that.

Once the Divine Tree appeared, the human face on its trunk showed extreme joy. Its eyeballs slowly rolled as it looked around, and upon sensing the rich Spiritual Qi of the area it looked utterly delighted and hummed, "Good, good, the conditions here are simply superb."

Yang Kai knew this was the Divine Tree's first taste of the Star Domain's Spiritual Qi, which explained its delight. The Spiritual Qi here compared to its old Small Xuan Realm was like heaven and earth — utterly incomparable.

"If you like it, that's good," Yang Kai chuckled. "I won't pin you to any particular spot — you can wander where you please. But I should warn you: many places here have formations and restrictions. If you blunder into them you could get into trouble, so be careful not to be trapped."

"Mm, I can sense the traces of those arrays. Don't worry, I won't wander recklessly," the Divine Tree agreed. Its rootlike tendrils writhed and the ground rolled; in the blink of an eye it had planted its roots and emitted a deep, rumbling sound, its eyes half-closed in obvious enjoyment, lazily content.

Yang Kai didn't disturb it, merely standing by and letting it revel in the joy of seeing the sun again.

After a while he suddenly remembered and said, "Right, my two drops of Golden Blood were enough to make you evolve — what if you devour more?"

The Divine Tree opened its eyes and showed a hungry look, but soon replied, "Your Golden Blood must be supremely precious. Although it greatly aids my growth, I cannot evolve again in the short term. Devouring it would only make me stronger, and there's no rush. When you have more later, give it to me to consume."

Yang Kai grinned and said, "I don't have much, but giving you a drop now won't hurt."

With that he forced out a drop of Golden Blood and flicked it; the golden, brilliant drop flew slowly toward the Divine Tree. The tree opened its mouth and swallowed it, giving a contented sound as its large maw writhed, as if still savoring the taste.

After a while the Divine Tree opened its eyes and said, "All right, I still need a few days to adapt. You go take care of your business."

"Very well." Yang Kai nodded, gave it a few more instructions, and then left.

He called over the Haike Family warriors and ordered them to carefully tend the Divine Tree, and to tell Yang Yan and Wu Yi of the tree's existence when they returned — they would surely take good care of it.

Having done this, Yang Kai entered seclusion once more.

Whether by fate or fortune, a month after the Divine Tree's evolution the Zhi Stone he'd placed in the stone chamber stirred. All the Soul-Devouring insects had awakened; the huge Zhi Stone had been completely consumed and vanished, and the awakened Soul-Devouring insects had clearly been well nourished and grown greatly — truly a double blessing.
