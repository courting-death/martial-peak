## Chapter 1096 — Golden Spear

Outside the warship, the brilliance of Secret Treasures and Martial Skills dazzled; forces of various attributes erupted from the martial artists, charging into the dense ranks of the Black Rock Beasts.

Even though the Black Rock Beasts' hides were extraordinarily tough, they couldn't withstand such a violent onslaught; after just one sweep, over twenty Sixth-Tier Black Rock Beasts were smashed to pieces.

The warriors on the warship moved methodically, operating in tightly grouped formations; they didn't rush out alone to take on the beasts' misfortune, but under Wu Yi's command they acted in unison—where Wu Yi pointed, they struck.

Their numbers were small, only fifty or sixty in all, making them seem insignificant compared to the vast Black Rock Beast horde; this method was the only way they could gain an edge.

Prayers and shouts of encouragement rang in Yang Kai's ears—those left behind on the warship were cheering on their comrades; their cultivation was the lowest among everyone, so they weren't qualified to join such combat and could only remain aboard to keep the ship running.

A shriek rang out; a Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior was the first to be torn to pieces by a charging Black Rock Beast, killed instantly.

Someone immediately filled the gap, forcing that Black Rock Beast back, and in the next instant a dozen attacks fell, killing the beast on the spot.

Wu Yi's coordination was regular and effective; it was obvious they weren't handling such a battle for the first time—everyone was seasoned; if things continued like this, even though Wu Yi's side was small, they could still achieve final victory.

But Yang Kai keenly perceived that everyone fighting outside was worried about something, as if they knew what the Black Rock Beasts would do next, and that was something they could not withstand.

Another piercing scream sounded; a warrior at the very edge of the formation was swarmed by several Black Rock Beasts and chewed; his hand and foot bones were shattered—he became the second to die.

After gnawing their victims to death, the Black Rock Beasts did not devour their flesh and blood; instead they spat it out—the beasts ate minerals, not flesh.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Streams of emerald-green liquid suddenly sprayed from the mouths of the Black Rock Beasts; in an instant Wu Yi and the others on all sides were enveloped by the sap-green fluid, and everyone looked grave. Under Wu Yi's command they quickly dodged.

A warrior who carelessly got the green liquid on him screamed; smoke rose from his body, the imposing treasure armor he wore over his chest was swiftly dissolved, even his flesh was corroded, leaving only a heap of white bones.

That emerald-green liquid clearly possessed a powerful corrosive property!

Yang Kai's expression changed. He couldn't help but worry for Wu Yi and the others.

His strength hadn't fully recovered yet; at best he could only perform at the level of a Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior. If Wu Yi and the others were defeated and the warship destroyed, everyone on the ship would be doomed; few would survive amid that vast beast swarm.

Yang Kai suddenly felt he should do something.

Thud, thud, thud...

A series of muffled thuds came from the hull; Yang Kai saw that the Black Rock Beasts had actually avoided where Wu Yi and the others were. They leapt onto the warship, spraying that emerald-green liquid from their mouths, beginning to corrode the hull and then gnaw at the ship.

The crackling sound, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, came—countless, making one's spine chill.

Wu Yi and the others no longer stayed huddled; in small groups of three or five they followed those Black Rock Beasts, leaping onto the ship's hull one after another, fighting bravely to protect the vessel's safety.

People kept dying; around each person dozens of Black Rock Beasts gathered.

Yu Feng, together with three others, stood guarding Wu Yi and unleashed their Saint Yuan alongside her.

Wu Yi practiced a fire-attribute cultivation technique; she brandished several rings in her hand, her body weaving like a water-snake, and billows of flame coalesced into a dragon-like assault, making the Black Rock Beasts wary—those few that approached were all torn apart by her.

They seemed to fear fire.

More Black Rock Beasts noticed and rushed over quickly.

Yu Feng and the others did their utmost but couldn't stop the surge, especially since among this pack there were even a few Seventh-Tier existences.

A Seventh-Tier demonic beast is equivalent to a Saint King Realm warrior; two Seventh-Tier Black Rock Beasts latched onto Yu Feng, while several others rushed at the warriors protecting Wu Yi, leaving them no time to spare.

The rings in Wu Yi's hands erupted with stronger flames and struck a charging Seventh-Tier Black Rock Beast; fire splashed, the beast howled and retreated, but it wasn't killed.

The Black Rock Beasts had thick hides and tough meat, extremely high defense. Wu Yi could kill Sixth-Tier beasts, but couldn't make a Seventh-Tier beast die in a short time.

Struck by flame, that beast seemed to grow immensely enraged; it opened its maw to reveal irregular serrated fangs, and faintly one could see emerald-green corrosive acid pooling in its mouth.

It hid behind several companions and, seizing the moment when Wu Yi was flurried, lunged at her waist to bite.

If that bite connected, given the Black Rock Beast's bite force and the acid's corrosion, Wu Yi would either be killed or grievously injured.

She could see it clearly but couldn't stop it.

Yu Feng and the others were also furious, but unable to pull themselves away to help.

A surge of despair rose from her heart; Wu Yi looked tragic, staring helplessly at the Seventh-Tier Black Rock Beast rushing to bite her.

At that moment, a drop of golden light suddenly appeared in front of her. The golden gleam manifested without warning or sign; as it flashed it coalesced into a spear, the spear's shaft emanating an appalling energy fluctuation—its power was so great that everyone's faces changed.

The spear, like a bolt of lightning, smashed into the gaping Seventh-Tier Black Rock Beast, shattering a huge hole in its skull and blowing its whole head apart.

The golden spear continued without slack, consecutively piercing a dozen imposing Black Rock Beasts; none of those thick-skinned demonic beasts could withstand its attacks—whether Fifth-Tier or Sixth-Tier, they all burst into clouds of blood mist and vanished from sight.

Dumbfounded, Yu Feng forgot his peril and stared stupidly as the golden spear rapidly approached him; a chill rose from deep within his heart.

He felt certain he was done for.

But to his surprise, that golden spear seemed to possess spirit; as it reached him it suddenly turned, brushed past his body, and swallowed up a Black Rock Beast behind him.

Everyone looked around in bewilderment, utterly at a loss—not knowing who had produced this golden spear.

Wu Yi searched around even more; the situation that had been certain death was resolved by that golden spear, allowing her to escape; her face was pale with lingering fright and full of puzzlement.

She wanted to find the owner of the spear—she had no idea any of her subordinates could be so formidable; a single spear like that would be enough to make its wielder a mainstay of the family.

Wu Yi naturally recognized the value of a warrior with such capabilities.

She looked for a long time but found no suspicious person; suddenly she saw Yang Kai standing behind a window on a certain part of the warship, waving both hands at her—he seemed to be saying something, and from his anxious expression and lip movements Wu Yi guessed he was cheering them on.

Wu Yi shook her head and didn't pay Yang Kai much heed; while Yu Feng and the others drew back and launched another attack on the Black Rock Beasts, she quietly observed the golden spear.

Since that strange golden spear appeared, the tide of battle seemed to have shifted.

The warriors, who had been at an absolute disadvantage, now fought as if injected with adrenaline, recklessly forcing their power, and gradually turned the tables.

The golden spear drifted through the battlefield like it had a life of its own, as if it had eyes; every attack killed several Black Rock Beasts, and every strike saved a warrior's life—its timing was impeccable.

Everyone noticed the peculiar golden spear and recognized its ferocity; the shrewd began hiding behind it to pick off injured Black Rock Beasts. Wu Yi was also clever—without hesitation she ordered everyone to follow closely behind the spear and attack; with such an invincible spear clearing the way, it was only a matter of time before the Black Rock Beast horde was wiped out.

The Black Rock Beasts that had leapt onto the warship were gradually cleared away; the horde seemed to sense the spear's threat, gathering together and staring over like predators, but dared not launch a reckless attack.

Wu Yi raised her hand to signal for everyone to rest for a moment.

Their numbers were just too few; the Black Rock Beast horde still numbered several hundred demonic beasts—rushing in would certainly cause casualties.

The scene reached an impasse: the horde hesitated, unwilling to advance, and Wu Yi's side held their positions.

The stalemate was broken by the golden spear. For reasons unknown, a terrifying energy fluctuation suddenly poured from it; the spear that had been only three zhang long abruptly lengthened and thickened, and in the blink of an eye became a gigantic spear fifty zhang long.

The giant spear flicked once and then abruptly vanished from everyone's sight, as though it had never existed.

As everyone searched for the giant spear's trace, a golden brilliance exploded where the Black Rock Beasts had gathered; the golden light shrouded the enormous horde and countless Fifth-Tier and Sixth-Tier demonic beasts instantly disappeared, as if evaporated; even the Seventh-Tier Black Rock Beasts began to howl, their black hides rolling as bright red blood flowed from their bodies.

When the golden glow faded, the huge Black Rock Beast horde had been greatly reduced—at least dozens of beasts died in that light.

The remaining beasts no longer dared linger; led by several Seventh-Tier demonic beasts, they fled in a terrified stampede into the distance.

A group of warriors stood dumbfounded until the horde vanished into the Starry Sky and was out of sight; only then did cries of cheer erupt, every face filled with joy and the relief of having survived disaster.
