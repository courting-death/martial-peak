## Chapter 845 — The Young Man Has a Nice Figure

"So, Patriarch, how did you get back here?" Yang Kai couldn't help but ask, curious.

Chu Lingxiao chuckled, "It was a lucky coincidence. You have a place called Ghostly Underworld Mountain over there, don't you?"

Yang Kai nodded; it was a forbidden ground of the Great Han that he'd ventured into before. While there he had even visited a Small Xuan Realm and gotten involved in some affairs with Zi Mo of the Tianlang Kingdom and others.

He naturally remembered it clearly.

"It was inside there that I found a Void Passage. I slipped through it and returned to the Tongxuan Continent."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

There were Void Passages leading here inside Ghostly Underworld Mountain? He had been completely unaware. The reason he himself had arrived here was that he followed Meng Wuya's instructions and went into the forbidden Wasteland of the Tianlang Kingdom.

That place had a hidden Void Passage as well.

And the Earth Veins in Zhongdu also contained such passages.

So it seemed the world around Zhongdu and the Tongxuan Continent must have many invisible connections; few had discovered them.

Conversely, there must also be plenty of links from the Tongxuan Continent back to Zhongdu's world.

After a long talk with Chu Lingxiao, Yang Kai hadn't obtained all the information he sought, but one thing was certain—if he searched patiently, he would eventually find a route to Zhongdu.

There was no rush; for now he lacked both the means to settle those relatives and friends and the strength to protect them.

As for the art of tearing space itself, its secrets he would have to explore on his own.

Returning from Chu Lingxiao to Qixiu Peak, Yang Kai informed Senior Aunt Fei Yu and immediately began secluding himself.

He had only just broken into the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and needed time to stabilize his cultivation; it was the perfect opportunity to probe the mysteries of tearing space.

He once again used the secret chamber on Qixiu Peak—an entire room fashioned from crystal stone, saturated with astonishing Spiritual Qi and costly beyond measure. Yang Kai had refined pills here in the past; Fei Yu readily agreed to lend it to him.

Once the chamber was sealed, Yang Kai waved his hand and rent a pitch-black seam in the void. Within it lay chaotic nothingness, exuding an eerie energy that sent chills down the spine.

By now Yang Kai's method of tearing space had become practiced and effortless.

After he plunged into that dark void, the tear snapped shut and erased any trace of itself.

As always, the feeling of weightlessness came. Yang Kai sat calmly cross-legged amid the chaotic currents of the void, refining his techniques to consolidate his strength while sending out his Divine Sense to probe the currents' trajectories.

He had the impression that the secrets of the void lay hidden in these chaotic currents; the reason no one had penetrated them was simply because they were so perilous.

Even Saint Realm experts arriving here might not withstand the assault of these currents; their bodies could be destroyed and their souls shattered in short order.

Yang Kai, however, felt no fear—his body was tough and his Divine Sense unique, giving him a considerable advantage.

His Divine Sense split into thousands of strands to ride the currents, following their flow to seek patterns.

He remained calm and unhurried, his mind steady.

Time passed, and he began to discern certain regularities, though he couldn't grasp the crucial key, which made him concentrate even more.

Suddenly the chaotic currents in the void grew restless. Yang Kai's expression hardened; he quickly withdrew his Divine Sense and, looking around, was astonished to see the void in utter disorder as a violent, destructive energy swept in from all directions.

Another eruption of void currents!

When Yang Kai had experimented with tearing space before, he often encountered this—like being within a starry sky, whose gathered power would, upon reaching a certain point, generate a starry sky storm.

Within these rifts, the same accumulation of void power could form a void storm.

It was an inevitable result: quantitative change producing qualitative transformation.

Each time this happened, Yang Kai would temporarily back off. Sensing the danger now, he felt the urge to leave, but he calmed himself and furrowed his brow in thought.

The last time he had been in the starry sky and encountered a storm it had benefited him greatly—he had broken through to the Transcendent Realm. If he stayed and absorbed the mysteries within this void storm, perhaps he could finally unmask the secret of tearing space!

With that thought, he no longer hurried to leave. He sat quietly amid the chaotic currents, secretly gathering strength to face the world-shattering power.

In the next moment, the fierce energy swallowed him.

In an instant his clothes turned to dust and his sturdy body was riddled with wounds; scarcely an inch of him remained unbroken.

Yang Kai's face changed.

Although he knew the energy here was stranger and more damaging than the starry sky's, he had still underestimated it.

He immediately erupted with all his power to endure that battering storm.

Skin torn and blood streaming, Yang Kai looked as if a layer had been peeled from him; the crimson flesh shimmered with golden light as subtle energies poured into his body through millions of pores.

Startled, he put aside his pain and focused inward to sense what was entering him.

Those forces were the void's power—the very leverage he needed to unravel the art of tearing space.

The void power intensified, and even Yang Kai found it hard to withstand, feeling a horror as if he would be sliced into countless pieces.

Moreover, the void power made his features seem vague and unreal.

Though his hands and feet were plainly before him, the folding and distortion of space made him feel as if his limbs had been scattered everywhere.

Wasting no time, Yang Kai shouted, "Enter Demonic State!"

Black, dense demonic qi surged from his Indomitable Golden Body, forming intricate, eerie demon marks that covered his flesh and vanished into it.

His Qi and blood erupted, his momentum and aura skyrocketing.

The unbearable pain and crushing sense of destruction eased considerably.

He drew a breath and opened himself to the void power's onslaught, letting those forces brand every part of him so his body could remember them.

Time had never passed so slowly, but gradually Yang Kai noticed subtle, welcome changes before his eyes.

The once-ungraspable chaotic currents now showed traces he could follow; with a casual wave, the currents began to obey his direction.

Yang Kai grinned and maintained that state, continuously using the incoming void power to peer deeper into its mysteries.

Long, long after, the unleashed void storm finally subsided and everything stilled.

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, surprised to find that the once-blank rift was now dotted with glimmering lights like a sky of stars—astonishingly beautiful.

When his Divine Sense reached them, each speck of light transmitted a subtle message.

Yang Kai frowned and probed carefully; gradually he seized the crucial point and felt elated.

Focusing on one light, an imposing mountain sprang into his mind—hundreds of zhang high, flanked by countless peaks. On its side a waterfall cascaded, and behind that waterfall hid the mouth of a cave.

The sensation was peculiar, as if Yang Kai hovered above, looking down on a peak that felt strangely familiar.

Qixiu Peak!

It was the very mountain where Senior Aunt Fei Yu resided and where he had secluded himself.

Ripping open the void, Yang Kai shot out from it.

In a blink he found himself in a forested mountain valley; trees swayed, birds sang, flowers perfumed the air, and the roar of a waterfall reached his ears.

Impatient, Yang Kai leapt into the sky and gazed down.

After a moment he couldn't help but laugh aloud.

The scene from above matched almost exactly what he'd seen through that shaft of light in the rift.

"So that's it!" Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, nearly moved to howl at the heavens.

At last he had truly grasped the secret of tearing space and would no longer emerge at random points within a few hundred miles after passing through a rift.

Now, if he wished, he could roughly determine the direction and location he intended to reach.

Using his body's memory of the void power's secrets had indeed proven highly effective.

Had he known this method worked earlier, he would have practiced it long ago—why had he only now comprehended the true way of tearing space?

From the mountain's belly a graceful figure streaked over like the wind, approaching fast—apparently drawn by Yang Kai's laughter to come investigate.

When she arrived and saw Yang Kai hovering midair, Fei Yu's expression turned odd. She placed a delicate hand at her forehead, tilted her head and called out, "Junior Disciple, weren't you in seclusion? How did you end up here?"

Hearing her voice, Yang Kai hastily flew down, chuckling, "I emerged today and went for a stroll."

"Emerging from seclusion?" Fei Yu frowned. "Why didn't I see you?"

She had remained inside the cave and hadn't seen Yang Kai leave the chamber, so she was naturally suspicious.

"Maybe Senior Aunt didn't notice," Yang Kai answered offhandedly.

Fei Yu stopped questioning and instead appraised him with a meaningful look, lips pursed into a playful smile. "Junior Disciple, don't you feel something's different about yourself?"

"Different?" Yang Kai frowned, unsure what she meant.

"The young man has a nice figure…" Fei Yu clicked her tongue in amazement, a flush creeping up her fair neck as her eyes continued to roam up and down him. "You wouldn't notice with your clothes on."
