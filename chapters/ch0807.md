## Chapter 807 — Despicable Fellow

The most important thing was patience—let them clearly sense that you harbor no malice; only then would they lower their guard and willingly communicate.

During this process, a single moment of impatience could ruin everything, provoking their instincts and causing trouble.

In a part of the thicket, Yang Kai stood quietly, suppressing his aura and blending with the surroundings as his Divine Sense extended outward to convey goodwill.

The demonic beasts gathered nearby cowered in hiding, beastly eyes flashing with ferocity and fixed on Yang Kai’s position.

Time passed and Yang Kai remained unhurried and composed.

After roughly half a day he finally heard rustling nearby; turning his head he saw a huge tiger-like demonic beast, brilliantly patterned and massive, slowly emerging from its concealment.

Rustle… rustle…

More demonic beasts revealed themselves, forming an iron-clad encirclement around Yang Kai.

Yang Kai swept his gaze around and felt his eyes brighten at the sight.

These beasts took varied forms, each remarkably handsome and imposing.

When they drew within roughly ten zhang of Yang Kai they halted and emitted low growls; at the same time Yang Kai sensed they were sending out Divine Sense, trying to communicate.

But their spirit-intelligence was undeveloped and they could not clearly express their thoughts.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and transmitted a thought: “Hello. I come with no ulterior motive—you need not fear. I only wish to meet your Great Lord. If convenient, could you guide me?”

Immediately the tiger-like beast let out a roar, as if asking why he wanted to see their Great Lord.

“I have matters to discuss with him,” Yang Kai answered patiently.

The beasts fell silent, turning their heads as if unable to decide.

After a long while, the tiger-like beast howled to the sky; the cry rolled like thunder and shook the ears.

Yang Kai frowned slightly but showed no impatience; he stood quietly and waited.

He did not know exactly where the Great Yao Lord resided and had to rely on these undeveloped beasts.

That long howl was answered from deep within the thicket, then relayed in succession, growing more distant as if passed like a baton.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up with understanding; he sat cross-legged, took several bottles of pills from his bosom, and tossed them toward the beasts as a friendly gesture.

These pills were casually refined by him to promote True Yuan circulation and aid cultivation.

The beasts approached and sniffed them eagerly.

Demonic beasts instinctively seek benefit and avoid harm; they can sense danger. Though these pills were not high-grade, each emanated Spiritual Qi and naturally attracted them.

Before long the pills were snatched and swallowed like snacks, and the beasts looked at Yang Kai with expectant eyes.

Yang Kai shook his head with a wry smile and produced a few more bottles.

About half an hour later, Yang Kai—still seated—suddenly stiffened and turned to look in one direction.

There, a proud, unruly aura was rapidly approaching.

The newcomer’s cultivation was not low—at least Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, equivalent to a peak Seventh-Tier demonic beast.

Boom…

A hulking figure descended like a falling meteor, crashing down not far from Yang Kai and kicking up dust and shockwaves that made the great trees tremble.

The demonic beasts gathered around scattered in fear.

Yang Kai squinted and saw a burly middle-aged man of roughly forty standing before him, looking down with contempt.

He wore only simple animal-skin garments; his hair was wild and a thick coat of black fur ruffled in the wind.

At first glance he resembled a maddened male lion—fierce and unrestrained.

A yao!

Yang Kai immediately identified him; the relay howls must have informed him, and upon receiving the message this yao powerhouse had rushed over.

His eyes were filled with hostility and bloodthirst, and the beasts that had been amiable with Yang Kai now bared teeth and snarled.

Yang Kai grinned and rose calmly, projecting composure.

“Human, you dare intrude into the Beast Sea Thicket—you have guts!” the burly yao roared as his yao energy surged, clearly eager to slay Yang Kai.

“I’ve matters to attend to here. Friend, please be patient and hear me out,” Yang Kai said with a gentle smile.

“Who is your friend!” the burly yao spat, waving his broad palm with contempt. “Despicable human—yao will never befriend you.”

“Er…” Yang Kai was momentarily at a loss.

The yao’s rejection was obvious and left him helpless.

“May I ask your name?” Yang Kai cupped his fist politely.

“The Great Lord bestowed the name—Kuang Shi!” the yao said proudly, as if being named by the Great Lord was a great honor.

“Noted,” Yang Kai replied seriously.

“You despicable fellow.” Kuang Shi looked Yang Kai over with disdain. “What did you do to my kin? Why were they so friendly to you?”

“I did nothing—just gave them some pills,” Yang Kai explained casually. “They’re cultivation aids and harmless.”

“Pills?” Kuang Shi’s eyes lit up; the word clearly piqued him.

Yang Kai smiled and offered, “I still have more. Brother Kuang, want some? A small token for our first meeting—a humble courtesy.”

As he spoke he produced a few more bottles and handed them over.

Kuang Shi’s desire showed, though he hesitated; when he smelled the pill fragrance his lust overcame reason and he snatched them into his pocket, growling, “Despicable rascal, don’t think to win my favor with these… but I like you better now.”

Yang Kai stifled a laugh, finding the creature’s simplicity oddly alarming.

If all yao were like Kuang Shi, dealings would be easy.

After checking the bottles, Kuang Shi slipped them into his pants and guarded them like a treasure.

He then glanced at Yang Kai and asked, “I heard you want to see the Great Lord?”

He already grasped Yang Kai’s intent from the beasts’ cries and didn’t need to ask.

“Yes. Can you introduce me?” Yang Kai asked.

Kuang Shi sneered, “You think this thicket is somewhere you can stroll into? Do you think our Great Lord is someone you can meet on a whim? For being so compliant I won't kill you—go back where you came from. Don’t be presumptuous. If you stay until dusk, your death will come with the night!”

Yang Kai frowned and pleaded patiently, “Brother Kuang, I truly have urgent matters to discuss with your Great Lord. Could you do me this favor?”

“Don’t try to provoke me. You humans are arrogant; anger me and your end will be miserable. The Beast Sea Thicket never allows humans—today I’m showing leniency.” Kuang Shi snorted, unwilling to relent.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Really, Brother Kuang? I heard someone used to come here often to drink and chat with your Great Lord.”

Kuang Shi’s expression changed. “Where did you hear that? Huh… that ring on your hand looks familiar.”

“Because that person wore this ring,” Yang Kai said, holding up his hand to show the ring. “You should have heard about the old Saint Lord’s fall in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. In a way, I’m his successor. The old Saint Lord and your Great Venerable were friends, so I hoped to ask a favor.”

“You’re the successor?” Kuang Shi’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked Yang Kai over. “That fellow was powerful and fought evenly with the Great Venerable—how can you, his successor, seem so weak?”

He regarded Yang Kai with scorn, as if a finger could flick him away.

Yang Kai paid it no mind and continued, “You know our old Saint Lord brought you many crystal stones and Spirit-Grade Pills… you haven’t had that these past two years. If I take his place I can bring you what you want, for example…”

“For example?” Kuang Shi’s attention was caught.

“For example, the pills I just gave you,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

“Those are mine now!” Kuang Shi clutched his pocket and glared, fearful Yang Kai would try to take them back.

“I know, they’re yours,” Yang Kai nodded. “But in future if you want more, you must first let me see your Great Lord. Only if I and your Great Lord reach an agreement can I continue to bring these things, right?”

Kuang Shi tilted his head to the sky, brows furrowed, thoughtful.

After a while he scratched his head and muttered, “Your words are strange yet make some sense… you’re not tricking me, are you?”

He glared intently into Yang Kai’s eyes.

Yang Kai met his stare calmly, showing no guilt or unease.
