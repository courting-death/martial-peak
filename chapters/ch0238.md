## Chapter 238 — Who is in Charge

Zi Mo led her army of Demonic Beasts to the place where Jin Hao had perished. She rummaged through the pile of powder for a long time but was unable to find her Control Soul Insect. Her expression darkened, and her delicate face turned icy.

The Control Soul Insects of the Tianlang Kingdom martial artists were exceedingly precious. It was not that the insects themselves held great value, but because they contained the thread of soul connected to their owner's spirit.

This was no trivial matter. If such an insect fell into the hands of an enemy and was refined, their Divine Sense would undoubtedly suffer damage. If one were to encounter such a blow during a fierce battle, it could lead to utter defeat or even death.

Thus, whenever a controlled Demonic Beast died, Zi Mo would rush to the spot where it had perished to retrieve the Control Soul Insect.

Yet this time, she found nothing.

Noticing the change in Zi Mo's expression, Leng Shan, who was following her, couldn't help but sneer repeatedly, her face filled with delight.

Zi Mo snorted softly, closed her eyes, and began to sense carefully.

Although she had not cultivated Divine Sense and could not conduct a large-scale search, the scattered threads of soul were ultimately of the same origin as her own spirit, allowing her to sense them within a certain range.

After a brief probe, a strange expression appeared on Zi Mo's beautiful face. She turned to look in a specific direction, her smile charming, and her beautiful eyes sparkling with excitement.

Dozens of Demonic Beasts quickly spread out, encircling that area.

Leng Shan was taken aback. From Zi Mo's actions and demeanor, she sensed something was amiss.

She harbored a deep hatred for Zi Mo, resenting her for previously promising her purity to Jin Hao, and even more for her reckless behavior. Leng Shan had thought that this time Zi Mo would surely suffer a great loss, secretly anticipating the spectacle, yet she did not expect the situation to develop this way.

Could it be that the expert who killed Jin Hao was still here? Wasn't that throwing oneself into a trap?

Suddenly, a rustling sound came from the jungle, and a figure dashed past Leng Shan's line of sight.

Zi Mo pointed her hand, and the dozens of Demonic Beasts rushed toward the location of the figure. A tinkling laugh rang out, “Don’t run! You can’t escape. Once my Control Soul Insect burrows into your body, even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you will have to return to me and obediently obey. I won’t make you suffer!”

“Damn it! I knew that insect was strange!” A frantic curse echoed from the jungle. This voice only added to Zi Mo's delight, causing her to laugh uncontrollably.

Leng Shan sighed inwardly, her fleeting hope instantly shattered.

So it turned out that the person who killed Jin Hao had also been afflicted by the Control Soul Insect! Was this person a fool or just plain stupid?

The figure in the jungle indeed stopped fleeing and was soon surrounded by dozens of Demonic Beasts, captured without resistance. Then, he swaggered back toward them.

When she saw the person's face, Leng Shan's body trembled, and a look of disbelief flashed in her eyes.

Jin Hao could recognize Yang Kai, so how could Leng Shan not? But precisely because she recognized him, she found it even more unbelievable. Gazing deeply at Yang Kai, her mind raced, weighing the gains and losses.

Yang Kai wore a reluctant expression, walking back helplessly. He stopped thirty zhang away from Zi Mo and Leng Shan, forced a bitter smile, and asked, “Miss, what kind of insect is that?”

“It is the unique Control Soul Insect of our Tianlang Kingdom. Once you are infected by it, you become my subordinate,” Zi Mo patiently explained, sizing up Yang Kai. Seeing that he was merely a youth, her beautiful eyes widened in surprise. She could hardly believe that the one who killed Jin Hao was so young.

“Alas, I shouldn’t have meddled with Jin Hao’s corpse!” Yang Kai sighed deeply, grief-stricken, then suddenly grinned, “Miss, now that I am your person, what will you do with me? Are you going to have me warm your bed at night?”

Zi Mo pursed her lips and smiled alluringly, “That’s fine, but I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle it.”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes at her unabashedness. Zi Mo took note of his expression and laughed heartily.

“If I tell you some useful information, will you let me go?” Leng Shan suddenly spoke up, her beautiful eyes fixed intently on Yang Kai.

“What information?” Zi Mo frowned.

“About him.” Leng Shan expressionlessly pointed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, but his heart skipped a beat, secretly circulating his Primordial Qi in vigilance. Although he did not know what this female disciple from Ghost King Valley was about to say, he could be certain it would not be in his favor.

With dozens of Demonic Beasts surrounding them, if they all rushed over, he would have to use the Wings of Yang Flame to escape.

“First, you must promise me,” Leng Shan bargained.

“I cannot let you go,” Zi Mo slowly shook her head. Leng Shan's expression remained unchanged as she awaited the next words; she had not expected this.

“However... I can treat you a bit better. At most, I won’t bully you anymore in the future.”

“Remember what you said. Otherwise, even if I perish with you, I will never again suffer such humiliation!” Leng Shan achieved her goal and then pointed at Yang Kai, saying, “This person cultivates a Yang attribute cultivation method!”

Having fought with Yang Kai before, Leng Shan naturally knew the attribute of the Primordial Qi within him. This attribute was precisely the nemesis of the Control Soul Insect! Thus, the moment she recognized Yang Kai, she realized he had not been controlled by the insect. He was pretending to be afflicted, merely playing along with the scheme.

Leng Shan believed that with Yang Kai's strength, he could not possibly defeat Zi Mo. With dozens of Demonic Beasts present, if Yang Kai made a move, he would undoubtedly die. It was better to reveal the truth before he died and take the opportunity to negotiate for some benefits. After hesitating for a moment, she disclosed this to Zi Mo.

She did not care who died; she only cared about herself.

Zi Mo's smile instantly froze on her face. She abruptly turned her head, coldly staring at Yang Kai, her eyes filled with murderous intent.

At that moment, Yang Kai decisively forced the Control Soul Insect out of his body, holding it in his hand with a sinister grin, “I know this insect is attached to a thread of your soul. If you don’t want your spirit to be harmed, you better behave. Otherwise, I will burn it immediately!”

Zi Mo's expression changed drastically, her face losing color.

Yang Kai laughed coldly, calm and composed.

Leng Shan remained expressionless, indifferent.

Moments later, Zi Mo suddenly covered her mouth and began to laugh, “You should have burned it when I was unprepared. That way, I would definitely suffer injuries, and perhaps you would have had a slim chance of survival. But you think you can threaten me with this? You are gravely mistaken.”

“Oh? I would like to hear more,” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his expression unchanged.

Zi Mo coldly replied, “Since you know that a thread of my soul is attached to the insect, you should also know that I can retrieve it.”

As she spoke, her thoughts moved, and the thread of soul attached to the insect was pulled back into her mind.

Yang Kai was not surprised; instead, he burst into laughter, his laughter growing louder, echoing like thunder.

Such reckless and unrestrained laughter made Zi Mo feel something was off. This youth was so composed that he either had a backup plan or had gone mad. Yet, seeing his triumphant expression, he clearly had a clear mind, showing no signs of insanity.

If it were anyone else, Zi Mo might have been interested in taking him as a subordinate. However, since he cultivated Yang attribute Primordial Qi, he absolutely could not be spared. Zi Mo's beautiful face was filled with murderous intent as she raised a delicate hand, ready to order the Demonic Beasts to attack. Yet Yang Kai suddenly ceased his laughter, coldly gazing at Zi Mo, and shouted, “Can you kill me?”

“Ah…” Zi Mo suddenly let out a tragic scream, clutching her head and crouching down, her delicate body trembling violently.

The sudden turn of events left Leng Shan stunned, her expression shocked as she watched Zi Mo wailing in agony, then looked up at the calm and composed Yang Kai, feeling an unreal sensation.

What was happening? What on earth had transpired between these two? Leng Shan had not even seen any signs of a confrontation; it was merely during their conversation that Zi Mo suddenly encountered misfortune.

Zi Mo's emotional upheaval triggered a reaction from the dozens of Demonic Beasts, each baring their teeth at Yang Kai, growling incessantly, and slowly closing in on him.

“Get these Demonic Beasts to roll away, or I will destroy your Divine Sense right now and turn you into an idiot!” Yang Kai coldly threatened.

Zi Mo endured the excruciating pain in her mind, daring not to hesitate, and quickly issued orders.

The dozens of Demonic Beasts glanced at Zi Mo, all retracting their hostility, then scattered and retreated, stopping after running about a hundred zhang, tightly surrounding the area where the three stood.

“You are quite sensible!” Yang Kai sneered as he stepped forward, reaching out to grab Zi Mo's hair and lifting her up.

Such a violent and cruel attitude made Leng Shan's heart skip a beat, and she couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

“You better not move. I will settle the score with you later!” Yang Kai coldly glared at her, causing Leng Shan to freeze in place, looking at Yang Kai in shock and fear.

More than half a year ago, when her Senior Brother and fellow disciples attacked this disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion, he had only been at the Third Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, fleeing like a lost dog under their assault.

But now, upon their reunion, he had effortlessly captured Zi Mo of the Tianlang Kingdom!

Leng Shan understood Zi Mo's strength and ferocity well. With the Control Soul Insect in hand, she could control many Demonic Beasts and martial artists, and her own strength was extraordinary. How could such a person be defeated by Yang Kai in less than half a tea's time?

Just moments ago, she had sold him out for a bit of benefit. Now, thinking back, Leng Shan felt a wave of fear.

The situation had changed too quickly.

Zi Mo's cries gradually subsided, her fragrant sweat soaking her clothes, revealing her exquisite and full figure before Yang Kai.

She raised her head slightly, her face filled with stubbornness and defiance, glaring hatefully at Yang Kai, her beautiful features etched with deep resentment.

“It seems... you still haven’t realized who is in charge now!” Yang Kai said, tossing her to the ground.

Zi Mo's screams rang out once more, this time even more heart-wrenching than before. In her cries, she rolled on the ground as if subjected to the most severe torture in the world, her voice reaching Leng Shan's ears and causing her to shiver involuntarily.

“No... please... don’t... don’t torment me anymore...” Zi Mo struggled to rise, crawling to Yang Kai's feet, clutching one of his ankles tightly, refusing to let go. Her disheveled hair was drenched in sweat as she looked up at him with a beautiful face, trembling as she pleaded, “I will obey... I will listen to you in everything, just don’t torture me anymore...”
