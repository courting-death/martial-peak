## Chapter 1940 — Actually Didn't Die

The three great Secret Treasures nurtured and refined within Yang Kai's body were not things to be shown lightly; any one of them, even if placed in the Star Realm, could set off a bloody storm.

The two Imperial Treasure pearls needed no introduction—those were inheritances from Yang Yan and another Emperor, of extremely high grade and tremendous power, enough that warriors below the Emperor realm would risk their lives to seize them; even those at the Emperor realm would covet them endlessly.

As for the Dragon Bone sword Dripping Jade, its grade was not high simply because Yang Kai had not completely refined it into a true Secret Treasure; the Dragon Bone sword was basically still a half-finished piece.

Its principal materials, however, were true Dragon Spine Bone and a Dragon Pearl.

These were bodily Secret Treasures of an ancient true dragon, the same grade as the dragon scale that had fused into Yang Kai's body; in terms of value, even if they did not quite match top Imperial Treasures, they were not far behind.

So when that Treasure-Stealing Serpent entered his body, Yang Kai felt a grave unease.

Any one of those three Secret Treasures being taken was more than he could bear, yet with his power sealed he could only silently endure the torment the Treasure-Stealing Serpent wrought inside him, utterly powerless to fight back.

Besides, even if he had been at his peak he might not have been a match for Yan Xiuran.

Yan Xiuran stood to one side and sneered coldly, eyes hard with expectation—clearly this was not his first time doing such a thing—and he said with a feral smile, "You can still regret this in time; if you don't want to suffer, cooperate obediently. You should know that while Secret Treasures are precious, without life they're useless—no matter how many you have you still can't use them."

Yang Kai regarded him with cold eyes and did not utter a word; the hatred in his gaze was so venomous it seemed he wanted to carve the man's face into his very bones.

Yan Xiuran curled his lip and said, "Stubborn and senseless—so be it, don't blame me then."

As he spoke, he formed a hand seal.

The Treasure-Stealing Serpent that had been rampaging in Yang Kai's body redoubled its savagery.

Yang Kai's screams suddenly rang out.

He could clearly feel the serpent's path threading through his body; that demonic beast possessed some innate talent for sniffing out and tracking Secret Treasures being refined inside a warrior's body—any hidden Secret Treasure seemed unable to escape its detection.

It very quickly located where the Dragon Bone sword lay and darted straight toward it.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth against the pain, beads of sweat sliding from his brow; he wanted to control the Dragon Bone sword to dodge and maneuver, but he simply could not.

The Treasure-Stealing Serpent soon arrived near the Dragon Bone sword; without even looking it opened its mouth as if to swallow the sword whole and seize it.

If it succeeded, Yang Kai would suffer a grievous loss.

Unexpectedly, the serpent's swallowing motion had only half completed when, as if startled by something, it hastily recoiled.

It veered cleanly away from where the Dragon Bone sword lay.

In that instant Yang Kai distinctly felt a faint draconic might surge from the Dragon Bone sword, and the Dragon Pearl embedded in the blade—within which a dragon soul remained—slowly opened its eyes and cast a pale glance at the Treasure-Stealing Serpent.

That trace of draconic might and the dragon soul's glance were what frightened the Treasure-Stealing Serpent away.

Yang Kai's heart leapt, and after a moment's thought he understood why it had happened.

It was not that the Dragon Bone sword's grade was overwhelmingly high, but that the sword itself carried draconic might and a remnant dragon soul, which naturally restrained and intimidated the Treasure-Stealing Serpent.

It was not surprising: true dragons were ancient divine spirits, and legends said jiao, serpents and snakes were the descendants of true dragon bloodlines—true dragons therefore had inherent dominance over those three kinds of creatures.

The Treasure-Stealing Serpent was, after all, just a serpent; it had no stomach to be presumptuous before the venerable ancestor’s lingering might, so it immediately slunk away as far as it could.

"Hm?" Yan Xiuran, who had been watching, couldn't help but make a light sound and frowned, puzzled that his Treasure-Stealing Serpent had encountered some problem and had not been able to immediately seize the other's Secret Treasure.

Previously his Treasure-Stealing Serpent, once dispatched, took no more than ten breaths to snatch another's Secret Treasure, but today there seemed to be unexpected complications...

He glanced meaningfully at Yang Kai but did not pay it much heed, instead continuing to wait.

Unable to swallow the Dragon Bone sword, the serpent could only seek other Secret Treasures.

Its next target, astonishingly, was none other than the Extinction Thunder Bead!

The Extinction Thunder Bead naturally lacked draconic might to intimidate it, but the annihilation divine thunder contained within it was something the serpent would not dare provoke, so it merely circled nearby and slunk away.

With the Treasure-Stealing Serpent's skills, it wouldn't dare approach an Imperial Treasure like the Extinction Thunder Bead—the only end to any forced theft would be being blasted to ash by the annihilating divine thunder!

It had some cunning and knew to seek profit and avoid harm.

Soon it came before the Xuan Realm Pearl; likely chastened by its encounters with the Dragon Bone sword and the Extinction Thunder Bead, it did not rush to swallow the Xuan Realm Pearl but circled and observed carefully.

After confirming the Xuan Realm Pearl gave off no dangerous sensation, it opened its jaws, swallowed the Xuan Realm Pearl whole, and then attempted to exit Yang Kai's body.

But it was already too late.

The instant the Xuan Realm Pearl slid into its belly, a surging might exploded from within the pearl's core. In a single heartbeat a great hole was blown through the Treasure-Stealing Serpent's abdomen; it let out a shrill, metallic hiss and, panic-stricken, scrambled outward and fled.

The Xuan Realm Pearl was a self-contained world; Yang Kai had refined it and thus could hold it inside his body— for the serpent to swallow it was tantamount to swallowing a world, and with its capabilities how could it endure that? Not exploding instantly was lucky.

It realized then that everything inside Yang Kai's body was not so easily plundered; grievously wounded, it no longer dared linger.

At the same time Yan Xiuran's face changed and he barked, "What is happening?"

He had a link to the Treasure-Stealing Serpent, so at the instant it was injured he sensed it; panic-stricken, he hurriedly formed double seals to urge the serpent out.

Yang Kai endured the intolerable pain and suddenly took a few steps back.

Whoosh...

From somewhere in his chest a small blood-stained snake shot out, its jaws opening and closing as if wronged, lunging toward Yan Xiuran; its belly gaped with a bloody hole and its entrails were exposed to the air, a sight that made Yan Xiuran wince with pity.

At that moment Yang Kai did something Yan Xiuran and Liu Qianyun could not believe.

He took a stride forward, reached out, grabbed the Treasure-Stealing Serpent in his palm, pinched its head, and with a slight squeeze of thumb and forefinger crushed the little snake's neck bones.

Although Yang Kai's power was sealed, his physical strength was not; his strike was lightning-quick.

By the time Yan Xiuran reacted, the Treasure-Stealing Serpent was already dead.

Yang Kai gave him a feral grin, then shoved the little snake into his mouth and chewed with crunching sounds.

His mouth filled with blood—an appalling sight like a beast tearing and devouring flesh—his scarlet eyes flashing a dreadful light.

"You..." Yan Xiuran froze; he had not expected matters to develop this far—because Yang Kai's power was sealed he had not supposed his speed could still be so great; by the time he tried to intervene it was too late.

The Treasure-Stealing Serpent had already become Yang Kai's meal.

Liu Qianyun's delicate form trembled; she and Yang Kai were like grasshoppers on the same rope— to her it seemed his act would drag them both into a pit of fire.

Did he not know how one must bow when under a roof?

This was bad, truly bad! She should never have cooperated with this man—he had seemed composed before, so how could he do something so mad? Liu Qianyun regretted it to her core, her face paling.

"You're courting death!" Yan Xiuran flew into a rage; his step shifted, his eyes blazing red, and he slammed a vicious palm toward Yang Kai.

Boom...

A Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert's frenzied blow—given Yang Kai's present condition he could not withstand it; he was sent flying like a tattered sack, smashing into the mountainside more than ten zhang behind and gouging a huge V-shaped gouge.

The sound of bones snapping was heard.

Yang Kai slid down from the cliff face.

"Brother Yang!" Liu Qianyun cried in alarm; though she could not understand why he had suddenly acted so madly, seeing him struck she could not help but shout.

After all, she and Yang Kai were both from a lower Star Domain and shared some common ground; compared with the disciples of the Biyu Sect—each of whom was unpleasant—if Yang Kai died leaving only her, her fate would be miserable.

Instinctively she did not want Yang Kai to die so.

But she also knew Yang Kai's hope of survival was slim; Yan Xiuran had struck in blind rage with no mercy— even if she took that blow she would certainly die, let alone Yang Kai, merely a Second Stage of the Void King Realm?

"Cough, cough..." a violent cough came from beyond the dented cliff; Yang Kai staggered to his feet, spat out the serpent's blood and flesh, and swallowed only the serpent's gall.

Liu Qianyun widened her beautiful eyes and stared at the bedraggled yet defiant Yang Kai like a creature of horror; her heart trembled wildly.

He actually... survived?

How had he managed it?

"You actually didn't die?" Yan Xiuran was also stunned; his furious blow had been meant to take Yang Kai's life and avenge his Treasure-Stealing Serpent—after all the serpent, though useless in direct combat, was a rare oddity because of its innate talent to pilfer Secret Treasures, and he had paid a great price to acquire it; now that it had died at Yang Kai's hands, he would not let it pass.

Seeing Yang Kai still alive, Yan Xiuran's eyes turned ice-cold as he strode toward him like an erupting volcano, his rage and overwhelming aura pressing down on Yang Kai like a mountain.
