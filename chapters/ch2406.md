## Chapter 2406 — They Actually Want to Compensate

Somewhere in the Star Realm, above the vast sea, a massive vortex suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

There was no warning before the vortex emerged, but the moment it did, it churned the seawater for a hundred li in every direction, its might utterly astonishing, sending all the nearby sea beasts fleeing in terror.

Immediately after, figures shot out from the vortex, scattering in all directions. There were both men and women among them, their cultivations varied, and each looked as if they had just survived a great calamity—faces pale, lingering fear written all over them.

Suddenly finding themselves above the sea, everyone seemed a bit dazed, glancing around in confusion.

These people were, of course, Yang Kai and the others who had escaped from the Jixu Secret Realm. When the Bihai Shuttle collapsed, Bing Yun used her powerful Emperor Yuan to shield everyone, bringing them out at the very last moment.

Otherwise, out of this group, absolutely no more than three would have made it out alive.

"Ugh..." Bing Yun suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood mist, apparently aggravating her previous injuries by forcibly using her Emperor Yuan just now.

Fan Xin and the others turned pale, rushing forward to check on her. Yang Kai also hurried over, asking anxiously, "Senior, how are you?"

Bing Yun waved her hand without a word, sitting cross-legged in midair and forming seals with her hands to circulate her profound arts.

Seeing her about to begin emergency healing, Yang Kai quickly said, "Everyone, spread out and keep watch. Don’t let Senior be disturbed."

At his words, everyone quickly dispersed around Bing Yun.

"Senior Brother, have we really left that place?" Liu Qianyun moved to Yang Kai’s side, asking uncertainly. The endless sea around them left her unsure whether this was the Star Realm or still the Jixu Secret Realm. If they hadn’t escaped, she might have spent her whole life trapped in that secret realm.

Yang Kai frowned slightly. He didn’t know if this was still the Jixu Secret Realm either, but soon he tried circulating his cultivation to absorb the surrounding Spiritual Qi—and found no resistance at all. Delighted, he said, "This isn’t the Jixu Secret Realm!"

Hearing this, Liu Qianyun’s beautiful eyes immediately lit up.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “The Spiritual Qi here is much thinner than in the Jixu Secret Realm, but the most important thing is that strange transforming force is gone!”

Inside the Jixu Secret Realm, transforming force filled every corner, making it impossible for any cultivator to absorb Spiritual Qi—they could only rely on special Purification Arrays. But here, Yang Kai could easily draw in the surrounding Spiritual Qi, the best proof they had left the secret realm.

"We really escaped!" Liu Qianyun exclaimed with joy.

Ling Yinqin and the others, hearing their conversation, also showed expressions of disbelief.

They had lived in the Jixu Secret Realm for so many years, never imagining they would one day truly leave and return to the Star Realm. Yet now, this impossible wish had come true!

This made Ling Yinqin and the others feel as if they had been reborn, each of them overwhelmed with excitement.

"If this isn’t the Jixu Secret Realm, then where are we?" Liu Qianyun asked.

Yang Kai pondered, "The Star Realm has four Great Territories. Except for the Western Territory, every territory has a sea. But... I think this is the Northern Territory!"

"Why?" Liu Qianyun looked at Yang Kai curiously, not understanding how he deduced that.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Don’t you feel how bitterly cold it is here? The Eastern and Southern Territories rarely have such environments. Only the Northern Territory is covered in ice and snow year-round, making it this frigid."

Though it was just a guess, Yang Kai felt it was almost certainly correct.

He had set out from Chiyue Sect, planning to go to the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect to ask Yin Lesheng about Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts. But before he even reached the Eastern Territory, he ended up in the Northern Territory instead. Truly, the ways of Heaven are unpredictable—fate toys with people.

"Senior Brother Yang, you mean... this is the Northern Territory?" Fan Xin looked at Yang Kai, asking excitedly.

"It’s just my guess. I’m not sure," Yang Kai replied with a slight smile.

"Our sect is in the Northern Territory!" Fan Xin exchanged glances with several of her senior and junior sisters, all of them cheering with joy.

While trapped in the Jixu Secret Realm, Fan Xin and the others had been taken in as disciples by Bing Yun. Though they claimed to be disciples of Ice Heart Pavilion, Bing Yun had long since told them her true origins—they all knew their master was the founder of Ice Heart Valley in the Northern Territory!

For that sect they had never visited, Fan Xin and the others felt a near-reverent longing, hoping to one day return there with their master. But trapped in the Jixu Secret Realm, this wish had never come true.

Now, having escaped, they had somehow ended up in the Northern Territory. Naturally, Fan Xin and the others were overjoyed.

"Someone’s coming. If we ask, we’ll know for sure if this is the Northern Territory," Yang Kai suddenly said, turning to look in a certain direction.

Only then did everyone notice a group of people rapidly flying toward them from that direction.

As they drew near, it became clear the group was led by a middle-aged man, with a total of about a dozen people.

The middle-aged man’s hair was white, his expression extremely grim. For some reason, his gaze toward Yang Kai and the others was tinged with hostility. The men and women following him all looked indignant, as if Yang Kai’s group had offended them.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, not sure what was going on. But he didn’t dare be careless, because the middle-aged man wasn’t hiding his aura at all—the power he radiated marked him as a First Stage Emperor Realm expert.

The dozen or so people with him were all Dao Origin Realm cultivators, some even at the third stage.

Such a force was definitely not insignificant—likely a major sect. Yang Kai was secretly wary. He wasn’t afraid of these people; if a fight broke out, he could always escape. But Liu Qianyun and the others wouldn’t be able to flee so easily, and Bing Yun was still healing and couldn’t be disturbed.

With that in mind, he quickly stepped forward to greet the middle-aged man, cupping his fists and saying, "Junior Yang Kai greets you, Sir. How should I address you?"

His tone was quite polite, since he figured this might be someone’s territory—offending the locals would do no good.

Who would have thought the middle-aged man would give him no face at all, nostrils flaring as he barked, "This Lord is Jiang Zhouzi, Vice Island Master of Taiqing Island. Who are you people, and why have you appeared here?"

This was Yang Kai’s first time here—he didn’t even know if this was the Northern Territory, let alone anything about Taiqing Island. But if Taiqing Island had an Emperor Realm cultivator as its vice island master, their strength couldn’t be weak. At the very least, they must have an island master even stronger than Jiang Zhouzi!

"So it’s Island Master Jiang. My apologies! We passed through by accident and meant no disturbance. Please forgive us, Island Master Jiang," Yang Kai replied courteously, his demeanor neither servile nor overbearing.

"No disturbance?" Before Jiang Zhouzi could speak, a woman in red behind him suddenly sneered. She was fairly pretty, with a curvaceous figure, but her face was a bit sharp, her cheekbones high and severe. For some reason, she was furious, snapping at Yang Kai, "You suddenly appeared here and scared off the Blue Infant Beast, yet you dare say you caused no disturbance? Are you blind?"

The woman in red seemed to be relying on the Emperor Realm expert backing her up, not putting Yang Kai’s group in her eyes at all. She immediately began lecturing them, making Ling Yinqin and the others’ faces darken.

"Blue Infant Beast?" Yang Kai frowned.

He had heard of the Blue Infant Beast before—a demonic beast that lived deep in the sea, its cry sounding like a baby’s wail, its body icy blue, hence the name. The Blue Infant Beast was a Twelfth-Tier demonic beast, equivalent to an Emperor Realm expert. It was extremely rare, and its Inner Core was priceless, able to enhance Divine Sense and clear the mind. If refined into a pill, it could greatly boost a cultivator’s effectiveness when practicing secret arts or divine abilities.

He hadn’t expected there to be a Blue Infant Beast here. Judging by the woman’s words, it seemed their arrival had scared it off.

Earlier, Yang Kai had indeed sensed many sea beasts scattering, but his mind was elsewhere and he hadn’t noticed if there really was a Blue Infant Beast among them.

"That’s right!" Jiang Zhouzi said coldly. "We spent a month setting up here, then waited another half month for the Blue Infant Beast to appear. But before we could act, you scared it off. This can’t just be let go!"

The woman in red chimed in as well, "The Blue Infant Beast’s Inner Core was meant as a congratulatory gift for the Young Sect Master of the Wenqing Sect on his wedding day. Now that it’s gone, what do you propose we do about it?"

At first, Yang Kai did feel a bit guilty. If what they said was true, it really was his group’s fault. After all, these people had worked hard for so long, only for the Blue Infant Beast to be scared off at the last moment. Anyone would be upset.

But the way this pair kept harping on, so aggressive and overbearing, made him a bit angry too.

If there’s a problem, just talk it out and find a solution—why be so overbearing? Weren’t they just trying to bully the weak?

Thinking this, Yang Kai’s face hardened as he said, "Then what do you all propose?"

Ling Yinqin frowned and said, "How about this—whatever the Blue Infant Beast is worth, we’ll compensate you!" She just wanted to settle things peacefully. She and her crew had gotten quite a few good things recently, selling them on Tongtian Island, so she still had some Source Crystals on hand. Besides, she knew Yang Kai was wealthy, so compensation seemed the best solution.

"Compensate?" The woman in red looked at Ling Yinqin with mockery. "Even if we sold all of you, you couldn’t pay for it. Do you think Blue Infant Beasts are so easy to find? There aren’t more than three in the entire Ice Sea. Now it’s gone, and you actually want to compensate us!"

As she spoke, she looked about ready to explode with rage.

Yang Kai frowned. "Things are already like this—what do you want, then?"

Jiang Zhouzi glanced coldly at Yang Kai and snorted, "What? Judging by your tone, you don’t take Taiqing Island seriously?"
