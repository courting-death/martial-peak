## Chapter 2259 — Fortunately, I Didn’t Fail

Alarmed by the resonance of Yang Kai’s Imperial Treasure, some twenty or thirty Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had come to the Qin Family had now all left, not a single one remaining.

Only one person was left, still standing in midair.

Narrowing his eyes, Yang Kai looked at her and saw that it was a woman dressed as a young married lady. Her figure was graceful and slender, her skin as fair as snow, and her long black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. She wore a jade-green palace dress, her bright eyes shining. Though she was wary of Yang Kai, there was no fear in her gaze.

This woman’s cultivation wasn’t particularly high, but not low either—about the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Judging by her appearance, she was likely from some mid-tier sect or family.

“You’re still not leaving?” Yang Kai saw that she hadn’t moved an inch and his face darkened.

Hearing this, the woman spoke, “May I ask, young brother, are you Yang Kai, Master Yang?”

Yang Kai frowned, growing wary inside, and instead of answering, asked, “Who are you?”

The woman hurriedly replied, “I am from Chiyue Sect, Ye Qinghan.”

“Chiyue Sect!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. He vaguely remembered this sect, though not clearly. Still, he was certain that Chiyue Sect wasn’t a major sect—probably about the same as Biyu Sect, without any Emperor Realm experts holding the fort, just a few Dao Origin Realm cultivators supporting it.

In the entire Southern Territory, there were at least hundreds if not a thousand such sects, each occupying some territory and continuing their line. Perhaps their ancestors had once achieved great glory, but as generations passed, they gradually declined, and their strength faded away.

The Biyu Sect was the perfect example. The current Sect Master, Wu Mengchuan, could trace his lineage back to the Heaven Devouring Emperor, who was once the number one figure in the entire Star Realm—an existence who could blot out the sky with a single hand and command the winds and clouds. Yet Wu Mengchuan was merely at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, just the master of a minor sect.

In this world, there are no unshakable sects, no families that never scatter. After ten thousand years of inheritance, only the Star God Palace and a few other top sects can manage it.

“You really are Master Yang, aren’t you?” Ye Qinghan asked a bit anxiously.

“You’ve got the wrong person,” Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

Off to the side, several members of the Qin Family and disciples of the Eight Directions Sect stared at him, eyes wide.

“That’s right, he is Yang Kai, Master Yang!” The round-faced girl who was infatuated with Luo Yuan suddenly blurted out, admitting it for him. After speaking, she even made a funny face at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glared at her fiercely.

"You really are Master Yang!" Ye Qinghan, now certain of his identity, looked a little excited.

"I told you you've got the wrong person. There are plenty of people in this world with the same name. If you don't leave, I won't be polite!" Yang Kai waved his hand impatiently, shooing her away like a chicken.

Ye Qinghan bit her red lips lightly, looking pitifully at Yang Kai. “Master Yang, could you let me say a few words? I’ll leave as soon as I’m done.”

“I’m not in the mood!”

“You…” The round-faced girl seemed unable to stand it anymore and scolded, “She’s begging you so earnestly. What’s the harm in listening? Don’t you know how to show a little compassion?”

Yang Kai glared at her. “No, I don’t! Besides, she came here to steal my treasure. Why should I listen to her? If someone tried that with your Luo Yuan, what would you do?”

“What do you mean, my Luo Yuan…” The round-faced girl blushed and grew bashful, but soon her pretty face turned cold and she snorted, “If anyone dares to target Senior Brother Luo, I’d beat her to death!”

Her face was full of murderous intent. Yang Kai was quite surprised, not expecting this little girl to have such a cold side.

“Patriarch Qin, see the guest out,” Yang Kai said to Qin Chaoyang, then beckoned to Qin Yu, “Miss Qin, come with me!”

“Mm.” Qin Yu quickly walked over to Yang Kai.

On the other side, Qin Chaoyang thought for a moment, then flew up to speak with Ye Qinghan, seemingly trying to persuade her to leave. But Ye Qinghan was unmoved, only pleading bitterly.

“Oh, right!” After taking a few steps, Yang Kai turned back to the Eight Directions Sect disciples and sneered, “You’d better behave. If you dare act up again, you’ll regret it!”

The Eight Directions Sect disciples broke out in a cold sweat. How could they not comply? They all nodded repeatedly.

They had seen Yang Kai kill Qu Huairen and seize that middle-aged man’s Secret Treasure with their own eyes. Knowing they were no match for him, if they provoked Yang Kai, they’d be doomed.

The round-faced girl smiled, “Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on them. They won’t cause trouble.”

“See that you do. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving Luo Yuan any face!” Yang Kai snorted and turned to leave.

Leading Qin Yu, he went all the way to the secret chamber. As soon as Qin Yu sat down cross-legged, Qin Chaoyang rushed in, looking eager, as if he’d already dealt with Ye Qinghan. He looked at Yang Kai with hope and asked nervously, “Brother Yang… this trip to the Four Seasons Land, how did it go?”

Since Yang Kai’s return, he hadn’t had time to ask about the Calamity Fruit. Now, finally free, he couldn’t wait to know the result.

Qin Yu’s delicate body trembled, her breathing quickening, unable to control her emotions.

After all, this concerned her very life. She was not yet eighteen, had not seen enough of the world’s splendor, nor experienced all of life’s changes—how could she face death calmly?

Yang Kai glanced at the two, smiled slightly, and said, “Fortunately, I didn’t fail!”

As he spoke, he took out a jade box from his Spatial Ring, flicked it open, and a spirit fruit as pure as carved ice appeared before the Qin Family pair.

Qin Chaoyang stared wide-eyed, and Qin Yu stretched her slender, fair neck, gazing in a daze.

“That’s right… that’s it, this is the Calamity Fruit!” After a while, Qin Chaoyang suddenly burst out laughing, tears streaming down his face. “I recognize it. Back then, a great expert once showed me an image of this spirit fruit.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu covered her red lips with her hand, a great weight lifted from her heart. She seemed to lose all strength and collapsed on the spot.

“There were quite a few twists and turns in obtaining this spirit fruit, so I couldn’t return right away. Sorry to have kept you waiting,” Yang Kai said lightly, not explaining further.

Qin Chaoyang, tears streaming down his old face, said, “No rush, no rush. It’s all thanks to you, Brother Yang. Now Yu’er has hope of surviving!”

“By the way, Patriarch Qin, did that great expert ever say how Qin Yu should take this spirit fruit? Does it need to be refined into a pill? If so, I can help a bit,” Yang Kai asked seriously.

“No need to refine it!” Qin Chaoyang shook his head. “That expert said, as long as you find the Calamity Fruit, Yu’er just needs to eat it directly. Her Heaven and Earth Severed Body is due to being rejected by the world, her vitality cut off. The Calamity Fruit’s medicinal power can form an invisible bridge, reconnecting her severed vitality. She’ll never suffer from this constitution again!”

“Then there’s no time to lose. Let’s have Miss Qin take it right away,” Yang Kai said, quickly handing the jade box to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took it, looked at the Calamity Fruit, then glanced at Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang. Seeing their encouraging faces, she no longer hesitated. She picked up the Calamity Fruit with her slender fingers, covered her mouth, and chewed it slowly.

In a moment, the spirit fruit was swallowed.

Qin Chaoyang watched Qin Yu anxiously and asked, “Yu’er, do you feel any discomfort?”

Qin Yu shook her head. “No, it’s just cold…”

As soon as she finished speaking, her face suddenly twisted in pain, as if enduring great torment. At the same time, a unique power spread through her body, turning into a layer of pure white light that enveloped her.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly. Using his Divine Sense, he saw that the thick black energy around Qin Yu was being slowly dispelled by the white light. As the black energy faded, her pain eased, and vitality gradually returned to her body, spreading through her limbs and bones.

Seeing this, Yang Kai nodded, knowing the remedy was right. Qin Yu’s affliction would surely be cured.

“Brother Yang, this, this…” Qin Chaoyang was at a loss.

Yang Kai smiled. “Patriarch Qin, let’s step outside. Miss Qin should be fine—she just needs time.”

“Brother Yang, are you sure?” Qin Chaoyang asked uneasily, then quickly added, “It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s just…”

“I understand,” Yang Kai smiled. “You’re just worried. Use your Divine Sense to check the situation around Qin Yu and you’ll see.”

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang did as told. After a moment, he couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

“Now, can you relax?” Yang Kai smiled.

Qin Chaoyang was a little embarrassed by the teasing. “Yu’er has had a hard life. Her parents died young, and she’s the only bloodline left in the Qin Family. She and I have depended on each other for over ten years. If even she…”

“I understand,” Yang Kai said solemnly, nodding.

As they spoke, the two left the secret chamber.

With a twist of his wrist, Yang Kai took out the Myriad Sword, held it in both hands, and offered it to Qin Chaoyang. “Patriarch Qin, this sword is returned to the Qin Family. Please verify it.”

Qin Chaoyang looked at the Myriad Sword calmly. After a long time, he finally reached out to touch the blade and said, “The Myriad Sword was left by my Qin Family’s ancestors. It’s the family’s greatest treasure. For ten thousand years, every generation has made it their mission to restore the family’s glory and to master the Myriad Sword, but few have succeeded. In my generation… sigh!”

He sighed heavily, then continued, “The treasured sword has been sealed away, never seeing the light of day. If my ancestors knew, I wonder if they’d blame me.”

Yang Kai said, “Miss Qin is exceptionally talented. At just eighteen, she’s already reached the Origin Returning Realm. Now that she’s free of her affliction, given time, she’ll achieve great things.”

Qin Chaoyang smiled. “All my hopes rest on Yu’er now. That’s why I’d like to ask Brother Yang to keep this sword for now!”
