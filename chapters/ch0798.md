## Chapter 798 — Demon God Golden Blood

Inside the Sacred Tomb, after several days of sitting and absorbing, Yang Kai had absorbed into himself the remaining essences from the residual souls of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's successive Saint Lords.

The gains were unimaginably great!

Though his realm did not change, because those essences were all insights from Third Stage of the Saint Realm experts, Yang Kai instantly gained a clear understanding of the path that lay ahead.

So long as his bodily strength could keep pace, he could walk that path without worry; in short, before reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm he would no longer encounter the kinds of bottlenecks that had once plagued him.

Such a boon was what every martial artist dreamed of.

The reason realms were so hard to break through was that at certain critical points one would encounter varying difficulties and constraints; without seeing the underlying mysteries, a breakthrough was impossible.

Countless martial artists' lives stopped at their own bottlenecks, never advancing another inch; among them were many prodigies who shone brightly in youth but stalled once they reached their limits.

Those with luck and opportunity who could break through those bottlenecks would see their strength skyrocket.

Thus the word "bottleneck" struck fear into every cultivator; everyone met them to some degree on the road of growth.

Yang Kai had experienced the same, each time overcoming peril and discerning clarity between life and death.

From now on, he no longer had to worry about that; his cultivation path would be smooth before reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

He drew a breath and stood up, suddenly feeling the world had shifted; standing within it, he had a strange sensation of everything being within his grasp.

A subtle energy fluctuation came from the coffin beside him; Yang Kai sensed carefully and, after a moment, a smile crept to his lips.

He moved his mind, and a stream of light shot from the coffin straight toward him.

Yang Kai put out his hand and the light settled neatly in his palm; looking closer, it was a silver leaf.

The leaf's veins were distinct and lifelike, as if freshly plucked from a tree; yet this seemingly simple leaf emitted staggering energy fluctuations!

A Saint-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure!

The top-tier Secret Treasure the previous Saint Lord once had, as Xu Hui and the others had spoken of—such items were scarce across the entire continent.

This silver leaf bore the previous Saint Lord's soul imprint, but because Yang Kai had used the World-Ending Demon Eye to purify and absorb the Saint Lords' souls here, he could control the previous Saint Lord's soul imprint; indeed, he could control the soul imprints of them all.

In other words, if any coffins still held Secret Treasures, he could easily take them without fear of being harmed by those treasures' powers.

Yang Kai had never seen a treasure of this form before; Secret Treasures came in many varieties and shapes. This silver leaf surely had an unusual ability. Unsure how to temper it, he temporarily placed it into the Black Book Space.

Dodging the tomb's lurking perils, Yang Kai set off toward the second coffin in high spirits.

He intended to clear this place out!

He checked coffin after coffin; almost every one contained gains. The past Saint Lords had all been top-tier experts, so their Secret Treasures were naturally not inferior.

All were Saint-Grade items—mostly Middle-Level, some Lower-Level, and only that single silver leaf at Upper-Level, showing how rare such high-grade treasures were.

Though the treasures were fine, Yang Kai felt little use for many of them; weapon-type treasures didn't suit his hands, and in life-or-death clashes he'd rather fight unarmed.

The only item that caught his attention was a deep-red suit of armor; its halo shimmered beautifully, it felt light to bear, and it could surely withstand a Saint Realm expert's fierce assault without breaking.

It was a woman's armor, obtained from a coffin containing a female skeleton.

That coffin differed from the rest; inside lay two skeletons—one the Sacred Land's lord, the other likely the Saintess—tightly embraced, sharing life and death, which moved Yang Kai.

That armor would make a fine gift—whether to Su Yan or to Xia Ningshang it would provide formidable defense.

With that thought, he casually pocketed the armor.

After a while Yang Kai paused before the last coffin. Oddly, it showed no traces of a Secret Treasure and, unlike the others, it was tightly sealed; heavy seals shimmered upon it, though after countless years those seals had somewhat loosened.

For reasons unknown, his blood began to surge faster and his heartbeat grew stronger the moment he approached—as if something inside the coffin was drawing at his blood.

He frowned and sensed for some time, then slowly shook his head: due to the seals, he could not penetrate its mysteries.

Yet this was the only coffin kept closed; evidently this Saint Lord had not wished anyone to open it and pry into its hidden secret.

If not for that strange feeling, Yang Kai would have ignored it, but now he was unusually curious.

The thought would not be suppressed.

After thinking awhile Yang Kai's expression hardened; he raised his hand and struck the coffin, True Yuan surging forth.

In principle, seals laid by a Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert should have been beyond Yang Kai to break, but that Saint Lord had been dead many years and the seal no longer held the force of its prime.

In under half an hour Yang Kai had destroyed all the seals.

As the light dimmed and the seals failed, he drew a deep breath and lifted the lid.

A decayed, misshapen skeleton came into view; when he looked closely, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel moved.

The skeleton's bones were broken and damaged—around eighty percent of them had been shattered.

Yang Kai felt a chill of horror.

Every Saint Lord who lay here had been a top Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivator; at such a level bodily strength and bone toughness were extraordinarily strong, and it was rare for bones to fracture.

Yet this scene showed that before dying this Saint Lord had fought a desperate battle with some mighty foe; win or lose, he had been brutally beaten, and his death was undoubtedly tied to these injuries.

What kind of person could slay a Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert in direct combat?

Absorbed in thought, Yang Kai's gaze was drawn to a jet-black bottle placed on the skeleton's chest.

Before dying, the Saint Lord had clasped the bottle to his chest; the bottle was sealed with a spell, seemingly protecting whatever lay within.

A terrifying demonic energy emanated from the bottle, making Yang Kai feel acutely tormented in body and mind.

Crackling sounds rang out—

It seemed that because Yang Kai had broken the coffin's barrier, whatever was in the bottle had become unstable and was violently seeking escape.

The jet-black bottle could not withstand the assault; in an instant countless cracks spidered across it, and the seal at the mouth flickered ominously.

Yang Kai looked on indifferently, making no move to stop it; he felt in some inscrutable way that the thing within the bottle had some connection to him.

He sensed faint traces in the void.

Crack—

With the snapping sound the jet-black bottle shattered, and a streak of gold flashed forth, radiating blinding brilliance that filled the entire Sacred Tomb.

The seals across the tomb dissolved at the touch of that golden light, losing their power.

A towering, murderous aura surged outward from the gold, sweeping all around; coffins were lifted and flung into the air, bursting open in mid-flight, and the Saint Lords' skeletons were pulverized into dust.

Yang Kai stared unblinkingly at that streak of gold, his expression shifting as he let out a low cry, "Demon God Golden Blood?"

The golden light exuded a thick stench of blood; it was certainly blood, yet shone like molten gold—its evil energy made even Yang Kai tremble, and it had been clutched tightly by a Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Aside from Demon God Golden Blood, he could think of no other possibility!

Why would a drop of Demon God Golden Blood be here? What connection did the legendary Great Demon God have with this Saint Lord?

As his thoughts spun, the floating drop of Demon God Golden Blood seemed to find its target; it vanished where it hovered, leaving a golden afterimage as it shot toward Yang Kai's brow and embedded itself between his eyebrows.

The next instant Yang Kai's face contorted grotesquely.

He felt his blood boiling and roaring; the golden blood within his veins appeared to activate and erupted, the explosive force tearing through his meridians and flesh. In moments Yang Kai was riddled with wounds, his organs burned, and he writhed in unbearable agony.

Bathed in blinding gold, Yang Kai howled to the heavens with an earth-shaking cry. The Small Xuan Realm's sky twisted; thick blood-tinged vapor rose, painting the realm in an eerie weave of gold and crimson.

The Indomitable Golden Body writhed and cracked, and the demonic qi stored within that Golden Body gushed uncontrollably, forming Demon Marks that overlaid Yang Kai's skin and sank into his flesh.

The small realm's gold-and-red colors were suddenly swallowed by pitch darkness; no light remained.

In that blackness Yang Kai gritted his teeth and held on, shivering as his skin split and blood trickled down to wet the ground.

Yet before his eyes a scroll seemed to unfurl, and within it an apocalyptic battle was playing out.
