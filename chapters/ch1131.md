## Chapter 1131 — Yang Flame's Confidence

Ba Qingyan felt he'd been earnest and sincere, laid his heart bare; if it were anyone else he wouldn't have been so blunt. He was worldly and schooled in human dealings—he knew precisely which words to use and which to avoid when bargaining.

Only when facing Yang Kai did he throw his family's terms out all at once, because he found the young man short on temper and patience, and perhaps Wu Yi had left him with a poor impression; if he hedged and hemmed he'd probably lose the chance to speak at all.

Being so frank and earnest, Ba Qingyan thought, as long as Yang Kai had any sense he shouldn't refuse these proposals.

So after speaking he looked at Yang Kai full of expectation.

"You have five breaths!" Yang Kai remained indifferent, showing not the slightest stir.

Ba Qingyan's expression flickered several times; he steeled himself and ground out, "Young friend, my Haike Family and the Xu Family are both peripheral powers of Yingyue Hall. Though we've had friction, we're allies—sworn to stand together and perish together. Were it not so, small forces like ours would long ago have been devoured by Yingyue Hall. Won't you reconsider?"

His words bore a threatening undertone: if Yang Kai did not rely on Haike's protection, and the Xu united with Haike, Yang Kai might face hostility from two forces.

Yang Kai nodded. “By all means, come. Once you’re here, we’ll see if you can make it back!”

After saying that, he didn't wait for Ba Qingyan's reaction and turned to walk into the cave.

Ba Qingyan trembled with rage. Though not the utmost in strength, he was still an elder of the Haike Family sent to recruit Yang Kai—who would have thought the brat would be so contemptuous and arrogant, giving him no opportunity?

Does he really take himself for something? A mere Saint King Realm—no matter how high his combat power, it's limited. When the Xu Family's experts swarm in, can he stop them? He has no sense of gratitude!

"Young friend!" Ba Qingyan's fury was stoked by Yang Kai's attitude; in a low voice he said, "Dragon Lair Mountain is Haike Family property; outsiders are not welcome. You should choose elsewhere to live."

Yang Kai, just at the cave entrance, heard that and immediately turned, casting a cold glance at Ba Qingyan.

Ba Qingyan was unabashed and sneered, "I know this place was given to you by Wu Yi, but now that Wu Yi has announced she left the family, she no longer has the right to gift Dragon Lair Mountain unless she returns to accept family law. Even so, it still belongs to Haike Family. It's not for an outsider to boss about here. Besides, any family disciples who come here will be punished!"

"Get out!" Yang Kai barked, his Divine Sense erupting like a tide.

Ba Qingyan grunted, his face went pale, and he was hurled backward, vomiting a mouthful of blood in midair; when he landed his face was horrified and his eyes filled with terror.

He was a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm practitioner, yet in Divine Sense he couldn't match Yang Kai—the newly promoted First Stage Saint King—and was struck and wounded in a single move. His Sea of Consciousness trembled in unrest.

If the brat wanted his life, would it not be effortless?

"I'm not killing you this time. Go back and tell your Haike Family: if you dare trouble me again I'll leave your family nothing. Wu Yi and the others are here with me; Dragon Lair Mountain is mine. If anyone treads this fifty-li range without my consent, they're my enemy—don't blame me for showing no mercy!"

"You..." Ba Qingyan pointed at Yang Kai, his finger trembling, nearly spitting blood again. He dared not stay and immediately summoned his Star Shuttle and fled.

Outside the cave, when Ba Qingyan had said anyone who came here would be punished, the warriors who had come with Wu Yi looked sombre; they had long heard of the family's laws and knew they were unbearable—those who'd had family law executed on them often ended maimed, two out of ten dead, and one perhaps bedridden for life.

Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye the once haughty Elder Ba would be coughing blood and running off, no longer daring to mention family law.

They hadn't even fully understood what had happened; for a time they stared at Yang Kai in a daze, eyes full of admiration and even excitement. They had left the family because of Wu Yi's unfair treatment and long resented Elder Ba; seeing him taught a lesson naturally delighted them.

These lower-tier fighters feared Elder Ba but had no reverence; whether Ba Qingyan lived or died meant nothing to them—the only thing that mattered was Wu Yi.

Back inside the cave, Yang Kai found Wu Yi looking very downcast and comforted her: "Don't worry; as long as you refuse to return to the family, they can't take you."

"I'm not worried about myself; it's you, Yang Kai. This time you went too far. Elder Ba's words were grating, but he told the truth: Haike did make an agreement with the Xu Family. If Xu cite that agreement, Haike must side with them even if unwilling. Combined with how you treated Elder Ba today, the families really might join efforts."

"I have my ways. This place won't be touched, and you won't suffer any harm!"

Yang Kai truly didn't fear two small families. He still had nearly a hundred drops of Golden Blood; if the enemy truly had numbers, he'd sacrifice a drop—no matter how many Saint Kings came, he could slaughter them.

Yang Kai had tested the power of Golden Blood and knew ordinary Saint Kings could not withstand it; after all, a drop equaled three months of his bitter cultivation. But it was too precious, and he wouldn't use it unless unavoidable.

"Yes—so long as I'm here, even if all the Xu Family came, or a few Origin Returning Realm came, they couldn't do anything to us," Yang Flame suddenly interjected from the side.

Yang Kai and Wu Yi both looked at her in astonishment, not knowing where she drew such confidence.

Yang Flame smiled mysteriously. "Three days. In three days, just wait and see!"

Seeing her brimming with confidence, Yang Kai grew expectant; he too wanted to know how powerful the defensive arrays Yang Flame had set with so many rare materials really were.

Perhaps infected by Yang Flame's mood, the gloom on Wu Yi's brow vanished and she became cheerful and talkative.

Though few in number on Dragon Lair Mountain, everything was stable. Wu Yi handled finances and materials; over forty underlings busied themselves helping, while Yang Flame brought the Stone Puppet to temper materials and lay out arrays.

Yang Kai returned to his stone chamber and found a new stone door had appeared—meticulously fashioned. When closed, it blocked outside sound. It also prevented others from probing in with Divine Sense, though his own Divine Sense could still extend outward.

That was a fine thing—Yang Kai was certain Yang Flame had made it. With the door, future seclusions would be much easier; at least outsiders coming and going wouldn't disturb him, and they couldn't see what he did inside.

Yang Flame said she would gather Saint Crystals not only to set arrays on Dragon Lair Mountain but because so many people had come. Though they weren't closely tied to Yang Kai, more hands made tasks easier; they had come to help Wu Yi leave the family, which also helped Yang Flame. She couldn't shortchange them—Saint Crystals, Pills, Secret Treasures—all cost money.

To amass a large number of Saint Crystals quickly, selling Ethereal Crystals would be most efficient but also utterly foolish. Yang Kai wouldn't do that.

If vast quantities of Ethereal Crystal flowed out from here, it would surely attract attention.

With Ethereal Crystals off the table, Yang Kai could only turn to Pills for income.

He was an alchemist and had never worried about money.

The Black Book Space contained countless Spiritual Herbs and Medicines—some taken from the Rainfall Star's Hengluo Commerce Guild warehouses, some gathered on the Floating Continent, some seized as spoils in battle, and some collected with Guiche and the others in that mysterious realm.

The spiritual herbs and medicines Yang Kai owned could rival the stores of a mid-sized force, and they covered every grade; even Origin-Grade and a fair quantity of Void King-Grade items were among them.

He took out ingredients, brought forth his furnace, and concentrated on refining Pills within the stone chamber.

Now that his power had improved, his alchemy seemed to have broken a bottleneck. Yang Kai tried making several Upper-Level Saint King Pills and found it not difficult, so he produced them. Though the chance to yield Pill Patterns wasn't high, it reached nearly one in five.

And as time passed, that probability kept rising—toward one in four, then one in three...

Yang Kai quietly calculated that he was now a Lower-Level Origin-Grade alchemist, meaning he could reliably refine Lower-Level Origin-Grade Pills; forcing higher-grade synthesis risked failure and loss of Origin-Grade materials.

He had little personal need for Pills; he refined chiefly to sell. A Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pill bearing Pill Patterns fetched a higher price than an ordinary Lower-Level Origin-Grade Pill, so he avoided wasting Origin-Grade materials and instead produced Saint King-Grade Pills.

He worked day and night, utterly absorbed in alchemy; through refining his Saint King Realm cultivation grew steadier and firmer.

Saint King-Grade Pills kept emerging from his hands; one jade bottle after another was filled and lined up, a sight of good omen.

Other alchemists needed long recovery after each refinement, but Yang Kai did not. His Divine Sense was vast, and the perennial nourishment of the Warm Spirit Lotus made his Divine Sense unusually strong; the Divine Sense consumed by alchemy was roughly balanced by the Lotus's recovery.
