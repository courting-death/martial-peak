## Chapter 1822 — The Core

Two hours later, Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor set out again, and they gradually moved farther and farther away.

The woman from Tianmu Palace watched their retreating figures and felt a surge of joy in the depths of her heart.

"Yang Saint Lord has returned — the continent is saved!" Though she had never crossed paths with Yang Kai before and this was their first meeting, she believed the matter without a sliver of doubt.

"Yang Kai, according to that little girl's words, this Devouring Spirit Sect really does have some sinister tricks," Ghost Ancestor said thoughtfully. "This method of drawing the continent's entire Spiritual Qi and converting it into Devouring Spirit Crystals is a most bizarre invention — even this old man finds it hard to fathom."

"Indeed, but such a thing can only be achieved by damaging the very foundations of the stars," Yang Kai said, touching several Devouring Spirit Crystals of similar size and almost indistinguishable hue in his hand.

All of these Devouring Spirit Crystals had been retrieved from Mu Chengfeng's Spatial Ring.

One was a semi-finished piece, taken directly from that Devouring Spirit Array, while the remaining crystals were already fully formed — clearly the harvest of Mu Chengfeng and the others over the past year.

Every portion of Spiritual Qi contained within those Devouring Spirit Crystals had originally belonged to Tongxuan Continent.

According to the woman from Tianmu Palace, the Devouring Spirit Sect had appeared on Tongxuan Continent only a year earlier; when a warship descended that day, the cultivators of Tongxuan had been baffled and unaware of what had happened. But after the Devouring Spirit Sect suppressed the continent with absolute dominance, they began to enslave the cultivators to serve them and to maintain the operation of the Devouring Spirit Array.

Any who resisted were killed without mercy.

Within a single year, dozens of families and forces on Tongxuan Continent had been exterminated.

Their Tianmu Palace also suffered grievous losses — in the end only one thousand people survived.

"Elder, you never heard the name Devouring Spirit Sect before?" Yang Kai asked, turning to Ghost Ancestor.

Ghost Ancestor shook his head. "No. You know that this old man was imprisoned for two thousand years and was freed not long ago; I don't know much about affairs in this Star Domain, but... you happen to have someone on hand who can be questioned."

"You mean..." Yang Kai murmured, then understood Ghost Ancestor's implication and drew the Soul-Fixing Bowl from the Spatial Ring. He condensed Divine Sense and struck it inward, then called softly, "Come out!"

In the next moment, Zi Donglai's soul-body wavered into view, trembling as he looked at Yang Kai with a face full of fearful flattery and said, "Brother Yang called me — what orders do you have? Have we arrived at Purple Star?"

"We haven't reached Purple Star. I have questions for you."

"Ask freely, Brother Yang. I will tell you all I know and hide nothing," Zi Donglai replied, wiping his brow as if he felt noticeably relieved.

"Have you ever heard of the Devouring Spirit Sect?" Yang Kai asked.

"The Devouring Spirit Sect?" Zi Donglai's expression shifted, and an unmistakable look of dread crossed his face.

"So you do know of them," Yang Kai said, reading the change in his demeanor and realizing this man had indeed heard of the sect.

"I do know of them. What is it? Have you encountered people from the Devouring Spirit Sect?" Zi Donglai asked anxiously.

"Yes. I ran into a group who claimed to be from the Devouring Spirit Sect; they had set up a Devouring Spirit Array and were refining something called Devouring Spirit Crystals," Yang Kai said, producing one such crystal and adding, "this thing here."

"It really is a Devouring Spirit Crystal!" Zi Donglai's eyes immediately flared hot as he stared greedily at the crystal, but he soon remembered his physical body had been destroyed and that the crystals were of no use to him — his shoulders drooped in dejection.

"Tell me about them — what's the background of the Devouring Spirit Sect? Why do you look so fearful?" Yang Kai put away the crystal and continued questioning.

"The Devouring Spirit Sect... I never met them in person; I only saw records in the Purple Star annals. It was said that about a hundred years ago, on a cultivation star named Tianlang, the Devouring Spirit Sect suddenly came into being, and then rose like a comet. Their rise was so rapid the entire Star Domain took notice. In less than ten years the sect produced numerous experts, even several Void King Realm figures — an extraordinary occurrence for a previously obscure sect."

"Therefore the three great forces of that Star Domain investigated the Devouring Spirit Sect. They discovered the sect had somehow mastered a secret technique — the kind that laid down a Devouring Spirit Array and refined Devouring Spirit Crystals — and the sect's cultivators could devour and refine the crystals' energy to rapidly raise their own strength in a short time."

"If it had stopped there it might not have mattered, but their rise coincided with the decline of Tianlang. Within fifty years of the sect's founding the density of Tianlang's Spiritual Qi had fallen by several grades. Only then did the three great forces realize the gravity of the situation. Any cultivation star is a priceless asset to its Star Domain; they could not allow the Devouring Spirit Sect to run rampant. If left unchecked, Tianlang would collapse. Thus the three powers jointly mobilized experts and attacked the Devouring Spirit Sect's main headquarters on Tianlang."

"In that battle the Devouring Spirit Sect was rooted out, but the three great powers also suffered heavy losses — an unprecedented event. A sect able to stand against the three great forces together was unheard of. After that battle the Devouring Spirit Sect disappeared from history. I had thought them extinguished, so I did not expect there to be stragglers."

"The three forces joined together!" Yang Kai was taken aback, then sneered, "Your three houses united not merely to stop the Devouring Spirit Sect from ruining Tianlang, did they? Weren't they also after something else?"

Zi Donglai forced a sheepish smile and flattered, "Brother Yang, your insight is sharp — the Devouring Spirit Sect possessed world-shaking secrets that could rapidly cultivate fighters; which power wouldn't covet that? Possession breeds suspicion. But, as far as I know, although the three great powers annihilated the Devouring Spirit Sect, they did not obtain the method for arranging the Devouring Spirit Array."

"Oh? Why is that?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"I don't know that. I only read some records in the sect annals; the specifics elude me," Zi Donglai admitted, worry creasing his brow. "Yet now, decades later, the Devouring Spirit Sect has reappeared — that is bad news. Tell me, Brother Yang, where are we? After that affair the Devouring Spirit Sect became a marked enemy, hunted everywhere; there is no way they could act again under the noses of the three great powers."

“This is my homeland,” Yang Kai replied casually. “It’s been a long time since any outsiders came here. I suppose that’s exactly why the Devouring Spirit Sect chose this place to set up their Devouring Spirit Array.”

"I see. Brother Yang, since you've found the Devouring Spirit Sect, you should eradicate them at once. If you give them even a chance to breathe they'll become a great disaster. I judge the Spiritual Qi here to be thin; there are likely no great experts — why not let me return to Purple Star and mobilize experts from there to come... hey, Brother Yang, listen to me — Brother Yang..."

After Yang Kai stuffed the Soul-Fixing Bowl back into the Spatial Ring he turned to Ghost Ancestor and said, "Elder, I'll need you to make a trip."

"Whatever the Sect Master commands, just say the word," Ghost Ancestor chuckled.

"It seems the Devouring Spirit Sect numbers many. The woman said they are dispersed across the continent, arranging Devouring Spirit Arrays. I want you to help me wipe them all out."

"No problem," Ghost Ancestor cackled, "They're easy enough to find — just follow the trail of Spiritual Qi depletion and you can trace them. Besides, I'm quite intrigued by that Devouring Spirit Array; had I known such a heaven-defying formation existed, I should not have stayed silent when Mu Chengfeng died — I ought to have pressed him for answers."

"You may study the array, but you must not use it."

"This old man knows better than to become a public enemy of the Star Domain. Sect Master, rest assured — I'll be gone and back before long. By the way, after I deal with them, where shall I look you up?"

"The Nine Heavens Sacred Land," Yang Kai replied. "Ask around when you get there and you'll know the direction."

"Good — I'll go!" Ghost Ancestor laughed, the Ten Thousand Souls Banner wrapped around him as he turned into a black light and sped away.

After the Ghost Ancestor departed, Yang Kai gazed thoughtfully into a certain direction. Behind him, his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled, roaring with the sound of storm and lightning as he too turned into a streak of light and vanished.

He had never imagined that this return to Tongxuan Continent would lead to such events. With Ghost Ancestor personally heading off to root out the Devouring Spirit Sect remnants, he had little to fear there — but the Core itself was a place he would have to go to in person.

Mu Chengfeng had said his father intended to refine the Stellar Origin of Tongxuan Continent; if that were so, then the Sect Master of the Devouring Spirit Sect must be located at the Core.

The source power of a cultivation star forever lay hidden in its core, but reaching it was extraordinarily arduous; the laws contained in the source power were not something ordinary people could withstand — only experts at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm could resist them for a time.

However, Tongxuan's origin had been refined by Little Senior Sister, and since Little Senior Sister was not on this continent, it should be comparatively easy to infiltrate the Core now.

If Yang Kai's guess was correct, the Devouring Spirit Sect's Sect Master was already within the Core.

He flew for a while and found a suitable spot, then landed. He waved and released Xiaoxiao, then dove into the Xuan Realm Pearl himself, leaving Xiaoxiao to carry the Imperial Treasure.

In the next instant, Xiaoxiao used its innate divine ability to vanish into the earth and sped toward the Core with great swiftness.

Only an hour later did Yang Kai release Divine Sense and probe outward, and he discovered that indeed they had reached the Core: magma churned below, the heat was intense, and even the Spiritual Qi present here carried an unimaginable scorching toxicity.

From an extremely distant spot, faint movements could still be detected.

Yang Kai's expression turned grave as he burst from the Xuan Realm Pearl, cocked an ear to listen for a moment, and then hurried toward the source of the sound.

About one hundred li from where Yang Kai stood, a rugged-looking middle-aged man stood with his hands folded behind his back, and five cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm were arrayed to either side of him.

The middle-aged man stared straight ahead, his gaze severe and commanding.

Before him hovered a dazzling sphere of energy, and on that sphere a clear face manifested, veiled with a thin gauze that obscured its true features; a blue crystal adorned the forehead and the eyes were clear, like a spirit from a lonely valley.

This woman — if not Xia Ningshang, then who?
