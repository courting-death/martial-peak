## Chapter 1721 — Just a Formation

Sha Hu and that burly middle-aged man stared at each other across empty space; sparks seemed to fly, scattering into the void, and everyone in the Sea Hall dared not even draw a breath, standing to the side with hearts pounding.

After a long moment, Sha Hu sighed, his gaze no longer so aggressive, and he said to the burly man, "Huai'an, Yang Kai is my guest—I'll receive him myself. You should take your people and withdraw."

Hearing Sha Hu's address for the middle-aged man, Yang Kai instantly realized the other's identity.

The Sea Hall's Hall Master, Jiang Huai'an!

In fact, Yang Kai had heard the name Jiang Huai’an before — back when he first took part in the Tianyun City auction. The Origin Condensing Pill of Lower Origin Grade that he had personally refined at the time was bought for a hefty price by none other than this very Jiang Huai’an.

At the time, Wei Guchang had said Jiang Huai'an bought that Origin Condensing Pill for his son.

But this was the first time Yang Kai had met him face to face.

Yang Kai casually sized up the Sea Hall's Hall Master and found the man’s strength had already reached the peak of the Origin Returning Realm; his aura was even denser than Qian Tong's had been, and he truly had the qualifications and ability to serve as the Sea Hall's Hall Master.

Moreover… the fellow was bold. Yang Kai did not know what grudge existed between him and Sha Hu, but clearly their relationship was far from amicable.

Jiang Huai'an smiled and said, "Senior Uncle Sha, you're mistaken. Although Sect Master Yang is your guest, he seeks to collude with the Sea Race; forgive your Junior Nephew for not being able to stand idly by. You know how deep the grudges between the Sea Race and our Sea Hall run—each year our Sea Hall disciples have died at the hands of the Sea Race; those from the Sea God Palace are our mortal enemies. Since you know this man, you should step back for a time. Leave this matter to your Junior Nephew; I will give you a satisfactory explanation."

Yang Kai's brow rose—he vaguely sensed he had been dragged into some vortex of conflict, and that the dispute clearly lay between Jiang Huai'an and Sha Hu.

It seemed that every family had its own troubles — Yang Kai sighed inwardly.

"Huai'an, must you be like this?" Sha Hu's face darkened; he showed no sign of retreat.

"Your Junior Nephew only acts for the Sea Hall's sake!" Hall Master Jiang Huai'an straightened his posture, showing no shame or avoidance. "Please forgive your Junior Nephew, Senior Uncle!"

Sha Hu fixed Jiang Huai'an with a fierce gaze; Saint Yuan around him twitched as if ready to be unleashed—he seemed about to strike. Sensing this, Jiang Huai'an was not afraid; instead he revealed an eager expression, as if he could hardly wait for Sha Hu to make a move.

"Elder Sha, what exactly is going on here?" Yang Kai asked, baffled.

Sha Hu glanced at him and sighed, "Shame on me. I've been too soft-hearted. I'm afraid, I've troubled you."

"Elder Sha, you're being too serious," Yang Kai chuckled, "but all this makes me rather puzzled."

"Wait a moment. I will settle this matter, then I'll come speak with you." Sha Hu said.

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded and assumed an onlooker's pose, smiling as he looked around.

Sha Hu turned his gaze to Jiang Huai'an and spoke gravely, "Huai'an, you were once one of the Sea Hall's unparalleled geniuses, but your heart is too narrow. I thought that after so many years, and after you rose to Hall Master and gained a broader view, you might have changed, but you've disappointed me. No matter how high you climb, no matter how deep your cultivation grows, Jiang Huai'an remains the Jiang Huai'an of old—unchanged!"

Being openly criticized by Sha Hu before so many of the Sea Hall's experts left Jiang Huai'an no small embarrassment; he snapped, "You needn't concern yourself over Junior Nephew's affairs, Senior Uncle."

Sha Hu shook his head slowly, "A country can change, but nature cannot! I disappeared for three hundred years; now, with the help of Sect Master Yang I have returned to the Sea Hall, and I do not wish to participate in squabbles for power. As long as I can bring opportunity for growth to the Sea Hall, it matters not who takes the three Hall Masters' seats. Do you think I would vie for the Hall Master position? Ridiculous. To speak plainly—today I have not set my sight on the Hall Master positions at all!"

Jiang Huai'an's eye twitched as he stared fixedly at Sha Hu, as if trying to discern whether he spoke truth or falsehood.

Beside them, Yang Kai showed an expression of understanding; he finally grasped why he had been treated so.

Clearly Jiang Huai'an had misjudged Sha Hu with the heart of a petty man, thinking Sha Hu's return threatened his status, so he went out of his way to make things difficult for Yang Kai to suppress Sha Hu.

As for colluding with the Sea Race, that was merely a convenient excuse. Even without that pretext, the Sea Hall would have found other reasons—Yang Kai simply happened to have stepped into their power struggle and become a bargaining chip.

Sha Hu, however, had no desire to vie for power. He had lived on Ghost Isle for three hundred years and had long since grown indifferent to fame and fortune; in this life he pursued only a stronger Martial Dao.

But Jiang Huai'an was, after all, a Hall Master of the Sea Hall; though Sha Hu was displeased, he would not strike first, and so he endured.

That was why he had called it being too soft-hearted.

Jiang Huai'an's threat to Yang Kai had forced Sha Hu to step forward, until he could no longer tolerate it.

Thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind like lightning, and in an instant he suspected the root cause of the present situation.

"I will give you one last chance! Apologize to Sect Master Yang and I'll treat this as though it never happened; you may remain Hall Master of the Sea Hall. As for me, I will withdraw from the Sea Hall and never return!" Sha Hu said coldly to Jiang Huai'an, his tone leaving no room for doubt.

Jiang Huai'an's eyelids fluttered; fury visibly burned in his eyes.

Sha Hu, relying on his years and authority, spoke in a commanding tone, and this rankled Jiang Huai'an. If he humbly apologized to Yang Kai as Sha Hu demanded, his dignity as Hall Master would be utterly shattered; people would regard him as nothing but a puppet arranged by Sha Hu.

That was something Jiang Huai'an absolutely could not tolerate.

"Senior Uncle, you are the highest in seniority within our Sea Hall; your Junior Nephew has always respected you, but you have disappointed me. As an elder of the Sea Hall, you do not consider the Hall's interests; instead you ask this Hall Master to apologize to an outsider? What right does he have? Senior Uncle, I offer you one chance—leave this matter and withdraw; Junior Nephew promises to be respectful and filial to you in future. If not, do not blame Junior Nephew for being without mercy."

"It seems we have nothing more to say," Sha Hu said, his expression dim.

He never expected that upon returning, full of joy, to the Sea Hall he’d been away from for so long, he would encounter such things. Had he known earlier, he might as well have stayed hidden on Ghost Isle and never come out.

"So Senior Uncle is determined to oppose me and the Sea Hall?" Jiang Huai'an narrowed his eyes at Sha Hu and, without waiting, put a heavy charge on him.

Sha Hu remained silent, his expression stricken with grief.

"Very well, then I shan't be polite!" Jiang Huai'an suddenly roared, "Form the array!"

At his command, Black Reef Island suddenly thrummed and trembled; in the next moment a bright curtain of light enveloped the whole island, and throughout the hundred-mile sea the currents surged so that waves rose ten zhang.

An overwhelming torrent of water-attribute Spiritual Qi surged madly toward Black Reef Island. In midair, countless strange beasts formed out of that Spiritual Qi, so densely packed that the naked eye could no longer discern them — mixed among them were myriad weapons, all likewise condensed from water-attribute Qi.

A destructive aura descended from the heavens!

Sha Hu's face changed dramatically, and he cried out in alarm, "The Tidal Azure Wave Formation! So you had planned this—you're willing to activate such an array just to trouble me?!"

Jiang Huai'an smiled, "Senior Uncle speaks jokingly—this formation is not aimed at you, after all you are one of the Sea Hall."

As he spoke, Jiang Huai'an turned to look at Yang Kai.

"Not meant for Elder Sha, then it's for me?" Yang Kai pointed at his own nose with utter nonchalance.

Jiang Huai'an's smile turned cold, "I have heard Sect Master Yang is powerful—so much that the leaders of Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, and Star Emperor Mountain have been struck down by him. This Hall Master must not be careless!"

"Hall Master Jiang flatters me. Those praises are mere rumor."

"Hmph! Sect Master Yang is the head of the Lingxiao Sect; normally we of the Sea Hall would not interfere, but since you dare collude with the Sea Race, you are our mortal enemy. Sect Master Yang, surrender!" Hall Master Jiang looked at Yang Kai with lofty confidence, fully convinced that under his great formation Yang Kai would be powerless to resist.

“Yang Kai, go!” Sha Hu suddenly shouted in a deep voice. “The Tidal Azure Wave Formation is the Sea Hall’s grand guardian array. It draws upon the abundant Water Spiritual Qi of the surrounding seas — once activated, its power is endless! Below the Void King Realm, no one can possibly break through it! But with your abilities, leaving shouldn’t be difficult. Go first — this old man will hold them off!”

"Truly, Senior Uncle, your knowledge of the Sea Hall's great array is profound; yet must you say so much to an outsider?" Jiang Huai'an sneered at Sha Hu.

"Audacious! I have already said I do not wish to contend with you, but you are short-sighted and will let the Sea Hall decline under your hand. For the sake of our ancestors, I must do battle with you even if I would rather not."

"Calm down, Elder Sha!" Yang Kai patted Sha Hu's shoulder lightly, appearing perfectly at ease.

"You… are foolish!" Sha Hu stamped his foot in vexation. "The longer this formation charges, the stronger it grows. If you hesitate any longer, you may not even be able to leave."

"I wasn't planning to leave," Yang Kai said with a laugh, "it's only a formation, after all."

"Only?" Sha Hu's expression froze; his formation being dismissed so lightly by Yang Kai felt strange to him. Yet upon seeing Yang Kai's utter composure, his frown eased and he pondered, "If that's how you put it, then I won't waste words—be careful."
