## Chapter 643 — Is He Courting Death?

Hua Mo clearly did not like Yang Kai's attitude — how dare he, a prisoner under supervision, still try to haggle.

Yang Kai smiled calmly. "I can also choose," he said, "that when I grow into a Saint-Grade alchemist, whether to refine that sort of Pill for you, or to make some imperceptible adjustments while refining it."

The expressions of the others shifted. Han Fei in particular looked at Yang Kai with murderous intent, her face hostile.

"You dare!" Hua Mo roared angrily.

Li Rong reached out to restrain Hua Mo's rage, then looked at Yang Kai and said, "That is a matter for far in the future. I believe that if we meet your demands, you would not do such things, right?"

"Depends on my mood." Yang Kai shrugged, wearing an expression that said he had them figured out.

"Tell us your demands. I just mentioned to Guan'er that as long as your request is not excessive, we can unconditionally grant it — I said that to your face as well." Li Rong smiled faintly and did not lose her temper.

Yang Kai glanced at her and found that this composed beauty truly carried a placid, gentle temperament; her broad mind seemed able to encompass everything. She was the sort of woman of a certain standing, even more mature than Yun Xuan, and there was always a flash of wise calmness in her eyes that made people involuntarily feel a closeness toward her.

Hearing her speak like that, the slight resistance and hostility in Yang Kai's heart dissipated.

Composing his expression, Yang Kai said in a deep voice, "I want Divine Sense Fire!"

Li Rong, Han Fei and Hua Mo's expressions changed subtly. Li Rong hastily laughed to cover her lapse and said softly, "Aren't you yourself a cultivator who possesses Divine Sense Fire? Asking us for Divine Sense Fire — are you sure you're not asking the wrong people?"

Yang Kai shook his head serenely and looked meaningfully at Li Rong. "One who is straightforward does not speak in riddles — you know what I mean."

The three fell silent at once.

Seeing their silence, Yang Kai knew he had a chance and pressed it, "What use do you have for those dozen or so pieces of Divine Sense Fire? Do you intend to cultivate an alchemist who possesses Divine Sense Fire yourselves? Heh, I advise you to give up; if I'm not mistaken, you've already tried and know the consequences. In short, your demon race's constitution is not suited to pill-refining!"

"You seem to know quite a lot." Hua Mo sounded slightly surprised. Although Yang Kai's words had seemed random on the surface, to those who knew the inside story, they clearly understood what he meant.

"That is thanks to the scriptures left behind here; there are many obscure records within."

"Detestable human!" Hua Mo ground her teeth. They had checked all the remaining scriptures one by one and confirmed there was nothing in them that would leak any harmful information about Mo Shen Fort before allowing Yang Kai to view them, yet he had still tampered with things.

Communication among alchemists is so covert that one can never be fully on guard!

Li Rong nodded and said, "Indeed, we do have those dozen or so pieces of Divine Sense Fire. These Divine Sense Fires were the inheritance left behind when human cultivators captured by our Senior Coffin-Servant died, preserved by special methods through the years without the slightest loss."

Yang Kai's eyes lit up and he licked his lips, "I want those. Give them to me and I'll grant your wish!"

"It's not that we can't give them to you." Li Rong's brows knit slightly. "As you said, over the years we did try to cultivate an alchemist who could possess Divine Sense Fire, but although our demonfolk are robust and powerful, we do not know where the problem lies — we simply cannot refine Pills. When those of our race attempted to devour and fuse with these Divine Sense Fires, their minds were burned away and several died."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, knowing his guess had been correct.

Having been confined in this Small Xuan Realm for so many years, Yang Kai did not believe these demons relied solely on finding human cultivators with Divine Sense Fire from outside to free themselves; they were certainly making efforts themselves, only without progress.

"You demonfolk are interesting; your physical constitutions are stronger than any other race, so why can you not refine Pills?" Yang Kai smiled, a hint of schadenfreude in his tone.

"Every gain has its loss. Precisely because our constitutions are so strong, if we could refine Pills, where would other races have a place to live?" Han Fei replied.

"Not every demon is incapable of refining pills. In our history there once lived the greatest alchemist the world has ever seen — someone even your human pill-masters couldn't hold a candle to," Han Fei retorted coldly.

"Oh? There was such a figure? Who was it?"

Li Rong slowly shook her head, unwilling to go into it, and returned to the earlier topic: "Keeping the Divine Sense Fire does us little good. If you want them, we can give them to you — but can you guarantee you can safely swallow and absorb those Divine Sense Fires without dying? If you die, it would be troubling for us as well. After all, finding someone like you is difficult; Senior Coffin-Servant can basically find only one person every ten years."

"Do I look like someone who would seek his own death?" Yang Kai grinned broadly.

Li Rong gazed at him intently for a long moment before she gave a slight nod and inclined her head, "Then I will fulfill your request. I hope you will not become greedy."

"Pleasure doing business with you!"

Li Rong smiled faintly, turned and walked outside, her soft voice drifting back, "Tomorrow I will have someone send the Divine Sense Fire."

"I'll be waiting!"

Han Fei watched Yang Kai coldly and warned, "You have only ten years. If you cannot satisfy us after ten years, I will personally make you know what it is to live worse than death!"

This icy beauty seemed to bear grudges. Yang Kai had only remarked that she was cold on the outside but warm within, and now she had taken such offense that Yang Kai felt helpless.

The three Saint Realm powerhouses left quickly, and the young girl Guan'er disappeared as well.

The next day, Guan'er brought ten or so vessels exquisitely carved from white jade; each was about the size of a fist and sealed. Faint, barely visible patterns shone on them, as if some method had been used to seal them.

Placing the ten or so vessels before Yang Kai, Guan'er snorted coldly, "These are the things you wanted."

Yang Kai's expression flickered as he picked one up and was about to use True Yuan to break the vessel's seal, when Guan'er's face went pale and she cried out, "What are you doing?"

"Unsealing and absorbing." Yang Kai smiled brightly.

"Are you crazy?" Guan'er was extremely anxious, "Each of the Divine Sense Fires in here belonged to cultivators no lower than the Transcendent Realm; their Divine Senses are far stronger than yours. To recklessly absorb them, your end will be the same as my clansmen — burned to death. Don't joke about this!"

"I'm not joking!" Yang Kai shook his head seriously.

"Don't you have a more secure method?" Guan'er asked urgently. "Yesterday you said you wanted these Divine Sense Fires. Lady Li thought you had a very safe way to absorb them, which is why she decided to give them to you. If you do this, she..."

"This is my method. If you don't want to die, stay away."

"Wait, I'll report this to Lady Li first and we can wait for her decision." Guan'er cried out and hurriedly ran outside, clearly intending to inform Li Rong of the sudden change to let her decide.

"Do not act rashly before Lady Li arrives!"

No sooner had the words left her mouth than Guan'er sensed a searing heat that made her spirit uneasy.

This heat was not the heat of True Yuan, but a burning that came from the depths of a soul; under that scorching influence, Guan'er felt as if her soul were being roasted, pain unbearable.

Her beautiful eyes trembled violently as she rushed outside, then stopped again, afraid her soul would be burned away.

In the bustle she looked back and saw the entire stone chamber had turned a deep red; the space was suffused with the law of fire, and clusters of flame clouds visible to the naked eye rapidly formed. Those flame clouds not only contained Divine Sense Fire, but also the spirits and wills of the cultivators who had died, making them chaotic and overwhelming.

Yet that terrifying heat could not affect the human in the slightest.

He sat there enjoying it, his face animated.

Suddenly, a frenzied attraction emanated from his mind; in an instant, the power containing the Divine Sense Fire was swallowed by him entirely and vanished.

Guan'er stood dumbstruck, staring at the incredible scene as if she could not draw breath.

The stone chamber returned to calm, but Yang Kai was not yet satisfied; he casually broke the seals on all the remaining vessels.

Guan'er's face went pale and she immediately cursed, "Madman!"

Then she turned and fled without looking back.

One piece of Divine Sense Fire alone had made her feel like she was facing death; with a dozen suddenly surging out, she could not endure them at all.

A wave of heat burst from the chamber and sent Guan'er tumbling as she fled, nearly falling to the ground. Once she steadied herself, many of the people of Mo Shen Fort hurried over.

Li Rong appeared in plain dress and asked in a deep voice, "What happened? Weren't you supposed to deliver those Divine Sense Fires to him? Why were all the seals suddenly broken?"

"He unsealed them himself..." Guan'er was beside herself and could only explain weakly, "I tried to stop him but failed..."

"Is he courting death?" Even Li Rong could not stay composed; her body swayed as she rushed into the chamber. Although she had agreed to give the Divine Sense Fires to Yang Kai, she had not expected the confident-seeming Yang Kai to be such a rash youngster.

How could he survive having all the seals broken like that?

Fixing her gaze, her expression unconsciously paused.

She discovered that the scorching force she had felt earlier had now entirely vanished. The human had not suffered any harm; on the contrary, he sat contentedly as if savoring something, his face full of joy.

Evidently he was absorbing and refining those dozen or so Divine Sense Fires.

Li Rong's expression turned strange; she found herself momentarily unable to understand this human.

Those dozen pieces of Divine Sense Fire from Transcendent Realm powerhouses — even she did not dare lightly probe them — had all been absorbed into this human's Sea of Consciousness.

What support did he have that could guarantee his safety?
