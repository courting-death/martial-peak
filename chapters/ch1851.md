## Chapter 1851 — Left Home Without a Brain

“Isn’t this President Hua?” Just as Hua Youmeng was lost in thought, a voice suddenly came from the side. Hearing it, her brows knit together slightly, and she turned her head to look in that direction.

Not far off, a man of about thirty strode over with the swagger of a dragon and the gait of a tiger, chuckling as he walked, his triangular eyes repeatedly roaming over the sensitive places of Hua Youmeng's body.

The man was dressed in luxurious clothing and looked like someone with influential backing, yet those naturally triangular eyes lent him a sinister air, and under his leering stare Hua Youmeng felt instantly uncomfortable.

Behind him followed two Origin Returning Realm warriors, expressionless—clearly bodyguards.

"Jiang Chao!" A look of loathing and apprehension flashed across Hua Youmeng's beautiful eyes, but she quickly reminded herself she was not alone now—Yang Kai was at her side—and she immediately recovered a composed demeanor.

"Heh heh, what a small world, President Hua—what a coincidence to run into you here, fate indeed, fate!" Jiang Chao pretended not to notice Hua Youmeng's rejecting posture and kept up an appearance of affability.

"Chairman Jiang, you jest. We are both Commerce Guild chiefs; as the saying goes, colleagues are rivals—there is no fate between us," Hua Youmeng said coldly.

"Rivals, huh?" Jiang Chao was unconcerned, a smirk lifting one corner of his mouth. "I prefer the phrase 'colleagues are enemies.' President Hua, you are my enemy, indeed."

Hearing the brazen flirtation, Hua Youmeng's pretty face darkened and she snapped, "Chairman Jiang, mind your manners!"

"Ha," Jiang Chao laughed, "Why should I bother when you're right here? We'll be family before long anyway. By the way, the matter I mentioned six months ago—how have you decided? I don't have the patience to wait forever. You abruptly left Purple Star city six months ago and I couldn't find you; now that we've met, give me an answer quickly."

Hua Youmeng's expression turned sullen; she ground her teeth and glared at him.

Jiang Chao sneered coldly. "President Hua, you must know your little guild can never amount to much—what can a few kittens do? Why not merge with my Saint Yuan Commerce Guild? Under my leadership, how could you not prosper? If not for you being a woman who bears heavy burdens, do you think I would let you enjoy such a great benefit? I'm a man who cherishes beauty; I cannot bear to see a beauty suffer."

"Chairman Jiang, I already gave you a clear answer last time: the Five Directions Commerce Guild will not merge with your Saint Yuan Commerce Guild. Give up that thought and stop harassing me," Hua Youmeng said, then casually pulled Yang Kai by the arm. "Let's go."

"Go?" Jiang Chao's triangular eyes flashed. He stepped to block Hua Youmeng's path. "Where are you going? Since fate placed you before me today, you won't leave without giving me a satisfactory answer. You'll answer me today whether you want to or not!"

"You intend to make a scene here?" Hua Youmeng cried out. "This is Purple Star city..."

"Ha!" Jiang Chao sneered. "Purple Star city? President Hua, perhaps my previous leniency gave you the wrong impression—have you forgotten who I am? Even if I were to act, so what? Besides, I heard your Five Directions Commerce Guild made a ruckus at the city gate yesterday and beat people. I don't know how you remain unpunished, but if I handed you over to the guard troops, it would surely be credited, not blamed."

Hearing him mention his backing, Hua Youmeng's pretty face changed slightly—she showed clear fear.

Seeing her hesitate, Jiang Chao sneered and said, “President Hua, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. This Young Master doesn’t have that much patience. Give me a satisfactory answer right now, and we’ll still be one family in the future. Otherwise…”

Hua Youmeng looked helpless and imploringly glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sighed, knowing it would not be effective if he stayed silent. He stepped forward, patted Hua Youmeng's shoulder, sent her behind him, and looked calmly at Jiang Chao with a faint smile. "Friend, did you forget to bring something when you left home?"

Jiang Chao sized up Yang Kai with his triangular eyes and snarled fiercely, "Who is this brat that dares speak to this Young Master like this?"

Seeing Hua Youmeng so meek and compliant toward Yang Kai, an irrational rage rose in him and his attitude became uncivil.

"Calling yourself 'this Young Master' in front of me, you truly did forget something," Yang Kai chuckled.

Jiang Chao's expression turned cold and severe. "Kid, then tell me—what did I forget to bring?"

Yang Kai pointed forward; before Jiang Chao could react, Yang Kai jabbed a finger at his forehead and smiled. "Friend, you left home without a brain, didn't you?"

Jiang Chao stumbled back several steps, a look of shock on his face. He was, after all, a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior, yet he could not resist when someone simply pressed his forehead—clearly the other's strength far exceeded his own. Had that person intended to kill, he would not have survived.

Cold sweat broke out on Jiang Chao; humiliated and furious, he roared, "Bastard! How dare you insult me?"

Yang Kai laughed loudly and said, “If you’d brought your brain with you when you left the house, how could you not figure out why, after we beat people up at the city gates yesterday, we’re still safe and sound today?”

"Why?" Jiang Chao was confused by Yang Kai's words.

"It turns out you didn't forget your brain—you were born with a pig's brain!" Yang Kai said with a look of sudden enlightenment.

Hua Youmeng, listening amusedly on the side, couldn't help laughing out loud, then quickly covered her red lips with a delicate hand.

"How dare you!" Jiang Chao flew into a rage. His Saint Yuan flared involuntarily, and he looked ready to come to blows with Yang Kai.

The two bodyguards behind him changed expression and hurried forward to restrain him; one leaned close and whispered something into Jiang Chao's ear.

Jiang Chao's neck stiffened as he snapped, "Backing? Even if he has backing, how could it be stronger than me? I'm of the Jiang Family—the Eighth Elder of Purple Star is my ancestral uncle! Whose backing could surpass mine?"

Yang Kai was stunned and glanced at Hua Youmeng. "The Eighth Elder of Purple Star is of his Jiang Family?"

"Yes. Elder Jiang Changfeng is the highest-ranking member of his family," Hua Youmeng said gravely. For this reason she felt helpless against Jiang Chao's harassment; although the elder and Jiang Chao were separated by many generations and rarely met, having such background allowed Jiang Chao to strut about in Purple Star city.

Jiang Chao had long set his sights on her Five Directions Commerce Guild and on her personally; had Hua Youmeng not persistently avoided him, who knew what fate she'd have suffered.

"Kid, scared now?" Jiang Chao looked at Yang Kai triumphantly. "Kneel and apologize now and I might spare your life; otherwise..."

"Or else what?" Yang Kai asked, smiling without a hint of fear.

"You dare!" Jiang Chao flew into a rage and shouted, "Seize him!"

The two bodyguards hesitated, knowing Yang Kai was not to be trifled with, but they dared not disobey an order and rushed at him from both sides.

Both were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts with formidable methods; though they hadn't fathomed Yang Kai's depth, they believed two of them together should subdue him.

To their surprise, as soon as they reached Yang Kai and before they could employ their techniques, Yang Kai simply grinned and delivered two slaps left and right.

The motions were casual and elegant, as if merely brushing away bothersome mosquitoes.

Yet those two slaps dragged them into a vortex of power they could not escape.

"This is..."

"Not good!" they both cried, frantically forcing Saint Yuan to resist, but before that vortex their Saint Yuan was like paper—instantly shredded.

Two screams rang out as the assailants were flung left and right, crashing into the shop walls lining the street and smashing great holes in them.

In an instant, curses erupted from the damaged shops; many warriors poured out and looked around, wondering what kind of person dared injure others inside Purple Star city.

Hissing, Jiang Chao was left standing there, eyes widened, sucking in a cold breath until his lungs ached. He stared at Yang Kai in horror and exclaimed, "Void King Realm?"

His two guards were not the top elite of the Origin Returning Realm, but they were no weaklings—yet the two together were slapped away by the other; such a feat was impossible without Void King Realm strength.

That unassuming man—handsomer than himself no less—whom he'd called a bastard, was actually a Void King Realm warrior?

Jiang Chao's soles cramped as terror gripped him; he watched Yang Kai's smiling face grow horribly menacing.

He wanted to flee, but found he could not summon a trace of Saint Yuan or strength; his feet felt nailed to the ground as Yang Kai walked toward him step by step.

A wave of deathly aura rushed straight at him, making Jiang Chao feel as though he had fallen into an icy abyss!

"Who dares wreak havoc inside Purple Star city!" a furious shout came from afar, and soon the guard troops' figures flashed from the crowd, encircling Yang Kai and Jiang Chao until the area was sealed, their faces grim.
