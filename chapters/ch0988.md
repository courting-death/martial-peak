## Chapter 988 — The Kid's Pretty Lucky

Bi Ya's delicate body tightened suddenly; she gave a coquettish gasp, then pouted at Yang Kai and, in a sultry voice, said, "Easy—you're going to break me."

"Slut!" Yang Kai cursed inwardly, yet an uncontrollable thrill rose up from deep within him. Especially the two full mounds in his hands—their astonishing springiness nearly robbed him of reason, and the heat pouring from her flesh was enough to shatter his psychological defenses.

Bi Ya appeared to be flushed with desire and impatient, but Yang Kai keenly sensed that the flow of power inside her body had subtly shifted into something strange.

Her whole bearing was changing without a trace, making her seem even more alluring and delectable, so that any man riding her would find it impossible to resist her temptation.

The beauty was like an overripe honey peach; the exposed skin glowed with an unusual flush, as if any part of her body could be squeezed and yield water.

Such a woman had a lethal attraction to every man.

Yang Kai's eyes reddened and his pupils dilated; barely able to restrain himself, his two large hands mechanically kneaded her fullness.

He seemed to have lost his wits.

After watching silently for a while, a triumphant look appeared in Bi Ya's beautiful eyes.

She knew the man beneath her had been completely subdued; now she could do as she pleased.

She had possessed countless men before; in those entanglements she could absorb all of a man's Essence-Blood to strengthen herself.

Men she toyed with often ended up as dried husks, discarded at will.

Although she had toyed with many, Saint-Grade cultivators were still hard to come by—those who had reached such strength generally would not sit idly and let her have her way.

That was why she especially liked men like Yang Kai. This young man, with his strong body and heroic bearing, suited her taste even more.

After confirming Yang Kai had already fallen, Bi Ya pursed her lips and smiled. She wiped the corner of her mouth—there seemed to be saliva there.

She loosened her clothes and exposed a body as white as jade; her slender hand reached out and gripped Yang Kai's hard length.

A soft exhalation escaped; Bi Ya's beautiful eyes rippled like water as she murmured to herself, "This one's no small asset."

She felt a secret thrill, and slightly raised her body, preparing to sit down.

A thread of crystalline viscous fluid flowed from between her legs, sliding down her long, shapely thighs.

At that moment her movement halted. Her brows drew into a line; anger and displeasure flashed across her pretty face as she turned to look toward the door.

As her gaze shifted, Yang Kai's previously dilated pupils contracted slightly, and the power he had been gathering quietly dispersed.

Urgent footsteps sounded in the corridor outside. Immediately the door was pushed open and Liu Shan and Liu Sha appeared in the doorway.

The two of them simply stared at Bi Ya and Yang Kai in their extremely intimate posture on the bed, showing no sign of embarrassment. Liu Sha even whistled lecherously, his thieving eyes lingering over the marvels of Bi Ya's body.

"We're leaving now," Liu Shan said indifferently.

"What?" Bi Ya's face soured. "Didn't we just get back?"

"It's the Lord's order. If you have complaints, take them up with him," Liu Shan replied coldly. "I'll give you ten breaths!"

Saying that, he turned and left. From start to finish he never paid extra attention to Bi Ya's body, as if that perfectly tempting figure held no attraction for him.

Bi Ya looked at Yang Kai lying beneath her, already powerless; she clenched her teeth, half reluctant and half annoyed. After a moment she turned and glared at Liu Sha, "What are you staring at? Keep looking and I'll gouge your eyes out!"

Liu Sha grinned and called out, "Why don't you say that to Liu Shan? He was looking too."

"He wasn't moved; you were. You cheap man, get out!" Bi Ya flicked her hand and the door was shut.

Outside, Liu Sha pinched his nose and muttered in displeasure, "It's not like I haven't seen it before—no need to make a fuss."

Then he laughed loudly. "Still, being interrupted at such a crucial moment would rile anyone. Liu Shan, well done."

"I'm just relaying the Lord's orders," Liu Shan snorted.

In the antechamber, Bi Ya cursed through gritted teeth as she dressed in the clothes she'd just taken off; a little while later she stormed angrily out of the room.

The three of them's footsteps receded into the distance.

Once he was sure they had gone, Yang Kai's expression turned dark and he sat up from the bed.

If Liu Shan had arrived even a moment later, he would have been pushed to drastic action.

Bi Ya believed he had been utterly defeated and left defenseless; so close, Yang Kai was certain he could have killed her with a single strike.

What to do after killing her, Yang Kai had no idea.

He only knew he absolutely could not have physical contact with this wanton beauty; the aura she exhaled when stirred was too dangerous.

It was an aura that would devour him alive.

The starry void was indeed splendid, but it also carried far greater dangers.

Putting his clothes back on properly, Yang Kai sat on the bed and started to think.

Now that Bi Ya had gone and no one was watching him, he considered seizing the chance to escape the great ship. But he did not know how to open the exit to the ship's Secret Treasure; acting rashly might bring more harm than good.

While he brooded, the door opened again.

A middle-aged man stood in the doorway, looking at Yang Kai with an extremely strange expression.

He possessed the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—a cultivation level not particularly high on this ship—something Yang Kai did not much regard.

"Kid, you're pretty lucky," the middle-aged man said suddenly.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Yang Kai pretended not to understand.

"If you don't know, never mind—come out." The man beckoned to him.

Yang Kai frowned but did not refuse; he rose and walked out of the antechamber. The middle-aged man said nothing further and led him through the ship's cabins.

"Where are you taking me?" Yang Kai couldn't help asking.

"Wherever I take you. Why are you asking so much?" The man frowned in annoyance and snorted. "Normally, a stranger like you should be killed outright."

A hidden glint of chill flashed in Yang Kai's eyes.

"But Lady Bi Ya couldn't bear to kill you, so she instructed me to arrange a decent place for you. When she returns next time, she'll come for you," the man explained casually.

Yang Kai let out a light breath, recognizing that he was safe for the moment.

As long as that Bi Ya still fancied something from him, she wouldn't have him killed.

Trailing the middle-aged man, they walked for the time it takes a stick of incense to burn before they arrived at a vast sealed chamber.

The moment he entered, Yang Kai felt an overwhelming surge of dense energy; within that chamber the energy seemed condensed into substance.

This was the bottom of the great ship. Yang Kai scanned the place, his mind shaken.

He could not tell the chamber's exact purpose—lines of flickering array patterns covered every corner, converging into a monumental formation, with those array routes extending into every direction of the ship.

Rows upon rows of top-grade Crystal Stones were arranged in orderly fashion; each was the size of a washbasin and stored intensely condensed energy.

That energy was being transmitted outward along the array lines to who-knows-where.

Moreover, the chamber contained separate sealed slots, and in each slot a cultivator sat cross-legged; their strength levels varied.

Most were Transcendent Realm cultivators, with a few in the Saint Realm.

These cultivators had their hands and feet bound by shackles that extended from the chamber floor, confining them to a small area and preventing them from leaving.

The shackles emitted an extremely strange fluctuation, apparently with a restraining function.

Yang Kai's heart sank as he realized something was very wrong.

He found that those bound by the shackles were all emaciated and sallow-faced, their internal power silently leaking away; they all displayed the look of severe energy overdraw.

In serious cases, their qi drifted erratically and their realms seemed to be slipping.

"What is this place?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

"The warship's power chamber," the middle-aged man replied casually. "Your job is simple: sit there like the others. Nothing else."

Before Yang Kai could ask more, the man shouted to the side, "Ke Meng, I've brought a newcomer!"

A figure suddenly appeared before Yang Kai, eyeing him up and down with satisfaction. He grinned and said, "Cultivation's not bad—where did you find him?"

The middle-aged man shrugged. "Lady Bi Ya and the others brought him back when they went out."

"Lady Bi Ya?" the man called Ke Meng frowned, amusement crossing his face. "She'd spare someone to be sent to the power chamber?"

"Lady Bi Ya went out on a mission again and there's no one watching him for now, so she thought to put him in the power chamber. Keep an eye on him—don't let him die," the middle-aged man said.

Ke Meng laughed with a sinister tone, baring a set of wolfish, irregular fangs. "I can't promise that. Someone unlucky just bit it. You know how things are here—it's not up to me."

The middle-aged man frowned, seeming to understand Ke Meng's predicament, and nodded. "Do your best. If he really dies before Lady Bi Ya returns, it might anger her."

Ke Meng's face changed, showing deep apprehension. After a moment's hesitation he nodded, "Fine, I'll hand more Saint Crystals to him and try not to let him weaken too much."

"That's best!" the middle-aged man said approvingly, gave Yang Kai a long look, and then turned and left.
