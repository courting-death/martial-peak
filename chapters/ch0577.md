## Chapter 577 — Powerful Capital

“Is Miss Qiu feeling jealous?” Shan Qingluo smiled sweetly at Qiu Yimeng, her eyes full of mischief.

Qiu Yimeng pouted.

“If you don’t leave soon, I might just eat you up,” Shan Qingluo said, then glancing at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes grew misty, a scarlet tongue flicking teasingly at her lips, wearing an expression of insatiable desire.

“Spare me, I don’t want to die yet,” Yang Kai said immediately, now understanding the reason for her amorous mood. The secret to Shan Qingluo’s poisonous widow constitution was known only to him and the Enchantress Queen herself.

Seems that being a love-struck fool had a great influence on Shan Qingluo.

“I’m going into seclusion,” Yang Kai said as he prepared to leave.

“Aren’t you just out of seclusion?” Qiu Yimeng snorted lightly, suspecting he was making an excuse to leave, displeased inwardly.

“I had some new insights,” Yang Kai explained casually.

Back in his room, Yang Kai hurried to sit down. He sent his Divine Sense into his Sea of Consciousness, transforming into a Spirit Body, and gazed intently at the mass of clustered energy.

This mass of energy was chaotic and different from the pure energy left behind after the Ye Family expert’s death. It contained the thoughts and lifelong experiences of sixty or seventy masters.

If he absorbed that energy directly, Yang Kai feared his own memory and thinking would become muddled; he might even forget who he was.

That would be a grave matter—no one could live a joyful life not knowing their own identity.

He looked up at the tightly shut Golden Pupil Eye and concentrated his Divine Sense to establish a connection.

This energy was attracted and pulled into the Sea of Consciousness by the Golden Pupil Eye. Having experienced this once before, Yang Kai now knew what to do: the Golden Pupil Eye only needed to emit its golden light again to purify and cleanse this chaotic energy.

The only question was whether he could control this Golden Pupil Eye.

Gradually, his Divine Sense linked with the Golden Pupil Eye. In the depths, it seemed as though a great door had been opened, and beyond it, a dazzling golden light shimmered, making it difficult to see clearly.

At this moment, the tightly shut Golden Pupil Eye slowly opened.

Just like the first time he saw it, the majestic golden pupil inspired both fear and reverence.

A destructive beam of golden light shot forth from the eye, striking the chaotic clump of energy.

Sizzle...

It sounded like a hot iron plunged into water.

Black tendrils began to seep out from the chaotic energy, writhing desperately, but under the golden light’s illumination, they dissipated in an instant, vanishing without a trace.

Those black auras were undoubtedly the thoughts and life experiences of the masters; under the golden light’s burn, they were completely purified.

Soon, the golden light retracted, and the eye slowly closed again.

Inside the Sea of Consciousness, the formerly disordered energy had become remarkably pure.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, his heart filled with joy.

He finally understood how to wield the Golden Pupil Eye he had acquired from the seventh page of the Black Book.

The only regret was that when the seven souls perished in Fengshen Hall, he had failed to connect with the Golden Pupil Eye at the time. Had he then absorbed the Divine Sense energy those seven left behind, what a tremendous boon that would have been.

But knowing now was better than never.

Before the purified energy, Yang Kai began to absorb it greedily.

Soon, all that pure energy transformed into a powerful capital for Yang Kai.

His cultivation at the Divine Roaming Realm, Fourth Stage was further consolidated; it wouldn’t be long before he reached the Fifth Stage.

This result left Yang Kai somewhat unsatisfied; he had thought that obtaining such a massive amount of pure energy would at least push him up a stage.

But it seemed he had been wishing too much. After all, this energy came from the Sea of Consciousness of Divine Roaming Realm masters, and in quality, it could not compare to that left by the top Ye Family expert. Although the volume was large, it had not reached a threshold to induce a qualitative leap.

Yang Kai also vaguely sensed a bottleneck in his understanding of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Fortunately, when absorbing the Ye Family expert’s energy, he had also gained insight into the Martial Dao, which he assimilated—a key reason his foundation at this realm was stable despite his rapid progress.

Slowly opening his eyes, Yang Kai drifted into deep thought. Soon, an internal restlessness arose.

Half a day later, Yang Kai emerged from seclusion and quickly stepped outside his mansion.

Outside, the Lü Family entourage was still waiting. Led by Lü Si, they quietly continued their vigil.

“Elder, are we just going to wait here?” Lü Mu, a Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage expert of the Lü Family, asked.

“Yes, wait,” Lü Si replied seriously.

“Is that necessary?” Lü Mu was somewhat perplexed. Though he was a Lü Family elder himself, compared to Lü Si, the Grand Elder, he was far junior in both rank and status. While not entirely agreeing with Lü Si’s approach, he dared not speak out and respectfully said, “Though our Lü Family acted alongside the Guangming Mansion of the Huang Family and suffered heavy losses, it was their own fault. We cannot be blamed. But does that mean the Eight Great Families would suspect us over this?”

“That’s just the narrative between me and that young master of the Yang Family,” Lü Si smiled. “The people of the Eight Great Families are no fools. Once we clearly explain what really happened, how could they suspect us?”

“Then why...” Lü Mu grew even more confused.

Lü Si sighed softly: “Let me ask you, what would happen if we rushed to Zhongdu now?”

Lü Mu thought for a moment and answered, “We would be fighting the Cangyun Evil Land.”

“Exactly. Fighting the Cangyun Evil Land, and we’d inevitably be placed at the vanguard.” Lü Si turned to look around, “Our Lü Family’s elite consist of thirty-five Divine Roaming Realm experts. Facing such a battle, how many do you think would survive?”

Lü Mu was silent. Of those thirty-five Divine Roaming Realm experts, surviving with only three or five left would already be an incredible stroke of luck.

“But what if we acted together with that young master of the Yang Family, with him leading us to Zhongdu?” Lü Si countered.

The Lü Family members’ eyes lit up, recalling the magnificent nine-person formation they had just witnessed, deeply impressed and hopeful.

“This young master Yang is not the demon colluder the rumors say. From what I know, those who allied with him during the Succession War all reaped great rewards. If our Lü Family can hitch a ride on his favorable tide, regardless of whether we profit, at least we won’t be sacrificed as vanguard fodder. That alone justifies the effort our Lü Family has put into cultivating you all.”

“Elder, your wisdom is profound,” Lü Mu said, finally understanding Lü Si’s reason for waiting in front of Yang Kai’s mansion. It was a consideration based on this.

Indeed, if Yang Kai could lead them to Zhongdu, the outlook would not be so bleak.

Everyone had heard of the miracles he repeatedly worked during the Succession War.

“But will this young master Yang really go to Zhongdu?” someone else asked.

“Unlikely!” Lü Si shook his head gloomily.

The Eight Great Families have treated Yang Kai unjustly, probably breaking his spirit. Otherwise, having gathered so many experts under his command, why would he remain inactive? He himself said the fate of the Eight Great Families and Zhongdu was no concern of his.

If he still cared for Zhongdu or the Eight Great Families, he would not sit idly by.

“Let’s wait a few days. If nothing works, the Lü Family will have no choice but to rush to Zhongdu to support the defense!” Lü Si said with a helpless smile.

As they spoke, a figure suddenly stepped out from Yang Kai’s mansion. Lü Si sharpened his gaze and was deeply moved; a warm smile appeared on his face as he cupped his fists from afar: “Young Master Yang!”

Yang Kai had actually come out! This caught Lü Si by surprise.

The Lü Family members hurried to bow and greet respectfully, having already taken Yang Kai as their last hope after hearing Lü Si’s speech, not daring to show any disrespect.

Yang Kai glanced at them and after a moment’s thought said, “Elder Lü, I do owe the Lü Family some favor. You are a senior among seniors. It is improper for me to have you waiting outside like this.”

“Not at all!” Lü Si hurriedly waved his hand, signaling it was no trouble.

“Would you like to come in for a seat?” Yang Kai tilted his head invitingly.

Lü Si’s eyes brightened. Though not quite understanding why Yang Kai’s attitude had shifted so dramatically, he was overjoyed and nodded, “That would be wonderful. I shall impose.”

“Please!”

Lü Si had thought Yang Kai was inviting him inside to discuss rushing to Zhongdu to help, but once inside, Qiu Yimeng took charge of entertaining the Lü Family members, while Yang Kai himself disappeared without a trace.

Lü Si was thoroughly confused and unsure what game Yang Kai was playing. He asked Qiu Yimeng repeatedly but she had no knowledge, leaving him feeling uneasy.

In Meng Wuya’s room, Yang Kai shared his thoughts with Meng Wuya, Di Mo, and Ling Taixu.

“Young Master, you want to go to Zhongdu?” Di Mo was surprised, not understanding why Yang Kai suddenly had this idea. Over the past six months, everyone in the mansion had been working hard to increase their power, with pleasing results. But if they got involved in the battles around Zhongdu, who knew how many would die?

“Yes, I want to go to Zhongdu,” Yang Kai nodded decisively. Now that he understood how to wield the Golden Pupil Eye and the great benefits it could bring, naturally, he sought the right opportunity.

It was indeed safer to stay within War City, but power growth there was slow.

Zhongdu was different. Numerous Divine Roaming Realm experts perished there daily, and every time one died, Yang Kai could obtain the Divine Sense energy they left behind.

“You’re not usually this selfless,” Meng Wuya laughed. “So, tell us, what’s your real reason?”

“It’s not easy to explain. All I can say to you three is that I have my reasons,” Yang Kai grinned.

The three raised their brows and looked at him curiously.

“Senior Master is planning to go to Zhongdu himself after some time, isn’t he?” Yang Kai suddenly turned his gaze to Ling Taixu.

Ling Taixu was momentarily startled but did not deny it, nodding, “Indeed. My two disciples— the only ones I have ever accepted in my lifetime—are there. I must go and settle this matter.”
