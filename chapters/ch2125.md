## Chapter 2125 — Where Have I Seen You Before?

"From the information you brought back, it’s certain that those two Dao Origin Realm juniors indeed brought the Mortal Token. Anyone can forge a Mortal Token, but the power infused within it… isn’t something just anyone can add." Wen Zishan smiled and said, "But honestly, who would want to bother forging such a token?"

“How could those two have the Mortal Great Emperor’s Mortal Token!” Qiu Ran frowned.

Wen Zishan shrugged and said, “That lord’s way of doing things… haha, no one can ever guess his intentions. It’s not strange for those two to have the Mortal Token. Who knows, maybe one day a bunch of beggars or brothel girls will show up at my Qingyang Shrine with a Mortal Token!”

Everyone wore indifferent expressions.

“Don’t be so skeptical!” Wen Zishan said. “Back when this Lord first founded Qingyang Shrine, a group of brothel girls came with a Mortal Token asking me for money! At that time, none of you were around, only Little Xueting was by my side, so of course you wouldn’t know.”

“There was such a thing!” Everyone was shocked.

Qiu Ran looked speechless and muttered, “The Mortal Token actually ended up in the hands of those kinds of women. That lord really is…”

“Unpredictable!”

“Impossible to figure out!”

“The Mortal Great Emperor truly lives up to his name!”

At this moment, the young girl Chen Qian, who had been quietly floating in midair after using a soul secret technique on Deacon Tao, suddenly spoke in a calm voice, “Speaking of which, why do I feel that Hall Master’s style is a bit similar to that Emperor’s?”

With those words, everyone fell into thought, the more they considered it, the more it made sense.

“Hall Master is always acting mysterious, never serious!”

“And always wears such tasteless clothes!”

“Especially lacking in self-respect!”

"I’m standing right here. You dare gossip about This Lord right to my face—do you take me for… deaf?" Wen Zishan said, his face set in a stern line.

Qiu Ran glanced at him, cupped his fists, and said, “Hall Master, I heard that when you were young, you were once adopted by the Mortal Great Emperor for a time? Is that true?”

“Absolutely not!”

“I also heard the Mortal Great Emperor taught you personally…”

“Pure rumor!”

“Ah?” Many were shocked at these words. “There was such a thing? Hall Master actually has such a connection with the Mortal Great Emperor?”

“So that’s how it is!”

“I understand now.”

Wen Zishan looked at the crowd below, powerless, and said, “What do you understand? Are you trying to say that this Lord’s personality was influenced by that old fellow? Nonsense! I have no blood or family ties to that old fellow, how could I be influenced by him?”

"Then why does the Mortal Token keep appearing at our Qingyang Shrine?" Qiu Ran asked. Including this time, the Mortal Token has appeared at Qingyang Shrine twice.

No other force has ever received a Mortal Token!

“Hmm, this Lord is quite curious what those two want by bringing the Mortal Token to Qingyang Shrine. Let them in.” Wen Zishan suddenly said seriously.

Qiu Ran sighed deeply, feeling more and more that his own Hall Master was somewhat like the Mortal Great Emperor.

Still, he didn’t hesitate, and with a wave of his hand, opened the palace doors. At the same time, he sent a message outside.

Outside, Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang exchanged a glance, both straightening up and walking in side by side.

Once the two entered the grand hall, the doors closed again.

Within the hall, Emperor Realm experts sat in quiet restraint. Even without deliberately releasing their auras, the omnipresent pressure was far beyond what two First-Stage Dao Origin cultivators could bear. Yang Kai fared slightly better—each step felt heavy, yet he managed to keep his composure and avoided disgrace.

Qin Chaoyang, however, was trembling all over. As he walked, he left clear wet marks on the floor, his clothes soaked with sweat.

When they reached the front, both cupped their fists and saluted the crowd.

The others simply watched them quietly without speaking. Wen Zishan waved his hand, and an invisible force radiated out, making Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang feel much more at ease.

“Many thanks, Hall Master Wen!” Yang Kai cupped his fists toward the high platform and thanked him. Although no one introduced him, since he was seated at the head and wore the signature purple robe, he was undoubtedly the Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine.

“After this Hall Master’s verification, the token you brought is genuine!” Wen Zishan said solemnly, looking down and asking, “This Lord asks you, why have you come to Qingyang Shrine with this token?”

Yang Kai glanced at Qin Chaoyang beside him, only to find him shrinking back, seemingly afraid to speak.

Helpless, he could only say, “Reporting to Hall Master Wen, the two of us come from Fenglin City. That token was given to Brother Qin by a mysterious expert twelve years ago, with instructions to come to Qingyang Shrine after twelve years and request a spot to enter the Four Seasons Realm from Hall Master Wen!”

“Hmm? The Four Seasons Realm?” Wen Zishan was a bit surprised, and the others also looked puzzled.

They had thought the two came to Qingyang Shrine with the Mortal Token to make some special request, but it turned out they only wanted a spot to enter the Four Seasons Realm.

Wen Zishan’s Divine Sense swept over Qin Chaoyang and said calmly, “This old man doesn’t look particularly talented. Why would that lord want him to enter the Four Seasons Realm? Although the Four Seasons Realm isn’t an extraordinary secret realm, entry spots are limited and usually reserved for elite disciples of major sects and families to seek fortune and opportunity. Is there any special reason he must enter?”

Qin Chaoyang took a deep breath and replied solemnly, “Reporting, it’s for my clan’s granddaughter! She suffers from a stubborn illness and was born frail. Only a certain spirit fruit from the Four Seasons Realm can cure her. That lord saw this twelve years ago and gave me the token, instructing me to come to Qingyang Shrine after twelve years!”

“So that’s it!” Wen Zishan nodded, not probing further, and said, “Since that lord said so, this Hall Master can’t refuse. It’s just a matter of one spot…”

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang couldn’t help but show great joy.

He had expected this trip to be full of difficulties. He worried whether Qingyang Shrine would honor the token; even if they did, would they grant the spot...

All the way here, Qin Chaoyang had been worried.

But things went unexpectedly smoothly, and the spot seemed within reach. He was instantly overjoyed.

“However…” Wen Zishan changed the subject, “This matter has always been handled by one of our Shrine’s elders…”

At this, he turned to the side and said, “Little Xueting…”

Before he finished, Gao Xueting glared at him fiercely.

“Ahem… Elder Gao!” Wen Zishan quickly corrected himself.

“Present!” Gao Xueting stepped forward and replied solemnly.

“You heard what was just said. How about you handle this?” Wen Zishan said.

Gao Xueting looked troubled upon hearing this.

“Is there a problem?” Wen Zishan asked, noticing her expression.

Qin Chaoyang couldn’t help but grow nervous.

Gao Xueting glanced at Qin Chaoyang and said, “The Four Seasons Realm will open in a month, and the spots have already been decided and the disciples notified. If we take back a spot now, someone will surely be unhappy!”

“That’s true…” Wen Zishan showed a thoughtful expression and muttered, “Entering the Four Seasons Realm is something they’ve longed for. Suddenly revoking someone’s qualification is indeed unfair! But this is that Lord’s will… Hmm, this Lord is in a tough spot.”

Gao Xueting said, “Actually, I have a suggestion!”

“Oh? Let’s hear it!” Wen Zishan’s eyes lit up.

Gao Xueting said, “I just heard this old man say he wants to enter the Four Seasons Realm to obtain a spirit fruit to cure his granddaughter’s illness. May I ask, what kind of spirit fruit are you seeking? If it’s convenient, please tell us. Perhaps Qingyang Shrine already has it, and if so, you wouldn’t need to risk entering. To be honest, with your strength…” She paused, searching for the right words, but finally said, “You might not survive inside!”

Qin Chaoyang agreed and replied, “Reporting to Elder Gao, I only seek a single Calamity Fruit!”

“Calamity Fruit!” Qiu Ran frowned.

Gao Xueting also looked troubled.

Wen Zishan turned his gaze to the young girl named Chen Qian and asked, “Elder Chen, you’ve always managed our Shrine’s vault. Is there a Calamity Fruit in the Treasure Vault?”

Chen Qian said, “I’ll need to check!”

“How long?”

“A quarter of an hour!”

Wen Zishan nodded and closed his eyes, saying no more.

Chen Qian took out a Transmission Compass and sent her Divine Sense into it, clearly passing orders to the disciples below.

For a while, the grand hall was silent.

Only Qin Chaoyang waited anxiously, his heart pounding wildly, full of worry and hope.

Yang Kai stood idly by, but suddenly, as if sensing something, turned to look to the side.

Over there, Gao Xueting was staring at him. When she saw his gaze, she didn’t avoid it, but instead looked even more intently.

This made Yang Kai’s heart skip a beat… He felt something was wrong.

Most present were Emperor Realm experts, so the scene quickly drew attention. Everyone curiously looked at Yang Kai, wondering what about him made Gao Xueting so interested.

Wen Zishan narrowed his eyes with interest, watching everything unfold.

“Elder Gao, do you have some instructions?” Yang Kai felt uneasy being stared at, especially by an Emperor Realm expert, so he simply spoke up.

“Where have I seen you before?” Gao Xueting asked, “You seem familiar!”

“Hahahaha!”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Wen Zishan above burst out laughing.

Gao Xueting frowned and glared at him in annoyance.
