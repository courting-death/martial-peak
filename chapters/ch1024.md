## Chapter 1024 — Stellar Origin

The Ghost Ancestor's little schemes were plain to Yang Kai, and he never exposed them.

But within this spatial turbulence everything had been severed from the outside world; the Ghost Ancestor couldn't even perceive where he himself was, let alone spy on anything. So Yang Kai had no worry that the Ghost Ancestor could steal his methods.

Though his words had enlightened him and granted him a significant boost in strength — a fact Yang Kai was grateful for — he still remained wary when caution was due; Yang Kai had never fully trusted the Ghost Ancestor.

Old monsters like him frequently broke their word and turned on others. Yang Kai not only had to find a way to leave this place, he also had to ensure that once free the Ghost Ancestor would not strike him down!

It was difficult. Yang Kai was tangled in worry and could not think of a good solution; for now he could only take things step by step.

After lingering for a while in the spatial turbulence, Yang Kai departed.

The moment his figure appeared, the Ghost Ancestor’s voice sounded beside his ear: “Boy, have you gained anything?”

He sounded impatient, evidently anxious.

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. “It isn't that simple. Senior, don't be hasty. I was only confirming whether the spatial domain field here had stabilized.”

“And the result?” the Ghost Ancestor continued to ask.

“Hm, it has leveled out. It won't interfere with my judgment.”

“Good then!”

“Senior, how far did I move just now?”

“About a thousand li, I suppose.” The Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. “Your method has improved considerably since last time. Looks like your strength has indeed risen a lot.”

Yang Kai's eyes brightened involuntarily and his spirit lifted. Before, when he tore space he could only move a few hundred li at a time; now it was a thousand li in an instant — an enormous advancement.

“Don't try any tricks on me. We both know you can't escape my hand. Serve me faithfully and get me out of here, and I guarantee I won't harm you!”

“I understand.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly. “If Senior has nothing else, I will continue.”

“Go.”

Yang Kai tore space again, placing himself in that turbulence and seeking opportunities and direction within it.

With increased strength and experience he suddenly realized his understanding of spatial mysteries was still shallow. Though deeper than the Ghost Ancestor's in some respects, such comprehension alone was clearly insufficient to free him from this strange continent.

So, as he had years ago, he returned to the spatial turbulence to perceive its secrets, probing the mysteries from the turbulence's surges and eruptions.

He did not tell the Ghost Ancestor this, for the Ghost Ancestor was impatient; he longed for Yang Kai to bring him away at once.

Days passed and Yang Kai remained in the turbulence, fully immersing himself in its profundities.

Each day he had to return to the continent once to report progress to the Ghost Ancestor and soothe his restless mood.

Yang Kai improved markedly and gained greatly; his grasp of space became ever more natural.

One day he suddenly had an idea and slipped out of the turbulence.

He released his Divine Sense in place of his body, using it to break the barriers of space and achieve instant movement.

If he wanted to leave he had to break through the restraint of the seven-colored sky, which the Ghost Ancestor had said was formed by the intersection of myriad domain fields in the Chaos Abyss, covering at least several thousand to tens of thousands of li.

Even with his current method Yang Kai would have to link and execute several to a dozen precise space tears to penetrate that chaotic domain field.

He dared not probe with his physical body, for any mistake might lose him within that domain field.

But he could use his Divine Sense; if it were lost there would be no great harm.

At worst his Divine Consciousness would be damaged, but the Six-Color Warm Spirit Lotus would quickly heal it.

Like a tide his Divine Sense spread in all directions. Yang Kai condensed it into threads, invisible filaments that carried his insights into the mechanics of space, thrusting those threads of thought into the void.

Those threads contained the subtleties of space as they darted about; each strand left no discernible trace, leaping and skipping across the continent, disappearing at one spot and reappearing at another. They bypassed spatial restraints and manifested strange instantaneous movements.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense covered an ever-widening and farther-reaching area.

Inside the mountain, the Ghost Ancestor, who had been monitoring Yang Kai's movements, suddenly revealed astonishment in his eyes and muttered, “Good, it seems there's some progress.”

He couldn't help but grin. Yang Kai making progress meant a greater chance of escaping this prison, so unusually he did not disturb Yang Kai and let him experiment.

After a couple of hours Yang Kai showed signs of fatigue; his Divine Sense had probed too vast a stretch, a sign beyond his current realm.

At that moment Yang Kai's scattered threads of Divine Sense nearly covered half the continent — a level not reachable by a Second Stage of the Saint Realm warrior. Even people like Yue Xi and Lü Guichen likely could not achieve such an extent.

Because Yang Kai's Divine Sense jumped and was intermittent, breaking spatial constraints rather than proceeding in a continuous fashion like ordinary people.

That was why he could sense half the continent.

He drew his Divine Sense back to rest.

Yet at that instant one of the threads he had sent out detected an unusual disturbance.

Yang Kai's heart stirred; he recalled the other threads and concentrated his Divine Sense toward that point to continue probing.

Moments later his expression jolted — he made a startling discovery!

At the very center of the continent, buried ten thousand zhang beneath the ground, there was a surging, terrifying energy. That power was concealed to an extreme, as if it had always slumbered there; if Yang Kai's leaping Divine Sense had not happened to pass by while withdrawing, he would never have found it.

Moreover, he found that around this energy was a layer of barrier, an extraordinarily sturdy wall protecting and perfectly concealing that power from notice.

The thread that had inadvertently leaped inside lingered for a moment and was greatly nourished there; the nearly vanished filament grew robust once more.

Yang Kai was violently shaken, instantly realizing this mass of energy was extraordinary.

He feigned calm, leaving that thread in place to mark the location, sat cross-legged and began to recuperate.

He wanted to figure out exactly what that energy was.

Would the Ghost Ancestor, who had lived here for two thousand years, know of it?

He soon felt the Ghost Ancestor probably did not know of that energy's existence; if he had known, he would not have allowed it to go unattended — such a vast power would not escape the Ghost Ancestor's notice.

But why had he not discovered it? The Ghost Ancestor was already at the Void King Realm level. With but a thought he would be aware of the continent's situation.

“Senior.” Yang Kai called with his Divine Sense.

“What is it?” the Ghost Ancestor replied at once.

“I wish to ask, having lived on this continent so long, have you found anything unusual about it?”

“Unusual?” The Ghost Ancestor snorted angrily and roared, “What do you mean? Apart from rich Spiritual Qi and abundant resources, this place is nothing but a hateful prison! A prison that has trapped me for two thousand years; sooner or later I will leave!”

“Have you discovered something?” he suddenly grew alert.

“No. I only wanted to ask some questions to determine a direction for leaving!” Yang Kai answered casually.

“You had better be telling the truth. If I find you scheming, don't blame me for being harsh!” the Ghost Ancestor snorted.

After a moment of silence he added, “Are you trying to use your special Divine Sense to search this damned place for a Stellar Origin?”

“Stellar Origin? What is that?” Yang Kai was stupefied.

“You don't know?” the Ghost Ancestor was surprised too.

Yang Kai shook his head and smiled wryly. “I come from a low-ranked continent where people never studied the Starry Sky; we're not familiar with anything in a Star Domain.”

“Barbarian!” The Ghost Ancestor sneered. “The Stellar Origin is the essence of a star; every cultivation star possesses one. It's that star's quintessence. If a star is like a martial cultivator, the Stellar Origin is equivalent to the cultivator's dantian, equivalent to the Sea of Consciousness! If anyone imprints their soul mark on the Stellar Origin of a cultivation star, they become that star's master. They can thoroughly perceive all within that star and, if they wish, trigger calamities anywhere on it. With but a thought they could turn the high mountains into boundless seas or fill abyssal pits to level ground.”

Yang Kai was moved and exclaimed, “So that is tantamount to controlling a cultivation star?”

“Exactly! In a Star Domain each Star Lord controls the origin of their cultivation star. They can freely draw the star's energy to replenish themselves; on that star their power never empties — inexhaustible! Kid, do you now understand the Star Lord's might?”

“I understand.” Yang Kai's face went pale. “Then here…”

“Hmph. Calling you a barbarian was apt — this place is merely an eerie continent, not a star. Where would a Stellar Origin come from? I searched here over fifteen hundred years ago; if there had been one, you wouldn't be the one to snatch it up!”

Yang Kai forced a smile. “You're right, Senior. I was only asking casually; I had never even heard the term before.”

“Good. If that's all, focus on finding a way out and don't chase unrealistic notions that won't benefit you.” The Ghost Ancestor scolded and cut off contact.

Yang Kai resumed his recuperation and sank into thought.

As the Ghost Ancestor said, this place did indeed seem not to be a star but merely a strange continent.

Yet Yang Kai had seen star-forms like ancient trees in the Chaos Abyss, enormous treelike stars that stretched branches and leaves in the Abyss, radiating strong wood-attributed energy.

Judging by that, calling this continent a star wasn't far-fetched; its volume was large, far beyond the scale of a mere meteor.
