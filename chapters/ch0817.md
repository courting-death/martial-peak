## Chapter 817 — Kid, You’re Truly Pitiful

“You’re saying Xuan’er, she…” Yun Cheng frowned in thought. “What exactly did she have with this person?”

Ji Yan gave a dry laugh. “Mm. That was my assessment at the time. But because we all believed he was dead, we did not report this matter to the Alliance Master. I ask the Alliance Master to punish me.”

Yun Cheng slowly shook his head. “It’s fine. Xuan’er is a grown woman. Liking someone is only natural… No wonder that time when she returned to Duao City, she stayed sullen for quite a while. I thought she couldn’t let go of the past and had drifted from me, but so this was the reason. By your observation, how does that man treat Xuan’er?”

Ji Yan replied respectfully, “Not bad, I suppose. He didn’t show any special concern, but young people… hehe.”

“Oh?” Yun Cheng broke into a laugh. “In that case, if Nine Heavens Sacred Land doesn’t collapse this time, my Duao Alliance might just have an opportunity!”

“Alliance Master’s meaning?” Ji Yan, quick on the uptake, immediately caught on.

“We’ll watch and see. Perhaps they won’t weather this crisis; if they do, we’ll speak of it then… Mm. For now, all of us act carefully—make a show of it and that’s enough. Don’t truly get drawn into this tempest.”

“Alliance Master is wise!”

Elsewhere, someone was also looking Yang Kai over with great interest. After confirming that Yang Kai was indeed the young man seized by the Coffin-Bearer in Blazing Fire City, he couldn’t help but chuckle and hurried forward.

In short order, he arrived beside Cao Guan, Hall Master of War Soul Hall.

“Hall Master, I have something to report!”

Cao Guan, face dark, was staring coldly at Yang Kai. At the words, he said impatiently, “Later.”

“Hall Master, it concerns the new Saint Lord!” the man said in a deep voice.

Only then did Cao Guan turn to look at him and nod slightly. “Yao Di… What is it you want to say?”

The one called Yao Di quickly leaned in and whispered by Cao Guan’s ear.

Had Yang Kai noticed this man, he would certainly have recognized his face.

Back then, when he encountered the Coffin-Bearer in Blazing Fire City, this man had shown up.

Appearing with him were Xu Qi of the Leiguang Divine Cult and Zou Xing of the Xuantian Alliance. Yun Xuan had once specifically pointed these three out to Yang Kai.

In those days, the three had tailed the Coffin-Bearer all the way to Blazing Fire City.

Later, Yang Kai was seized by the Coffin-Bearer and taken into the Small Xuan Realm where the Ancient Demon Clan lived. When he came out, he went to Giant Stone City and, on the recommendation of the alchemy master Du Wan, entered the Leiguang Divine Cult. For that, Xu Qi even lost his life.

As Yao Di spoke, Cao Guan’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. He exclaimed, “Truly?”

Yao Di nodded heavily. “No mistake. I remember his face!”

“Now that is interesting.” Cao Guan let out a sinister chuckle. “Looks like we can kill two birds with one stone this time. Once we catch him, not only can we obtain Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s inheritance method, we might even unravel the mystery of the Coffin-Bearer…”

Excited, he lowered his voice. “Other than you, who else knows?”

Yao Di frowned in thought. “Ji Yan of the Duao Alliance likely recognized him as well. After all, he was there when it happened.”

“Duao Alliance… hmph, nothing to fear. Keep a close eye on them. If they dare leak the news, I’ll deal with them.” Cao Guan looked utterly disdainful.

Yao Di hurriedly nodded and turned his gaze toward the Duao Alliance’s side.

The strongest expert in the Duao Alliance was only their Alliance Master, Yun Cheng, at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm; they didn’t even have a single Saint Realm expert. A force like that naturally didn’t merit Cao Guan’s regard.

On this continent, only forces with a Saint Realm expert sitting in town could be considered strong.

Within the Nine Peaks’ barrier, Xu Hui said earnestly, “I trust you all now understand the matter of Saintess Nan—it was not at my Sacred Land’s instigation. If you withdraw now and do not make things difficult for my Sacred Land, the losses Saintess Nan caused you will be compensated by us. But if you insist on becoming enemies of my Sacred Land, then we can only settle this by force.”

“Compensation? Can you compensate for lives?” Seeing many grow hesitant at the appearance of the new Saint Lord, Zhang Ao immediately roared, “Xu Hui, have you truly grown senile? Since ancient times, a life is paid for with a life. Are you going to die to atone?”

“Zhang Ao, don’t push us too far!” Xu Hui’s expression turned ugly.

Zhang Ao grew even more arrogant, laughing loudly. “I’m the one bullying others? Clearly your Nine Heavens Sacred Land is throwing its weight around, treating human lives as nothing. We are here to demand justice!”

“I’ve already given you justice. Why do you still press so hard?”

“What justice? I don’t see it.”

“What I just said is justice! We will resolve the matter of Saintess Nan, and any forces harmed because of her will be compensated. And you, Zhang Ao, still insist on goading them into becoming enemies of my Sacred Land. Do you think I don’t know what you’re plotting?”

Called out in front of so many, Zhang Ao’s lids lowered, then he suddenly grew nonchalant and nodded. “Fine. I’ll trust what you say. But before you fulfill your promise, I think our friends who’ve come from afar deserve some collateral. Otherwise your empty words aren’t worth a thing. Even if I believe you, they won’t.”

“What collateral do you want?” Xu Hui frowned.

Zhang Ao’s gaze slid between Yang Kai and An Ling’er as he chuckled. “Please have your new Saint Lord and Saintess come stay in my Poxuan Palace for a spell. Before you resolve the previous Saintess’s problem, they’ll be in our care.”

At that, Cao Guan hastily chimed in, “Yes, Brother Zhang’s proposal is good. War Soul Hall supports it. Great Elder, rest easy. We will make proper arrangements for the Saint Lord and Saintess; not a single hair on their heads will be harmed.”

Standing off to the side, looking solitary, Wu Jie, unusually, made no comment and only let out a weird laugh.

“Wishful thinking!” Xu Hui flew into a rage. The Saint Lord might be young, but he was the symbol of the Sacred Land. If he fell into another force’s hands as a hostage and the news spread, Nine Heavens Sacred Land would become a laughingstock. Besides, Xu Hui knew perfectly well what Zhang Ao was scheming and would never agree to such an absurd demand.

“Then there’s nothing more to discuss.” Ferocity twisted Zhang Ao’s face as he shouted, “We’ll level your Nine Heavens Sacred Land and avenge our dead!”

At his bellow, many people’s emotions ran high.

“Indeed, enough talk!” Yang Kai drew in a breath and said in a ringing voice, “At this point, those who are willing to reconcile with the Sacred Land will reconcile. Those who are not—all of them are enemies!”

As he spoke, his gaze swept the crowd.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai’s expression turned startled. His eyes fixed on a point in the crowd where two women were watching him. One ground her teeth, muttering under her breath; the other stared blankly, her beautiful eyes trembling.

Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu!

Yang Kai recognized them at once.

After years apart, they were still much the same—only Yun Xuan looked even more like a mature woman now, a rich, ripe allure flowing from her every movement, and Ruan Xinyu had hardly changed at all.

The only change was in their relationship. They used to be at odds, yet now they seemed as close as sisters.

When their eyes met, Yun Xuan’s heart trembled. In that instant she realized he was the man she had pined for day and night. His expression and gaze grew a touch chaotic for a heartbeat—though he covered it well, it didn’t escape her notice.

“How about it? Didn’t I say it was him?” Ruan Xinyu said angrily. “That heartless, unfeeling bastard—alive and well, just look at him.”

Yun Xuan’s mind was a jumble, at a loss for what to do. If not for the occasion, she would have rushed over already to demand why, if he was alive, he hadn’t contacted her—to at least let her know he was safe.

But at a time like this, she didn’t dare reveal her feelings.

Seeing Ruan Xinyu about to call out, Yun Xuan hurriedly pulled her back. “It’s not him, even if he looks a lot like him…”

With that, she turned to leave.

This was absolutely not the right moment to acknowledge him; it would benefit neither of them. Yun Xuan decided on the spot to act as though she hadn’t seen him.

“Hey…” Ruan Xinyu hesitated for a moment, then hurried after her, fuming. “How is it not him? It’s obviously him! I’d recognize that brat even if he were ashes!”

“I said it’s not, so it’s not,” Yun Xuan said impatiently.

“Fine, fine, not him then. I’m just a busybody sticking my nose in,” Ruan Xinyu said, thoroughly displeased.

Watching the two women walk away, Yang Kai quickly gathered his wandering thoughts. He didn’t know why the Duao Alliance had been dragged into this, but it was likely because of Saintess Nan.

“Kid, you’re truly pitiful!” Zhang Ao looked Yang Kai over with a cold eye. “You might be the Saint Lord with the shortest tenure in the history of Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Though your Saint Lords have never had long lives, you’re definitely about to set a record.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai sneered lightly. “I’d like to see how you plan to take my life.”

He looked utterly unafraid—calm and unruffled—which many found hard to accept.

All at once, scorching True Yuan erupted from Yang Kai’s body, burst out through the barrier, and in midair took the shape of a golden greatsword over a dozen zhang long.

This was one of the Nine Heavens Divine Techniques—the Profound Heaven Sword.

At the same time, within one of the Nine Peaks, a wondrous, surging energy suddenly welled up, like a primordial savage beast startled awake, its aura terrifying.

Under the effect of the Nine Peaks grand array, that power instantly blessed the Profound Heaven Sword.

In an instant, the Profound Heaven Sword of a dozen‑odd zhang swelled, in a flash becoming several dozen zhang long, like a long rainbow cleaving the sky as it hacked down toward Zhang Ao with shocking might.

Chi, chi, chi…

Space seemed torn as sharp detonations rang out one after another, hair‑raising to hear. The descending Profound Heaven Sword pressed down like a great mountain, leaving many people with no thought of resistance. Their faces changed drastically.
