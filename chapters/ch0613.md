## Chapter 613 — Wasteland

Not an inch of grass grew; there was no breath of life. It seemed endlessly desolate, the gale whipping up sand and grit, so that nothing could be seen within ten zhang.

This was the Wasteland!

Stepping into it, Yang Kai could not help but become alert. According to Zi Mo, the energies within the Wasteland were strange and could, at any moment, suddenly erupt into disaster; if one were a little careless here, the end would be being smashed to pieces.

Moreover, due to the hostile environment, if one’s sense of direction were insufficient, one could very easily become lost within it.

Every year, a great number of martial artists who attempted to seek opportunity here went missing, neither seen alive nor found dead.

Zi Mo did not know how the Wasteland had formed; she only knew that more than two hundred years ago this place had suddenly become like this.

The region where the Wasteland now lay had not originally been so barren and desolate. Though it had never been very prosperous, at the very least there had been flowers, birds, and traces of human activity.

But an anomaly more than two hundred years ago caused the appearance of the Wasteland, at the mention of which the whole of Tianlang would turn pale.

Zi Mo did not know the origin of the Wasteland, but Yang Kai did.

This forbidden area of Tianlang had, astonishingly, been created because of Meng Wuya.

In the final moment before Shopkeeper Meng passed through the Void Passage to the Tongxuan Continent, he transmitted a bit of information to Yang Kai.

He told him the route and the method to reach the Tongxuan Continent; it was precisely Meng Wuya’s guidance that had led Yang Kai to this place.

If not for Meng Wuya, Yang Kai would never have known that within this Wasteland there was a concealed Void Passage; find it, and one could travel to another world.

When Meng Wuya came over from the Tongxuan Continent back then, he had arrived exactly at the place where the Wasteland now lay. To protect that Void Passage he employed means to create such a forbidden area.

As time flowed on, that forbidden area grew ever more dangerous, exceeding Meng Wuya’s ability to control it and gradually developing into its present scale.

Meng Wuya passed through the Void Passage to this world two hundred years ago… How old is Shopkeeper Meng, really? Yang Kai pondered the information he had been given, his expression strange.

Shopkeeper Meng is truly mysterious. Yang Kai had thought he knew him well enough, but now realized his understanding was only superficial. Yang Kai even suspected that Transcendent Realm, Third Stage was not Meng Wuya’s true cultivation.

That old fellow! Yang Kai kept shaking his head.

Shui Ling followed Yang Kai step by step. Although she had reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, here she still felt rather unsafe and would not stray far from Yang Kai for fear of being separated from him.

They had not gone far when Yang Kai suddenly halted, pricked up his ears and listened; his face changed, and he seized Shui Ling and charged forward.

They had only rushed out several dozen zhang when a howl of fierce wind sounded behind them.

Shui Ling turned, her face blanching. From behind, vague tornadoes stretched up to the sky; the wind blades they raised sliced the earth apart, leaving ravines everywhere, and from those wind blades came energy ripples that made the heart quake with dread.

"Stay close," Yang Kai warned in a low voice. "The energies here are very chaotic; a single mistake could kill you."

Shui Ling’s face was ashen; she nodded heavily, then asked in puzzlement, "This place is so dangerous and has no heaven-and-earth treasures—so why did that girl surnamed Zi say many of Tianlang’s strong ones still come here to seek opportunity?"

"Because these chaotic energies are actually manifestations of one martial skill after another," Yang Kai explained casually.

"Manifestations of martial skills?" Shui Ling exclaimed in astonishment.

"Yes. Many years ago someone, to protect a secret, released a vast number of high-grade martial skills across this area, and he used a special method to preserve their destructive force for a long time. Although over time those martial skills have dissipated and the energies become chaotic, within those energies still lie the intent and mysteries produced by a top master. If one can discern the intent and the mysteries hidden in those energies, one might learn a martial skill. Tell me—wouldn’t those powerful figures be tempted?"

"Who could be so formidable?" Shui Ling was deeply moved. "To preserve a martial skill’s destructive power for years on end seems hardly possible, does it?"

"Why not impossible? That person you've met before," Yang Kai said with a smile.

"Who?" Shui Ling asked, even more puzzled.

Yang Kai did not answer. Shui Ling pressed him several times, then curled her lips: "So it was a lie. You’ve always been in Great Han—how could you possibly know the secrets here? Even that Zi girl didn’t know these things."

Apart from that explanation, Shui Ling could not think of what benefit would draw Tianlang’s powerful figures to risk their lives here seeking opportunity.

As Yang Kai continued forward, roughly once every couple of hours they encountered a violent onslaught of energy; the attributes varied, and the chaotic energies struck in a thousand strange ways, making them hard to guard against.

Fortunately, Yang Kai’s vigilance was exceptional; he was always able to detect anomalies at the most critical moments and lead Shui Ling away from danger.

After two or three days’ travel inward, Shui Ling had been beaten to a sorry state, dirty as a little beggar; her pale-blue hair no longer flowed gracefully but hung sloppily over her shoulders.

And the deeper they went, the more frequent the dangers and the more massive the chaotic energies became. Shui Ling was utterly helpless; though she did not know exactly what Yang Kai aimed for, she followed him docilely, neither anxious nor impatient.

She knew Yang Kai would surely lead her on the path home.

Meanwhile, in another direction of the Wasteland.

A dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm masters were chasing a glowing orb; lightning crackled within it, wreaking havoc in the Wasteland in an irregular fashion, its power astonishing.

These Divine Roaming Realm experts shouted and clamored, and under the instruction of their leader they spread left and right in a pincer formation, intent on intercepting the orb to probe its secrets.

After much effort, just as success seemed within reach, a figure suddenly struck from the distance; he bore a violent, dangerous aura and landed before the group.

The earth trembled sharply.

"Who are you?" the leader roared.

"Xing Zong!" the newcomer announced his name, his voice low, as if repressing the anger in his heart; anyone could hear he was displeased.

"Xing Zong?" The leader’s face changed; he hurried forward and, upon seeing the newcomer’s face clearly, immediately adopted a respectful air and cupped his fists. "It truly is Palace Lord Xing of Senluo Palace."

Senluo Palace is Tianlang’s sole super power; the Palace Lord of Senluo Palace holds an unrivaled position in Tianlang.

Although these people were figures of some standing within Tianlang’s forces, in the face of Xing Zong they involuntarily lowered themselves and came forward to pay their respects.

Xing Zong nodded faintly.

The lead man kept a smile on his face, asked suspiciously, "Palace Lord Xing, are you here in the Wasteland seeking opportunity as well?"

Xing Zong snorted coldly, "I do not have that leisure."

"Then what brings Palace Lord Xing here?" the man asked in puzzlement.

The Wasteland is no good place; if not for opportunity, why would one come here?

"My son was slain by two Great Han warriors. Since you are here, have you seen those two?" Xing Zong demanded in a harsh voice.

The man’s face changed abruptly. "The young Palace Lord was killed—and by Great Han warriors?"

The other powerful ones likewise suddenly grew indignant.

Senluo Palace’s reputation in Tianlang may not be spectacular, but the Palace Lord’s son being killed by two Great Han warriors elevated the matter to an entirely different level.

Martial artists everywhere, when faced with enemies from another place, inevitably feel a sense of common indignation.

"We have not seen their tracks, but anyone daring enough to enter here must possess some skill," the man muttered.

Who without ability would dare enter the Wasteland to seek death?

"Palace Lord Xing, shall we be of assistance?"

Xing Zong considered the words for a moment and nodded, "Very well. I can track their traces. Come with me; if those two try to flee, help me block them."

"It is our honor to serve Palace Lord Xing," the man shouted, paying no heed to the lightning orb; he hastily called others and swept forward alongside Xing Zong.

Doing Palace Lord Xing a favor now, lending him a small hand, would surely be beneficial later on.

They had not flown far when they met another group of Tianlang cultivators, only four or five in number; upon hearing Xing Zong’s words they too agreed to contribute.

As they converged, the force comprised one Transcendent Realm cultivator and over twenty Divine Roaming Realm masters, their momentum fierce as they rapidly closed on Yang Kai and Shui Ling.

With tracking insects leading the way, Xing Zong had no fear he would fail to find Yang Kai.

The twin male-female trait meant that the male insect could, regardless of how harsh the environment, precisely seek out the female.

Yang Kai and Shui Ling continued deeper into the Wasteland at a steady pace; apparently unaware of the pursuers behind them or the dangers that were about to arrive.

After who knew how long, when a gulf of profound darkness suddenly appeared ahead, Yang Kai drew a soft breath and a trace of joy crossed his face.

Shopkeeper Meng’s final transmission had been too hurried; although it contained some guidance, Yang Kai had still feared getting lost in the Wasteland. Now, seeing the depth of this darkness, he could finally relax.

We’re there!

Inside it lay a Void Passage; pass through the Void Passage and one would arrive at the Tongxuan Continent.

"Yang Kai, I have a bad feeling." Shui Ling’s delicate body trembled as she fixed her gaze ahead. For some reason a deathly aura washed over them, as if were she to set foot there she would die without burial.

"Not good," Yang Kai nodded lightly, but with other meaning; he suddenly turned and narrowed his eyes to look behind him.

There, figures flickered indistinctly and could not be seen clearly. The two sides were separated by only about a hundred zhang, yet those people had halted, as if somewhat afraid to approach.

Shui Ling cried out in surprise—she had not expected to meet anyone at such a critical moment, and judging from their auras their intent was hostile.
