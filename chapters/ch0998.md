## Chapter 998 — Plaything?

After a brief examination, Yang Kai was surprised to find that he hadn't suffered any very serious injuries.

His bones, having fused with the Great Demon God's Indomitable Golden Body, were extraordinarily solid and had not taken the slightest damage in the recent calamity; only his internal organs had shifted slightly, and his body bore the usual bruises and wounds from blunt impact.

These were minor injuries. With Yang Kai's current recovery ability, he wouldn't even need to take any Spirit-Grade Pills—he could heal within half a day.

The only trouble was the restriction Lü Guichen had placed on him; the True Yuan in his meridians was locked as if in shackles, unable to flow or be used. His Divine Sense remained unaffected—no doubt Lü Guichen considered Yang Kai too weak to merit more careful treatment.

That gave Yang Kai a sliver of hope.

As long as he could use his Divine Sense, he could look for an opportunity to escape.

He wasn't afraid of Bi Ya; what he feared was a Saint King Realm powerhouse like Lü Guichen.

When he had surveyed the sky earlier, Yang Kai knew this continent wasn't very large. If he couldn't slip away without leaving a trace, once they searched there would be nowhere for him to hide.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai already had a plan in mind.

He sank his spirit into his Sea of Consciousness.

The instant he entered his Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai's Spirit Body registered astonishment.

He discovered that a number of spirit-energy clusters had somehow appeared within his Sea of Consciousness—by rough count there were at least forty or fifty, each containing varying strengths of soul-energy.

Yang Kai stood frozen.

Then he suddenly realized these spirit clusters must have been left behind by the cultivators who had died around him during the disaster.

The World-Ending Demon Eye not only purified other people's souls but could also draw in the soul-energy left behind after death; those clusters were surely drawn into his Sea of Consciousness by the World-Ending Demon Eye while he was unconscious.

This truly was an unexpected gain.

Time was short, so Yang Kai didn't carefully investigate the soul clusters floating above his Sea of Consciousness, only performing a cursory inspection.

Most of them belonged to Saint Realm cultivators, and among them Yang Kai even found a cluster that belonged to a Saint King Realm powerhouse.

He involuntarily changed color.

If even a Saint King Realm master couldn't survive that catastrophe, it showed how tremendous the destructive force was when two warships collided and were then swallowed by a black hole.

Those who were still alive now should count themselves lucky—fortunate not to have been as utterly doomed as that Saint King Realm master.

To avoid arousing Bi Ya's suspicion, after checking these things Yang Kai withdrew his spirit from the Sea of Consciousness. Those spirit clusters would have to wait for another opportunity to be absorbed.

The Heavenly Dao martial-path insights of a Saint King Realm cultivator—Yang Kai was very eager to see what kind of improvement they might bring.

When he opened his eyes again, things were as he had suspected: fighting had broken out in all directions.

Purple Star cultivators and Sword Alliance cultivators were tangled together in groups of three to five, still reeling from the disaster and venting their fury on one another with no intention of stopping.

Lü Guichen was even being engaged by a poised, mature beauty whose bearing was elegant and sumptuous, yet whose power was startlingly high—no less than Lü Guichen. She held a square sword case from which dazzling beams of rainbow light shot forth toward Lü Guichen. The light shifted unpredictably in length, clearly forming many high-grade sword treasures.

Facing this beauty Lü Guichen dared not slacken his caution. Golden armor shone about him and he gripped a short spear that radiated intense energy fluctuations like a mighty general; golden light filled the sky and trembled against those long swords.

The two fought fiercely in midair, striking back and forth in a spectacular duel. All the Purple Star and Sword Alliance cultivators kept well clear of their battlefield to avoid being caught up in it.

Yang Kai's gaze swept over the battlefield, trying to find an opening. He looked around and asked Bi Ya, "Now that it's come to blows, aren't you going to help?"

Bi Ya turned her head, glanced at him, and laughed coquettishly, "Are you trying to find an opportunity to run away?"

"My powers are sealed—where could I possibly run? Don't worry, you just go fight. I'll stay here and wait obediently. A woman like you... I do want to taste what that's like."

Bi Ya's face suddenly flushed with a new glow, becoming even more alluring. Her red lips trembled; her bosom swelled like a heaving mountain, sending out waves that made one dizzy with desire and left no doubt as to its remarkable springiness.

Her smile vanished in an instant, and she looked coldly at Yang Kai. "Don't waste your schemes; I won't give you the chance. I'd rather watch the fight here than let you have any possibility of escape."

"Why bother?" Yang Kai shook his head slowly, feeling helpless.

Bi Ya decided she would not relax her surveillance of him, and he had no way around it.

At that moment, two graceful white figures suddenly sped past from ahead, as if pursuing a Purple Star cultivator. As they swept by Yang Kai and Bi Ya, a light sound of surprise escaped them.

The two then halted in unison, staring at Yang Kai with astonishment.

The slightly older woman revealed a look of delight: "How is it you?"

"You two?" Yang Kai raised his brows.

The two women were none other than the first living beings he had met upon entering the Star Domain—the Sword Alliance's He Sisters.

Seeing them, Yang Kai's lips twitched into a small smile; he suddenly realized the situation wasn't as hopeless as he'd imagined.

"You two are here... so the Sword Alliance found you?" Yang Kai asked as if casually.

"Yes." He Miao nodded heavily and said cheerfully, "Not long after we parted from you, Master came with people to find us. But the Purple Star cultivators were hateful and kept chasing us, and we all ended up in this mess. They still want to fight, so we'll fight them to the end."

"Why are you here?" The older sister, more mature and perceptive, quickly noticed something was off.

Yang Kai stood with a Purple Star cultivator; though he didn't show signs of abuse, his powers were clearly restrained.

He was under someone else's control.

The Purple Star woman nearby, meanwhile, had energy stirring within her in secret, ready to act at any moment.

"It's a long story..." Yang Kai coughed dryly.

"You can't be this wicked woman's... plaything, can you?" He Miao covered her small mouth and cried out, a look of incredulous disgust coloring her pretty face.

Yang Kai was stunned—he hadn't expected He Miao to recognize Bi Ya, and now he understood what Shen Tu had said: Bi Ya's notorious reputation was not an exaggeration.

"Young lady, you have no upbringing!" A flash of coldness crossed Bi Ya's beautiful eyes; He Miao's calling her a 'wicked woman' clearly angered her. "Didn't your parents teach you any manners?"

"Bah—who in the Star Domain doesn't know about your affairs? You have the nerve to talk about manners?" He Miao snorted, brandished a long sword that shimmered with strange light, traced a sword-flower in the air, and cried, "Sister, enough words—let's go!"

He Zao said nothing and nodded slightly at Yang Kai, giving him a look. The two sisters cloaked their figures in sword light and surged toward them like a tide.

Before they arrived, the chilling sword intent swept over like a winter gale, cracking the ground and leaving sword scars everywhere.

Bi Ya shrieked and cracked her Dragon Bone Whip, summoning the phantom of a azure dragon with a blood-red maw to charge the sisters, while the Wind Blades cut like harvesting scythes at He Zao and He Miao's tender necks.

The three figures were entangled in combat in an instant.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Yang Kai hurriedly slipped away.

Bi Ya was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, and He Zao too was at that stage. He Miao, slightly weaker, had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm. With the sisters collaborating, Bi Ya would be hard-pressed.

So he had no real concern for He Zao and He Miao's safety. Right now Yang Kai's foremost consideration was his own escape.

He moved swiftly. Though his Saint Yuan could not be used, his powerful flesh-and-blood carried him; in a few breaths he leapt out of the chaotic battlefield, found a concealed spot, sat cross-legged, and, while watching the surroundings, attempted to manipulate his Saint Yuan to break Lü Guichen's restriction.

The conflict between Purple Star and Sword Alliance continued unabated; the two sides bore deep hatred and neither would yield.

More and more cultivators were struck down, their corpses left where they fell.

Yang Kai watched coldly from the sidelines and, luckily, no one bothered him.

Suddenly his gaze fixed in one direction and a peculiar expression flickered over his face.

There, an old man in a cyan robe with graying hair was searching for something.

He paid no heed to what was happening around him; instead he rummaged through the spots where warship fragments fell. From time to time he would pick up a piece, tap it with his hand, nod in satisfaction, and with a flash of brilliance the ring on his finger would take it into his spatial ring.

Before long he had collected dozens of warship fragments of various sizes, all of excellent quality.

Materials that survived that catastrophe had to have been forged from at least Upper-Level Saint King-class ore.

As he gathered the fragments he muttered to himself and laughed now and then, clearly very pleased.

Such a strange man moving through the chaotic battlefield naturally drew attention.

Yang Kai was surprised to find that both Purple Star and Sword Alliance cultivators wanted to pick fights with him.

Yet anyone who drew within ten zhang of him would be shoved back by an invisible force; those who attempted to harass him quickly realized the old man was not to be trifled with and retreated, no longer daring to approach.

Thus he went about his business collecting warship fragments in peace.

The old man's odd behavior finally attracted the attention of a true expert.

The battling Lü Guichen and the Sword Alliance beauty in the sky both drew back and put some distance between them, their gazes fixed downward as their Divine Sense closely monitored the old man below.
