## Chapter 1665 — Underground Battlefield

In front of the Fire Radiance Sect's main headquarters, the elite forces of Ice Heart Valley, led by Luo Li, cut through defenses like a blade through bamboo, breaching countless layers of protective seals and striking straight for the heart of the place.

Five Warships arranged themselves in a line across the sky, the black mouths of their Crystal Cannons faintly thrumming with energy, aimed downward and sending only messages of death and destruction.

On the flagship, Luo Li wore an indifferent expression as she peered down; the Ice Heart Valley high-rankers stood by her side, each a figure of heroic bearing.

A hundred zhang below, there was a plaza where numerous high-rankers of the Fire Radiance Sect had gathered, led by Wei Qing, who looked up with a grim face.

Between the two forces, another layer of fiery-red light membrane separated them.

This was the Fire Radiance Sect's final defensive barrier; should it be breached, the sect would be left undefended and at the mercy of Ice Heart Valley's powerful warriors.

After a long stare, Wei Qing finally shouted, “Senior Luo Li, does Ice Heart Valley intend to fight to the death with my Fire Radiance Sect?”

“Yes!” Luo Li replied.

Wei Qing laughed loudly. “It is our honor to have Senior Luo Li personally take action, but… do you think our Fire Radiance Sect is a soft pear to be squeezed and tossed aside at will? I advise you, if you do not wish for us all to perish together, withdraw quickly, or you will regret it!”

“Are you threatening me?” Luo Li's cold gaze stabbed at Wei Qing like a blade, forcing even someone as resolute as him to step back several paces.

Shocked in his heart, Wei Qing cupped his fist and said, “I dare not. As the Sect Master of the Fire Radiance Sect, I must consider the tens of thousands of disciples under my charge. Senior, your cultivation is profound; my Fire Radiance Sect indeed lacks anyone who can oppose you, but to annihilate my entire sect is not so easy.”

“I know what you rely on!” Luo Li suddenly smiled slightly. “To be honest, I too have a headache over that thing; I would not wish to confront it unless absolutely necessary.”

“Good that you understand!” Wei Qing's expression cleared somewhat, thinking Luo Li was beginning to hesitate.

Unexpectedly, Luo Li smiled again. “This time I only intend to clear you out; others will deal with that thing. So… surrender now. I do not wish to bully the weak and force you to cripple your cultivation. I can spare your lives if you submit!”

Wei Qing's face turned furious, and as he prepared to speak, his Sea of Consciousness suddenly churned; an astonishing, terrifying will came from a direction, sending a chill through his hands and feet!

“A mere acquired Artifact Spirit dares to challenge my majesty? Ignorant ant, tremble beneath my might!”

As that will spread, the volcano at the back mountain erupted into a clash of wills that made people's faces change.

Everyone felt it clearly in that moment.

The Fire Radiance Sect high-rankers’ expressions altered greatly as they all turned to look.

“Who dares provoke Qiantian Thunderflame!” an elder of the Fire Radiance Sect cried out.

“Is it starting?” Luo Li's beautiful eyes narrowed.

She had underestimated Yang Kai's speed; she thought it would be much longer before he could move the Qiantian Thunderflame, yet before she and her forces had even reached their doorstep, Yang Kai had already made his move.

“I give you ten breaths: cripple yourselves and I will spare your lives, or I will shatter this last protection and you will die!” In that instant, Luo Li's previously cool, detached manner turned aggressive and imposing.

The hatred between the two powers ran too deep; finally there was a point of no retreat between them.

Wei Qing's face shifted as he felt the rolling will of the Qiantian Thunderflame coming from the forbidden area; he knew his last reliance could not be counted on, but he would never willingly cripple his own cultivation.

A cultivator’s life is one of struggle — against the heavens, against fate itself. Every breakthrough is like thousands of troops crossing a single-plank bridge, with countless falling short before reaching the next realm. Wei Qing had spent three hundred years raising his cultivation to the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, becoming an expert with the hope of breaking through to the Void King Realm.

How could he willingly cripple his cultivation?

Rather than cling to life in misery, it was better to stake his life in one final gamble — to fight for that single thread of survival.

“Fight them to the death!” Wei Qing roared in a low voice.

The Fire Radiance Sect high-rankers shared his sentiment; they knew that with the two clans' enmity, pleading would lead nowhere. At Wei Qing's cry, many of them unleashed Saint Yuan, arrayed their Secret Treasures, and struck toward the five Warships.

“Courting death!” Luo Li's face chilled as she reached out and lightly pointed ahead.

Her gesture seemed utterly devoid of mortal flame; a crystalline, six-petaled snowflake drifted from her fingertip and spread open in the wind.

In the blink of an eye, that six-petaled snowflake swelled to the size of a celestial canopy, covering the plaza.

A bone-chilling cold descended from the heavens!

“Ice seals a thousand li!” cried Bing Long and Ran Yunting together.

Saint Yuan surged from every body, converging and pushing forward.

Wherever the Saint Yuan passed, the ground began to freeze.

Snow fell from the sky.

Each snowflake carried terrifying energy fluctuations as it drifted down onto the fiery-red shield, appearing to corrode it and pierce one small hole after another.

The profound intent of the ice seeped through those gaps toward the center of the plaza.

Lesser Fire Radiance Sect disciples were frozen into statues in the blink of an eye.

Wei Qing was overwhelmed with grief and rage, certain that his sect faced annihilation.

With Luo Li there, these people were no match. The Qiantian Thunderflame that had once restrained Luo Li could not be relied upon now; it was apparently entangled by someone else.

Moreover, observing Luo Li's expression and aura, there was no sign of injury.

She was clearly at the peak of her power!

Was the Fire Radiance Sect truly finished? Wei Qing's vision went black as if clouds had obscured all light.

…

Beneath the volcano, Yang Kai stood upon a protruding red rock that emitted intense heat; he had to use Saint Yuan to shield his body to avoid being burned.

Before him the magma roiled and howled; two different life presences were battling desperately beneath the lava, the low roars of the Qiantian Thunderflame and the cries of the Fire Bird ringing out.

They seemed evenly matched.

Yet as the master of the Artifact Spirit, Yang Kai could keenly sense that the Fire Bird was flagging.

Its evolutionary level could not compare with the Qiantian Thunderflame; its birth conditions were far less blessed.

The Artifact Spirit had been born within the Earth Lung Fire Vein after tens of thousands of years of burning, emerging from a Void King-Grade artifact furnace — a being of acquired creation.

But that mass of Qiantian Thunderflame had existed since the dawn of creation itself, growing stronger and stronger over the passage of time — one of the rarest and purest forms of energy in all Heaven and Earth.

Born inferior in both origin and strength, even with aid from a forging furnace, the Fire Bird was gradually being overwhelmed.

It was time to lend it a hand.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the rock, summoned the Stone Puppet to guard his body, closed his eyes, and used his Divine Sense to commune with his mind.

A phantom image suddenly burst from Yang Kai's mind, identical in appearance to Yang Kai himself.

But this shadow was not physical.

His soul had left his body!

It was a Spirit Body!

The spirit body wavered and dove into the magma, plunging downward.

Soul departure is an exceedingly dangerous act: once done, the body is left defenseless.

That was why Yang Kai had summoned the Stone Puppet.

Furthermore, souls are fragile and sensitive; without bodily protection they can be easily damaged.

Especially here at a blazing volcanic mouth—an ordinary soul could not even approach; too close and the heat would burn it to ash.

But Yang Kai was different.

His Divine Sense possessed a mutated Divine Sense Fire that shared a source with the magma's fire.

The scorching that made eve Void King Realm experts hesitate did not hinder him in the slightest.

Before long, Yang Kai's Spirit Body had descended to ten thousand zhang beneath the surface.

The surrounding environment grew ever more torrid――truly terrifying.

Deep beneath those ten thousand zhang, there lay a bizarre battlefield.

On that field, a thirty zhang-long, magnificent Artifact Spirit Fire Bird swayed and fought a huge, red-and-purple shadow.

That shadow was vaguely humanoid though it floated without feet; it had numerous tentacle-like arms that waved through the void and filled the space.

At its head sat a single massive eye emitting a chilling light.

Fury of fire pulsed about its form, and purple arcs of electricity raced across its surface like tempestuous thunder.

It was the Qiantian Thunderflame!

Yang Kai watched, stunned—he had not expected the Qiantian Thunderflame's true form to be like this.

Yet undeniably, the Thunderflame's murderous, destructive aura made men tremble.

Its tentacle-arms swept, covering the entire battlefield with attacks; if the Fire Bird was brushed even once, its radiance would dim a touch.

It was as if the Qiantian Thunderflame was stealing the Fire Bird's primordial power.

The Fire Bird refused to yield, each time finding an opening to rush beside the Thunderflame and clamp down with its beak; each bite restored a great deal of the usurped primordial power.

The two strange beings fought to devour one another's existence in this peculiar way—the clash shook heaven and earth.

Yang Kai noticed, sharply, that behind the Qiantian Thunderflame eight golden, gleaming energy chains bound its body, imprisoning it here.

Those eight chains bore the same aura as the octagonal array at the volcano's mouth.

It seemed those chains greatly restricted the Thunderflame's power; without them the Fire Bird would have no chance.

Realizing this, Yang Kai was deeply shocked.

It was hard to imagine what strength the Qiantian Thunderflame could unleash without the formation's constraint—would it be Second Stage of the Void King Realm, or even Third Stage?

And who had used great divine might to bind it here?
