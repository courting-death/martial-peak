## Chapter 1973 — Divine Spirit Descendants

Yang Kai had underestimated the power of Xu Qing's Beast-Form Transformation, mainly because he did not recognize the Golden-Mane Giant Ape.

Had he known that the Golden-Mane Giant Ape was a strange breed famed for its strength even in ancient times, he would not have been so careless as to be smashed into the ground.

In ancient days, such monstrously powerful beasts could casually uproot mountains with a single hand…

Fortunately his skin was thick and his flesh tough; though he was a little disheveled, he was not injured.

But Xu Qing's attack had truly filled him with rage.

The Domain Field of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm pressed down on Xu Qing; the Domain Field, laced with Spatial Force, disturbed the stability of that patch of space, and countless tiny, fish‑shaped spatial rifts began to vanish and reappear.

Yang Kai grinned savagely and swept his hands; Moon Blades shot forth like a storm.

Xu Qing's face changed drastically; although he could not determine the exact nature of the Moon Blades at first glance, Yang Kai's Domain Field was so potent and cohesive that he felt his life threatened.

He ignored the wound in his lower abdomen, roared to the heavens, his golden fur bristling, and became like steel needles incarnate — relying on his peerless divine might, he broke free from Yang Kai's Domain Field and leapt aside.

Hissing sounds filled the air as the Moon Blades all struck empty space, spraying soil and dust.

When Yang Kai turned, locking onto Xu Qing's position, he found that at some point the man had gained a great axe in his hand; it spun twice in the air and descended in a direct chop.

Yang Kai's eyes blazed with fury; multicolored aurora intensified about his body as he unleashed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, a layer of dragon scales covering his right arm, and he swept it toward the axe.

The two auras collided like two mountains meeting, and the earth trembled for it.

"What?"

Xu Qing's face went white as he watched his Secret Treasure axe get flung aside, while Yang Kai remained unhurt, merely pausing a moment to dispel the force and then charging again.

That strike, even aimed at a fellow Third Stage of the Void King Realm combatant, ought to have inflicted grievous wounds or even death, yet Yang Kai appeared entirely unscathed.

How formidable was his physical defense?

Xu Qing seethed with anger but did not retreat; instead he roared and charged Yang Kai head‑on.

The two quickly became a blur in the sky, fighting until the heavens dimmed and the earth grew dark; from the start Xu Qing had been at a disadvantage, while Yang Kai grew braver with each exchange, unleashing secret techniques and Martial Skill that left Xu Qing wailing in pain.

"How can this be? I already manifested the Beast-Soul Symbiosis of the Golden-Mane Giant Ape. Among Void King Realm cultivators, even if I cannot be called invincible, no one should be able to suppress me. Could it be his Origin Qi…"

Doubt and alarm warred in Xu Qing's eyes; it was not fear so much as worry, and his emotions could not be soothed.

Although Xu Qing was in a sorry state and being thoroughly suppressed by Yang Kai, he had not taken any new outward wounds — all his injuries were internal.

After the span of half a teacup's time, Xu Qing found he could hardly hold out; he realized that if he remained to brawl with Yang Kai he might lose his life here.

With that thought, he formed the intention to retreat.

At that moment, a sound of something slicing through the air came from far off, followed by a man's boisterous laugh: "Heaven has been kind to me — it dropped something ready for the taking right here, hahahahaha!"

As the voice fell, a tower ship suddenly blotted out the sunlight overhead, and on its deck a line of seven or eight deep‑auraed cultivators looked coldly down; at their head an old man’s eyes gleamed as he stared at the Fire Bird imprisoned within the water‑blue sphere.

Yang Kai and Xu Qing were both startled and hurriedly retreated.

In the next instant Yang Kai moved to Mo Xiaoqi's side, brow furrowed, looking up; at the same time his Divine Sense spread to scan the surroundings.

Yang Kai's face turned sullen.

He detected countless cultivators rapidly approaching; evidently the Fire Bird's pitiful cries had drawn them here.

The tower ship was only the first wave to arrive, and the old man at its head possessed the mighty cultivation of the Dao Origin Realm.

No sooner had the old man's words fallen than a figure flickered nearby: a middle‑aged man in the guise of a classical scholar appeared in sight and sneered, "Elder Jiu, your speed is impressive."

Elder Jiu glowered at the scholar with disgust and said coldly, "Chen Shiqi, have you come to join this little spectacle as well?"

Chen Shiqi laughed and replied, "Why should Elder Jiu's arrival bar me?"

"Indeed, my Blazing Fire Hall also wants a piece of this fun; Elder Jiu, I trust you won't begrudge us." Another voice cut in as three war chariots like tigers appeared from somewhere, and a burly man leapt lightly from the foremost chariot.

He was as strong as a bear, exuding a conspicuous fire‑elemental aura from head to toe; even his hair and beard were a dark crimson.

"Hmph!" At the arrival of this man from the Blazing Fire Hall, Elder Jiu and Chen Shiqi both snorted, wearing displeased expressions as if greatly wary of the burly man.

"Three Dao Origin Realm cultivators!" Yang Kai's brow tightened; from his perception he could roughly gauge the trio's strength: the early arrivals, Elder Jiu and Chen Shiqi, were likely First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while the burly man who came later was a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert.

As soon as the burly man appeared, Elder Jiu and Chen Shiqi ceased their bickering and exchanged looks, instead forming a tacit solidarity.

"Hall Master Luo's appearance is unexpected; would he not be needed to oversee the Blazing Fire Hall? I heard your hall has not been peaceful lately," Elder Jiu snorted coldly.

Hall Master Luo chuckled lightly, "I appreciate your concern, Elder Jiu. The matters within my hall are minor disputes; this Luo handled them easily."

On hearing this, Elder Jiu's face darkened; he suspected that Luo's claim of easily resolving matters had likely been accompanied by many deaths.

Despite Hall Master Luo's hulking and carefree appearance, he was actually a ruthless man, feared by many around Fenglin City.

As the conversation continued, more and more cultivators gathered here, mostly arriving in groups; solitary figures like Chen Shiqi were rare.

The three Dao Origin Realm cultivators were extremely displeased with the situation; they wished to expel these riff‑raff but none wanted to be the first to stir up the crowd's anger.

Yang Kai frowned inwardly, sensing this matter would not be easy to handle.

As he hesitated, Hall Master Luo suddenly asked, "Elder Jiu, you are well‑travelled — do you recognize what kind of demonic beast this is?"

He had been staring at the Fire Bird wrapped in the water‑blue sphere but seemed unable to identify its species, so he spoke.

Elder Jiu frowned and said, "It seems to me this little creature carries blood of the phoenix line."

"Phoenix?"

"An Ancient Divine Spirit?"

The many cultivators hearing this were not elated but instead paled and stepped back in alarm.

The name Ancient Divine Spirit was simply too great; ordinary cultivators would be horrified at the sound of it. Such beings were powerful Divine Spirits born since antiquity, beings whose power could obliterate a world and proved a grave problem even for the Ten Peak Emperors.

Yang Kai was suddenly enlightened; if that were true, it explained the faint pressure he had sensed within the Fire Bird.

Where dragons had their majesty and phoenixes their aura, a Fire Bird with phoenix blood would naturally possess an innate presence that intimidated any living creature.

Chen Shiqi nodded and said, "I concur with Elder Jiu's view; yet I cannot tell to which branch this creature belongs."

Hall Master Luo chuckled, "I heard of a Divine Spirit in ancient times called Luanfeng, possessing both phoenix and qingluan bloodlines. I once saw some records and illustrations — this little thing bears a seven‑ or eight‑tenths resemblance, though I cannot be certain."

"Luanfeng?" Elder Jiu frowned, then suddenly shouted at Xu Qing standing nearby, "Boy, did this creature display any power before?"

Xu Qing had already ended his Beast-Soul Symbiosis and returned to his original form, but he looked pale, clearly exhausted from the prior battle. Hearing Elder Jiu's question, he dared not withhold anything and promptly described everything that had happened.

The Dao Origin Realm cultivators listened, their expressions growing increasingly excited.

From Xu Qing's account, the Fire Bird could indeed be linked to the Luanfeng line.

That was an Ancient Divine Spirit!

In other words, this little Fire Bird was an offspring of a Divine Spirit, and moreover an immature one!

If they could capture it and raise it, once it matured they would obtain a Divine Spirit ally, elevating one's status to the level of the Ten Peak Emperors.

At that thought many breaths quickened — this was a chance to rise to the top in a single step.

Elder Jiu, Chen Shiqi, and Hall Master Luo all stared at the little Fire Bird with greed in their eyes.

"Time to go!" Yang Kai read the situation and realized this was no place to linger; he quietly told Mo Xiaoqi.

"Can I take my hands away now?" Mo Xiaoqi timidly asked.

"Why are you still covering them?" Yang Kai snapped, irritated, and roughly pulled her hands away from her eyes.

Once her sight was restored, Mo Xiaoqi glanced around and was startled: "So many people?"

"Yes. If we don't leave now, we won't be able to." Yang Kai gritted his teeth.

"But… my little Luanfeng!" Mo Xiaoqi bit her lip and looked at the Fire Bird locked by her Secret Treasure; no matter how foolish she was, she knew she could not take the bird away under so many watchful eyes.

"You knew it was a Luanfeng?" Yang Kai stared at Mo Xiaoqi in surprise.

"Of course. The moment I saw it I knew." Mo Xiaoqi looked utterly certain.

Yang Kai was stupefied for a long time, then finally cursed viciously.

Had he known there was a Luanfeng offspring in Yuqing Mountain, there was no amount of reward Mo Xiaoqi could have offered that would have tempted him to come.
