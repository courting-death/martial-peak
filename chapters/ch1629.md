## Chapter 1629 — Soft Confinement

Ran Yunting froze.

Since she had taken Su Yan back to Icebound Island nearly thirty years ago, she had never seen Su Yan smile; today was the first time.

The sudden bloom of that smile stood in stark contrast to the cold, aloof demeanor Su Yan usually wore, and matched with Su Yan’s almost flawless, peerless beauty, it even left Ran Yunting momentarily dazed.

A wave of self‑reproach rose in her heart.

Soon Ran Yunting dispelled the distracting thoughts, her face darkening as she demanded, “You actually have a man—when did this happen?”

“It was long before I met Master.”

“Have you had physical relations with him?” Ran Yunting pressed on.

A touch of intoxicating blush rose on Su Yan’s cheeks and she gave a slight nod.

Ran Yunting’s body trembled as if she had lost strength; she staggered back two steps, obvious disappointment filling her eyes as she cried, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

“Master never asked,” Su Yan said, lightly biting her lips.

Ran Yunting said, “I didn’t ask because your aura was so pure—Master assumed you were a virgin! But since you’ve had intimacy with a man, why is your aura not sullied?”

Once a woman has been intimate with a man, some of the man’s yang vigor inevitably remains within her body; that trace of energy is enough to shatter that kind of pristine purity.

Su Yan’s aura was exceptionally clean, immaculate; Ran Yunting could not have imagined that she had long since ceased to be a virgin.

Could it be due to a strange constitution? That was possible—Su Yan’s constitution was clearly not congenital but later formed; perhaps when it manifested it made her aura so clean.

“Such disregard for self‑preservation!” Ran Yunting ground her teeth and hissed.

“I have disappointed Master,” Su Yan lowered her eyes.

“If I had known earlier, I would never have allowed you to cultivate the Ice Jade Skill!” Ran Yunting said in anguish, her great expectations turned to disappointment, eyes reddening: “You must know, once one cultivates the Ice Jade Skill, if one becomes moved by love the technique will lash back! The situation is still mild now, but if this continues your Saint Yuan will be scattered. In the end you will become a cripple!”

“I did not know!” Su Yan shook her head, yet showed no fear.

She had come to Icebound Island and become Ran Yunting’s disciple; whatever Master ordered her to cultivate, she cultivated without question. It was only when the technique recently showed problems that she began to realize.

Ran Yunting’s expression shifted. Realizing the gravity of the matter, though greatly disappointed that Su Yan had hidden her history, she nonetheless valued this disciple deeply. Hastily she said, “Su Yan, it’s not too late. You must cut the knot quickly and sever your feelings, otherwise your cultivation will fall until you become an ordinary person, and then no one will be able to save you.”

“Sever my feelings?” Su Yan looked up at Ran Yunting; an unusual light flashed in her eyes as she slowly, resolutely shook her head: “Master, forgive me—your disciple will not do that.”

“You—” Ran Yunting raged, pointing at Su Yan, speechless.

Su Yan smiled again. “If I can see him once more, even if I fall to become an ordinary person, I will do so willingly.”

Ran Yunting stood stunned, staring at Su Yan. “Is this your true heart? You will not regret it?”

Su Yan nodded.

“Have you thought that you’re only chasing a momentary pleasure? If you truly become an ordinary person, your lifespan would not exceed a hundred years; in the end you will age and lose your beauty—what man would take interest then? The man you cherish might ultimately leave you!”

Su Yan’s delicate body trembled; a trace of fear appeared in her beautiful eyes.

Seeing that look, Ran Yunting thought she had a chance and prepared to press the advantage and reason with her, but Su Yan’s fear melted away. She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear and said softly, “If I can be with him again, I will willingly leave before I grow old and wither; I will not let him see me in that state.”

“You infuriate me!” Ran Yunting’s chest heaved violently.

She had never realized her disciple could be so stubborn and unreasonable.

“Master, I want to go out!” Su Yan said in a low voice.

“You mean to go out to find that man?” Ran Yunting looked at her coldly; earlier she had thought Su Yan sought to leave for experience to break through her bottleneck, but now she understood her disciple’s true purpose.

She was clearly going to search for the man from the painting.

“Yes—please grant me permission!” Su Yan did not deny it.

“Delusion!” Ran Yunting snorted coldly. “You will obediently stay on the inner island—don’t think of stepping outside. I will find a way to solve your current trouble; don’t disappoint me again.”

“Master!” Su Yan cried in urgency.

Ran Yunting snorted and commanded sharply, “Attendants!”

Two women immediately entered; both had cultivation at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. They clasped their fists and said in unison, “Great Elder, what are your orders?”

“Take Su Yan away and watch her closely. If she dares leave her residence a single step, I will hold you accountable!”

The two women exchanged puzzled glances, not knowing what Su Yan had done to anger the Great Elder so badly.

They recalled that the Great Elder had once been proud of Su Yan, repeatedly declaring before outsiders that taking Su Yan as a disciple had been her best decision in life.

Su Yan was certainly destined to become the one to bring glory to Ice Heart Valley.

But now Ran Yunting was furious and even intended to place Su Yan under house arrest.

What on earth had happened?

The two women dared not ask further; they glanced thoughtfully at Su Yan and said, “Junior Sister Su, please.”

“Master...” Su Yan pleaded, looking to Ran Yunting, hoping she would change her mind.

“Take her away!” Ran Yunting barked, her back turned to Su Yan, as if she never wanted to see her again.

“Junior Sister, please don’t make things hard for us,” one of the two women—taller and frowning—urged impatiently.

Su Yan looked at Ran Yunting’s retreating back, sighed softly, knowing nothing she said would work. She bowed, then turned and left.

Soon the ice chamber held only Ran Yunting.

Her gaze seemed to spit fire as she stared at the portrait hanging on the ice wall, her eyes as if they could tear the painted man to pieces. Suddenly she raised her palm and struck forward.

With a thunderous boom, the portrait turned to powder in an instant.

“Kid, don’t fall into my hands—or I will tear you to pieces!” Ran Yunting vowed darkly in her heart.

So long as Su Yan still harbored even the faintest remorse in her heart, she would immediately strike Yang Kai down, purging the heart demon within her.

If Su Yan would not sever her feelings herself, then as her Master Ran Yunting would do it for her!

Once that man was dead, Su Yan’s path forward would be unobstructed and the Ice Jade Skill would no longer lash back.

Perhaps Su Yan would grieve and become withdrawn for a time, but Ran Yunting believed that as time passed Su Yan would feel gratitude rather than hatred.

After thinking it over, Ran Yunting swiftly left her ice chamber and headed to the ice peak where the Grand Elder was in seclusion—she needed to consult the Grand Elder, for she was not entirely certain her method would work; if the Grand Elder approved, there would be no more concerns.

On the inner island of Icebound Island, ice paths crisscrossed and led in all directions.

Many of Ice Heart Valley’s female disciples walked those paths. The buildings on Icebound Island were unique, as if carved from blocks of ice—crystal clear and exuding cold.

Su Yan walked in a daze along the ice path, step by step toward her ice chamber.

The two female disciples assigned to guard her followed closely behind, their eyes meeting as their Divine Senses exchanged thoughts.

“Senior Sister Zhou, what do you think Su Yan did to make the Great Elder so angry?” the shorter girl asked.

The taller Zhou Senior Sister snorted, “The Great Elder didn’t say; how would I know? But this is no trivial matter—otherwise the Great Elder wouldn’t house arrest Su Yan. Humph, this brat has been arrogant since entering Ice Heart Valley, never giving us elder sisters proper respect, never greeting us when she meets us.”

“Yes, she relies on the Great Elder’s favor,” the shorter girl said with a smile. “Now that she has angered the Great Elder, she’ll fall out of favor. I want to see how arrogant she can be afterward.”

“We elder sisters should teach her how to behave.”

The two exchanged a look and smiled knowingly, feeling pleased as if the sky itself were different today.

As they walked, Su Yan suddenly stopped; her previously vacant eyes brightened, she looked in one direction, and then her figure flashed—she was gone from sight.

The two women trailing her changed their expressions, thinking she was trying to escape, but when they turned they saw she had run up to several fellow disciples.

“What’s going on?” the Zhou woman said displeased, hurrying over.

A few disciples who had been whispering now all looked puzzled at Su Yan’s sudden approach. The leader among them, a woman with cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, frowned as she examined Su Yan and said in surprise, “You’re the Great Elder’s disciple Su Yan?”

“She’s Su Yan?”

“I heard she entered at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; in less than thirty years she’s nearly at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.”

“I’ve heard of her as well—so this is what she looks like.”

The women sized Su Yan up with interest, as if seeing her for the first time.

“Yes.” Su Yan nodded. “Greetings, Senior Sisters!”

“Hm—do you have business?” the leader asked.

“I just heard several Senior Sisters discussing the man in the painting. Have you seen him?” Su Yan asked, pointing at the portrait the leader held.

“You mean this fellow?” the woman lifted the portrait and chuckled, “I have seen him.”

Su Yan’s eyes lit up; she hurriedly asked, “When did you see him, Senior Sister? Is he... all right?”
