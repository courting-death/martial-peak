## Chapter 457 — This Is the Yang Family’s Stage

The news that a thousand treasures were about to appear spread like wildfire, shaking the entire War City in an instant.

The six Young Masters’ manors all acted swiftly, preparing and readying for departure.

Curious onlookers gathered in groups, heading toward Po Jing Lake, fifty miles away, eager to witness the excitement.

At Yang Kai’s manor, Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, staring at the noisy group of allies before him. Aside from the five from the Duanmu Family—each a taciturn Divine Roaming Realm master who refrained from saying a word—the others were all clamoring for Yang Kai to bring their troops to join the battle.

Though silent, those five from the Duanmu Family radiated a fierce battle intent in their eyes.

The debate escalated into a chaotic uproar.

Qiu Yimeng was at a loss. Most of these people were Yang Kai’s friends; unlike other Young Masters’ manors where those who went to assist were merely subordinates subject to orders, here these were individuals who could not be commanded at will.

“I don’t care. This Young Master is definitely going, dammit! How could I, Huo Xingchen, miss such a grand event?” The eldest Young Master Huo declared with an attitude of “if you don’t take me, I’ll go alone.”

Qiu Yimeng opened and closed her mouth but said nothing. She also wished to go, but Yang Kai was clearly in a difficult position. As the second-in-command of the manor, it wasn’t proper to favor some personal attachments; she had to wait for Yang Kai’s decision.

Yang Kai gave a wry smile facing his passionate allies.

Their desire to go was not out of boredom nor simply enticed by the treasure, but because Yang Kai had been providing them with cultivation Pills, and they had yet to contribute any effort. Now that a chance to prove themselves had finally arrived, who would be willing to miss it?

“Let’s draw lots,” Yang Kai settled the matter decisively. Continuing the argument would yield no result, so employing the simplest method was best.

The once noisy crowd quieted abruptly, all gazing at Yang Kai in surprise—who would have thought he’d decide such a matter by drawing lots?

But... it seemed not entirely inappropriate.

“That’s good. Whoever goes, whoever stays, fate will decide!” Han Xiao Qi smiled subtly, being the first to agree.

“Then let’s grab the lots!” Fatty Dong nodded in agreement.

“This Young Master has no objections!” Huo Xingchen chuckled.

To ensure fairness, Yang Kai personally oversaw the arrangements. Soon the results were announced.

Among the eleven supporting families, six joined Yang Kai’s campaign: the Huo Family, Duanmu Family, Dong Family, Wan Hua Palace, Yingyue Sect, and Tianyuan City. The rest stayed behind to guard the manor, prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.

“No objections, right?” Yang Kai scanned the group.

“All right, I’ll stay behind to keep watch,” Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly.

“Then let’s depart!” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold and commanding. He raised his hand and led the way immediately. The six factions hurried to keep pace.

Among these six, except for the Huo Family—which had only two Divine Roaming Realm masters at the Fifth Stage—each had at least five Divine Roaming Realm experts. Among them, four were at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. The remaining stages were unevenly distributed but none were weak.

Nearly thirty Divine Roaming Realm masters set out, joined by many True Essence Realm martial artists. The spectacle was truly magnificent.

About a mile outside Yang Kai’s manor was an inn. Inside the main hall sat a young man and two young women having a meal. Among them was a pair of twins.

The twin sisters wore light blue dresses, ethereal and refined. Their enchanting beauty drew many passing customers and patrons to steal glances in admiration.

Beautiful women were rare; twin beauties were even rarer.

One of the twins bore an expression of helplessness, while the other remained calm yet showed subtle dissatisfaction and resentment between her brows.

The young man sighed bitterly, quietly drinking. “Big Sister, we’ve been here over a month. Are you really not going inside?”

One of the sisters nodded. “Yes, sister. Staying in this inn isn’t right. Since we came all this way, why not see him?”

“For what?” The other sister snorted coldly. “We didn’t come to see him. We…” 

“We’re just out for fun, I know,” the man interrupted. “But the War City is chaotic now. You two showing yourselves openly will eventually attract attention. Haven’t you noticed more people watching you lately?”

“I’m not going!” The dazzling woman snorted again. “If you want to go, then you go. I’ll just hide in my room from now on.”

The man shook his head gently. “He just concealed his true identity. It’s not his wish. Yang Family scions don’t reveal these things when they're away from home. Why do you care so much?”

The woman pouted, unable to respond.

Suddenly, a large group rushed out from Yang Kai’s manor, with Yang Kai leading them, rising into the air and dashing eastward.

The women’s eyes brightened, then dimmed again.

“There’s movement!” The man’s expression hardened. Yang Kai leading so many out clearly signaled a serious matter. He turned to the sisters. “I’m going to see what’s happening. Are you coming?”

“Sister, I want to go!” one quickly said.

“I…”

“What are you waiting for? If you don’t hurry, we’ll be too late. Let’s go!” The man forced no argument and rushed out.

The twins exchanged a glance and followed without hesitation.

Just outside the city, Yang Kai’s flank was intercepted by a host of troops. Both sides sized each other up, the tension palpable.

They were Yang Zhao’s men! Though a month ago Yang Kai’s forces briefly surpassed Yang Zhao, the latter had since gathered more support. His contingent was no less than Yang Kai’s now and was packed with formidable experts.

Their forces closed the distance to less than thirty zhang, moving parallel. Neither side willing to fall behind.

“Ninth Brother, impressive agility,” Yang Zhao chuckled. “No wonder our Third Brother was taken by you.”

“Second Brother is flattering me,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“This time, Second Brother won’t go easy on you.”

“Anytime, Second Brother. If you want a fight, I’m ready to play!”

Yang Zhao’s smile stiffened slightly. Yang Kai’s imposing aura made him uneasy. After a pause, he shook his head. “Serious matters first. Brothers spar later. Plenty of chances ahead!”

“True enough!” Yang Kai ceased provocations.

Suddenly, a gust raced from behind. A figure darted through the crowd, speeding forward like lightning.

Both Yang Kai and Yang Zhao’s expressions tightened as they narrowed their eyes, focusing on the person’s back.

“Liu Qingyao!” Huo Xingchen shouted, grinding his teeth. “That bastard is so arrogant!”

His voice was furious but tinged with helplessness. Compared to Huo Xingchen, Liu Qingyao truly was more exceptional.

He cut across both forces’ heads without glance or hesitation, clearly confident in his prowess and disregarding everyone.

Upon hearing Huo Xingchen’s exclamation, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

He had only heard Liu Qingyao’s name before, never seeing him in person.

Since the succession war began, he knew Liu Qingyao had been watching from afar in War City, neither aligning with nor confronting any Yang Family scion.

Clearly, in his eyes no one was worthy of his allegiance.

So this was Liu Qingyao! He really had grounds for his arrogance.

Yang Zhao snorted lightly. “Ninth Brother, this is the Yang Family’s stage. How can we let outsiders steal the spotlight?”

Yang Kai understood and smiled: “I feel the same.”

In unison, their expressions sharpened as they surged forward like shooting stars.

Behind them, both forces were shaken.

Recently, Yang Zhao had reached the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. His cultivation was yet to stabilize, but surpassing this threshold was significant.

Even at this initial stage, he could unleash this speed, faster than the departing Liu Qingyao by some measure, commanding awe.

More astonishing was Yang Kai, a mere Eighth Stage True Essence Realm cultivator, who matched Yang Zhao’s pace. His movements were windborne, effortless and agile.

The Yang Family’s direct descendants truly were monsters! The crowd could only shake their heads in disbelief.

During the dash, Yang Zhao glanced sideways at Yang Kai with admiration. He had employed secret techniques to reach this speed, consuming vast True Essence. In other words, he could only sustain this for about the length of an incense stick before needing rest or he’d slow down.

Ninth Brother, however, seemed different. No secret arts, no treasure aids—just pure True Essence. His speed appeared inherent, attainable simply by channeling his power.

Inevitably, Yang Zhao felt a twinge of dissatisfaction, accelerating further.

Yet just as he pulled half a body length ahead, Yang Kai caught up effortlessly, waving off concern. “Second Brother, this is tiring.”

Yang Zhao forced a smile. “Let’s catch up to Liu Qingyao first.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily, brimming with resolve: “I’ll take the spotlight for the Yang Family. If you can’t keep up, Second Brother, just rest!”

Suddenly, a fierce heat surged beside Yang Zhao as Yang Kai seemed to become a blazing fireball, engulfed in flames. In an instant, he shot ahead, closing the gap to Liu Qingyao. The rushing wind cut like knives against Yang Zhao’s face.

Yang Zhao’s eyelids tightened, his voice firm: “I am Second Brother, how could I not be able to?”

A ring of dazzling light enveloped him. Bathed in its gleam, Yang Zhao’s speed surged to the limit, shadowing Yang Kai closely.

Sensing the two pursuing him, Liu Qingyao glanced back. Before his gaze focused, a fiery figure streaked past him, the heat disrupting his True Essence.

“Hm?” Liu Qingyao’s face showed surprise. “What pure True Essence!”

“Young Master Liu, we’ll take the lead!” Yang Zhao laughed heartily as he surged past Liu Qingyao.
