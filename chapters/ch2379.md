## Chapter 2379 — You Don’t Care?

“If you want to find the master artificer, there’s no chance today.” The young boy snorted, “But you’re lucky to have run into me. If you don’t mind, just hand over your materials and I’ll forge them for you!”

“You’re an artificer too?” Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

The boy lifted his chin and puffed out his chest, tossing his hair with a roguish flair. He declared proudly, “What’s so hard about a little artifact forging? I was born with extraordinary talent, and after being around the master for so long, helping you is no problem at all. But as for the payment…”

Yang Kai curled his lips and walked away without looking back.

This boy was only at the Origin Returning Realm. Even if he really was an artificer, how skilled could he be? Yang Kai was looking for Master Sangde to repair a high-level Purification Array, and repairing was even harder than forging. He was certain this boy didn’t have the ability.

“Hey, don’t just walk away! Are you looking down on me?” The boy stomped his feet, clearly feeling deeply insulted by Yang Kai. “Let me tell you, I’m a genuine Saint-Grade artificer! Miss this chance and you won’t find another—don’t come crying to me later!”

……

For several days, Yang Kai went to Master Sangde’s place every day. According to the boy, the master had already opened his doors twice this month, and there was only one chance left, but no one knew the exact time. So Yang Kai could only try his luck.

Unfortunately, after several days, Yang Kai still gained nothing.

However, after wandering the streets these days, he had gotten a pretty good grasp of Tongtian City’s situation and customs.

With only a few days left in the month, Yang Kai was afraid he’d miss the master’s opening if he came late, or fail to squeeze into the ten available spots. So he stopped running around and went straight to the master’s residence to wait.

He thought he’d arrived early enough to secure a good spot, but when he got there, Yang Kai realized he was wrong.

In front of Master Sangde’s residence, quite a few cultivators were already lined up waiting.

Yang Kai was stunned at the sight.

But thinking about it, he realized these people must have had the same idea. With so little time left this month and one last chance for the master to open his doors, they had come early to wait.

He counted carefully and found there were nine people already. In other words, including himself, that made a full ten.

Without saying much, he quietly took his place at the end of the line.

The sweeping boy seemed to get excited around crowds. Seeing so many people, he energetically promoted himself, boasting about his skills and trying to get the cultivators to hand over their materials for him to forge.

But the cultivators living here clearly knew the boy’s abilities. He was like a half-filled bucket, making the most noise. No one responded to his endless chatter, no matter how much he bragged.

The boy seemed a bit annoyed.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Instead of wasting your breath here, why not go find some materials and practice your craft? Judging by how long you’ve been with the master, surely he’s taught you that every skill is built step by step—don’t aim too high before you’re ready.”

The boy muttered, “Mind your own business. Just stand there.”

But after Yang Kai’s lecture, he felt too embarrassed to keep pestering the cultivators. He turned and went inside, shutting the door behind him to avoid the sight.

Everyone here was waiting for Master Sangde to open his doors and request artifact forging. Since no one really knew each other, there was no idle chatter. Those who got bored simply sat down cross-legged to meditate.

In front of the master’s door, no one dared to act out of line, so there was no fear of trouble from anyone with no sense.

As time passed, more and more people arrived.

But when the newcomers saw ten people already waiting, most shook their heads in disappointment and left. They knew Master Sangde’s rules and understood that waiting would be pointless, so they could only wait for the next opportunity.

Some, however, came prepared. They took out Source Crystals and tried to buy a spot from the ten, including Yang Kai, but few succeeded—only two people made quick deals.

Those trying to buy a spot with Source Crystals also approached him, but Yang Kai wasn’t short on Source Crystals and simply shook his head in refusal.

After waiting for two full days, the front door suddenly opened. The boy strode out, puffing out his chest, and coughed theatrically before announcing, “The third artifact forging session of the month begins now! The first ten, please follow me inside!”

Everyone was overjoyed and stood up at once. After waiting so long, the master’s third opening was finally here. They all felt it was worth it, since Master Sangde rarely failed in his forging, and though his fees were high, his skills were superb. As long as you made your request, the master could fulfill it.

“Hahaha, coming early is nothing compared to coming at the right time!” A loud laugh rang out, and a figure shot in from behind, barging into the crowd and seizing a spot. The powerful aura he unleashed made everyone frown and look displeased.

But after sensing the newcomer’s cultivation, their displeasure turned to wariness.

The newcomer was actually a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert.

Among the ten waiting, only Yang Kai and a woman dressed as a young matron were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The rest were at the first or second stage, so naturally, no one dared to offend him.

The man wore a long purple robe, making him stand out. He was quite imposing, but his gaze was filled with a strong sense of superiority, as if no one in the world could meet his standards.

After arrogantly taking a spot, Yang Kai, who had been at the end of the line, suddenly became the eleventh person.

Master Sangde only allowed ten people in at a time. Now, standing eleventh, did that mean he’d waited for days for nothing?

Yang Kai was immediately displeased and looked at the boy, “Hey, aren’t you going to do something about this?”

“What? I didn’t see anything.” The boy tilted his head back, rolling his eyes.

A few days ago, Yang Kai had knocked him on the head, and he clearly still held a grudge. Seeing Yang Kai lose his spot, he was secretly delighted and had no intention of helping.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “Are you blind? Didn’t you see him cut in line?”

The boy snapped, “My eyes are just fine. You’re the blind one.”

Yang Kai sneered, “To act so domineering in front of the master’s door—doesn’t anyone care about fairness?”

“Fairness?” The man who had seized the spot sneered, “This Lord is the law here. You want to talk fairness with me? Fine, let’s talk. You say I cut in line—who saw it? If anyone saw it, step up and say so, and I, Yu Leping, will give up my spot immediately!”

As he spoke, he looked around. The other nine remained silent, clearly wary of this Yu Leping.

“I saw it!” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Yu Leping snorted, “Don’t make trouble just because you came late. If you slander me again, believe it or not, I’ll gouge your eyes out?”

“Try it.” Yang Kai laughed in anger. This Yu Leping was truly shameless—he’d cut in line, yet now he was playing the victim. Yang Kai had never seen someone so brazen.

“You’re courting death!” Yu Leping was clearly hot-tempered. He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to argue with him, so in a fit of rage, he stepped forward, his hand turning into a claw as he grabbed at Yang Kai.

The attack hadn’t even landed, but the force was already upon him, overwhelming and fierce.

Judging by his posture, he really intended to gouge out Yang Kai’s eyes, showing no mercy at all.

The weaker cultivators were so pressured by his aura that their faces changed and they staggered back.

Yang Kai didn’t move, but instead looked coldly at the boy. “You’re not going to step in when someone’s fighting in front of the master’s door?”

The boy snorted, “Settle your own business.”

“That’s all I needed to hear!” Yang Kai snorted, raising his eyes to Yu Leping.

Yu Leping, who had been so aggressive, suddenly felt a chill run through him under Yang Kai’s gaze. But then he remembered he was a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. On the whole Tongtian Island, only a handful of people could make him wary—who else could be his match?

So after a brief hesitation, his attack became even more vicious.

Yang Kai raised his hand and punched forward. His Origin Qi erupted like a dormant volcano, its power so overwhelming that everyone was shocked.

Pa—

Yu Leping’s hand grabbed Yang Kai’s fist, a cruel smile on his face. Just as he was about to crush Yang Kai’s hand, he was shocked to find a tsunami-like force surging toward him. With his Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he was powerless to resist. His protective Origin Qi melted away like snow under the sun, retreating rapidly.

The force rushed up his arm, shredding his clothes, flesh, and bone along the way.

Boom—

Yu Leping, who had been so aggressive, was sent flying like he’d been hit by a mountain, crashing into the corner of the wall.

Wah—

A mouthful of blood spurted out, and Yu Leping’s arrogance instantly vanished. His face turned pale and bloodless.

“My hand!” he screamed in agony. Looking over, the arm he’d struck with was broken in several places, blood streaming, white bone jutting out—it was a horrifying sight.

The boy was stunned, and the other nine were terrified, all staring at Yang Kai in shock.

Before Yang Kai made a move, he’d seemed harmless, even asking the boy to uphold justice. But when he acted, he was so ruthless—one punch crippled Yu Leping’s arm, and he didn’t even bat an eye.

This guy… could he be an Emperor Realm master hiding his strength?

Everyone had this thought, and the boy broke out in a cold sweat on the spot.
