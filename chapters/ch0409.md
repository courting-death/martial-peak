## Chapter 409 — When You Have Time, I'll Treat You to Tea

“What the hell’s going on?” Yang Zhen barked sharply, glaring at Cheng Bailian with displeasure. “At your age, you shouldn’t be so jumpy and unseemly!”

Cheng Bailian, however, seemed not to hear him. His eyes were wide open, shining with a mix of excitement, joy, and shock as he fixed his gaze unblinkingly on Yang Kai. The next moment, his figure staggered slightly before he suddenly appeared right in front of Yang Kai. Grabbing his shoulder tightly like an iron hoop, as if afraid Yang Kai would escape, he asked in a trembling voice, “Boy, this spirit formation… where did you get it from?”

Yang Kai frowned slightly, sensing something amiss, but answered calmly, “Yao Wang Valley, Hidden Cloud Peak.”

Cheng Bailian’s body trembled slightly, a look of ‘just as I thought’ crossing his face as he nodded repeatedly. “I knew it, I knew it…”

Then, turning solemn again, he gazed at Yang Kai and asked seriously, “What is your relationship with Master Xiao?”

“No relation. I only stayed on Hidden Cloud Peak for two months,” Yang Kai said slowly, downplaying it.

Cheng Bailian’s expression suddenly turned cold and hostile as his eyes flashed a sharp chill. “So you stole this spirit formation?”

Yang Kai shook his head. “Master taught it to me.”

Cheng Bailian was taken aback, unsure why this young man who claimed no relation to Master Xiao had been taught two such spirit formations. Yet, he quickly smiled again. “Good, good. Alchemy secrets must not be stolen, must not be stolen. If Master taught you, then it’s all right.”

He obviously believed Yang Kai was holding back and reluctant to admit his connection to Xiao Fusheng in public.

Though their exchange was brief, the white-haired elders in the Elder Hall sensed something unusual.

Those two spirit formations, which Yang Zhen had failed to recognize… seemed to have a significant origin!

“Senior, you recognize this spirit formation?” Yang Kai asked with some curiosity. If Cheng Bailian did not recognize it, he wouldn’t have reacted so strongly. But it was from the True Alchemy Formula—how could he know it?

At Yang Kai’s question, Yang Zhen and the others turned their gaze to Cheng Bailian, who looked both distraught and lost, shaking his head with a bitter smile. His eyes showed a hint of reminiscence as if plunged into deep thought.

“Speak up, damn it!” Yang Zhen, known for his fiery temper, shouted angrily after waiting too long for an explanation.

Normally, the Yang Family’s chief alchemist would have been irritable by now. But this time, he seemed rather thoughtful, pondering for a while before saying, “Thirty years ago, at an alchemy conference in Yao Wang Valley, I had the fortune to see this formation—though it was only half a broken formation.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted subtly; he began to understand the situation.

“That alchemy conference was full of prodigies, a gathering of shining stars! I bravely battled past dozens of opponents, my momentum unstoppable, rushing toward the finals. Yet in the end, I was defeated by one man—the very person who is now Master Xiao Fusheng!” Cheng Bailian said bitterly to Yang Kai. “Master Xiao is a natural genius, born for alchemy itself. Losing to him was no disgrace.”

Yang Zhen sneered silently on the side. As a martial artist, he naturally did not understand the intricacies of alchemy or the mutual respect among alchemists.

“Afterwards, outstanding young alchemists like us were sent to Dan Sheng Peak to venerate the Dan Sheng’s portrait and glean insights into alchemy,” Cheng Bailian continued smoothly. “Both Master Xiao and I saw half of this broken formation in the portrait but never the full picture; it was a great regret.”

“Later, I came to the Yang Family while Master Xiao entered Yao Wang Valley. Haha,” Cheng Bailian smiled slightly. “Over these thirty years, I’ve corresponded with Master Xiao occasionally. Whenever I have free time, I visit Yao Wang Valley to study that half-broken formation with him, hoping to complete it. Yet three decades later, I still have not succeeded!”

“When the Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive assault on Yao Wang Valley, the Dan Sheng portrait was destroyed! I thought I’d never see the full formation again. Unexpectedly… unexpectedly… hahaha, today my wish is finally fulfilled!” Cheng Bailian laughed madly, though his expression grew bittersweet as he continued, “Xiao Fusheng is truly Xiao Fusheng, always steps ahead of me. To think he’s already completed this spirit formation. I am no match—he truly deserves the title of the greatest alchemist in the world!”

Yang Kai did not expect the spirit formation he presented to be linked with such past events. Even someone as talented as Xiao Fusheng had only seen half of it back then, showing the vast profundity of the True Alchemy Formula.

The appearance of this spirit formation seemed to resolve a thirty-year conundrum between two of the greatest alchemists in the world.

Though there were some misunderstandings, Yang Kai did not intend to expose them. He only wanted to use Master Xiao’s name to act.

“You’ve said so much, but are these two spirit formations actually useful?” Yang Zhen asked impatiently.

“Nonsense,” Cheng Bailian snorted. “How could they not be? These are spirit formations from the Dan Sheng portrait, treasures left by Dan Sheng himself. Of course, they’re useful!”

“And their value?” Yang Zhen asked, sniffing.

“Inestimable!” Cheng Bailian’s expression grew extremely grave.

The elders showed strange looks; the two spirit formations Yang Kai produced could bring unparalleled contributions to the Yang Family. Even Yang Zhen didn’t know how to properly credit him.

“I’ll take the spirit formations to study them properly,” Cheng Bailian said with a delighted smile, clutching the two jade pieces as if they were precious treasures.

“You may take them, but do not leak them outside. You know the Yang Family’s rules,” Yang Zhen reminded sternly.

Cheng Bailian rolled his eyes. “I’ve been in the Yang Family for thirty years, living here among them. Do you think I don’t know the hierarchy?”

Yang Zhen nodded slightly in approval.

Cheng Bailian then turned to Yang Kai, no longer looking down on him, but kindly asked, “Boy, what’s your name?”

Yang Kai gave his name.

Cheng Bailian warmly patted his shoulder. “I will remember you. When you have time, come to my house. I’ll treat you to tea!”

With that, he strode off with a dignified gait.

The elders in the hall exchanged glances, feeling somewhat surreal.

Cheng Bailian inviting that boy to tea…

None of these old fellows had ever been treated so kindly by the Yang Family’s chief alchemist, let alone invited to tea.

Among the younger and even middle-aged generations, that was an extraordinary honor, one that would surely arouse envy if spread.

After Cheng Bailian left, the elders shook their heads in secret, wondering what kind of fortune Yang Kai had to have connections with someone like Xiao Fusheng and to have learned two priceless spirit formations from him.

“Elders,” Yang Kai called out, “Now that it’s confirmed, can I trade my merits for the followings of two Blood Servants?”

Yang Zhen rolled his eyes and grumbled, “Yes, but let me remind you: depending on the Blood Servants’ strength, the merits you need to spend vary.”

“What kind of Blood Servants can I get with my current merits?”

“Uh…” Yang Zhen cleared his throat awkwardly. “All the elites in the Blood Servants Hall, you can choose from them—including the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Hall!”

“The Chief and Deputy Chief?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“That’s right, both are experts at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm!” Yang Zhen nodded. “With them guarding you, no one should be able to get close to you in the succession war.”

Seemingly feeling Yang Kai’s merits too abundant, Yang Zhen was eager for him to spend them, enthusiastically promoting these Hall leaders and illustrating their formidable strength.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I don’t want them.”

Yang Zhen was stunned. “You don’t want such top experts? Who do you want then?”

“Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu,” Yang Kai named the two Blood Servants who had greeted Yang Xinwu, the fourth young master.

The expressions of the old men in the room immediately turned strange and amazed.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu had been the two most outstanding Blood Servants in the Blood Servants Hall. The elders had heard of them and placed great hopes on them. But because of the recent matter involving Yang Xinwu, they were punished and had become dispirited and stagnant.

The elders regretted their fate but were bound by family rules to punish them. They thought no one would dare use these two in the succession battle, yet the youngest among the Yang Family, Yang Kai, intended to employ such men.

Refusing strong and practiced elites to choose two wounded souls lying idle—either Yang Kai was a fool or had other designs.

Yang Zhen looked at Yang Kai meaningfully and said coldly, “They’re ruined. You still want them?”

“Yes.”

“Interesting!” Yang Zhen grinned. “You have quite the appetite.”

He looked as though he knew Yang Kai’s plan. Yang Kai just shrugged indifferently.

“Since you want them, then I’ll give them to you!” Yang Zhen snorted. “I want to see what kind of waves you’ll make with those two in the succession war! Don’t regret it when you lift a rock only to smash your own foot.”

“That’s my business. You need not worry,” Yang Kai replied.

Yang Zhen sneered coldly, then swiftly wrote a letter, stamped it with the elder council’s seal, and casually tossed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, skimmed over it casually, nodded in satisfaction, and saluted, “Thank you, Elder!”

“Hmm, with those two Blood Servants, you still have plenty of merits. Anything else you want to exchange?” Yang Zhen asked. “It’s wise to prepare well for the succession war.”

“How many merits do I have left?”

“A lot,” Yang Zhen said impatiently, not revealing any figures, probably unsure how to calculate.

“Then exchange them all for alchemy and refining materials, at least Heaven-Grade, preferably all Mystery-Grade.”
