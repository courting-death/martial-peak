## Chapter 905 — Li Rong's Opportunity

The four yao were in low spirits, while only Yang Kai and Li Rong brimmed with anticipation.

From the moment they entered, they had already confirmed this place had ties to the Great Demon God; those intent on probing such mysteries would not be discouraged halfway.

The fact nothing had been found yet simply meant they hadn’t reached the right spot; once they reached that precise place, clues would surely appear.

Both Yang Kai and Li Rong were overflowing with confidence.

One day, while traversing the boundless void, Yang Kai suddenly sensed an unusual aura coming from behind.

Startled, he turned to see Li Rong looking up at the sky, a thoughtful expression in her beautiful eyes; waves of power stirred within her delicate form, sending out strong fluctuations.

A strange light streaked across the horizon; Li Rong’s body trembled and her eyes suddenly brightened, the energy rippling from her growing ever more intense.

Lei Long, who was leading the way, halted and made a small exclamation as he looked back, surprise flashing across his face.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. At first he couldn’t tell exactly what was happening to Li Rong, but when her lovely face blossomed with radiance he realized at once and called in a low voice, “Enlightenment?”

Not daring to interrupt, he hurriedly waved to the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox and Jin Ni, who were trailing behind to form the rear guard.

The two yao experts obligingly moved closer, but kept a respectful distance from Li Rong.

“This is the sign of a breakthrough,” Lei Long said, eyes burning as he stared at Li Rong, confirming Yang Kai’s observation and guess.

Li Rong was currently at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, and had remained at that level for many years.

When Yang Kai had led the Ancient Demon Clan out of Mogu Castle and stepped onto the Tongxuan Continent, all the clan members had more or less gained some increase in strength.

Han Fei and Hua Mo had even broken through by a Stage because of it.

Back then Li Rong had also gained some strength, but not enough to push her through.

Now she clearly felt something; she was at last about to shatter the shackles that had bound her.

Once she broke through, she would enter the Third Stage of the Saint Realm — one of the highest tiers in this world.

When Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox realized this, both were visibly moved.

Yang Kai grinned, silently thrilled.

The stronger Li Rong became, the greater the help she could give him. Next time they encountered that woman Xueli, Yang Kai figured she wouldn’t be able to escape Li Rong’s grasp.

At Li Rong’s Second Stage she could wield Demon God Transformation to match Xueli; upon reaching the Third Stage she would be able to crush her utterly.

“I’ll trouble you all to wait here a while,” Yang Kai said, turning toward the two yao Great Lords.

“No problem — there’s nothing to find for now, so we’ll rest here,” Lei Long replied with a faint smile, then added thoughtfully, “But why would she breakthrough now? Did she discover something that benefits her growth?”

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox pondered for a moment and said, “These past days I’ve seen her staring at the sky constantly — could there be some secret in those passing lights?”

“The sky?” Lei Long lifted his head and stared upward; streaks of strange light flew across the firmament like meteors. Watching closely, he nodded after a moment. “That’s possible. At her level, a casual discovery can often cause a huge increase in strength.”

“Then this Old Ox will have a look too — maybe I’ll become even stronger, and when that happens, Lei Long, you’ll be bowing before me!” The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox brightened, immediately sat cross‑legged, and fixed his bovine eyes on the sky, unwilling to be outdone even for an instant.

Lei Long, the Great Lord, laughed silently. He didn’t stop him; instead he imitated the ox and sat down cross-legged to meditate on the secrets hidden in those lights.

If Li Rong could discover something, perhaps they could as well; since they were waiting, it made sense to try.

Caidie and Jin Ni also refused to be outdone and sat down.

Yang Kai shook his head and paid them no mind; he simply closed his eyes to rest.

Li Rong’s enlightenment lasted a long time. Yang Kai couldn’t measure the hours, but guessed it took at least ten days; during that time she remained rooted to the spot, gazing at the strange lights while her eyes grew ever brighter.

Finally her body trembled and a violent force burst forth, forming a sudden gale that spread from her position in a roaring sweep.

The aura of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm poured from Li Rong.

Massive energies gathered in the sky, forming terrifying heavenly might that descended upon Li Rong, who stood at the center.

A muffled groan escaped, but Li Rong did not budge; she endured that heavenly baptism with her mortal body.

Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox both grew extremely solemn.

They had both gone through this phase and knew how horrific and irresistible the heavenly might could be during such a breakthrough.

Back then they had both reverted to their true forms, using the hardened bodies of demonic beasts to resist the destructive force; even so they were gravely wounded and took a long time to recover.

Yet Li Rong, merely a woman, was doing something even more reckless than they had; the two Great Lords’ eyes nearly popped from their sockets.

The heavenly might continued to strike; blood welled at Li Rong’s mouth and her body trembled as if about to give out, but she ground her teeth and endured, using her flesh to absorb the heavenly power and turn it into potent nourishment.

Time passed, and the four yao watching were all tense; Caidie bit her thin lip and clenched her delicate hand, silently worrying for Li Rong.

“Kid, this won’t do…” Lei Long came close and whispered in Yang Kai’s ear, “If she keeps this up she may be destroyed by the heavenly might.”

“Indeed,” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox nodded. “Our yao bodies are the hardest of all. Even Lei Long and I wouldn’t dare absorb heavenly might so unguardedly. What she’s doing is digging her own grave.”

Li Rong made no attempt to resist the heavenly might; she opened herself completely to receive it, which made the two Great Lords quake with fear.

“Heh, don’t worry. She can endure it,” Yang Kai said lightly, showing not a trace of concern.

Lei Long looked at him in surprise, not understanding why Yang Kai had such confidence in Li Rong.

“If such a fine subordinate were to fall here, you’d have nothing but regret,” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox reminded him.

“She knows her limits,” Yang Kai shook his head and offered no further explanation.

Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox exchanged a glance and said no more, wearing puzzled expressions as they watched Li Rong to see how she would withstand the impending baptism.

As time went on, the heavenly might grew ever stronger; each strike made the world quake and Li Rong faltered, seeming at any moment as if she might die.

Yet she remained standing, unmoving.

The four yao were all moved; even setting everything else aside, the sheer will to face such heavenly power with her mortal body was enough to shock everyone.

The energies gathering in the sky calmed for a while, but their core grew increasingly ferocious, as if preparing a final, devastating blow.

Li Rong’s expression finally grew grave; her bright eyes fixed unblinking on the sky.

Boom…

The heavens rumbled as a world-shaking destructive force fell from above, enveloping Li Rong.

For an instant everyone’s hearts almost stopped as they focused on Li Rong’s position.

The slender figure still stood her ground; though trembling violently, she did not collapse.

Gradually the violence of the force abated, seemingly absorbed by Li Rong’s body; the swirling wind and flying debris quieted, and her bright eyes opened calmly, glinting with a strange light.

Li Rong stepped forward, breathing heavily, her chest heaving.

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox was speechless, staring dumbfounded at the woman who approached.

Lei Long, the Great Lord, also narrowed his eyes, his gaze fixed on Li Rong’s face.

Her pretty face was marked by dark, bizarre lines that formed an indistinct pattern; as she drew near those markings gradually faded and the torrent of power spilling from her subsided.

As if struck by a thought, Lei Long’s expression changed and he watched Li Rong with deep gravity.

Only when she reached the group did Li Rong halt and smile at Yang Kai.

Her aura now stretched wide as the sea; restrained brilliance shone in her clear eyes, her skin gleamed like jade with a tender radiance as if newly born, and her strength had undergone earth-shattering change.

“Master, I have reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm,” Li Rong reported calmly to Yang Kai.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded heavily. “This trip was not in vain.”

“Thank you all for waiting here so long,” Li Rong bowed slightly to the yao.

“It’s nothing, hardly worth mentioning,” Lei Long said, waving a hand. “We should congratulate you, madam, for stepping into this realm.”

Li Rong smiled modestly and said, “I will still need both Great Lords to instruct me in future.”

“Indeed. If you have time in the future, come to my Thundertree Palace and we can exchange insights,” Lei Long bowed slightly; now that Li Rong had reached the Third Stage, she and he were of the same tier and qualified to discuss cultivation methods.

“Ah, what a pity — I, Old Ox, sat here for so long and found nothing special, let alone enlightenment,” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox grumbled, shaking his head as if dissatisfied. Then he asked, “But you are formidable — absorbing heavenly might with your mortal body is the first I’ve seen. What were those patterns that crawled across your face? When they appeared it felt like your qi and blood surged greatly.”

Hearing the question, Li Rong looked toward Yang Kai, unsure how to answer.

Yang Kai hesitated, but before he could say anything Lei Long snapped, “Why pry into her secrets? Old Ox, you talk too much.”

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox gave an awkward chuckle. “I only asked casually; if she won’t say then she won’t. I was just curious.”
