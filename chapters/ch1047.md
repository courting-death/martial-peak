## Chapter 1047 — Soul Chain

Hearing Xue Yue’s words, Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You’re not really that naive, are you? If you take me for a three-year-old, you’ll be sorely disappointed. After everything I’ve done to you, can you really swallow your anger and pretend nothing happened? You’re the heir of the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s chairman, while I’m just a nobody. If I let you live, my days will be numbered. I’d rather take you now and let you cripple my cultivation or kill me than fall for your sweet words!”

"Sweet words?" Xue Yue snapped. "How could I, a woman, be one to speak sweet words? That's a man's specialty, isn't it?"

"I don't trust you anyway; whatever you say, I treat as nonsense!" Yang Kai snorted.

"Can you stop being so unreasonable?" Xue Yue's anger turned to a mocking laugh. "If I'm making this proposal, I have to show some sincerity. I promise I won't come after you later—no settling scores, understood?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted as he stared at her intently.

Truth be told, the two of them each had reasons to fear the other; neither could truly deal the final blow.

Xue Yue's cultivation was far higher than his, but her injuries were more severe and her recovery slower, which is why they were at an impasse.

But prolonging this was no solution; left to drag on, it would end in mutual destruction—an outcome neither wished to see.

Yang Kai refused to give up his cultivation for the sake of a woman's chastity, and Xue Yue was even more unwilling to be defiled by a man like him.

Suddenly he felt it might be worth hearing what Xue Yue had to say.

"Speak, I'm listening." Yang Kai nodded at her, though both his hands still gripped her jade peaks, refusing to relax for a moment.

"There isn't much enmity between us in the end. Fundamentally, it's just that you caught me during a transaction in the valley."

"Yes, and you killed more than two thousand people for it!" Yang Kai sneered. "You cruel venomous woman. How can I trust you?"

"Weren't you left unscathed?" Xue Yue countered. "Among those two thousand, was there anyone you cared about? Any connection to you?"

"No, there wasn't."

"Then shut up!" Xue Yue snorted coldly. "My proposal is this: you release me and I won't bother you. But you mustn't reveal that transaction or tell anyone about what happened here!"

As she spoke, her face flushed. Having just fought with Yang Kai, she set aside the humiliation she'd endured; speaking terms with him seemed to have stirred a woman's sense of shame within her.

Especially the heat from Yang Kai's palm pressing through her breasts into her body created unfamiliar sensations she had never felt before. She hurriedly drove away the shame, refusing to sink into passivity.

"How can you guarantee it?" Yang Kai asked calmly.

"I'll give you the proper guarantee. It won't be just words—if I merely said it, you probably wouldn't believe me!"

"Good to know."

Xue Yue drew a deep breath. Her full chest rose under Yang Kai's hand and her bright eyes flashed; she replied helplessly, "I have a secret treasure, forged by a master of the guild. It was prepared for me in times of danger. I'll let you have it."

"What secret treasure?" Yang Kai asked, curious.

"The Soul Chain!" Xue Yue gritted her teeth. "This treasure can bind the imprints of our souls and the traces of our lives together. If one of us dies, the other will die as well. Is that guarantee enough?"

"Live and die together?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he let out a mocking laugh. "Beauty, we're not that close yet, are we? Though we've been honest and close in flesh, isn't this taking things a bit fast? Besides, I'm a married man—actually two wives."

"Can you be serious and stop being so slick-tongued? Do you realize how annoying you are?" Xue Yue chided. "Do you think I'd willingly bind my life to yours? You, a Second Stage Saint Realm warrior—if you meet danger you might die. If we truly do this, I'd have to protect you all the time!"

Yang Kai's expression grew solemn as he felt her breathing and sensed the tremors of her soul.

After a long moment he said, "Should I trust you?"

"I've already compromised this far. If you don't trust me, then we'll have to fight to the death! That's not the ending you want, is it? We both have bright futures—who wants to die on this dead, lifeless rock?"

Yang Kai grinned. "Why do I feel your will to live is much stronger than mine..."

Xue Yue's pretty face sank and she fell silent.

"One more question: can the treasure's effect be undone? I don't want to be bound to you forever."

Even with Xue Yue’s usually steady temperament, she was nearly driven mad with anger by Yang Kai’s words.

Who doesn’t want to be tied to whom, exactly? It’s as if I’m the shameless one forcing myself on him! To be bound to me should be your damn privilege!

She scowled inwardly but said aloud, "It can be undone, but it requires both parties' willing consent. If either one refuses, the treasure's effect cannot be removed."

"That's fine." Yang Kai laughed, thought for a moment, then said low, "I trust you."

"So are we agreed?"

"Agreed."

"I'll take out the treasure; loosen your grip—you're strangling me." Xue Yue said softly and struggled a little.

Yang Kai's mind stirred and he slowly loosened his arms that bound her, though he did not drop his guard. Instead he pressed his mouth to Xue Yue's earlobe and breathed, "Don't try any tricks. If I use a little force, you'll be mine."

"I know!" Xue Yue ground her teeth and answered through clenched teeth.

Held by Yang Kai, one of her hands was still hooked at his abdomen, while the other—wearing a Spatial Ring—was raised to her lips. She poured Divine Sense into it; the Spatial Ring flashed and a chain-like secret treasure appeared on the ground.

"This thing?" Yang Kai's hands were quick as he snatched the treasure, causing Xue Yue to miss her grasp. "This treasure's function is curious. Why would your guild's master craft such a thing for you?"

“I told you—this is something I prepared for emergencies. If I run into an enemy I can’t defeat, I can use this Secret Treasure to bind their fate to mine; it’s my last resort for survival.”

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and poured Divine Sense into the treasure to probe it. He found unknown spirit formations etched within and a peculiar energy inside—an energy so strong it made his expression change.

There was no doubt: that surge of energy had been poured into it by an expert whose strength had reached the Void King Realm, containing the mysteries of that person's soul.

He understood at once: it was not the treasure itself that would take effect, but the divine art of that Void King Realm expert sealed within. The treasure was merely a vessel for imprisoning that art.

Realizing this, Yang Kai felt greatly reassured and said, "I don't trust you yet—tell me, how do you trigger the treasure's power?"

Xue Yue, annoyed, retorted, "Why are you so petty? Are you still a man?"

"Whether I'm a man or not—do you want to verify?" Yang Kai snorted.

"No need." Xue Yue was taken aback and hurriedly said, "Pour Divine Sense into it. Break the seal and that's all."

Yang Kai followed her instructions and poured Divine Sense into the treasure; its seal was not strong and was easily broken.

In the next moment an astonishing soul fluctuation burst forth from the treasure. A ring of purple radiance spread from it, enveloping both Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

The purple light penetrated everywhere, seeping into the pores of their skin, and was quickly absorbed by them.

Both involuntarily closed their eyes, feeling the effect of that soul energy; their bodies trembled slightly as an indescribable sensation rose in their hearts.

It seemed as if each had become part of the other, a mistaken sense of bloodline connection taking hold.

Xue Yue gave a soft moan.

That bewitching note startled Yang Kai into sudden clarity. His expression turned odd; he loosened his grip on Xue Yue's arm and no longer held so tightly. One hand still covered her breasts, freely kneading them, while the other moved down to stroke her waist and rest on her hips, feeling the full softness beneath his palm.

Xue Yue's voice grew stranger, her body twisting, her red lips nearly bleeding, and an unusual flush rose on her skin.

Yang Kai's rough hand rubbing her provoked involuntary shameful reactions.

She seemed less inclined to resist, as if to cooperate and let Yang Kai take his way.

Her brows knitted tightly with a line of resistance; then she bit her tongue hard. The pain shocked her awake. Like a frightened rabbit, she sprang from Yang Kai's arms, landing several zhang away. Both ashamed and furious, she glared at him and ground her teeth: "Shameless! You still want to take advantage of me—are you not satisfied yet?"

Yang Kai licked his lips, fingers still rubbing, feeling a bit wistful.

When Xue Yue leapt away, he couldn't help but feel a strong sense of loss.

"Why do I feel you've become a lot more amiable? And not as wary as before? Is this the effect of the divine art sealed in that treasure?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her.

"Yes!" Xue Yue crossed one arm over her chest to cover her breasts and placed the other hand over her lower body to block his gaze, pursing her lips. "Our soul imprints and life breaths are now linked. Whether we want it or not, we'll involuntarily feel a kindred closeness— in other words, we'll regard each other as someone important to ourselves!"

"So wondrous?" Yang Kai frowned.

"And one more thing—I find you not as detestable as before." Xue Yue said unwillingly.

Yang Kai grinned, wanting to laugh but afraid to further anger her; he held it back with difficulty.

"Turn around, I'm going to dress—no peeking!" Xue Yue commanded in a coquettish scold.

"I've held you, touched you—I'm familiar with every inch of you. What's a glance?" Yang Kai scoffed, unconcerned.

Enraged, Xue Yue crouched and picked up a handful of rubble, hurling it fiercely at Yang Kai. He immediately covered his head and fled.
