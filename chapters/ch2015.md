## Chapter 2015 — Mu Xiao's Calamity

That sudden abnormality made many of the martial artists who remained on the plaza look grim, but none dared show disrespect before the might of the two Emperor Realm experts.

For a moment they all began to speculate what, exactly, was going on.

At that moment, Xiao Yuyang and Gao Xueting, seated atop the high platform, exchanged a glance and rose together.

The next instant, two enormous Divine Senses, as tangible as solid matter, swept outward and enveloped the entire great plaza.

Almost everyone stiffened at that moment — after all, being scanned by the Divine Sense of two Emperor Realm experts was not comfortable; before such overwhelming Divine Senses, the secrets within one’s body seemed to be laid bare and about to be revealed.

But very quickly the two Divine Senses withdrew, allowing the crowd to breathe more easily.

"It seems quite a few people were infected," Xiao Yuyang said with a faint smile. He extended a hand and tapped toward the front; from his fingertip a streak of light suddenly shot forth.

The streak moved at incredible speed and in the blink of an eye arrived before a man in blue, striking straight toward his abdomen.

The blue-clad cultivator was of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and, seeing an Emperor Realm expert strike at him, turned pale and cried out, "Star Envoy, you…"

He could not comprehend why, as a mere Void King, he had provoked the Star Envoy of the Star God Palace to act against him personally.

Before he could finish speaking, the streak struck his abdomen; the blue-clad man gave a muffled groan as if struck by tremendous force and was sent flying, collapsing into the crowd.

At the same time, a streak flew from his back, its light appearing to encase something.

The onlookers peered closely and were startled to find that the thing was an oval, cyan seed.

With a soft snapping sound the streak burst apart and the seed disintegrated into dust.

From within the seed came faint, sharp cries.

Seeing this, everyone’s faces changed; it was clear that something abnormal had been inside the blue-clad man, and Xiao Yuyang had struck to purge that abnormality.

Turning back to look, the blue-clad man who had been pierced by mysterious light now looked pale, as if his Yuan Qi had been grievously wounded, yet he staggered to his feet — he was not at death’s door.

Xiao Yuyang did not look at him; a mocking, world-weary sneer hung at the corner of his mouth as his fingers flicked.

One streak after another of the same kind flashed out, each shooting toward different cultivators in the crowd.

Simultaneously, Gao Xueting also moved.

The young woman performed solemn hand seals, producing rows of rune-like patterns that then split into many small net-like formations and flew out in all directions.

The little nets, as if possessing their own spirit, quickly found targets and veiled one cultivator after another.

Those enveloped by the nets all gave muffled groans as the nets seemed to pass through an invisible thing and emerge from their backs; within those nets, however, many cyan seeds appeared.

With another seal the young woman caused the nets to explode, and the seeds trapped within were shattered as well.

"What is that?" someone cried in terror and stepped back.

Although the two Emperor Realm experts had no intention of killing, after seeing such strange seeds inside nearby cultivators the remaining people were filled with dread.

Then, from all directions of the plaza, there rose piercing screams.

Immediately after came a surge of violent power.

From among the crowd, strange, tree-like forms sprang up; at first glance they did not differ from trees, but they radiated an extremely evil aura, and embedded in the center of their trunks were human faces.

Yang Kai himself flinched in fright.

He watched with his own eyes as a cultivator beside him underwent a terrifying transformation in a very short time.

This cultivator had been chatting and laughing with his companions about entering the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, his face full of excitement, when he suddenly writhed in excruciating pain.

At the same time, a cyan light shone from his abdomen, his skin split and blood flowed, and something else seemed to be clawing its way out from his flesh.

In the space of a blink, the cultivator had become a tree-like thing with his face embedded dead center in the trunk, his expression contorted as he struggled and howled before going still.

Hissss……

From inside that tree shot forth cyan vines that lashed and prodded crazily in all directions.

Several nearby cultivators were caught unawares; one was pierced through his body by a vine, and from within the vine came a gurgling sound as if something were being devoured, while the pierced cultivator’s flesh quickly withered away.

"Mu Xiao!" Yang Kai shouted in alarm.

This scene was so familiar — it was exactly the Mu Xiao he had encountered on the second floor of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

He had never imagined he would see such a thing again on the plaza in Fenglin City.

As he shouted, Yang Kai retreated rapidly and unleashed the fire sword qi of the Undying Five Elements Sword, cleaving down toward the vine that had struck him.

With a thud the burning sword severed the vine’s barbed tip, and Yang Kai used that force to drift back.

By then many cultivators had recognized the culprit of this aberration, and the name Mu Xiao spread across the plaza.

"Channel your strength into resisting; do not let the wood seeds enter your bodies, or your fate will be the same!" Xiao Yuyang’s furious shout rang out from the high platform.

Yang Kai understood at once and hurriedly circulated his power, surrounding himself to avoid being infected.

Others who reacted quickly did the same; those who were slower either escaped by luck or were not so fortunate and had the tiny wood seeds invade their bodies, becoming Mu Xiao’s thralls in a short time.

On the high platform, Xiao Yuyang snorted coldly as violent power surged from his body; he pointed and killed several Mu Xiao duplicates instantly from afar.

Gao Xueting was also formidable; seeing the situation getting out of control, she cut through those Mu Xiao duplicates without mercy.

At the same time, the other four Emperor Realm experts throughout Fenglin City were doing the same.

When many cultivators had returned from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda to the plaza earlier, a number left immediately. Among them were those whose bodies had already been invaded by the wood seeds — now they revealed their true forms.

In an instant, the six Emperor Realm experts cut down those Mu Xiao duplicates as if slicing through melons.

The cultivators of Fenglin City, realizing how troublesome Mu Xiao was, also unleashed their power to protect themselves.

For a time the whole of Fenglin City was plunged into chaotic combat; overall, however, the situation was clear — these Mu Xiao duplicates were not individually very strong; their danger lay in a strange method: the wood seeds could silently invade bodies.

Yet if cultivators were prepared, the chance of invasion dropped greatly.

With many cultivators working together, the Mu Xiao threat seemed to be quickly resolved.

Half a day later, Mu Xiao duplicates lay dead across Fenglin City — these corpses had once been the city’s cultivators, but after being invaded by the wood seeds they had become other things.

To ensure the threat was fully rooted out, the six Emperor Realm experts split up and patrolled the city.

As they did, they indeed found some concealed wood seeds.

This situation continued for two full days before the chaos in Fenglin City gradually calmed.

During those two days thousands of Fenglin City’s cultivators had died, which showed how terrifying Mu Xiao was — it did not even need to strike personally; merely spreading its wood seeds was enough.

If the thing were allowed to mature, the whole of Fenglin City would likely be devastated.

Yang Kai finally understood the terror of that creature and felt Mo Xiaoqi’s warning that an Emperor Realm expert had once fallen to Mu Xiao might not have been baseless.

Over those two days he had actively joined the others in hunting and slaying Mu Xiao duplicates; since all the city’s cultivators were doing so, if he had not, he would have been treated as an outsider and distrusted.

During the process, Mo Xiaoqi and Kang Siran repeatedly asked after his safety; once they learned he was fine, they relaxed.

Once everything had settled, Yang Kai visited the Pill Shop and met Kang Siran to arrange a time to refine pills, then strolled back toward the cave dwelling he rented.

He needed to properly sort out the gains he had won from entering the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda this time.

Meanwhile, within the city lord’s mansion.

The six Emperor Realm experts gathered together, with Duan Yuanshan still standing in the lower place.

Several of the Emperor Realm experts no longer looked as relaxed as before; instead, they were somewhat grave.

"Sirs, has Mu Xiao truly been eradicated?" Duan Yuanshan asked hesitantly after a long moment.

Having personally slain two of his own confidants earlier, he fully understood how difficult Mu Xiao was to eliminate, and his mood was heavy.

"If I were to say it has been completely eradicated, you surely would not believe me," Xiao Yuyang said, glancing up at him.

"You mean…" Duan Yuanshan’s face changed.

Xiao Yuyang sighed. "Mu Xiao comes in many varieties with differing innate abilities; this particular Mu Xiao exceeded my expectations. I cannot guarantee it is truly gone from the world — perhaps there are hidden wood seeds we have not detected."

Duan Yuanshan’s expression turned horrified. "With the methods you possess, you still cannot be certain?"

Gao Xueting said, "We cannot be certain, unless you gather all the cultivators of Fenglin City together and let us inspect them one by one with Divine Sense; only then could we be sure."

"How could I trouble six of you to mobilize so many people?" Duan Yuanshan exclaimed in alarm and hastily apologized.
