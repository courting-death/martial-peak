## Chapter 1190 — Stalactite Cave

It took Yang Kai some time to pinpoint the location; fortunately the place where the Soul Cleansing Divine Water was detected wasn't too far from his position, otherwise the Communication Compass would have had no response.

When Yang Kai finally arrived, he was shocked to find it was a stalactite cave — its mouth black and deep, a veil of mist drifting within so that the interior could not be seen with the naked eye, and his Divine Sense could not extend far.

Soul Cleansing Divine Water in a place like this?

No sooner had Yang Kai set foot here than a party of three rapidly approached from the side.

Yang Kai cast a casual glance and was astonished, for among the three, two wore the exact same robes as the cultivators who had fought him over the Cuiluo Grass — meaning these three belonged to the same force as those two.

Yang Kai kept his guard and immediately understood which force they were from.

It turned out to be the Battle Sky Alliance!

The leader of the three was none other than the notorious Qu Changfeng!

The Battle Sky Alliance's entrance into the Flowing Flame Sandland wasn't at the same place as Yingyue Hall's. When Yang Kai had gone through the Heat-Flame Zone earlier, he hadn't encountered Battle Sky Alliance members, but once inside the heaven-and-earth treasure area, encounters began to happen — the deeper into the Flowing Flame Sandland one went, the less space there was to operate.

Qu Changfeng's face brimmed with excitement and exultation as he and his two disciples approached with lightning speed, clearly having received a Divine Sense dispatch and eager to investigate.

The Soul Cleansing Divine Water drew everyone like a magnet; it helped not only Saint King Realm cultivators, but could even benefit those of the Origin Returning and Void King Realms — though only Saint King Realm level could enter the Flowing Flame Sandland. Otherwise such a treasure wouldn't fall to Saint King Realm cultivators.

Qu Changfeng, concerned about the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, did not seem intent on troubling Yang Kai; he merely glanced at him before charging into the stalactite cave.

After his figure vanished, a few more cultivators arrived from different directions.

Seeing this, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and followed Qu Changfeng into the cave.

The treasure was right before them; quick hands would get it, slow hands wouldn't — Yang Kai wasn't about to fall behind.

Countless cone-shaped stalactites hung from the cave ceiling, pale and powdery, and the cavern air was clear. The Spiritual Qi was extremely dense, as if a spiritual source hid within the cave.

Yang Kai nodded inwardly — one of the necessary conditions for the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's birth was met here; the Spiritual Qi was indeed thick, and that was only at the fringes. Deeper inside it would be even more concentrated.

The cave was silent save for water droplets falling from above, pattering softly.

Yang Kai pressed on. The farther he went the denser the Spiritual Qi became; after winding through the cave for the length of an incense stick, he burst into a vast stone chamber.

Yang Kai's expression froze when he looked about.

Quite a number of people had gathered in the chamber — no fewer than twenty. Qu Changfeng stood among them, eyes greedily fixed on a spot, and five Saint King Realm cultivators surrounded him like satellites; these were clearly Battle Sky Alliance members.

Aside from the six from Battle Sky Alliance, the remaining dozen or so had formed four small groups, each with only three to five people.

There was even a lone cultivator with a face like it had been carved by a knife and a resolute expression, standing alone like Yang Kai, appearing isolated and solitary.

Yet the moment Yang Kai saw him a strange sense of danger washed over him — this fellow's strength was not weak; he had the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Yang Kai had a habit of killing above his rank and had slain several at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm before; ordinary Third Stage opponents didn't make him uneasy. If this one did, it meant the man was formidable.

Facing Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong, Yang Kai hadn't felt this way. Who was this man?

Sure enough, when Qu Changfeng withdrew his greedy gaze and saw the man, his brows tightened; a glint of apprehension and annoyance flashed in his eyes.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

He had known Qu Changfeng's arrogance and disregard for others, and he held Fang Tianzhong in contempt — yet this knife-faced, resolute man could provoke such a reaction from Qu Changfeng. What was his background?

Just as he pondered this, Qu Changfeng suddenly turned his gaze toward Yang Kai, a flash of anger passing through his eyes as if mocking Yang Kai for overreaching — daring to enter alone at Saint King Realm First Stage. By nature he would clear the place and Yang Kai would be his primary target; who wouldn't want such a treasure to themselves. Yet for some reason the anger and resentment slowly receded.

Seeing he had no intention of troubling him, Yang Kai directed his gaze forward to see whether the Soul Cleansing Divine Water truly existed.

Where everyone's gazes converged was a pool roughly twenty zhang across. Its waters overflowed with golden liquid, thick and saturated with a soul-cleansing charm; those standing beside it, upon being bathed in this aura, felt their minds clear and several displayed looks of joy and contemplation — evidently their Divine Sense cultivation had just advanced.

So it really was the Soul Cleansing Divine Water? Yang Kai's brow twitched.

Feeling the pool's power, Yang Kai could immediately confirm this was indeed the legendary Soul Cleansing Divine Water. What puzzled him was why it was golden.

Zong Ao's records stated Soul Cleansing Divine Water was usually milky white; if of sufficient quality and old enough, it might turn silver.

The record never mentioned golden Soul Cleansing Divine Water — it seemed no one had seen such a thing. Could this one be even better than the silver variety?

Could there be something wrong? Yang Kai frowned and pondered, occasionally casting looks at the others to see if any understood.

He was soon disappointed. The cultivators here showed only two expressions: desire for the Soul Cleansing Divine Water or fear of Qu Changfeng. Only that knife-faced Third Stage Saint King Realm man remained calm and impassive.

These people clearly knew little about the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, so trying to glean information from them would be futile.

The treasure was in front of them and nobody was unmoved, but the reason no one rushed into the pool was because a golden formation hovered above it like a semicircular dome, covering the water.

Evidently someone had tested the barrier's power; until it was broken no one could enter the pool.

On the other side of the pool sat a set of bones in the lotus position, long dead — even the secret treasure resembling a piece of armor on the corpse had gone dull and tattered.

There was no Spatial Ring on him; whether it had been taken earlier or never existed was unknown.

This man had certainly died at the Void King Realm; only the Divine Sense of a Void King Realm expert dispersing upon death could combine with the spring here to produce Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

All who looked upon the bones wore looks of regret, for armor worn by a Void King Realm warrior would be of high grade, possibly superior even to the finest secret treasures of Dark Star.

But the armor was clearly ruined beyond use; nobody knew how long ago this Void King Realm expert had died here.

After Yang Kai entered, another dozen or so rushed in, obviously having received the news. Qu Changfeng's face darkened; he was displeased that so many had come to contest the treasure.

Yet there was nothing he could do. There were already seven or eight forces gathered here; however mighty the Battle Sky Alliance, Qu Changfeng could not offend so many, and besides, only eight cultivators now stood by him — not enough to take on everyone present.

"Where are Junior Brother Fu and Junior Brother Liu? They should be nearby and ought to have received the dispatch already," quivered a thin man beside Qu Changfeng, glancing toward the cave entrance now and then. Though their power might not be great, their arrival would bolster Battle Sky Alliance's side and secure more benefit when the spoils were divided. But they had not come, and the dispatch had gone unanswered.

"If they haven't come by now, they won't be coming," Qu Changfeng snorted coldly.

The thin man's face changed; he heard an unspoken meaning in Qu Changfeng's words. If they could have come they would have; their absence now suggested they might have met with misfortune.

The heaven-and-earth treasure area was hardly safe; many dangers lurked within.

Little did they know that Fu and Liu had met their ends — one slain by Yang Kai, the other struck down by the Silver-Horn Electric Python's lightning and whiptail — and thus could never arrive.

As more people poured in, those who had arrived earlier could no longer sit idly by; if they waited the spoils would be much smaller.

From one five-man group a man in a cyan robe resembling a scholar stepped forward, clasped his hands toward Qu Changfeng and said politely, "Young Master Qu, what do you think we should do now? Should we take action?"

He spoke with deference, acting as if Qu Changfeng's word were law, for he knew better than anyone that Qu Changfeng was the top genius here and likely the strongest among those present; any handling of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water must first seek his opinion.

Acting rashly would only earn everyone's enmity.

The present situation required everyone to discuss a plan together and fairly divide the benefits.
