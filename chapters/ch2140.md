## Chapter 2140 — Ultimatum

Normally, when ordinary martial artists encounter a sea of Spiritual Qi, they can only look on in envy. They would never waste their precious time lingering here to cultivate with this abundant Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai would not do so either.

But he had the Xuan Realm Pearl!

Although the Spiritual Qi inside the Xuan Realm Pearl wasn't exactly meagre, the difference compared to this place was still vast. As long as he used the Xuan Realm Pearl to absorb the Spiritual Qi here, the cultivation environment inside the Small Xuan Realm should improve somewhat.

It was a sudden idea of Yang Kai’s. After all, the last time in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda the Xuan Realm Pearl had absorbed a large amount of broken Law Power. Since it could even absorb Law Power, there was no reason it could not take in Spiritual Qi as well.

And sure enough, it worked.

A massive wind eye condensed directly on the surface of the Xuan Realm Pearl. As it spun and pulled, all the surrounding Spiritual Qi was sucked into this Imperial Treasure, filling the Small Xuan Realm within.

Yang Kai was overjoyed.

The success of this experiment meant that, in the future, he could raise the cultivation environment of the Small Xuan Realm to rival the best blessed lands and paradises of the Star Realm—of course, provided he could find more places like this Sea of Spiritual Qi.

He handed the Xuan Realm Pearl to Liu Yan, letting her hold this Imperial Treasure while watching over Zhang Ruoxi.

Liu Yan understood at once, silently taking it and withdrawing a little distance so the commotion from the Xuan Realm Pearl would not disturb Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation.

Only then did he tilt his head at Hua Qingsi, signaling her to step aside for a word.

Hua Qingsi snapped, “Am I your pet? Do you think you can order me around as you please?”

Yang Kai said, “If you don’t want to, then forget it. Just go back and wait.”

“Fine, fine, fine... You’ve got nerve, you really do!” Hua Qingsi was so angry that smoke seemed to rise from her head, her Qi and blood surging, but she had no choice but to swallow her indignation for now…

Leading Hua Qingsi a short distance away, Yang Kai made sure they would not disturb Zhang Ruoxi. Then, while scanning the surroundings, he asked, “So, have you thought over what I mentioned to you before?”

“What are you talking about?” Hua Qingsi replied absentmindedly, all the while looking for a chance to launch a sneak attack.

What she couldn't understand was that Yang Kai—a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator—had his back to her the whole time. His stance left him wide open, as if he didn't care about her at all. Combined with his earlier arrogance and confident air, Hua Qingsi couldn't help but feel conflicted.

She did not know what would happen if she really tried to ambush him!

She'd had enough of being imprisoned in the Small Xuan Realm. If she were locked up again, she would go mad.

“Playing dumb?” Yang Kai stopped and glanced back at her.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Hua Qingsi put on a look of utter indifference.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Let me explain. I just think it’s a bit inhumane to keep you locked up in there all the time. After all, we have no real grudge between us…”

“You’re actually so reasonable?” Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes lit up, gazing at Yang Kai with hope. “If that’s the case, then—”

“Keep dreaming!” Yang Kai snorted, turning away and continuing forward. “But you know my greatest secret now, so if I don’t have a way to restrain you, I can’t rest easy letting you out. This time is an exception. Next time, you won’t be so lucky. If you really don’t want to offer up your Soul Brand, then be ready to spend the rest of your life locked inside.”

Hua Qingsi’s pretty face changed. After a moment of silence, she said, “Would you give your Soul Brand to someone you barely know, letting them control your life and death?”

“Of course not!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Exactly. If you wouldn’t, why should I?”

“Because... I’m stronger than you!” Yang Kai answered as if it were obvious.

Hua Qingsi’s mouth twitched. “A mere First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm dares to say that to me? Where do you get your confidence?”

“No need to test me. If you really thought you could beat me, you’d have made your move already. Why keep probing me?” Yang Kai sneered, turning again. His gaze grew cold and emotionless as he looked at Hua Qingsi. “My patience is limited. You must give me an answer now. If you won’t offer your Soul Brand, then be prepared to endure endless imprisonment! In your lifetime, I won’t give you another chance!”

Seeing how serious he was, Hua Qingsi’s heart sank. She realized that, faced with Yang Kai’s final ultimatum, she could no longer muddle through.

She bit her lip, opening and closing her mouth as if she wanted to speak but didn't know where to begin.

Yang Kai said, “The only reason I didn’t force you last time was to give you time to think it over. I figured... you should have made up your mind by now. It’s just a choice—how hard can it be?”

“You’re right, I’ve thought it through!” Hua Qingsi replied, lips pressed together.

“Oh? So your answer is…” Yang Kai looked her up and down with interest.

Hua Qingsi gritted her teeth. “If I offer you my Soul Brand... Damn it, can you stop showing that scheming smile? It makes me feel like I’m being tricked!”

“Go on!” Yang Kai replied seriously, quickly wiping the expression from his face.

“Will you make me do things that put my life in danger?” Hua Qingsi asked sharply.

“I’ve always been generous to my people. If something is truly dangerous, I’ll do it myself!”

As Yang Kai answered, Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes never left his, as if searching for any sign of a lie. But to her surprise, Yang Kai’s gaze was calm, meeting hers without the slightest evasion.

Hua Qingsi nodded. “I need to have my own secrets. You must not pry into them, nor can you order me to do anything against my will or conscience!”

“Fine!” Yang Kai agreed readily, leaving Hua Qingsi momentarily stunned—she had not expected him to be so easygoing.

“Will you treat me well in the future?” Hua Qingsi pressed.

Yang Kai pulled a strange face. “Are you planning to marry me? That’s the kind of question a shy bride would ask…”

Hua Qingsi flew into a rage. “You’re overthinking it! Shameless!”

Yang Kai laughed. “My answer is... even if I raised a dog—”

Before he could finish, Hua Qingsi’s delicate fist shot toward his face. Yang Kai raised a hand to block, then continued, “I’d treat it well, let alone a person like you!”

Hua Qingsi ground her teeth so hard they almost cracked. Suddenly, she leapt back several steps, Origin Qi surging around her as she shouted, “One last question! If you want me to offer my Soul Brand, you must have strength I can acknowledge. Though I don’t think I can beat you, everything must be tried!”

As she spoke, her slender hand flicked, summoning her Secret Treasure. The ribbon unfurled in the wind, instantly transforming into a rainbow bridge that spanned north to south, carrying destructive power as it swept toward Yang Kai.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Yang Kai stood unmoving, his voice cold. “Once you witness my methods, you’ll have no chance to refuse!”

Hua Qingsi did not answer. Her hand seals changed, and the rainbow bridge instantly condensed into a rope, binding Yang Kai up like a zongzi, even covering his mouth and nose.

“Huh?” Hua Qingsi was stunned. She had not expected Yang Kai to be dealt with so easily.

If that was really the case…

Her delight had barely surfaced when Yang Kai suddenly snorted coldly. “Looks like you’re prepared!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly became illusory, as if he had vanished from this space. The ribbon binding him loosened and fell away.

Secret Art, Nothingness!

Once this move was used, Yang Kai could slip into a spatial crack, evading otherwise unavoidable killing blows. He could also use the Nothingness technique to hide his presence and gather intelligence.

“How can this be?” Hua Qingsi’s pretty face changed.

“Never seen a spatial secret technique?” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came from the other side, eerily.

Hua Qingsi’s expression changed again. She turned to see Yang Kai floating there, completely unharmed, looking at her with a mocking smile.

“Spatial secret technique!” Hua Qingsi cried, her beautiful eyes full of disbelief.

“Moon Blade!” Yang Kai raised his hand, and dozens of pitch-black, crescent-shaped spatial cracks formed, slashing toward Hua Qingsi with a whoosh.

Sensing the terrifying lethality hidden in that mysterious attack, Hua Qingsi dared not be careless. She cried out, “Butterflies Dance in Profusion!”

Her graceful body spun, and multicolored light burst forth, transforming into countless brilliant butterflies that flew forward to intercept.

Boom, boom, boom…

The Moon Blades collided with the butterflies, producing violent explosions. Energy surged, and Spiritual Qi was thrown into chaos.

"Chasing Star Arrows!" When her first move failed, Hua Qingsi immediately unleashed another secret technique from the Star God Palace.

After all, she hailed from the Star God Palace, the overlord sect of the Southern Territory, and possessed the formidable cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Hua Qingsi was no ordinary opponent—her combat experience, strength, and adaptability were all first-rate.

As soon as the secret technique was activated, starlight appeared on Hua Qingsi’s body, gathering into arrows. With a slight tremor, they pierced through the void, arriving before Yang Kai in an instant, aiming to bore through his skull.

“Petty tricks!” Yang Kai snorted, Law Power swirling around his hand. He grabbed the Chasing Star Arrow and crushed it to dust with a squeeze.

Hua Qingsi’s heart thudded violently, as if Yang Kai had crushed her own heart rather than the arrow. She cried out in shock, “You… how can you do that?”

Yang Kai grinned savagely, boasting, “The three thousand Great Daos, the myriad secret techniques, are nothing more than the combination of Spiritual Qi and the Laws of heaven and earth. Your secret technique only borrows the Laws; it doesn't truly mobilize them. Once you see through the flow of the Law, breaking it is easy!”

Cold sweat beaded on Hua Qingsi’s forehead.

She was already at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, just a step away from the Emperor Realm. The Star God Palace she came from was no minor sect, yet she had never heard such an outrageous theory before.

Yet it was precisely this absurd statement that gave her a great deal of insight and inspiration.

Her brows furrowed as she abruptly stopped and stood in place, lost in thought.
