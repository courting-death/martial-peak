## Chapter 2581 — Heaven’s Will

Seeing that Yang Kai’s expression was unpleasant, the Elder and Mu Na exchanged a glance, then bowed together and pleaded, “Honored guest, please lend our two tribes a helping hand!”

Yang Kai stepped aside and said indifferently, “Are you two trying to force me into something unreasonable?”

The Elder shook his head. “Not at all. We are merely following Heaven’s will.”

“Heaven’s will?” Yang Kai sneered. “What Heaven’s will?”

The Elder smiled faintly, stepped aside, and pointed at the cave wall. “Honored guest, please look.”

Mu Na also waved her hand, and a stream of colorful light suddenly shot out, illuminating the entire cave wall. The flowing light hovered over a certain spot, slowly swirling. As the light shone, Yang Kai suddenly noticed that several extremely ancient drawings appeared on the wall.

In the first drawing, a person sat cross-legged with a stone on their knees. The person extended a finger, and a drop of blood dripped from the fingertip onto the stone. Strangely, the blood was not crimson, but a bizarre golden color.

Yang Kai was stunned. Before he could see clearly, his gaze was involuntarily drawn to the second drawing as the light moved.

In the second drawing, the person was still sitting cross-legged, but now there was a small figure nearby, hunched over on all fours like a monkey, bouncing around and chasing fluttering butterflies.

Both drawings were outlined with the simplest lines, looking extremely rough, yet vividly expressing their intended meaning.

Was that Xiaoxiao and himself? Yang Kai’s mind went blank, hardly able to believe his eyes. That small figure was clearly Xiaoxiao, and the one whose fingertip dripped golden blood—who else could it be but himself?

But... these drawings were clearly mottled with age, extremely ancient, at least several hundred or even a thousand years old. How could they depict him?

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of unreality.

Looking at the third drawing, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. In that scene, he and Xiaoxiao were fighting side by side. Xiaoxiao, wielding the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, was depicted with great power and lifelike detail.

The fourth drawing seemed to be in a passage filled with starlight. Space was shattered, and Xiaoxiao was being sucked into a spatial rift, with only one hand still visible, as if trying to grab something.

This was the encounter when they first entered the Star Realm, in the Starlight Passage!

The fifth drawing showed nine stone figures like Xiaoxiao resting in a primeval, dense forest, surrounded by many smaller wood spirits fluttering about.

The sixth drawing showed the person from the beginning finding the small figure again after a long separation. Overjoyed, they gathered around a bright bonfire, with many Stone Spirits and wood spirits singing and dancing—perfectly mirroring tonight’s events.

The seventh drawing depicted a blood-red, oval-shaped gate, with countless strange creatures fighting and dying around it.

In the eighth drawing, the small figure soared across the sky, and with the help of the human, charged into the blood-red gate, disappearing from sight.

The ninth drawing showed nothing but the blood-red gate—nothing else, leaving a great mystery.

There were nine drawings in total, branded on the tree wall. Though simply outlined, they were vivid and lifelike.

After finishing, Yang Kai’s mind was in turmoil. After a while, he looked up and asked, “What does this mean?”

The Elder said, “The Wood Spirit Race is not skilled in combat, but we possess many unique abilities. The previous Wood Spirit chief was adept at divination. Before her death, she sensed that our two tribes would face annihilation at some point in the future. At the cost of her life, she performed a divination and left these nine drawings to guide us.”

Mu Na sighed. “It’s been over a thousand years. The Elder and I have pondered the meaning of these nine drawings all this time, but never understood them—until Shi Jiu suddenly returned from the outside and confirmed the content of the fifth drawing. Only then did we realize that the hope of our tribes does not lie within ourselves, but in Shi Jiu, and in you, honored guest.”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “Just based on these nine drawings? You’re going to risk the lives of everyone in your tribes?”

The Elder shook his head solemnly. “This is Heaven’s will, a revelation, not a gamble! Honored guest, we have waited for you for a long time!”

Yang Kai was taken aback. He’d heard the Elder mention this earlier today, and had thought it was because of Xiaoxiao, but it turned out the Elder had another reason.

Inside the tree cave, the Elder and Mu Na stared at Yang Kai with burning, hopeful eyes.

Yang Kai sighed. “Even if this is a revelation left by the previous Wood Spirit chief, it doesn’t guarantee success.” Pointing at the ninth drawing, he said, “There’s nothing here.”

Mu Na replied solemnly, “I believe the previous chief would not leave a revelation without purpose. If this were a dead end, she would not have left it. Since she did, it must be the right path.”

“Honored guest...” the Elder began again.

Before he could finish, Yang Kai waved his hand to interrupt. “This matter is too important. I need to think about it. You two don’t need to say more.”

With that, Yang Kai turned and left the tree cave, ignoring the two. Outside, the celebration was still lively. The wood spirits and Stone Spirits were singing and laughing together. Ruoxi was pulled into the dance by a group of wood spirits, her graceful movements drawing applause, while several Stone Spirits stared with bulging eyes.

Xiaoxiao was also dancing wildly, though his moves were hardly praiseworthy.

Yang Kai didn’t disturb them. With a flicker, he returned to Xiaoxiao’s treehouse and sat down cross-legged.

Seeing him disappear, the Elder sighed softly, seemingly regretful at not persuading Yang Kai on the spot.

Mu Na glanced at the nine drawings, then waved her hand. As the light flashed, the ninth drawing completely changed. The blood-red gate remained, but now there was a gigantic Stone Giant, imposing and peerless, carrying a pitch-black giant club on its shoulder—clearly Xiaoxiao’s identity.

Mu Na said, “If it looked like this, would he have agreed just now?”

The Elder replied, “A revelation only points the way, not the result. If it were like this, he’d become suspicious. He’s no fool. The way it was is just right.”

Mu Na nodded in agreement, then waved her hand again, restoring the ninth drawing to its original state.

The Elder let out a heavy sigh. “It was wrong of us to join forces and deceive him, but we truly have no other way. If we want to succeed, we must seek help—and naturally, we have to give him time to consider.”

Mu Na said, “The Elder is right.”

The two chiefs had truly racked their brains. Yang Kai would never have guessed that these two seemingly venerable figures would join forces to deceive him, and that the nine drawings on the tree wall were just something Mu Na had casually created—not a revelation left by the previous Wood Spirit chief at all.

If Yang Kai ever found out, he’d make sure to beat them both until their faces were swollen like pig heads.

Sitting cross-legged in the tree cave, Yang Kai was deeply conflicted. In his view, the best choice was to take both tribes and leave this place of trouble. If that wasn’t possible, he could at least take Xiaoxiao away.

But the Elder’s words about being unable to leave their homeland dashed his hopes. Forcibly taking Xiaoxiao away was possible, but doing so would make Xiaoxiao lose the chance to become the Divine Spirit Tai Yue.

On one hand, there was the chance for Xiaoxiao to become a Divine Spirit; on the other, there was enormous risk. Yang Kai was torn.

In the end, it still depended on Xiaoxiao’s own wishes.

At dawn, the festivities finally quieted down. The wood spirits disappeared into the forest, and the Stone Spirits returned to their treehouses.

Ruoxi and Xiaoxiao came back together. Seeing Yang Kai sitting cross-legged, Ruoxi couldn’t help but stick out her tongue. She’d played so wildly last night that she hadn’t even noticed when her master disappeared.

“Xiaoxiao, come here!” Yang Kai beckoned to Xiaoxiao.

Xiaoxiao immediately bounced over, looking at him curiously, not knowing what Yang Kai wanted.

Yang Kai reached out, took Xiaoxiao’s hand, and sent his Divine Sense to communicate.

After a while, Yang Kai sighed. “You’ve really decided?”

As expected, Xiaoxiao had indeed decided to enter the Blood Gate. The Elder had already explained all the pros and cons to him in detail, without the slightest hint of coercion.

Xiaoxiao straightened up, pounding his fists on his chest, showing a stance of strength and fearlessness.

Yang Kai shook his head with a bitter smile. After a long silence, he finally said, “Go tell the Elder—I agree to his request.”

Xiaoxiao was stunned, clearly not understanding, but obediently ran out.

“Sir, did something happen?” Ruoxi asked anxiously, seeing Yang Kai’s troubled expression.

Yang Kai frowned, but didn’t hide it. “The Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Races want to send Xiaoxiao into the Blood Gate to inherit the Divine Spirit’s Origin Power. I’m a bit worried.”

“Ah.” Ruoxi covered her mouth in shock. “Entering the Blood Gate, but right now…”

“Yes, it’s very difficult. If I don’t help, they definitely can’t break through the defenses around the Blood Gate. Even with my help, there’s no guarantee of success.”

“Then why did Sir still agree?”

Yang Kai said, “I’ll do everything I can and leave the rest to fate. If things truly go wrong, I’m still confident I can get everyone out safely.”

Ruoxi’s eyes flickered. She bit her lip and said, “Then I want to help too.”

Yang Kai glared at her. “No. If we really go to the Blood Gate this time, it’ll be very dangerous. Your strength… isn’t enough. Just stay put.”

Zhang Ruoxi looked aggrieved, but didn’t dare go against Yang Kai’s wishes. She could only reply softly, “Understood.”

Yang Kai glanced at her and said gently, “I brought you out of the Zhang Family, so it’s my responsibility to keep you safe. When you become an Emperor, you can join in on things like this.”

“Yes, Sir…” Ruoxi replied, her voice tinged with disappointment.
