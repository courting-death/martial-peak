## Chapter 2456 — Shura Earth Fiend

Yin Lesheng had thought someone as cunning as Yang Kai would never accept his challenge. He planned to humiliate Yang Kai thoroughly and vent his anger, but unexpectedly, Yang Kai agreed without hesitation.

This made him gloat inwardly.

In a direct confrontation, he wasn’t sure if he could defeat Yang Kai, but he still had a trump card. Once he used it, Yang Kai would surely die.

He secretly resolved that when the fight began, he would immediately unleash his trump card, giving Yang Kai no chance to resist.

As his thoughts raced, Yang Kai suddenly pointed at the group of dozens nearby and said, “Since Brother Yin enjoys one-on-one duels so much, why not challenge this group of friends instead? I’m sure they’ll be happy to play with you.”

Yin Lesheng was dumbfounded by these words.

The dozens of cultivators were also stunned.

Lan He was equally taken aback.

Chang Hao’s face turned cold as he said in a deep voice, “Yang Kai, don’t go too far. We’ve already handed over our Spatial Rings. What more do you want?”

“That’s right, your grudge with Yin Lesheng is your own business. Why drag us into it?” Chang Xian also shouted, his voice tense. “We absolutely won’t help you.”

“Yeah, don’t take us for fools.”

The group immediately began clamoring, all criticizing him at once.

Yin Lesheng sneered, "If you don't have the guts to fight me, Yang, just say so. No one's mocking you. Why beat around the bush?"

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Brother Yin, you’re the Netherworld Sect Master’s personal disciple from the Eastern Territory, while I’m just a lone wanderer. Of course I don’t have the guts to fight you. If I accidentally killed you, wouldn’t I be causing a huge disaster?”

“If you don’t have the guts to fight Yin Lesheng, why should we? We’re not going!”

“That’s right, we’re not going! If you want to fight, do it yourself!”

“Does he really take us for idiots? This brat even wants to pit us against each other. Ridiculous!”

The crowd was already resentful about handing over their Spatial Rings, and now Yang Kai wanted them to deal with Yin Lesheng. Of course, no one was willing, and they all shouted angrily, their indignation growing.

Lan He looked at Yang Kai with deep concern, afraid he would push things too far. He had already used the Mountain and River Bell to threaten everyone and collected so many Spatial Rings—a miracle in itself. If he went any further, it might cause unnecessary trouble.

She quietly signaled to Yang Kai, hinting that he should stop before going too far.

But Yang Kai ignored her, his face cold as he said, “Perhaps you all didn’t hear what I said at the start.”

“What did you say?!”

“Yeah, say it. What exactly do you want?!”

Yang Kai snorted, “I said, whoever dares not hand over their Spatial Ring, I’ll make sure they die!”

“That’s true, you did say that. But we’ve all handed over our Spatial Rings. What more do you want?”

Yang Kai said, “Now that Yin Lesheng refuses to cooperate, I want him dead. Do any of you object?”

Chang Hao said, “Of course not. Your grudge with Brother Yin is your own business. Don’t drag us into it.”

“Good!” Yang Kai grinned, then shouted, “I’m about to strike the Mountain and River Bell and kill that little bastard Yin Lesheng! If you want to live, leave now—I won’t stop you!”

“What?”

“He’s going to strike it again?”

“Don’t, Brother Yang, calm down!”

With those words, everyone’s faces changed, and they were all terrified.

Yang Kai sneered, “Since you’ve handed over your Spatial Rings, I’ll keep my word and let you live. Now I only need to deal with Yin Lesheng. If you don’t want to die, get out of here!”

Chang Hao shouted angrily, “The formation here is complicated. If we could leave, we wouldn’t have been forced to hand over our rings in the first place! Yang Kai, aren’t you just lying through your teeth?”

Chang Xian added, “There’s a limit to shamelessness!”

Yang Kai remained calm and said leisurely, “That’s not my concern. If you can’t leave and get killed by the Mountain and River Bell, blame your own bad luck—it has nothing to do with me!” Then, turning to Yin Lesheng, he roared, “Yin, a year from today will be your death anniversary. Safe travels on Yellow Springs Road!”

As he spoke, he swung the Myriad Sword fiercely at the Mountain and River Bell.

Lan He’s eyelids twitched, and she quickly activated her Origin Qi to protect herself.

The many cultivators were also shocked and cried out in alarm.

“Stop! Stop!”

“Damn it, stop! Let’s talk this out. At worst, we’ll help you persuade Yin Lesheng!”

“That’s right, we can talk to Yin Lesheng and get him to hand over his Spatial Ring!”

Amid the chaos, Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword stopped less than an inch from the Mountain and River Bell. He looked at the crowd and said, “You want to talk to Yin Lesheng?”

Everyone broke out in a cold sweat and nodded repeatedly.

Yang Kai looked troubled and said, “That Yin fellow is proud and stubborn. He won’t give in easily. Just talking probably won’t work!”

“Don’t worry, Brother Yang. If Xin Yin doesn’t cooperate, we’ll use a more forceful method to persuade him,” one man said with a grim expression.

Yang Kai said, “Ah, but that’s not right. You’ve all handed over your Spatial Rings, so this shouldn’t concern you anymore. It’s between me and Yin Lesheng. Why get involved?”

The crowd all wore dark expressions, cursing Yang Kai in their hearts, but no one dared show it.

“Don’t worry, Brother Yang. If that Yin fellow is so uncooperative, he deserves a lesson. Young people only understand the world after some hardship!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he said, “Well said, my friend. In that case, I’ll leave it to you all. I’m not forcing you.”

“Heh, we’re doing this of our own accord.”

With that, the dozens of cultivators turned to look at Yin Lesheng.

Yin Lesheng’s face was as black as the bottom of a pot, and the two Netherworld Sect disciples beside him were pale and dazed.

Somehow, they had suddenly become everyone’s enemies, leaving them completely at a loss.

“Yin Lesheng, if you know what’s good for you, hand over your Spatial Ring, or we’ll all die here!”

“That’s right! If you don’t cooperate, don’t blame us for being rude!”

“Hand it over, now!”

Whether it was because Yin Lesheng’s refusal had dragged them down, or because misery loves company, everyone’s attitude toward him was harsh and unrelenting.

Yin Lesheng, burning with anger, said coldly, “You’re all elite disciples of major sects, the pride of your schools. Yet you let yourselves be manipulated by one man. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at if word gets out?”

His words made many look embarrassed and awkward.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “What Yin Lesheng means is that you should silence the witnesses, so that no one will spread word of what happened today.”

Hearing this, many people’s eyes lit up, secretly thinking it wasn’t a bad idea. A few even showed murderous intent in their eyes.

Yin Lesheng glared at Yang Kai, “You’re truly despicable. I really misjudged you.”

Yang Kai snorted, “You should have thought about the consequences when you ambushed me in the Starlight Passage back then!”

Yin Lesheng gritted his teeth, “Don’t push me. If you do, none of you will have a good end!”

Yang Kai jumped back and glared, “Oh, I’m so scared!” Then he turned to the crowd and said, “He’s threatening you. Can you tolerate that? I couldn’t. If I were you, I’d tear him apart right now!”

Even though they knew Yang Kai was fanning the flames, the crowd still felt uncomfortable. Yin Lesheng’s words were just too much.

Chang Hao pondered for a moment and said, “Brother Yin, a wise man knows when to yield. I know you have tricks up your sleeve, but do you really think you can take on all of us?”

Yin Lesheng’s eyes blazed with fury, his voice icy cold. “Chang Hao, even you’re going to force my hand?”

Both were disciples of major sects in the Eastern Territory and had known each other for a long time. Though not close, they were still from the same region. For others to pressure him was one thing, but for Chang Hao to do so made Yin Lesheng extremely uncomfortable.

Chang Hao said solemnly, “Brother Yin, a gentleman’s revenge can wait ten years. This is the Shattered Star Sea—there will be plenty of opportunities.”

He didn’t bother to transmit his voice, saying it openly in front of Yang Kai, clearly holding a grudge and looking for a chance to settle it later.

Yang Kai curled his lips, looking completely unconcerned.

Yin Lesheng kept a dark face for a long time before finally nodding, “Fine. I’ll remember this, Yang Kai. One day, I’ll pay you back a hundredfold!”

Yang Kai laughed, “Brother Yin, you’re the fish and I’m the butcher. Is it really wise to make threats now?”

Yin Lesheng glared at Yang Kai in silence.

Yang Kai snorted, “Miss Lan He, collect their Spatial Rings.”

Lan He nodded and walked up to Yin Lesheng, holding out her hand.

Yin Lesheng said, “Heavenly Wolf Valley—I’ll remember this too. One day, I’ll pay a visit!”

Lan He’s expression changed slightly, but she knew nothing she said would help. She took the three Netherworld Sect members’ Spatial Rings and turned away.

Soon, she returned to Yang Kai and said, “Forty-six Spatial Rings in total. Here they are, Brother Yang. Please count them.”

Yang Kai happily took them and said, “Miss Lan He, you should take a share too.”

Lan He shook her head, “No need. I didn’t do much.”

Yang Kai was about to say something else when his expression suddenly changed and his Origin Qi surged violently.

Lan He was also startled, not knowing what had happened to Yang Kai. Looking over, she saw a streak of black energy appear on his wrist, slithering up his arm like a spirit snake. Wherever it passed, his flesh turned to mush, exposing white bone. The corroded area sizzled, making everyone’s scalp tingle.

A foul stench instantly filled the air.

“Shura Earth Fiend!” Lan He cried out in shock.
