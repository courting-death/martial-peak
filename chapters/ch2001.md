## Chapter 2001 — A Question

The Dragon Ascension Altar inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda turned out to be an enormous fraud.

Several hundred Void King Realm cultivators for a moment found it hard to accept this reality.

Near the Dragon Ascension Altar, everyone’s faces were sullen as they stared at the ground strewn with corpses and shattered bodies.

If the Dragon Ascension Altar was a hoax, then what had those dead people died for? Among them were relatives and friends of people still alive.

“Miss Qin, regarding this matter, shouldn’t you give us an explanation?”

Suddenly, someone in the crowd looked toward Qin Yu at the very back and asked coldly.

Qin Yu had already stopped walking, and because her strength was not great she had not gone far; at this moment she and her guards lagged far behind the crowd, some thirty to forty zhang from the nearest martial artists.

Hearing this, Qin Yu knitted her brows and lifted her delicate chin, weakly asking, “What did this friend mean by that?”

“Hmph, what do you mean? Miss Qin, don’t you know? You said this place was the Dragon Ascension Altar and we all believed you, but it turned out to be a scam that caused so many deaths—are you going to play deaf and dumb?”

The speaker wore a face full of righteous indignation, as if Qin Yu had truly cheated them and should be held responsible for those fallen martial artists.

His accusation won the approval of many martial artists, who all glared at Qin Yu with hostile looks, as if they wanted to vent their grievances on her.

Qin Yu's dark brows knitted even tighter. Before she could reply, a guard at her side snorted coldly, “Friend, kindly think before you speak—what does this matter have to do with our Miss Qin?”

“How is it not related? If Miss Qin had not said this was the Dragon Ascension Altar, we wouldn’t have—”

“—rashly charged in with blind bloodthirst?”

Before the man could finish, Duan Tianci suddenly sneered and, his face full of killing intent, looked at him and said, “How laughable; think carefully yourselves—if there were such a great opportunity here, would you have willingly let it go even without Miss Qin’s hint?”

Duan Tianci was after all the son of the city lord and a formidable cultivator; among Fenglin City’s martial artists he enjoyed high fame and prestige. Hearing him say this, many lowered their heads to ponder and realized he was right.

Even if Qin Yu had not explained things, no one would have ignored the Dragon Ascension Altar; they would have surged forward. The outcome would probably have been no different from what it was now.

In other words, whether Qin Yu had been present or not, the ending would not have changed.

“But simply because Miss Qin gave a hint you want to pin all the blame on her—don’t you find that absurd?” Duan Tianci said coldly to the man who had spoken earlier.

The man dared not meet Duan Tianci’s gaze; his eyes flicked nervously from side to side.

“Indeed, Miss Qin bears no fault; anyone who dares blame her is making an enemy of my Blazing Fire Hall,” Zong Zijin said indifferently.

“The Jiang Family holds the same stance!” Jiang Chuhe smiled and spoke up, opportunely taking the side of righteousness to bolster the Jiang Family’s reputation.

“Of course none of us will accuse Miss Qin—these were merely the irresponsible words of a few clowns; Miss Qin need not pay them any mind.”

“Exactly; if not for Miss Qin we wouldn’t even have known what that thing was. To not thank her and instead accuse her—those people are the scum of Fenglin City, vermin we are ashamed to be associated with!”

……

Voices rose and argued; the man who had accused Qin Yu flushed scarlet, wishing he could crawl into a hole and never come out.

A short distance away Qin Yu smiled faintly and bowed gracefully, saying, “You are all people of sense, but… I did not speak falsely; the Dragon Ascension Altar truly contained treasures.”

“Where?” Duan Tianci and Zong Zijin’s faces heated as they hurriedly asked.

Yang Kai felt his heart sink and stared unwaveringly at Qin Yu, fearful she might say something he did not want to hear.

Qin Yu smiled slightly and said, “The Dragon Ascension Altar itself… is a treasure. Perhaps the things previously placed atop it were formed by illusion, but the altar was forged from true dragon bone, a refining material coveted even by those of the Emperor Realm.”

At her words everyone’s expressions flared with excitement.

Qin Yu went on, “However… with our strength we cannot destroy the Dragon Ascension Altar; otherwise it would not still be inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and would have long been taken by a master. Rashly attacking it will likely trigger powerful seals, so I advise you not to act recklessly.”

Hearing this, Zong Zijin and Duan Tianci gradually calmed, glanced at the huge Dragon Ascension Altar and heaved a regretful sigh.

A mountain of treasure lay before them, yet they had no strength to mine it—such a feeling truly tormented them.

“By the way, Miss Qin.” Yang Kai, who had not previously spoken, cupped his fist and asked, “If Miss Qin knows something of the Dragon Ascension Altar, may I ask… when can we leave here? We saw what happened to those who tried to retreat. We can’t stay trapped here forever, can we?”

“Yes, Miss Qin, please advise!” Many suddenly realized the same question and turned their attention to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at Yang Kai with meaning in her eyes, pressed her lips into a smile and said, “You can leave now. Once the treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar vanish, the seals will lose their effect. In half an hour the altar will sink into the ground and drift away into the void; when it next appears is unknown. Of course… you may also choose to remain, for the dragon’s oppressive aura still exists here and the benefits of cultivating under it are clear, so I need say no more.”

Yang Kai felt uneasy under her gaze, as if some secret might be revealed, but he still thanked her, “Thank you for your guidance, Miss Qin.”

Though he said that, he did not budge.

Having learned from the previous lesson, he did not want to be killed by some inexplicable flash of light emitted from the Dragon Ascension Altar.

So he sat cross-legged on the ground and took an Origin Condensing Pill. Relying on the altar’s strong dragon pressure and the pill’s effect, he sought to convert his Origin Qi.

Not only him, but all the martial artists remained motionless, waiting for the first daring person to act; most, like Yang Kai, sat cross-legged, unwilling to waste this prime opportunity.

As for the rest, some were anxious to leave and seek other treasures but lacked the courage; their eyes flitted about uncertainly.

Seeing this, Qin Yu smiled slightly, turned, and walked back a few steps.

“Miss!” Her guards cried out in alarm, their backs instantly beaded with cold sweat.

What reassured them was that Qin Yu was not attacked by the Dragon Ascension Altar—apparently her previous words were true: once the treasures disappeared the seals lost their effect.

Seeing Qin Yu set an example, many martial artists put their minds at ease and departed by various means.

Soon only a few dozen martial artists remained near the Dragon Ascension Altar.

Yang Kai was among them.

He had withdrawn the Golden Sacred Dragon’s source power and endured the terrifying dragon pressure with his physical body; with the Origin Condensing Pill catalyzing, he felt his internal power converting at an astonishing rate.

He roughly calculated that training here for half an hour would be equivalent to ten days of bitter cultivation outside.

As Qin Yu had said, after half an hour the ground trembled and the Dragon Ascension Altar, under a mysterious force, slowly sank into the earth.

In not much more than the time of half a cup of tea, the entire Dragon Ascension Altar vanished without a trace.

Along with it the dragon pressure disappeared entirely.

Yang Kai finally sighed and stood.

He glanced around; those dozens who remained also rose—some alone, some in small groups—but all parted peacefully without dispute.

Soon they all flew off in different directions.

Yang Kai casually picked a direction and continued searching for the Five-Colored Pillar of Light that would lead to the second tier.

He had not flown far when his brow furrowed and he suddenly quickened his pace.

An hour later his face darkened; he abruptly stopped, turned, and looked back.

There was no one behind him at first, but after a short wait a streak of mysterious light rushed swiftly from the distance.

When it drew near Yang Kai recognized it as a flying secret treasure shaped like a tower ship, much like one he had seen before.

On the deck of the tower ship a slight figure stood peering into the distance; seeing Yang Kai, she quickly turned and seemed to shout something to others.

Before long the tower ship flew before Yang Kai and slowly descended.

“Miss Qin!” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he looked at Qin Yu and several Void King Realm guards who disembarked from the ship and said, “Miss Qin, what do you mean by this? You’ve been tailing me—do you think I wouldn’t notice?”

Qin Yu listened and answered apologetically, “Please do not blame me, sir. I did not intend to trail you; your speed was simply too great and the Qin Family’s tower ship could not quite catch up, so we followed behind.”

Yang Kai frowned and his expression softened slightly as he asked, “Miss Qin means you seek me for something?”

“Something like that.” Qin Yu nodded.

“I have no connection with Miss Qin—what do you want with me?” Yang Kai looked puzzled, though instinctively he felt averse to the frail woman; in her presence he always felt insecure.

“Really nothing much, just one question I wish to ask you.”

“One question?”

“Yes—may I ask your honorable surname?”

“That’s the question?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“Of course not.” Qin Yu pursed her lips and smiled, lightly coughing before she continued, “What I want to ask is not that…”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “My surname is Yang.”

“So it is Brother Yang,” Qin Yu said with comprehension, then moved her lips and a soft voice reached Yang Kai’s ear.

“May I ask, Brother Yang, was there truly no treasure on that Dragon Ascension Altar?”
