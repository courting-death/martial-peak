## Chapter 1706 — I Do Not Need Earth Fire

A few days earlier, when he had fought Yang Kai, Yang Kai had suddenly used the Undying Five Elements Sword; with his eyesight he could naturally discern the clue.

On Ghost Isle, Saint Yuan could not be used at all; the only explanation for the five-colored radiance was a body-refinement cultivation method. The strength cultivated by a body-refinement method lay outside the category of Saint Yuan, and therefore was not subject to Ghost Isle's restrictions.

"Yes!" Yang Kai did not hide it.

A flush of fervent expression immediately rose on the elder's face.

Body-refinement cultivation methods were comparatively rare across the entire Star Domain, and the more profound ones were even rarer.

But rarity alone did not make a body-refinement method precious.

For one thing, body-refinement methods were difficult to cultivate; even an ordinary body-refinement method was extremely hard to raise to very high levels. For another, a martial artist did not have the spare lifetime and energy to concurrently cultivate a body-refinement method in addition to their primary path.

Martial artists measured power and survival by the strength of Saint Yuan and Divine Sense, so even though many knew the advantages of a powerful body, they had no way to cultivate both paths.

But on Ghost Isle things were different.

Here place Saint Yuan could not be used and Divine Sense power was suppressed; cultivating a body-refinement method was the brightest and most honorable path for a martial artist!

Over countless years, countless martial artists had been stranded on Ghost Isle, and naturally some body-refinement methods had been brought into the isle. The elder had cultivated one himself, but it was exceedingly ordinary, a world of difference from Yang Kai's Undying Five Elements Sword.

The reason the Undying Five Elements Sword was powerful was not the method itself, but the materials required to cultivate it.

The elder thought that if he could obtain Yang Kai's body-refinement method it would absolutely raise his own strength by a great deal.

So when he heard Yang Kai possessed a profound body-refinement method his gaze grew hot.

After all, he was a fairly formidable expert and knew that techniques like this could not be demanded casually; he forced down his desire and did not make a scene.

"Let me introduce myself — I am Sha Hu!" he said with a hint of self-satisfaction, as if Yang Kai should have known the name.

Unfortunately, the result disappointed him. Yang Kai merely clasped his fists lightly and said, "So it's Elder Sha. I am Yang Kai!"

Sha Hu frowned and tentatively asked, "You haven't heard my name?"

Yang Kai chuckled: "Elder Sha is from the Deep Sea, right?"

Sha Hu nodded, realizing, "You come from the inland?"

"Correct!" Yang Kai replied.

Sha Hu understood. On Dark Star, deep sea and inland martial artists belonged to two different systems. Though they did not cut off contact entirely, they rarely ventured into each other's territories. Someone from the inland not knowing the names of deep sea powerhouses was not surprising.

Having understood that, Sha Hu's face brightened a little and he chuckled, "I have been here for more than three hundred years. Back then I was the Second Hall Master of Sea Hall. How is Sea Hall faring now?"

Yang Kai was surprised: "You were the Second Hall Master of Sea Hall? To be frank, Elder, I came from near Xiaguang Island of Sea Hall. Sea Hall is currently a very powerful force in the Deep Sea, the foremost among humans, able to rival the Sea God Palace."

Sha Hu listened quietly and said with satisfaction, "Those youngsters still have some ability. They have not ruined the ancestral hall! Do you have ties with Sea Hall? How did you come near Xiaguang Island?"

"Just passing by by chance; as for ties, none," Yang Kai chuckled.

Perhaps because he had confirmed Yang Kai’s connection to the Sea Hall, Sha Hu’s expression relaxed considerably. Seeing that Yang Kai lacked the usual arrogance of youth, he couldn’t help but feel quite pleased with him.

The two men set aside the awkwardness from their earlier great battle and, surprisingly, hit it off in conversation.

Yang Kai needed to learn about Ghost Isle's situation, and Sha Hu wanted to probe Sea Hall's current state — question and answer flowed, and the atmosphere grew amicable.

After a long time, both obtained the information they sought.

Yang Kai frowned. This Ghost Isle was strange in every way — an isolated, sealed space with no path to the outside. Even Sha Hu, who had once been the island’s master, had found no way to leave.

That Ming Yue had originally been Sha Hu’s vice island master, his strength not much inferior to Sha Hu’s. But for some unknown reason, one day Ming Yue’s power suddenly surged, and he fought Sha Hu for control. The result was, of course, Sha Hu’s defeat — forced to flee Ghost Isle and hide away on this small island.

That was nearly a hundred years ago.

For a hundred years Sha Hu had borne humiliation and waited, only hoping one day to strike back at Ghost Isle and avenge those old grievances.

Unfortunately, his strength seemed to have reached a bottleneck and could not be improved further; he could only keep guard where he was.

Fortunately this place was far from Ghost Isle and ordinary people could not reach it. When Sha Hu fled here he had barely survived; Yang Kai was the only sentient being he had seen in nearly a hundred years.

How large the independent space containing Ghost Isle truly was, even Sha Hu could not say. He had once left the small islet to explore, but the deeper he went the stronger the sea beasts became, and even he was not their match, so he had no choice but to retreat.

"Is there really no way to leave Ghost Isle?" Yang Kai asked, brow furrowed.

"Perhaps there is, but I cannot find it," Sha Hu shook his head. "At least, it cannot be found from here."

"You mean..."

Sha Hu frowned, pondered for a moment and said, "This is only my conjecture; whether it is correct I cannot be certain."

"Please, go on, Senior."

"If there is an exit, the main Ghost Isle would be the only clue. There is a place there that is very strange. I once tried to investigate it but could not enter," Sha Hu said measuredly.

Yang Kai was slightly moved.

Sha Hu smiled, "If the two of us joined forces perhaps we could seize Ghost Isle, but that is only a possibility. Ming Yue was stronger than I back then, and a hundred years later I do not know how powerful he is now — perhaps if we went we'd be walking into a trap."

Yang Kai neither agreed nor disagreed.

How strong Ming Yue was did not concern him. When he had fought Sha Hu he had not used his full strength. Moreover, he had the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao as a trump card!

In sheer strength, who in the world could surpass Xiaoxiao?

As long as Xiaoxiao acted, no one on Ghost Isle could match it!

He weighed the truth of Sha Hu's words. Though the old man's disposition was not bad, who knew whether he sought to use him for some aim. If he were double-crossed, the gain would not be worth the risk.

Yang Kai preferred to assume the worst of men's motives rather than regret being unlucky later.

Seeing Yang Kai silent, Sha Hu timely changed the subject, "Were you just researching the Huntian Lotus and the Huntian Pill?"

Yang Kai returned from his reverie and nodded, "Yes, these are specialties of Ghost Isle, right?"

"Indeed. Huntian Lotus cannot be found in the outside world; only Ghost Isle produces them. Martial artists stranded here used the Huntian Pill to enhance their strength, but I cannot refine pills myself — ingesting the Huntian Lotus gives me no benefit. Otherwise, do you think I would leave so many Huntian Lotuses in the lake?"

At that he showed a look of aching pain on his face.

A thousand Huntian Lotuses! Across Ghost Isle, with several thousand martial artists searching for years, they might not find so many. Yet now they were all inside Yang Kai's Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai suddenly asked, "Elder Sha, do you have the formula for the Huntian Pill?"

"Of course," Sha Hu laughed lightly and proudly. "After all, I was once the island master of Ghost Isle. Pill formulas..."

As he spoke his eyes brightened and, pointing at Yang Kai, he asked in a trembling voice, "You are an alchemist?"

If Yang Kai were not an alchemist there would be no point in asking about formulas.

He looked at Yang Kai with a gaze burning as if he had come upon an astonishing treasure.

Yang Kai chuckled, "You could say that."

"You really are an alchemist?" Sha Hu stood up at once.

Yang Kai nodded again.

Sha Hu was stunned for a moment, then laughed heartily, "Heaven has not forsaken me! Heaven has not forsaken me! Good, good — this is perfect!"

The reason his strength had stagnated over the years was precisely because he lacked the Huntian Pill. Directly taking the Huntian Lotus had no effect; only refining the Lotus into a pill could unlock its proper efficacy.

Thus upon learning Yang Kai truly was an alchemist, Sha Hu became so excited he lost some restraint.

But soon after he frowned, glanced at Yang Kai and sighed deeply.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled. A moment before Sha Hu had been like a child with joy; now he looked utterly despondent — the contrast was enormous.

"Even if you are an alchemist, without Earth Fire you cannot refine pills!" Sha Hu's face turned ashen and he sat down again. "Alchemists on Ghost Isle are exceedingly rare. Among the tens of thousands of people here there might be only four or five alchemists, and their levels varied. But to refine pills they must borrow Ghost Isle's Earth Fire — we have no Earth Fire to borrow here."

"I don't need Earth Fire!" Yang Kai laughed.

"Ridiculous!" Sha Hu sneered. "Which alchemist does not need Earth Fire? Maybe in the outside world you can, but here Saint Yuan cannot be used, so one must rely on Earth Fire... uh..."

Sha Hu trailed off as he could not finish the sentence.

Because he clearly felt a scorching power spreading from Yang Kai's body — it was not the power of Saint Yuan, but the force of Divine Sense!

"Divine Sense Fire?" Sha Hu's face changed dramatically.

Yang Kai smiled innocently.

Even in the outside world he did not need to use Saint Yuan to refine pills, because he had always used Divine Sense Fire.

Moreover, he had the Fire Bird. Since fusing with that Qiantian Thunderflame from Fire Radiance Sect, the Fire Bird had evolved full sentience, could take human form, and had merged her Secret Treasure alchemical furnace.

She herself was the best Earth Fire!

At worst, Yang Kai could enter the Xuan Realm Pearl to refine pills. The Xuan Realm Pearl was self-contained, and inside it Saint Yuan was not restricted.

All these advantages meant he had no real worry about refining pills; however, there was no reason to reveal them to Sha Hu.
