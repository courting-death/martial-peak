## Chapter 313 — Avoiding Encounter

Regardless of the intentions behind Shan Qingluo sending three women, one large and two small, their service was indeed attentive.

This building had a resting area on the second floor, while the first floor housed a large bathing pool, exquisitely carved from white jade, a costly endeavor. As for the third floor, it was rather unremarkable, likely just a place for enjoying the scenery.

Under the direction of the beautiful woman Yunli, the two young maidens Ruoyu and Ruoqing supported Yang Kai on either side, disregarding his willingness, and directly brought him to the bathing pool on the first floor.

Inside, steam rose from the water, and the fragrance of flowers wafted through the air. It was unclear when a pool of hot water had been prepared, filled with petals of various colors.

Yang Kai's expression darkened.

A grown man bathing in a pool of flower petals was inherently strange.

"Young Master, please bathe and change first," the beautiful woman Yunli said, maintaining a gentle smile throughout, appearing quite pleasant.

Yang Kai nodded with a stern face.

After waiting for a while, he noticed that neither she nor Ruoyu and Ruoqing showed any intention of leaving. He looked at them in astonishment and said, "You ladies aren't here to help me bathe, are you?"

Yunli smiled coyly, her voice softening, "If the Young Master wishes... we will obey your command... The Master has said that any request of yours must be fulfilled..."

As she spoke, her voice trailed off, her cheeks flushing slightly, a hint of shyness evident.

Ruoyu and Ruoqing were even more tense.

"No need for that trouble, you can leave first," Yang Kai waved his hand.

A trace of surprise flashed in Yunli's peach blossom eyes as she glanced at Yang Kai. However, upon hearing his words, Ruoyu and Ruoqing sighed in relief, as if released from a dream.

The three women gracefully withdrew, and only then did Yang Kai remove his clothes and jump into the bathing pool to wash himself.

The water temperature was just right, washing away his fatigue from the past period.

He couldn't help but wonder how Su Yan was doing after leaving the Void Passage. She should be able to reach thousands of miles away in an instant. Where were they now? What was happening with the Lingxiao Pavilion? What was the outcome of the battle involving his Master?

Yang Kai felt a bit restless.

…

Outside the building, Bilo stood with a puffed-up expression, waiting. She couldn't understand why the Master treated that boy so well, not only providing him with the best accommodations but even sending the finest maidservants from the palace.

The three women, regardless of their looks or temperament, were among the best in the palace. Such considerate care had never been seen even when other Evil Kings visited.

That boy clearly didn't seem like a decent person. At this moment, he wouldn't have already taken advantage of Yunli and the others, would he?

Thinking this, Bilo's anger intensified, and she secretly felt that the three women were being wronged. Yunli could be excused; having been a widow for many years, she must have her desires. It wouldn't be surprising for her to be drawn to that boy. But Ruoyu and Ruoqing had grown up alongside Bilo; they were both innocent girls, and if their purity were to be tarnished by that boy…

I'll castrate him! A glint of murderous intent flashed in Bilo's eyes as she secretly made up her mind.

Just as she was fuming, she saw Yunli and the two maidens walking out together.

"Eh..." Bilo was taken aback, then immediately filled with joy. She hurried over and grabbed Ruoyu and Ruoqing's hands, asking eagerly, "Are you all right? Did he do anything inappropriate?"

Ruoyu and Ruoqing's faces flushed, and they quickly shook their heads.

The beautiful woman Yunli chuckled, "Miss Bilo, you worry too much. That Young Master doesn't seem like a lecherous person; he is quite proper."

"Really?" Bilo was surprised. "Did you convey the Master's instructions to him?"

"I repeated every word," Yunli nodded slightly.

"He didn't make any advances on you?" Bilo asked, tilting her head in disbelief.

"No," Yunli replied with a light laugh. "If you don't believe me, you can ask Ruoyu and Ruoqing."

Bilo looked at them suspiciously.

Ruoqing shook her head, her face red as she said, "Bilo, you think too much. I was really scared earlier; I thought that person was a lecher."

"That's strange; how could this be? I usually have a good eye for men. That boy looks like he has a belly full of schemes; it doesn't make sense that he wouldn't try to take advantage of you," Bilo frowned. Suddenly, her eyes brightened, and she snorted, "I see, he must be shy since it's his first time here. Men are all like that; you’ve seen those Evil Kings and young masters who visit the palace. Which one of them doesn’t drool over you, wishing to strip you bare and take you to bed?"

Hearing this, Ruoyu and Ruoqing became tense again.

"He must be that type, pretending to be cultured to lower your guard, then taking both your bodies and hearts when you're unprepared. In reality, he's just a beast in human clothing!" Bilo exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with deduction.

"Ah..." Ruoyu and Ruoqing gasped in shock.

Yunli was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. "Miss Bilo, don't scare them. That Young Master should not be a bad person… Moreover, if he really wanted to act… we wouldn't be able to resist…"

Bilo glared at her angrily, then suddenly lunged forward, her hands gripping Yunli's soft bosom tightly, kneading it vigorously as she grinned wickedly, "Looks like Sister Yun is already mentally prepared. Is it that no men have stayed in the palace for so many years that you can't help but want to throw yourself at one?"

Suddenly assaulted, Yunli's sensitive areas were accurately kneaded by Bilo, nearly causing her to collapse into her embrace. A rosy hue appeared on her fair face, and she gritted her teeth, her voice barely above a whisper, "What nonsense are you talking about?"

"Hmph, so sensitive, it must be true!" Bilo not only didn't let go but intensified her actions, channeling her True Essence into rhythmic bursts from her fingertips, fiercely stimulating those two sensitive spots.

"Mm..." A moan escaped from Yunli's lips, her peach blossom eyes instantly becoming hazy, an unusual red glow appearing on her skin.

Hearing the sound, Ruoyu and Ruoqing felt a strange sensation in their hearts.

Bilo giggled, leaning her head into Yunli's long, fair neck, extending a small tongue to lick the beautiful woman's earlobe.

Yunli shivered.

Ruoyu and Ruoqing stared wide-eyed, their faces flushed, their hearts racing like startled deer.

Although they had long known that Bilo's cultivation method was the same alluring arts as the Master, and she understood much about matters between men and women, they never expected her to be so irresistible when she went wild.

"Stop it, you little brat!" Yunli struggled to suppress her own throbbing heart and bodily pleasure, jumping out of Bilo's embrace. Her legs nearly gave way under her, feeling weak, and even her voice sounded unusually strange.

"Hmph! A woman who’s ripe is indeed different," Bilo licked her crimson lips, looking unsatisfied, her eyes glistening.

"Enough of your nonsense. Why not go find Qianying and Qianchen? They are assigned to help you cultivate the alluring arts. Ruoyu, Ruoqing, and I still need to serve that Young Master breakfast. It wouldn't do to delay," Yunli reproached, glancing at her, seemingly aware of Bilo's temperament, and hurriedly called to Ruoyu and Ruoqing, "Let's go."

"Oh." Ruoyu and Ruoqing quickly followed.

"Sister Yun, I'll come find you tonight," Bilo called out in a sweet tone from behind.

Yunli turned her head, glaring fiercely at her, "Tonight, Ruoyu, Ruoqing, and I will be resting here. If you have the guts, come over!"

…

After finishing his bath, Yang Kai changed into a clean set of clothes.

These garments had been sent early in the morning by Shan Qingluo, looking bright and polished, fitting Yang Kai's physique perfectly and further highlighting his extraordinary demeanor.

Even Yunli and the two maidens Ruoyu and Ruoqing were momentarily taken aback by his appearance.

Breakfast had already been laid out outside, a variety of delicacies that looked delightful.

As Yunli served him porridge, she said, "These were personally made by the maidservants. Young Master, please eat while it's hot."

After a pause, she added with a smile, "Your physique is a bit on the lean side; it must be due to your years of wandering. You should eat more to nourish your body."

"Mm." Yang Kai responded lightly, then suspiciously asked, "Where is your Master?"

"The Master has matters to attend to today," Yunli replied with a smile.

"I thought she would come to have breakfast with me," Yang Kai frowned.

Upon hearing this, Yunli and the two maidens exchanged strange glances, their expressions filled with curiosity, increasingly unsure of Yang Kai's true identity.

To be able to have Shan Qingluo sit beside him for a meal was a privilege that the other five Evil Kings likely did not enjoy.

"Then where can I find her? Where should I go?" Yang Kai asked while eating.

Yunli giggled, "The Master said she has been busy these days and instructed you to ask Miss Bilo if you have any questions. She has been waiting outside since early morning."

"I've been played!" Yang Kai snorted lightly. Yesterday, Shan Qingluo had said she would come to find him, but now she had changed her mind, clearly knowing he wanted to discuss leaving with her, so she was avoiding him.

After clearing the table of food, Yang Kai stepped out of the building.

The somewhat enchanting maiden Bilo was indeed waiting outside, her expression showing a hint of disdain towards Yang Kai. However, she dared not defy Shan Qingluo's orders in the slightest.

"Miss Bilo!" Yang Kai called out.

"Mm!" Bilo responded indifferently, wearing an aloof expression that suggested she was not to be approached.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, "I want to see your Master!"

Bilo frowned, her expression displeased as she replied, "The Master is discussing important matters with several elders in the city today; she probably won't have time to see you."

"When will she finish?"

"It may not be possible for the next few days. The Master has been away from Piaoxiang City for nearly two months, and with the frequent battles during this time, many matters require her to oversee."

Yang Kai's expression turned cold, his mood instantly sour.

Bilo hesitated for a moment, reluctantly saying, "However, the Master mentioned last night that to make up for her oversight, she allows you to visit her treasure vault."
