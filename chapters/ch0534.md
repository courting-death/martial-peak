## Chapter 534 — What Can You Offer?

Inside the side hall, Ye Xinrou blinked her big eyes, staring at Yang Kai. After a long moment, she suddenly covered her mouth and let out a coquettish laugh.

Laughing, she said, “Young Master, you are really underestimating me. How could I ever think to betray Second Young Master and turn to you? If I did such a thing, who would I, Ye Xinrou, be? And how would the world see the Ye Family?”

“Just joking, no need to take it seriously,” Yang Kai smiled slightly and shook his head.

He also knew that Ye Xinrou would never do such a thing.

The Succession War was hosted by the Yang Family to choose the next head of the family. Various powers across the land took part, most hoping to curry favor with the Yang Family.

But the other Seven Great Families of Zhongdu had no such intention.

They possessed deep roots and strength; even if they were not as mighty as the Yang Family, they were close enough to rival them.

Moreover, since they all resided in Zhongdu, there were countless inseparable ties between them and the Yang Family, making it unnecessary to flatter the Yang Family.

The children of the Seven Great Families took part in the Succession War mainly to temper themselves and hone their abilities. They didn’t overly care about winning or losing; victory was sweet, but defeat wouldn’t cost them much.

So, even though Yang Zhao’s mansion was currently not in a good state, Ye Xinrou would never betray him to join Yang Kai. Doing so would cause great damage to the reputation of her Ye Family.

“What do you want then?” Yang Kai fixed Ye Xinrou with a burning gaze. “If I’m not mistaken, you must have been waiting outside for days, right?”

It made no sense that he had just left the mansion and she already sought him out.

The only explanation was that she was lying in wait for an opportunity.

“Actually, I don’t want to do anything much,” Ye Xinrou shook her head. “It’s just that the situation is now clear. It’s only a matter of time before Young Master claims victory. We could even say that if you wanted, you could crush the other two opponents right now.”

Yang Kai fell silent, but a hint of caution flashed in his eyes. He didn’t know if Ye Xinrou was here to spy on him.

“The future head of the Yang Family will definitely be Young Master,” Ye Xinrou’s beautiful eyes sparkled as if she already saw Yang Kai reigning supreme over all. Her breath grew slightly hurried, and a faint flush graced her charming face. “Coincidentally, I’m quite interested in the strong, and Young Master is precisely such a person.”

“You really have nothing better to do,” Yang Kai said with a curl of his lip, full of disdain.

A cold glint flashed briefly in Ye Xinrou’s eyes, but she quickly subdued it, chuckling softly. “To put it plainly, I’ve come for only one thing.”

“What is it?”

“That once Young Master becomes the head of the Yang Family, you will take care of my Ye Family.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange, and he looked askance at Ye Xinrou. “Your Ye Family is one of the Eight Great Families; surely you don’t need me to look after you?”

Ye Xinrou shook her head slowly, her expression darkening. “Young Master doesn’t know. The Eight Great Families are all in decline now. Many of the masters within are nearing the end of their lifespans. The next generation’s strength is uneven, mostly filled with degenerate brats doing nothing of worth. In the last battle at Cangyun Evil Land, our side suffered heavy losses and still failed to eradicate the Evil Land. The reputation of the Eight Great Families took a hit. No one knows how much longer this glory can last. I’ve always felt that Young Master can bring miracles. The entire Succession War is your battlefield of miracles. Under your leadership, the Yang Family could become stronger than it is now, and among the other Seven Great Families... hehe, I think no one else has that ability.”

“At that time, with gains and losses balanced thus, your Yang Family might truly dominate Zhongdu and control the world, no longer just nominally as it is now.”

Yang Kai was slightly moved, suddenly realizing he had undervalued this woman’s foresight.

No wonder she came from one of the Eight Great Families. Setting aside her character, she indeed had a keen eye.

The current Eight Great Families, although still led by the Yang Family, also wielded no weak power, each hoping to replace the Yang Family.

But none had the chance.

Yet all were indeed in decline.

Ye Xinrou’s concerns were ones Yang Kai had thought of occasionally but never dwelled upon, thinking such affairs were unrelated to him.

Hearing her analysis now, it suddenly made a lot of sense.

The Eight Great Families have enjoyed their days of ease and dominance for far too long. The saying “wealth does not last beyond three generations” holds, and the height of prosperity inevitably brings decline.

The signs are already evident.

The young masters and misses of Zhongdu all think themselves superior, forgetting the hardships and dangers their ancestors endured to create this flourishing era.

People like Qiu Ziru, who may one day steer the Qiu Family, are the last hope for them. What future does the Qiu Family have?

Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, Meng Shanyi, Liu Qingyao, and others all have some ability, but whether their leadership will stop their family’s decline is unpredictable.

“Perhaps we won’t see this within our lifetimes, but I’m just preparing for the worst. It’s better to be ready than not, isn’t it?” Ye Xinrou looked confidently at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded gently.

“In any case, I feel Young Master isn’t ordinary. Yang Family under your leadership will definitely be better. If I don’t cultivate a good relationship with you now, I might not get the chance later,” Ye Xinrou spoke honestly, her tone and expression sincere. It was clear she truly meant it.

“I admit you have a point,” Yang Kai said after a moment of contemplation, looking up at her with a smile tugging at his lips. “But if we do this, what benefit do I gain?”

Ye Xinrou bit her lip softly, speaking sweetly, “Young Master, what benefits do you want?”

Her eyes became dreamy, and a hint of flirtation and invitation appeared on her face. Her meaning was unmistakable.

Yang Kai leisurely regarded her, slowly shaking his head. “I don’t know yet. Let’s see what you can offer.”

Ye Xinrou giggled lightly, standing up with grace, stepping toward Yang Kai.

When she was only half a foot away, she stopped, turned her body, and plopped down on Yang Kai’s lap. Her arms encircled his neck as she pressed her lips close, breathing softly like orchids. “Young Master, whatever you want me to give, I can.”

“Really?” Yang Kai's eyes brightened, filled with lustful intent. He reached out a large hand and kneaded her full breasts.

A soft moan escaped Ye Xinrou, who looked at him mockingly and pouted, “Young Master, be gentle, you might bruise me.”

Her lips were crimson and tempting.

In her eyes glowed a victorious light permeated with passion.

No matter how outstanding Yang Kai was, after all, he was still an eighteen-year-old youth! Even Yang Zhao became submissive under her body’s conquest; how could Yang Kai escape?

Ye Xinrou snorted coldly within.

After speaking, she lightly lifted herself from Yang Kai’s embrace.

She was masterful in the art of playing hard to get, knowing well that to whet a man’s appetite, you cannot let him succeed too easily.

She was no innocent girl; she knew men’s thoughts well.

Yang Kai did not stop her, only watching her with a smiling and expectant expression. Although lust gleamed in his gaze, there was no sign of genuine feeling.

Just as Ye Xinrou steadied herself, her clothes suddenly transformed into fragments and shattered.

Her perfectly proportioned snowy white figure was suddenly exposed to the air, smooth as soft silk, shimmering with enticing luster, breathtaking.

Ye Xinrou cried out in surprise, completely unprepared for this.

Suddenly realizing, the nip Yang Kai had just given her had some hidden trick she hadn’t noticed.

Panicked and fearful, she quickly raised one jade arm to shield her breasts, using the other to cover her lower body, her face burning crimson. She gritted her teeth and glared angrily at Yang Kai. “You…”

She only uttered one word before hastily suppressing her anger, water-like emotion rippling in her eyes, stomping her foot and saying, “Young Master, how can you be like this?”

“You’re the one who came knocking,” Yang Kai gave a light snort, lifting his head with a proud look. “Take your hands off me.”

Ye Xinrou’s face twisted with embarrassment and hesitation.

“You just said you’d give everything, right?” Yang Kai sneered. “What, was that just talk?”

“Of course I meant it,” Ye Xinrou’s heart cursed silently. She was not afraid of engaging with Yang Kai physically—in fact, she longed for it—but she did not want him to take advantage before she received a tangible benefit and his promise.

Now, however, she had no choice.

Steeling herself, Ye Xinrou spoke softly, “Then, Young Master, please don’t mock me…”

Yang Kai said nothing, still regarding her with that slightly superior gaze.

Ye Xinrou finally slowly loosened her hands, lowered her head, appearing extremely shy.

Yang Kai’s eyes were filled with aggression, unabashedly staring.

Her full, supple breasts, her flat, smooth belly without the slightest trace of excess, and the hidden patch of soft grass below — all were cloaked in a flawless snowy white that captivated the soul and set a man’s blood surging. The sight filled Yang Kai’s vision, making even his fingers itch to move.

Ye Xinrou stood there completely bare, like a work of art, allowing him to admire her exquisite curves and enchanting figure.

One had to admit, this woman was truly well-equipped; especially now, her shy demeanor aroused a subtle urge to pin her down, brutally ravage, and savor her futile struggling.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, a strange rosy glow grew across Ye Xinrou’s white body as her breath quickened.

Though not innocent, she was still a woman and stood shyly before a man.

“Am I beautiful?” Ye Xinrou asked, letting his eyes roam shamelessly over her, lifting her head lightly.

Yang Kai nodded heavily, his breath heavy.

“As long as you give me a promise, all this will be yours…” At this stage, Ye Xinrou could no longer play coy but threw out the bait.

Moreover, judging by Yang Kai’s demeanor and condition, he clearly could not resist such temptation, and she was confident in this!

She was the eldest daughter of the Ye Family; just that status made countless men yearn for the pleasures of her body, not to mention she was a true beauty.
