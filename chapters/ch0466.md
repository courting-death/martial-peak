## Chapter 466 — Is That Him?

The violent energy remained chaotic for quite a while before finally settling down.

The dazzling starlight vanished, and Yang Kai snorted coldly, his entire body falling nearly ten zhang before he barely managed to stabilize his stance.

Facing Liu Qingyao’s Mystery-Grade Middle-Level martial skill head-on, even the Star Mark struggled to hold its ground. Moreover, their cultivation realms originally differed by several minor stages, with the Divine Roaming Realm acting as a watershed in between.

Yang Kai was in a tough spot. Liu Qingyao’s body trembled slightly. The enormous figure that had been visible to all suddenly shattered. It was as if struck by a sharp sword, causing his entire momentum to drain away.

The terrifying pressure dissipated, and everyone felt a clear moon emerging from behind the clearing mist in their hearts.

Looking closely, the two remained about twenty zhang apart, gazing at each other as if they had not clashed at all.

Several disciples of the Yang Family were dumbfounded.

They had never realized Yang Kai was this formidable!

Everyone knew his strength was not weak, but no matter how high they estimated it, they had clearly underestimated this Ninth Brother. In a one-on-one fight, no one in the Yang Family could match him!

Yet with only the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm, how could he be evenly matched against Liu Qingyao, a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivator?

Yang Zhao and the others wore grim expressions. Although personal strength wasn’t paramount in the succession war, as warriors, they still hoped to reach the Martial Peak, to ascend beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and earn the respect of thousands.

There was no contradiction between the succession war and the pursuit of martial arts standpoints.

Only Yang Wei shook his head with a bitter smile, quietly breathing a sigh of relief.

“There’s one more move!” Yang Kai smoothed the rebellious Qi in his chest, smiling lightly as he looked at Liu Qingyao.

The latter’s expression grew serious; no longer daring to underestimate Yang Kai even slightly, surprisingly he shook his head slowly. “No need. You are not my match now! But I admit you have the qualifications to fight me.”

With that, he casually tossed the Mystery-Grade treasure he had snatched earlier directly to Yang Kai, his gaze burning: “I’ll wait for you. Once you enter the Divine Roaming Realm, we shall have a proper fight!”

Yang Kai casually caught the treasure, somewhat surprised. His eyes flickered but he said no more.

Liu Qingyao had not used his full strength in those two moves, Yang Kai knew.

But what Liu Qingyao did not realize was that Yang Kai hadn’t either! The reason Yang Kai took the initiative to start the fight was purely due to the rare Mystery-Grade treasure’s temptation. Without it, he wouldn’t bother sparring with Liu Qingyao.

But it seemed this man was somewhat arrogant, yet not overbearing or hateful.

Now that the treasure was in hand, there was no need to linger.

Seeing the treasure, which Liu Qingyao had won using the Water Moon Azure Wave Armor’s sacrificial power, casually tossed to Yang Kai without a trace of reluctance, everyone’s eyes reddened and their breaths grew hot.

In a flash, the Ninth Brother had once again struck a huge advantage, grabbing two Mystery-Grade treasures first!

Glancing at Yang Wei, Liu Qingyao nodded lightly. “Eldest Young Master, I know your limits. Ninth Young Master indeed has more potential, but I haven’t reached my limits either. We have plenty of time. Let’s see who is stronger in this generation. We will settle this then!”

With that, he turned and left.

The expressions of those present grew complex. When they looked back at Yang Kai, their gazes were filled with newfound caution, as if they had to reevaluate this Ninth Brother.

Yang Kai remained composed. Once Liu Qingyao left, he immediately flew downward.

“Damn, there’s still one more!” Yang Kang snapped back to reality and hurried after him. Eight Mystery-Grade treasures in total: six brothers each got one, Liu Qingyao had one, and the last one had fallen into Po Jing Lake. After witnessing the forbidden seals and Sealing Yuan Curse on the treasure, no one dared to rashly dive into the lake to retrieve it. Until now, that treasure remained untouched.

Hearing Yang Kang’s shout, everyone suddenly woke up, scrambling in fear of losing out.

But no one dared come too close to Yang Kai.

Now that everyone’s Blood Servants were sealed of their True Essence, without their guardians, with Yang Kai’s recent performance, capturing any of them would be easy.

Losing the succession war because of this would be intolerable.

Yang Kai noticed their vigilance and naturally did not waste effort.

In only a short while, the six had returned to their respective camps.

The ninth batch of Heaven-Grade treasures was still being fought over. Most had found owners, with only a few still scattered, constantly changing hands. The scene was even more intense and lively.

The martial artists in the six major camps suffered casualties one after another.

Huo Xingchen had returned. His Huo Family suffered few losses. Two Divine Roaming Realm cultivators at the Fifth Stage were injured but not seriously; other True Essence Realm warriors had lost two or three.

“Young Master Kai!” Huo Xingchen’s face grew dark. “Should I have my father wipe out the Xiang Family and Nan Family?”

Yang Kai looked at him, puzzled by his words.

“Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng brought two groups, doing nothing but opposing us. Damn it, they don’t even consider me in their eyes. Just say the word, and I’ll have my father lead a strike to annihilate the two Nan families tomorrow.”

Yang Kai sneered. “Can’t handle losing? Then don’t join the succession war!”

Huo Xingchen rolled his eyes and muttered, “It’s not about not handling losing, it’s just that their underhandedness is irritating. I know the rules don’t allow private strikes against other powerful forces in the war. But who am I? The rogue scoundrel Huo Xingchen. I don’t care about rules.”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “No need. They will pay the price sooner or later.”

He was well aware of the situation. Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng bore great grudges against him and had targeted him accordingly. Yet private revenge was impossible—it would only unsettle all factions, and then no one would dare participate in the succession war.

“Fine, as you say.” Huo Xingchen agreed. “But mark my words, it’s not just those Nan families; that shameless Lü Song is included. When I finally confront them, I’ll leave no survivors!”

“There will be that day,” Yang Kai sneered.

“Also, that Qiu Ziru is acting odd. Not as obvious as those from the Xiang and Nan families, but still treating us like enemies everywhere. I reckon he’s trying to stabilize his inheritance in the Qiu Family by defeating you.”

Sighing, “Having a sister like Qiu Yimeng makes it tough for him. We’re all from Zhongdu, so in the future, let’s just give him a wide berth.”

He seemed already envisioning victory for their side.

“Enough talk. What’s the situation with that treasure?”

Yang Kai’s gaze shifted toward Po Jing Lake, asking softly.

“Still under the lake,” Huo Xingchen scanned around. “Everyone’s watching, but no one dares to go down.”

Yang Kai nodded. The treasure’s prohibitive seals and the Sealing Yuan Curse made everyone cautious. Whoever descended first would risk activating the defenses and drawing attacks, allowing others to reap benefits. Naturally, no one wanted to be the first.

At the very least, a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator at the Eighth Stage was needed to withstand the attack triggered by the seals. Even then, it was useless—since the Sealing Yuan Curse affected Blood Servants, even an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming cultivator wouldn’t escape it.

In other words, breaking the seals and the Sealing Yuan Curse would require sacrificing at least one Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert.

No one was willing.

Yang Kai frowned, sensing the difficulty.

Not only him—his five brothers showed similar greedy yet troubled expressions.

Yang Kai had snatched two Mystery-Grade treasures already, granting him an undeniable advantage in the battles to come. Only one treasure remained unclaimed, and everyone eyed it covetously.

Just as all felt stuck, a violent energy ripple suddenly rose from the bottom of Po Jing Lake.

The six members of the Yang Family by the lakeside changed their expressions in unison, quickly glancing at each other.

This energy fluctuation clearly indicated that the treasure’s seals had been triggered.

Someone had secretly entered the lake’s depths? Which faction?

Yang Kai’s expression stiffened as he noticed his five older brothers shared the same doubt, all suspicious of others.

No time to think further, his powerful Divine Sense immediately penetrated the lake bottom.

Boom...

A tremendous roar erupted. Po Jing Lake underwent a cataclysmic upheaval. The bloodstained waters surged violently like dragons leaping from the sea, blasted tens of zhang into the air, then poured back down spectacularly.

Yang Kai’s gaze grew sharp as he searched through the turbulent waters.

A faint, ghostly glow caught his eye—the Mystery-Grade treasure fallen into the lake.

As the treasure appeared, it launched streams of blue energy.

The Sealing Yuan Curse!

This curse wrapped tight around the void, circling multiple times. A blurred figure appeared faintly amidst the flying water, bound helplessly by the curse, unable to move.

“It’s him!” The frequently silent Ying Jiu exclaimed in shock.

Without a second thought, Yang Kai took off in place and charged towards Po Jing Lake. A cold smile sharp as a blade curved on his lips as he activated his True Essence.

In a flash, the Shura Sword appeared in his hand. As he surged forward, overwhelming sword light spread like wings along his sides. Wielding the long sword, beams of sword light shot forth.

He recognized the indistinct figure.

It was the mysterious expert who had sneaked near the pill room that morning!

He hadn’t expected such boldness, daring to infiltrate here. Most likely, he had slipped into the lake’s depths while Yang Kai and Liu Qingyao were engaged in battle.

With Blood Servants’ True Essence sealed, no one had sensed his presence. Yang Kai, the only one with Divine Sense capable of detecting aura, had been distracted, giving him the edge.

However, the treasure’s ownership was still undetermined!

Since he had revealed his location under everyone’s watchful eyes, let’s see how you escape now! Yang Kai sneered.

No sooner had the smile spread than the blurred figure bound by the Sealing Yuan Curse exploded again, just like that morning, dissolving into a mist of water...
