## Chapter 1343 — Formation Artificer

Yang Kai didn't need to recover, but to avoid drawing too much attention he made a show of it and found a spot nearby to sit in meditation.

The Spiritual Qi here was far denser than outside, so recovery was naturally twice as effective; before long, the several Saint King Realm who hadn't expended much effort had fully recovered.

Hearing footsteps approaching, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and saw Cai He and Du Sisi walking together; Du Sisi wore that same coquettish expression, while Cai He smiled broadly.

"Do you two need something?" Yang Kai asked, feigning puzzlement as they drew near; though he didn't know why they sought him, he suspected it had something to do with that Formation Talisman.

Sure enough, Cai He cupped his hands and said, "Brother Yang, don't take offense. We're of the same generation, and I won't speak hollow words—I'm here to ask how you intend to deal with the Formation Talisman you just obtained. Do you have any plans to sell it?"

As he asked, Du Sisi fixed him with an eager, expectant gaze, clearly ready to make an offer the moment Yang Kai said he would sell.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "Sorry, I'm rather well-off at the moment; I don't intend to sell it right now."

A trace of regret crossed Cai He's face; though he'd suspected as much, hearing Yang Kai say it himself still left him disappointed.

Du Sisi snorted. "You look like you've never had contact with formations—do you even know what a Formation Talisman is, or what it's used for?"

Yang Kai glanced at her coolly. "Whether I know or not is none of your concern; the item is in my hands, and how I handle it is my freedom."

"You—" Du Sisi's chest heaved as she cried in a petulant tone, "You only obtained the Formation Talisman thanks to everyone's joint effort—would you have had that ability otherwise? Besides, locating the Formation Eye was the credit of Cai He and me. Even if the Talisman's in your hands, I deserve a share!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai stroked his chin, half-smiling. "From the way you put it, it sounds like you intend to seize my Formation Talisman?"

“I never said that—don’t you dare slander me!” Du Sisi’s expression changed slightly as she couldn’t help glancing toward Fei Zhi Tu. After all, Fei Zhi Tu had just said that since the Formation Token was obtained by Yang Kai, it rightfully belonged to him. If Yang Kai now accused her of such a thing, it would be hard for her to explain herself before Fei Zhi Tu.

"Then what does the lady mean by that?" Yang Kai's expression cooled; he had never liked presumptuous women—if they didn't provoke him he tolerated them, but if provoked he was in no mood to show courtesy.

"I... I only meant to represent the Du family in buying your Formation Talisman!" Du Sisi ground her teeth.

"I said, the Formation Talisman is not for sale." Yang Kai shook his head slowly. By now he knew its value; not even the Du family, nor Yingyue Hall would make him part with it. Until he had understood the Talisman's function, he wouldn't give it up lightly.

By invoking the Du family's name, Du Sisi was clearly trying to pressure him, which made Yang Kai feel a measure of resentment.

Upon Yang Kai's flat refusal, Du Sisi sneered. "Don't be so quick to refuse—it's not too late to hear an offer. Our Du family will pay thirty million Saint Crystals!"

"Thirty million... that's a lot of Saint Crystals." Yang Kai chuckled.

That little girl probably had no idea of Dragon Lair Mountain’s true foundation, did she? Did she really think a mere thirty million Saint Crystals could sway him? Cai He, on the other hand, seemed to have heard of Dragon Lair Mountain before—upon hearing this, he sniffed lightly from the side.

"You're still not satisfied with that price?" Du Sisi was clearly taken aback; after all, she'd heard Yang Kai was only an upstart who'd seized a mountain—how could he have seen so many Saint Crystals? Even the Du family would not find it easy to gather such a sum. She herself lacked authority to decide, but since the Formation Talisman was an important matter, she would report back to the family—surely they would approve.

Even if they had to pawn everything, they could scrape together that amount.

Du Sisi's brows knitted; thinking Yang Kai would hike the price, she cursed him inwardly, then added, "Here's what we'll do: if you sell the Talisman to the Du family, we'll not only give you thirty million Saint Crystals, but our family's Formation Masters will craft several potent Formation Plates and Foundations for you—surely that's a sufficient offer?"

"Not for sale!" Yang Kai still shook his head.

Du Sisi looked at Yang Kai as if he were a fool. To be honest, her offer had already been generous, but it hadn't moved him in the slightest. She ground her teeth, hesitated, and seemed ready to increase the bid.

Yang Kai waved his hand to cut off her prattling, frowning. "Miss, be on your way—no matter what the Du family offers, I won't sell the Formation Talisman!"

"You'll regret this!" Du Sisi fumed, stamping her foot, then turned and stalked off, too angry to waste another word on Yang Kai.

Cai He opened his mouth as if to comfort her, but in the end remained silent.

After Du Sisi left, he forced a wry smile. "Brother Yang, please don't take offense. Sisi is pampered and has a certain young-lady temperament; if she offended you, I, Cai, will apologize on her behalf."

Yang Kai looked at him with a half-smile and nodded. "No matter. I won't stoop to her level."

"Then thank you, Brother Yang." Cai He breathed easier and added, "But judging by your manner, it seems you truly don't grasp how precious a Formation Talisman is?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted. "I'm willing to hear the details!"

Cai He chuckled, sat cross-legged opposite Yang Kai, and began to explain.

After Cai He's explanation, Yang Kai finally understood why Du Sisi had been so fixated on the Talisman and realized its rarity.

The path of formations was vast and profound; even a lifetime's devotion might not uncover all its secrets. Formation Talismans, Formation Foundations, Formation Eyes and Gates—these wonders were created by Formation Masters.

And Formation Talismans were an anomaly among them.

On Dark Star nowadays, Formation Masters could no longer produce such Talismans—not only had the methods been lost, but the craftsmen who forged them had vanished.

Rumor had it that long ago there had been a special branch among Formation Masters called the Formation Artificer!

From the name one could infer that Formation Artificers were not only versed in formations but also skilled in the art of forging—only those who combined both and reached a certain attainment could become Formation Artificers, and only they could forge Formation Talismans.

Generally, Formation Masters knew a bit of forging, since they had to craft their own Formation Plates and Foundations.

Similarly, Artificers understood some formation principles; the spirit formations used in forging fell under the realm of formations—this applied to alchemists as well.

It was just that neither delved deeply into the other's field.

Dao of Formations was already so profound that Formation Masters had little time to study forging; over time the special existence of Formation Artificers faded away into history.

Strictly speaking, a Formation Talisman refined by a Formation Artificer embodies the three core attributes of a Formation Foundation, a Formation Plate, and a Secret Treasure.

They did not require complex Formation Plates and Foundations; a single Talisman could perfectly enact a formation's function. In other words, the Formation Talisman Yang Kai held belonged to the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation—if he refined it, he could deploy that formation at will.

Hearing Cai He's words, Yang Kai couldn't help but have his eyes light up.

He had personally experienced the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation's power—the cloud beasts contained within were formidable and overwhelming; even Origin Returning Realm experts like Fei Zhi Tu and Ning Xiangchen had been trapped inside. With this formation aiding him, his strength would certainly rise significantly and he would gain an additional means against enemies.

Moreover, when everyone had been trapped by the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation earlier, the formation's power had not been fully exerted—without a host to govern it, achieving even half its effect was impressive.

If Yang Kai personally set it and drove its power, even an expert like Fei Zhi Tu entering would be certain to die.

Such a lost Formation Talisman carried great significance for Formation Masters; if obtained, one might glean the methods of forging Talismans from it. Compared to arranging formations via cumbersome Foundations and Plates, this was far superior. Moreover, Formation Talismans were akin to Secret Treasure—they could be refined into the body, summoned at will, and need not be feared for being stolen.

The benefits were numerous!

As Cai He explained these matters, his face showed agitation and envy; Yang Kai was well aware of what he was thinking.

Although he hadn't made an offer like Du Sisi, he clearly harbored the same intent—he simply hadn't spoken for the sake of face.

"So, Brother Yang, you now understand the rarity of Formation Talismans?" Cai He asked, looking at Yang Kai with envy.

Yang Kai nodded. "I understand. Thanks for enlightening me, Brother Cai. If one day I fall on hard times and truly must sell this Talisman, I will give the Cai family first consideration!"

Cai He, overjoyed, cupped his hands. "Then thank you for your kindness, Brother Yang. While I too would very much like the Formation Talisman, I truly hope not to see the day you fall so low."

Yang Kai chuckled softly, understanding that what he meant was that he didn’t wish to see Yang Kai fall into ruin one day. He couldn’t help but feel an even better impression of him, thinking that this was indeed someone worth befriending.

The affairs among the three Saint King Realm hadn't escaped Fei Zhi Tu and the others' perception, but the few Origin Returning Realm paid it no mind. Only after Cai He left did Yang Kai furrow his brow in thought.

Formation Artificers... could such a special group still exist in this world?

Though none could be found elsewhere, didn't Dragon Lair Mountain have one?

Yang Yan was not only skilled in forging but also in formations—she was clearly a Formation Artificer. Doesn't that mean she could also forge Formation Talismans?

Moreover, when Yang Kai obtained the Formation Talisman, he had sensed a faint aura on it that felt familiar; yet when he tried to recall where he'd seen it, he couldn't, which left him somewhat uneasy.
