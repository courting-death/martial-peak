## Chapter 2598 — Heaven’s Punisher Sword

"What’s going on, this power..."

"Not good, the Blood Gate’s restriction is reviving again."

"Sirs, please retreat quickly, or something unexpected may happen!"

The Yao Kings all cried out in alarm, voices overlapping. The only reason they could approach here was because the Blood Gate had recently changed, and that mysterious restrictive force had temporarily vanished. In the past, it was impossible to get within ten li of the Blood Gate.

But now, that mysterious force which had disappeared without reason seemed to have returned, making all the Yao Kings feel suppressed in an instant. Moreover, as time passed, this suppressive force only grew stronger.

The Saint Venerables clearly noticed this as well. Their cultivation, far surpassing the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, was actually suppressed down to the level of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm in a short span of time.

In other words, at this moment, any human martial artist at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm could fight them to a standstill.

Over the years, they had come to investigate the Blood Gate many times and knew well how terrifying this suppressive force was. This was only the beginning—if the suppression reached its limit, it could even push their strength below the Emperor Realm.

"You all go first," Fan Wu waved his hand and said.

Although the Yao Kings were formidable, they were still no match for the Four Great Saint Venerables. If they lingered any longer, disaster would surely befall them.

Upon receiving the order, the many Yao Kings and Saint Envoys felt as though they had just been spared a death sentence and immediately fled outward. Even as they withdrew, they did not forget to take along all the subdued members of the Stone Spirit Race.

In no time at all, only the Four Great Saint Venerables, Yang Kai, Ruoxi, and the Third Disciple remained at the scene.

The Four Great Saint Venerables possessed extraordinary cultivation. Although suppressed by the Blood Gate’s restriction, they were not in any immediate danger. As for Yang Kai, Ruoxi, and Third Disciple, they were not natives of the Ancient Land, nor were they yao, so the suppressive force did not affect them.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze was fixed on Zhang Ruoxi.

The young girl, still kneeling on the ground with her head lowered, remained motionless. The violent aura had also receded. Yet within her petite body, a power that made even the Four Great Saint Venerables tremble in fear was awakening.

"Bloodline power," Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit up as he vaguely realized what was happening.

All along, Ruoxi’s bloodline power had been a mystery. Yang Kai had always hoped to help Zhang Ruoxi unravel the secrets hidden within her bloodline, but he had never found a good way.

Last time, when they met the Mortal Great Emperor, Duan Hongchen seemed to have noticed something, but that old fellow acted all mysterious and never explained, only whetting Yang Kai’s curiosity and leaving him helplessly frustrated.

Yang Kai never imagined that this time, because of himself, under the matchless anger and despair, and the desperate longing for power, Ruoxi’s bloodline power would fully awaken.

"What did you say, boy?" Shi Huo lowered his head and glared angrily at Yang Kai. He vaguely heard Yang Kai mutter something, but his attention was all on Zhang Ruoxi, so he didn’t catch it clearly.

"None of your damn business," Yang Kai looked up at him with contempt, sneering coldly.

"You’re courting death, boy!" Shi Huo roared in fury.

"Don’t stir up more trouble," Fan Wu suddenly barked, his face full of anger. Zhang Ruoxi’s drastic change made him inexplicably uneasy, and all of it was because of Yang Kai.

If they made things difficult for Yang Kai now, who knew what that girl would become?

No matter what secrets were in her body, since it involved the Blood Gate, Fan Wu could not take it lightly.

Shi Huo shook his head in displeasure, not daring to provoke Yang Kai any further.

Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to tangle with him either. If Shi Huo insisted, he would just go all out and fight. He had endured humiliation just to get Ruoxi and the Stone Spirit Race out first.

Turning his head, Yang Kai called softly, "Ruoxi, Ruoxi..."

He called out more than a dozen times, but Ruoxi showed no reaction, making Yang Kai frown deeply.

"I have a bad feeling about this," Cang Gou couldn’t help but swallow, his face full of dread.

With his strength, even if a Great Emperor came, it wouldn’t scare him like this. If he couldn’t win, he could always run. But looking at the frail girl kneeling over there, he felt a chill from the bottom of his heart.

Luan Feng and Fan Wu exchanged glances, both seeing shock and unease in each other’s eyes.

Shi Huo said irritably, "I want to kill her. This feeling... this Lord really doesn’t like it."

As he spoke, he strode toward Zhang Ruoxi.

But after only two steps, Zhang Ruoxi, who had been silent, suddenly spoke in a low voice, "I understand now."

"What?" The Four Great Saint Venerables looked at her in surprise and doubt.

Ruoxi slowly raised her head, but her delicate face was icy cold, and her crimson eyes were terrifying to behold.

"Ruoxi..." Yang Kai was stunned. In all the years he’d known her, he had never seen her like this. Was this still the Ruoxi he knew?

The girl let out a gentle breath, gracefully stood up from the ground, brushed the dust from her dress, turned her head, and looked coldly at Shi Huo. Her lips parted: "Big rock, did you just say you wanted to kill me?"

Stared at by those seemingly emotionless eyes, Shi Huo’s whole body stiffened, a chill running from his head to his heels. Yet, with all the Yao Kings watching from ten li away, he forced himself to say, "So what if I did?"

Ruoxi nodded, said nothing more, and swept her beautiful eyes in Yang Kai’s direction.

Their eyes met. Yang Kai frowned, full of worry, but before he could ask anything, Ruoxi looked away, as if she didn’t know him at all.

This made Yang Kai’s heart sink. He couldn’t understand what had changed in Ruoxi. That look felt so unfamiliar, it made his heart ache.

Ruoxi raised her hand, and suddenly something appeared in her jade-like palm.

It was a jade disc shimmering with faint spatial power, exquisite and flawless.

"Ethereal Jade Disc."

Yang Kai frowned, not knowing why Zhang Ruoxi would take out the Ethereal Jade Disc at this moment. This was the Zhang Family’s ancestral heirloom, which Yang Kai had kept until just before entering the Ancient Land, when he handed it to Ruoxi, thinking her strength was finally enough to explore its mysteries. Perhaps it could help her unlock the secrets of her bloodline.

Yet Ruoxi had never discovered anything, and he hadn’t expected her to take it out now.

As Yang Kai watched, Ruoxi flicked her finger, and the Ethereal Jade Disc suddenly turned into a stream of light, shooting toward the Blood Gate.

The silvery light embedded itself in the Blood Gate, dyeing the blood-red surface with a layer of pure white.

In the next instant, the Ethereal Jade Disc began to flash with all sorts of patterns like a fairyland, and as these patterns flickered, a crisp cracking sound echoed through the world.

It was as if a long-sealed door was slowly opening, and a shocking aura was spreading out from within.

"The key to the Blood Gate, the key to the Blood Gate!" Fan Wu, after watching for a while with furrowed brows, suddenly changed expression, exclaiming in shock. He stared wide-eyed at Zhang Ruoxi, horrified: "How do you have the key to the Blood Gate?"

Luan Feng couldn’t help but cover her lips, staring dazedly at the Blood Gate, murmuring, "The Blood Gate... has been opened."

Rumble...

The sound of the door opening finally rang out. Within the Blood Gate, dazzling lights and wondrous scenery flickered in and out of view. It seemed as if a magnificent palace stood within, yet it was shrouded in clouds, making it impossible to see clearly.

"The key to the Blood Gate?" Yang Kai was full of amazement, his expression changing rapidly.

He had studied the Ethereal Jade Disc for quite some time, but never imagined it was actually a key.

A key to open the Blood Gate.

Thinking about it, all those beautiful scenes that had flashed across the Ethereal Jade Disc before must have been sights from inside the Blood Gate. That palace was the legendary Divine Spirit Palace.

"Do you wonder... why I have the key to the Blood Gate?" Ruoxi replied lightly, her tone gentle, but to Fan Wu it sounded like a devil’s whisper, making him involuntarily retreat several steps, his face pale.

Ruoxi raised a hand and beckoned toward the Blood Gate, as if summoning something.

Whoosh—

A stream of light shot out from within the Blood Gate and landed in her hand.

Clang—

The sound of a sword rang out. Only now did everyone see that what had flown out from the Blood Gate was a sword—a most exquisite and beautiful sword. Its blade gleamed like a mirror, the hilt was carved with dragons and phoenixes, and a red tassel at the end danced with life, as if it were alive.

With the sword in hand, Ruoxi’s aura surged, her power now no less than that of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

Crash—

Suddenly, a solid phantom appeared behind Ruoxi.

Yang Kai stared with wide eyes, dumbfounded by the sight.

He had seen this phantom more than once, but every time it left him deeply shaken.

It was the phantom of a giant woman, her long hair draped down her back, head slightly raised, expression cold and indifferent. She looked somewhat like Ruoxi, both hands resting on a sheathed greatsword, standing quietly behind her like Ruoxi’s elongated shadow.

"Heaven’s Punisher Sword!" Fan Wu could no longer hold back, crying out in shock. All color drained from his face.

Not just him—the other three Saint Venerables all looked as if they had seen a ghost, each one filled with terror, their eyes brimming with fear.

“You are actually a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher!” Luan Feng’s face drained of color, and bitterness filled her mouth.

Cang Gou trembled all over, barely able to stand.

Shi Huo’s mind went blank, and he nearly fainted on the spot.

As descendants of Divine Spirits, inheriting their ancestors’ Origin Power and memories, no one understood the terror of Heaven’s Punisher better than they did.

The era in which Heaven’s Punisher walked was undoubtedly a time of utter calamity for all Divine Spirits. She slaughtered ninety percent of the world’s Divine Spirits, sealing countless Origin Powers within the Divine Spirit Palace inside the Blood Gate, never to see the light of day. The mere mention of her name struck fear into the hearts of Divine Spirits everywhere, leaving them in constant dread.
