## Chapter 2184 — Gathering of Heroes

Zhuang Bufan paid no heed to Yang Kai’s words. The usually calm expression on his face now flickered with a hint of madness. He declared in a clear, ringing voice, “In Zhuang Bufan’s world, there is no such thing as retreat!”

"Good!" Yang Kai roared, the dazzling golden light growing even brighter. His whole body trembled as Origin Qi surged out from within, madly pressing downward. "Since that's the case, I'll grant your wish!"

Boom...

Accompanied by a thunderous sound, the golden light completely suppressed the white glow, gradually devouring it. Where Zhuang Bufan stood, a massive pit had already formed. Atop the mountain, sand and stones flew, and the winds and clouds changed in an instant.

Amidst the blinding light, a figure suddenly shot out, coming to a stop in midair, gasping for breath, his whole body drenched in blood.

The few from Wuhua Hall looked over, their hearts shaken to the core.

Although they couldn’t clearly see who was standing in the void, judging from the posture and the contest of Origin Qi just now, there was no doubt—it had to be Yang Kai.

They turned their eyes to the giant pit, only to see Zhuang Bufan kneeling on one knee, his clothes in tatters, hair disheveled, and body covered in blood, looking utterly miserable.

"Senior Brother Zhuang!" several people cried out.

Zhuang Bufan seemed to have no strength left to respond, merely holding that posture as his body trembled uncontrollably. After a long while he staggered to his feet and looked toward Yang Kai with a complicated expression.

"Thank you for letting me win!" Yang Kai cupped his fists and said in a deep voice.

Zhuang Bufan didn't reply. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground, took out healing and restorative pills from his Spatial Ring, stuffed them into his mouth, and began meditating to recover.

Seeing this, the few from Wuhua Hall glared at Yang Kai, their eyes blazing. But besides anger, there was also deep fear and shock in their gazes!

Because just now, right before their eyes, Yang Kai, a First Stage cultivator of the Dao Origin Realm, had bested Zhuang Bufan in a contest of Origin Qi. Although the final result looked like mutual injury, a win was still a win!

Could this guy really achieve such a feat? Senior Brother Zhuang actually lost to him in the field of Origin Qi?

Even if it were Xia Sheng or Wuchang, they might not be able to do it, right?

All sorts of thoughts flashed through their minds like lightning. They no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest. In their eyes, Yang Kai was now an existence on par with Zhuang Bufan! Perhaps even more terrifying than their own Senior Brother, because right now... he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If he advanced to the Third Stage, who in the world could be his match among Dao Origin Realm cultivators?

This person... might just be a dazzling new star in the Star Realm. One day in the future, he will surely shine with a brilliant light, illuminating the entire sky of the Star Realm!

On the other side, Yang Kai slowly descended, sat cross-legged, and took out handfuls of Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring, stuffing them all into his mouth.

Although his condition looked much better than Zhuang Bufan's, and his recovery ability was extremely strong, after such a fierce battle, his strength was no longer at its peak. He needed to recover as quickly as possible to deal with any trouble that might arise next.

As for Zhuang Bufan, Yang Kai figured he wouldn't try to snatch anything again. This man acted openly and uprightly—since he had lost, he surely wouldn't covet the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus any longer. On this point, Yang Kai felt at ease.

"Yo..." Suddenly, a shout rang out from somewhere, and a figure appeared not far behind. The newcomer glanced around casually, then laughed, "So it was you two making all this commotion!"

"Oh?" Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately opened his eyes, a faint smile appearing as he said, "The second to arrive is you... Brother Xia!"

He didn't need to look back to know the newcomer was definitely Xia Sheng.

In that instant, he couldn't help but feel much more at ease.

He had truly been worried that Wuchang would suddenly show up at this moment. After all, he urgently needed to recover, and if Wuchang came, it would be troublesome. Xia Sheng was different—at least he knew Yang Kai and probably wouldn't act rashly.

"Of course it's me." Xia Sheng smiled slightly. "Seeing the entrance about to close, I was planning to wait over there for the Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters to return together, but then I noticed some strange phenomena and fighting here, so I came to join the fun..."

As he spoke, his gaze sharpened and he said in a deep voice, "Looks like you two just had a fierce battle..."

His tone was tinged with shock.

He hadn't expected Yang Kai's strength to be on par with Zhuang Bufan's. Before this, he thought Yang Kai was impressive, but still far from his own level. Only a handful of people could match him, and Zhuang Bufan was one of them.

But now, Yang Kai and Zhuang Bufan had fought to mutual injury, which spoke volumes.

Although he didn't know who had the upper hand in that fight, what he saw now was enough for him to deduce Yang Kai's strength—he had clearly underestimated him before.

As he spoke, his gaze shifted to the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, his eyes lighting up as he exclaimed, "Whoa... this really is a fine thing. Xiao Bai, do you recognize what this is?"

His last question was directed at Xiao Baiyi, who had just arrived.

No one knew when these two had met up, but Murong Xiaoxiao had come along as well.

"No, never seen it before." Xiao Baiyi stood not far from Xia Sheng, his words concise.

"I don't know either!" Before Xia Sheng could ask her, Murong Xiaoxiao answered on her own.

Xia Sheng shrugged helplessly, his gaze shifting between Yang Kai and Zhuang Bufan. Suddenly, he flashed a sly grin and said, "If no one recognizes it, then let's just swallow it whole. Hmm, I wonder which of you two found it first?"

Yang Kai said nothing, but Zhuang Bufan, having recovered a bit, spoke up: "When I arrived, Brother Yang was already here and had driven off quite a few people."

"Brother Yang found it first?" Xia Sheng raised his eyebrows and muttered, "That's troublesome. If Brother Zhuang had found it first, I could just snatch it... but since Brother Yang found it... sigh, even though he's not a disciple of my Qingyang Shrine, he did come in with us. If I tried to snatch it, wouldn't that be unrighteous..."

Yang Kai's face darkened. "Brother Xia, I heard every word you said."

Xia Sheng froze, then chuckled, "No problem, no problem, it's nothing you can't hear. Brother Yang, how about this—let's split the heaven-and-earth treasure in half, that's not too much, right?"

"That's way too much!" Yang Kai replied seriously.

"Then I'll have to snatch it by force." Xia Sheng said solemnly.

Yang Kai glanced at him, expressionless. "Be my guest, Brother Xia!"

"You!" Xia Sheng looked at him helplessly and smiled bitterly. "You just know I won't really do it, don't you?"

Yang Kai chuckled, about to say something when he suddenly frowned, looking around. "Why are so many people coming all of a sudden?"

In his perception, martial artists were flying in from all directions, clearly drawn by the strange phenomena here.

He said oddly, "Isn't there still two days before the entrance closes? It's not time yet, so why is everyone coming back?"

"You don't know!" Xia Sheng shook his head and explained, "Every time the Four Seasons Land opens, there's an unwritten rule: disciples from all the sects and clans return to the entrance about two days early. Everyone exchanges treasures they don't need for things they do. Judging by the date, it's about time for everyone to return."

"There's such a thing!" Yang Kai looked surprised.

"Otherwise, why do you think we came so early?" Xiao Baiyi glanced at Yang Kai and said, "Now you're in trouble."

Yang Kai's face turned bitter as he nodded. "Indeed!"

He had thought there were still two days before the entrance closed, so even if strange phenomena appeared here, not many would come. By tomorrow, when the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus matured, the phenomena would naturally disappear. Who could have guessed that plans never kept pace with change…

Now that so many people were coming, if any conflict broke out, things would get out of hand. Even though Yang Kai was confident in his strength, two fists couldn't beat four hands...

As they spoke, accompanied by the sound of air being torn apart, one martial artist after another appeared around them, all staring at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus with eyes full of amazement and greed.

But with Zhuang Bufan and Xia Sheng present, no one dared to make a move. Still, everyone was clearly scheming, their eyes exchanging complicated messages.

Xiao Baiyi saw this and sneered repeatedly.

Suddenly, Xia Sheng shaded his eyes and looked into the distance, his expression turning serious. "Brother Yang, you'd better be prepared. Someone fierce is coming..."

Before he finished speaking, a familiar angry roar echoed from the distant sky.

"Don't let me catch you, or I'll make you taste every torture under heaven!"

The voice was filled with boundless anger and killing intent. Hearing it, many people felt their hair stand on end and their bodies go cold.

"Wuchang!" someone called out in a low voice, recognizing the owner of the voice. As soon as the name was spoken, many martial artists showed fear and unease.

It was clear that this son of the Southern Territory had left an indelible fear in countless hearts.

But Wuchang's words were puzzling. No one knew who he was chasing, but his fury was sky-high. Judging by his words, it seemed he'd been chasing for a long time without catching up.
