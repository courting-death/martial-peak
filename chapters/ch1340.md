## Chapter 1340 — Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation

The moment Fei Zhi Tu's jade shovel touched the soil of the flowerbed where the Sword Soul Grass grew, a pure white halo radiated out from the Sword Soul Grass, rippling in an uncanny way; at the same time, abnormal energy fluctuations rolled through the area.

Fei Zhi Tu's face changed drastically as he hastily drew back; the old woman, the old man, and another Origin Returning Realm expert all surged with Saint Yuan, wrapping the four younger Saint King Realm disciples in their protection.

The Sword Soul Grass, which had stood erect and sword-like, twisted in that instant and vanished in the blink of an eye, replaced by blinding light that shot out in all directions; as the light writhed and shifted it formed cloud-like masses of differing colors, enveloping everyone.

Two breaths later the surroundings had been transformed beyond recognition; there was no sign of the pavilion or the side rooms they had seen before, no flowerbed, no Sword Soul Grass, and none of the exotic plants used for display—only a void of chaotic sky and an eerie, unfathomable ground.

Where they stood now seemed to be perched atop the clouds; in every direction, above and below, lay countless clouds of varying colors and sizes, and nothing else.

"An array!" Fei Zhi Tu's face went ashen. By now he understood that the Sword Soul Grass had been a trap—once touched the formation would spring up and entrap whoever did so.

Yet the formation's sophistication far exceeded everyone's expectations; among the eight present almost no one had noticed its flaw—only Yang Kai had shouted at the last moment as a warning, but even that cry had come too late.

Thinking this over, Fei Zhi Tu looked at Yang Kai with puzzlement, as if unable to fathom how he had seen the flaw, since even the four Origin Returning Realm experts had been completely unaware earlier.

Yang Kai, of course, knew what he was thinking and before the man could ask spoke up: "I have some knowledge of medicinal arts. The Sword Soul Grass was purple, which means it must be of great age; at that stage the scent it gives off carries a faint, sharp spiciness that pricks the nostrils like an invisible blade."

Fei Zhi Tu looked surprised but asked no further; now that the trap had been sprung and they were trapped inside the array, further questioning was pointless. He turned to Cai He and Du Sisi and asked, "You two are more familiar with formations—have you spotted anything?"

Since the light had burst forth and the clouds had multiplied, Du Sisi and Cai He had been observing intently. At his question Du Sisi's pretty face darkened: "If I'm not mistaken, this should be one of the ancient, wondrous arrays—the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation. It's a long-lost formation!"

"I thought the same!" Cai He nodded at Du Sisi's conjecture.

"The Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation?" Fei Zhi Tu and the three other Origin Returning Realm men exchanged glances, bewildered—none of them had heard of it. "Is it difficult to break? What sort of power does it possess?"

Du Sisi gave a wry smile. "Don't ask about methods to break it yet... let me explain how it forms first. Do you see these clouds around us?"

"Of course! These clouds don't seem like illusions nor simply gatherings of some energy; it's quite strange," the old man Ning Xiangchen nodded.

"Because they are all real clouds!" Du Sisi said, her words startling.

"What?" Fei Zhi Tu and the others' faces drained of color. "You mean they're real clouds?"

"Exactly. The reason the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation became lost is because deploying it requires refining the very clouds in the sky, and even the strongest warriors on Dark Star today lack such capability—naturally they can't set this formation up."

"Refining the clouds in the sky..." Even the well-traveled Fei Zhi Tu and the others were stunned by Du Sisi's claim, dumbfounded and unable to accept it at first.

What sort of powerhouse could possess such a staggering technique that they could refine the clouds themselves? It was simply inconceivable.

Du Sisi ignored their incredulous expressions and continued calmly: "Refining the clouds is only the first step. The array's maker will fuse various attribute energies into those clouds, then extract Demonic Beast essences and meld them in, causing those otherwise dead clouds to gain transforming and attacking capabilities. The clouds in the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation can take the form of cloud-beasts. Depending on the rank of the Demonic Beast essence drawn, the cloud-beasts will have differing ranks; but no matter their rank, these cloud-beasts are extremely difficult to destroy!"

"You mean these things can transform..." Fei Zhi Tu pointed at the countless multi-colored clouds drifting about, his expression turning grim.

Du Sisi needn't answer; as Fei Zhi Tu finished speaking, a dozen of the surrounding clouds warped and writhed, and in the next moment they formed into beasts—each with different shapes and ferocious visages. These cloud-beasts had no flesh and blood; they were composed entirely of cloud, yet infused with vast amounts of pure energy, making them stronger than ordinary Demonic Beasts.

When everyone swept their Divine Sense across the bodies of those cloud-beasts and sensed the energy fluctuations within, Du Sisi slapped her tall chest and went pale, letting out a relieved breath: "It seems our luck holds—we're only dealing with low-tier cloud-beasts."

She couldn't help but feel fortunate—this formation had been laid down in ancient times; who could know what methods its maker had employed? If one or two Tenth-Tier cloud-beasts remained, they would all be buried here.

No matter how formidable Fei Zhi Tu and the others were, they could not stand against a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast—that equated to the strength of a Void King Realm powerhouse.

Having just stepped into an ancient ruin and fallen into such a formation, everyone's spirits sank; they dared not be careless. Fei Zhi Tu barked, "Du girl and Cai lad, find a way to break the array—let those cloud beasts come deal with us!"

"Yes!" Cai He and Du Sisi hurriedly nodded, galvanised to play their parts.

Fei Zhi Tu glanced at Yang Kai and the taciturn Lian Guang: "Take care of yourselves—don't perish here by accident."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. Lian Guang remained silent, but he withdrew from his Spatial Ring a number of palm-sized puppets—delicately crafted and lifelike. With a wave of his hand he scattered them out, then sent Saint Yuan into each with precise control.

In the next moment the puppets suddenly grew, making Yang Kai's eyes light up with astonishment.

It was the first time Yang Kai had seen someone employ puppet arts like this, and for Lian Guang, a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior, to command puppets that emanated energy fluctuations on the level of First to Second Stages of the Saint King Realm was staggering.

There were roughly five or six of them, each differing in shape and size—small as a spirit-serpent, large as a house—each clearly designed for a purpose; combined they would certainly be formidable.

Yang Kai immediately understood why the Lian family enjoyed such renown; it was not undeserved. With Lian Guang's skill alone one could hold the advantage among peers—facing Origin Returning Realm experts one might still find a chance to flee.

Elsewhere Fei Zhi Tu had already presented his Blue Jade Bowl. The round bowl suddenly expanded into a vessel some dozen zhang across; facing the nearby prowling cloud-beasts the bowl poured out like mercury, sending waves of blue light that enveloped one swaggering Ninth-Tier cloud-beast before it could strike. The blue light retracted, ignoring the beast's struggling roars, and drew it into the Blue Jade Bowl.

Yang Kai's expression tightened—he realized he had underestimated the Blue Jade Bowl's power.

At the same time the old man Ning Xiangchen whistled, producing a staff-like secret treasure that multiplied into countless staff-shadows as he swept his arm toward the cloud-beasts; the old woman wielded a net-like secret treasure that unfurled, radiating dazzling tri-colored light that not only hindered the cloud-beasts' movement but carried subtle, deadly effects.

Their immediate counterattack completely enraged the cloud-beasts. Roars echoed forth; aside from the Ninth-Tier beast taken by the Blue Jade Bowl, the remaining ones charged like fiends. Before their shapes even arrived, streams of energy spewed from their mouths, blanketing the air with a rain of light beams.

This sight caused Fei Zhi Tu and the others to alter their expressions. The Blue Jade Bowl rotated and emitted a cerulean glow that wrapped Cai He and Du Sisi in a protective shroud.

"Brother Wen, Du girl and Cai lad are in your care." Fei Zhi Tu left his Blue Jade Bowl and, after instructing the Origin Returning Realm man, surged forward with a torrent of Saint Yuan to confront the cloud-beasts.

Ning Xiangchen brandished his staff-secret treasure and, with the old woman at his side, formed a pincer strike; the three of them instantly scattered seven or eight cloud-beasts.

The other Origin Returning Realm expert surnamed Wen stood motionless. He shouted at the dazed Du Sisi and Cai He: "Aren't you breaking the array yet?"

"Oh!" Cai He and Du Sisi snapped back to attention and simultaneously drew from their spaces several tools specifically for dismantling arrays. After infusing them with Saint Yuan they sprinkled the devices about.

Yang Kai glanced at them and relaxed a little upon seeing they were probing the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation.

Having spent much time with Yang Yan, he naturally knew that the items they had cast out were array plates and array bases—used in setting arrays and also useful in dismantling them.

Moreover, once such tools are refined, even those not versed in array arts can use them to form arrays.

Yang Kai had once wanted Yang Yan to refine a set of powerful array plates for him, but had never found the chance or time. It seemed he would have to ask her to do it after this trip.

Although arrays formed with plates lack the full might of authentic formations and cannot unleash their complete strength, they are reusable so long as the plates remain intact; for someone like Yang Kai who frequently ventures out on perilous journeys, that was an invaluable convenience.
