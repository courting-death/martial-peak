## Chapter 468 — Coercion and Abduction

“You two chat away, hehe.” After the greeting, Fang Ziqi politely stepped back a bit, just in time to meet Huo Xingchen and the others coming from behind.

“Oh? Senior Brother Fang?” Lan Chudie’s beautiful eyes lit up. Although they belonged to different sects, they both came from the same place. Meeting here naturally felt somewhat familiar.

“You are… a Junior Sister of Lingxiao Pavilion?” Fang Ziqi looked somewhat unsure as he tried to recall Lan Chudie.

Lan Chudie smiled and nodded gracefully.

Dong Qinghan frowned slightly, appraising Fang Ziqi from head to toe before suddenly clapping his hands. “I’ve got it! I was wondering why those two girls looked familiar. Turns out they’re the sisters from Blood Battle Gang!”

The last time Dong Qinghan visited Lingxiao Pavilion, he also paid attention to Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang. The Beauty Twins and Fang Ziqi were both leading figures within their respective sects, so he naturally wasn’t unfamiliar with them.

It was just that they had never interacted directly, which is why recognition didn’t come immediately.

This also explained why she had thrown that secret treasure to him.

Everyone present was quite tactful. Seeing Hu Jiao’er’s unsettling expression, they didn’t rashly approach to interfere. Instead, they chatted warmly with Fang Ziqi, secretly pricking their ears to listen to the commotion nearby.

“You came, so why are you hiding from me?” Yang Kai looked at Hu Jiao’er and asked.

“Who’s hiding from you?” Hu Jiao’er snorted lightly, her cheeks flushing red.

“Really not hiding?” Yang Kai’s lips curled into a sly smile as he stepped forward to press her.

“No…” Hu Jiao’er stammered, her beautiful eyes flickering. “I just arrived here today.”

Yang Kai glanced at Hu Mei’er, who smiled sweetly, her lips moving silently as she betrayed her sister without a word.

“Alright then, since you’re here, come back to my mansion with me.” Yang Kai understood she was a little embarrassed, so he didn’t push further.

Hu Jiao’er scoffed, “We’re just visiting War City for fun, not joining your succession war. I’m not going.”

“Mei’er, are you coming?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“I’m going!” Hu Mei’er nodded enthusiastically.

“Mei’er!” Hu Jiao’er called out sharply, her chest rising and falling angrily. She hadn’t expected her younger sister’s stance to be so wavering—that she would agree with Yang Kai just by his casual inquiry.

Hu Mei’er stuck out her delicate tongue and giggled.

“We’re just from a second-rate sect, what help can we be? For what purpose to go there?” Hu Jiao’er looked a little embarrassed as she murmured softly.

Yang Kai suddenly understood—she cared about this.

Among the forces gathering at his mansion, aside from Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu’s Yingyue Sect, which were second-rate sects, the others were all of first-rate caliber. It was no wonder Hu Jiao’er felt somewhat inferior. That was why she kept avoiding him.

“Jiao’er, you and Mei’er in the future will both stand at the pinnacle of this world. Don’t be too concerned about your sect.” Yang Kai looked at her seriously. The last time they met, the twin sisters only had five tiers in the True Essence Realm, but now they both reached the eighth stage, equal to his own cultivation, and their Consonant Spirit Technique was extraordinary. Given time, they would certainly rise above the Divine Roaming Realm.

It could be said that in the future world, both of them would have a place!

“Is that what you think?” Hu Jiao’er’s expression softened, her beautiful eyes shimmering with joy as she looked at Yang Kai. She hadn’t expected him to hold such high regard for her and her sister.

Yang Kai nodded seriously.

“This… Seems like you’re about to succumb.” Huo Xingchen whispered, watching from nearby.

“I gave in long ago.” Fang Ziqi chuckled slyly with a lecherous smile.

“Proud, I admire that!” Young Master Huo shook his folding fan with a grin.

“Hmm, I’ll think about it. If I change my mind, I’ll come to your mansion with Mei’er in a few days.” Hu Jiao’er secretly rejoiced, lightly biting her crimson lips—irresistibly alluring.

Yang Kai beckoned her with a finger.

“What for?” Hu Jiao’er looked puzzled, leaning closer and whispering in his ear.

Yang Kai grinned wickedly, whispering, “If you keep stalling, I’ll reveal your secret to the world!”

“What secret?” Hu Jiao’er’s neck flushed pink. The warm breath of Yang Kai on her ear instantly made her feel restless, as if thousands of ants crawled all over her tender skin, itchy and tingling.

“Your butt—one side’s bigger than the other!” Yang Kai sat upright, chuckling strangely, his eyes glancing deliberately at her lower body.

Under his aggressive gaze, Hu Jiao’er felt as if she had been stripped bare, a chill running through her as her cheeks flushed deep red. Annoyed, she snapped, “I don’t!”

She then casually tucked in her abdomen and raised her hips slightly.

“At this point, whether you come or not, it’s your choice. Mei’er will go with me.” Saying this, he pulled Hu Mei’er along without looking back, heading toward War City.

“Yang Kai, how can you be such a shameless scoundrel?” Hu Jiao’er shouted furiously, grinding her teeth in frustration.

“Shameless scoundrel?” Huo Xingchen rushed over indignantly. “Miss, what has Young Master Kai done to you?”

“None of your damn business!” Hu Jiao’er gave him a cold glare, snorting, then quickly chased after Yang Kai, grabbing one of his arms and shouting, “If you don’t explain clearly to me today, we’re not done!”

“Her temper’s a bit fierce. Seems she only acts meek in front of Young Master Kai.” Huo Xingchen muttered thoughtfully and secretly admired Yang Kai’s skill with women, counting how many beauties were infatuated with him.

More than just the Hu sisters and Fang Ziqi came from Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower; each faction had over twenty people present. Although their overall strength didn’t compare to other forces, their presence showed their intentions.

Previously, because of Lingxiao Pavilion’s conflict, their sect’s experts had been dispatched to the battle against the Cangyun Evil Land, suffering greater losses than others.

Thus, among the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members this time, only a few had reached the Divine Roaming Realm, and even then, their tiers weren’t high.

Because of this, Hu Jiao’er had been reluctant to rely on Yang Kai. Since coming to join the succession war, she must bring some powerful allies, but they only had a few; the highest was a fourth-tier Divine Roaming Realm expert.

Among them was Guan Chile, a third-tier Divine Roaming Realm cultivator.

Yang Kai and Hu Jiao’er bickered all the way back to War City and retrieved their people from an inn.

Yang Kai knew the current predicament of the two factions better than anyone else and had no resentment. On the contrary, he treated them very courteously.

These people also acted cautiously around Yang Kai’s allies, clearly afraid of causing trouble for their sects after last time’s ordeal. They walked on eggshells, careful with every word.

Returning to the mansion, Qiu Yimeng was already there leading a group with a smiling welcome.

As the second most important person in the mansion, Miss Qiu naturally greeted the arrival of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower warmly, chatting intimately with the Hu sisters, simultaneously casting occasional glances at Yang Kai.

She keenly noticed the twin sisters’ unusual attitude toward Yang Kai and secretly gritted her teeth at him—a lecher who, even out for a trip, managed to seduce two beauties.

After the war came a pile of troublesome matters.

Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members were arranged by Qiu Yimeng to stay, while the major forces tallied their gains and losses.

The results came swiftly.

This treasure hunting battle cost Yang Kai’s side around thirty to forty casualties, including four Divine Roaming Realm experts; the rest were True Essence Realm cultivators. Luckily, this loss was offset by the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower arrivals.

There was no mourning or grief; everyone came prepared for the succession war.

Out of the one thousand secret treasures, Yang Kai’s men secured nearly two hundred.

How to distribute these two hundred treasures of varying quality was left entirely to Qiu Yimeng, leaving her to wrack her brains.

Though the number seemed large, after allocation it was still insufficient. Yang Kai trusted Qiu Yimeng’s ability to maintain balance without sowing discord among the forces.

Back in his room, Yang Kai saw Xia Ningshang asleep with her head on the table.

The Little Senior Sister had been busy refining pills; although the Yao Wang Valley people had gradually adapted to her methods and cooperated, prolonged exertion had taken a heavy toll on her stamina and spirit.

The noise of the door opening woke her. Seeing Yang Kai return safe and sound, she sighed in relief.

He lifted her gently in his arms, and the Little Senior Sister seemed accustomed to this intimacy. Apart from a faint blush on her cheeks, she no longer panicked as she once did.

Softly laying her on the bed and tucking in the covers, Yang Kai sat by the bedside. After a moment, he heard her breathing even out.

He smiled slightly, stroking her hair, staring at the veiled face. His heart stirred restlessly.

Until now, Yang Kai had never seen her full face. The closest was in the Nine Yin Valley when he kissed her and lifted half the veil.

It was impossible not to be curious about Little Senior Sister’s appearance.

He was sure that if he asked, she would unveil herself.

But... this veil of mystery was also one of Xia Ningshang’s most alluring qualities.

After a brief hesitation, Yang Kai abandoned the thought of lifting her veil, quietly leaving the room, gazing at the crescent moon overhead—just like the eyes Xia Ningshang showed when she smiled.

“Ying Jiu!” Yang Kai called out.

From the darkness, a slender figure emerged. Even after losing all True Essence, Ying Jiu’s instinct for concealment was second nature.

“Come with me.”

Ying Jiu nodded slightly, saying nothing.

They walked to the next room, and Yang Kai gently knocked. There was a voice from inside—Meng Wuya said, “Come in.”

Yang Kai pushed open the door.

Shopkeeper Meng sat cross-legged on the bed, silently circulating profound skills.

When Ying Jiu looked at him, his usually expressionless, calm face—like a still pool—finally showed some emotion. Since Meng Wuya had arrived at the mansion, Ying Jiu had taken a particular interest in him.

Not only Ying Jiu, but Qu Gaoyi and Xiao Shun were also concerned about this person.
