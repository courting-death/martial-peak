## Chapter 1697 — Xiaguang Island

Rebuilding a Sect is a weighty matter; it may require decades or even a century of effort, yet for the moment those Sects and families all felt they should cultivate good relations with Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall, for in the future they would look to these two as their leaders.

In this cataclysm, Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall rapidly accumulated prestige far surpassing that of the old Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, and Star Emperor Mountain; the two forces had already become the most powerful representatives on Dark Star.

One could say the Corpse Spirit Sect's disaster had, in effect, become the catalyst for the swift rise of Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall!

Before the Haijiao Mountain Range a beam of light flashed; Qian Tong and Yang Kai appeared side by side.

Qian Tong glanced sidelong at Yang Kai, astonished to the point of being speechless.

He was now a Void King Realm expert, a step above Yang Kai in cultivation, yet he still could not fathom how Yang Kai had brought him here.

This was absolutely not a simple spatial secret art!

After a moment a shocking conjecture suddenly rose in Qian Tong's mind: "You refined the Dark Star's origin and became a Star Lord?"

Only by becoming a Star Lord could one, in an instant, bring another from Haijiao City to here without that person noticing; coupled with the subtle changes in heaven and earth he had sensed recently, Qian Tong could almost be certain his guess was correct.

"Heh—Elder Qian has sharp eyes. Indeed, I have refined the Dark Star's origin," Yang Kai did not deny — such matters could not be kept hidden, and Qian Tong was no outsider.

Qian Tong went blank for a moment, then wore a strange, rueful smile and said, "I didn't expect you to have outpaced this old man — youth truly is formidable!"

He was somewhat glad for Yang Kai, yet also felt a sting of wounded pride.

“Just luck,” Yang Kai said modestly. He had no intention of becoming arrogant — his ability to refine the Stellar Origin was entirely thanks to Yang Yan. On his own, he would have needed to reach at least the Third Stage of the Void King Realm before even attempting it. The Dark Star’s origin had been sealed within Yang Yan’s Sea of Consciousness for tens of thousands of years and had long grown restless. Once Yang Kai accepted it, it willingly submitted to his refinement.

That truly was luck.

"If that is so, then there's no need for me to act — it's down to you now." Qian Tong chuckled, quickly returning to his usual demeanor without envy or jealousy, and stepped back to watch quietly.

Yang Kai said nothing further; his Divine Sense expanded, sweeping every corner of the Haijiao Mountain Range, and upon sensing only the presence of the Corpse Spirit Race within, he suddenly raised both hands — forming a posture of supporting the heavens — and slowly ascended.

With his motion the entire Haijiao Mountain Range trembled; violent sounds rang out from within the mountains, rumbling like war drums beating underground, the noise spreading to every corner of the range.

Visibly, the mountain range that stretched for over one hundred thousand li rose a fraction upward at a subtle speed.

Qian Tong drew in a cold breath, his heart filled with longing and desire.

This was the might of a Star Lord — with a single thought one could overturn seas and fields, move mountains, and alter the land itself...

And yet Yang Kai was using a method that would not destroy the mountain; otherwise he could have simply flattened the entire range.

Such a technique was beyond Qian Tong's capability — even if he were to exert himself fully he could not achieve this.

The mountain's abnormality alarmed the Corpse Spirit Race hiding within; countless of them shot out to investigate, only to find in horror that the entire range had been sealed by an invisible force — they could neither fly nor escape.

The very place they relied on for hiding and survival had become a cage.

The Corpse Spirit Race cried out in panic, bewildered and terrified, utterly at a loss for what had occurred.

In barely a dozen breaths the Haijiao Mountain Range had been lifted one zhang. Yang Kai exhaled softly and the upward-dragging palm suddenly pressed down.

Rumble...

The mountain range stretching over one hundred thousand li crashed back down.

The earth shook violently; an endless stream of explosive sounds burst forth from the mountains, and the Spiritual Qi seemed to take the form of killing blades, rampaging through the bodies of the Corpse Spirit Race.

Crack, crack, crack...

One by one the Corpse Spirits were shattered into powder and vanished.

After the tumult subsided, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense and found no trace of the Corpse Spirit Race in the Haijiao Mountain Range; the several thousand who had fled here had without exception been slaughtered.

Qian Tong watched in awe; after a long moment he let out a breath and said, "This cataclysm ends here, does it not?"

"Once their Sect leader is slain, we can truly be at ease," Yang Kai replied with a faint smile.

"This will require you to expend some effort. I... hm, when you've killed him I will tell you about this matter — no need to rush for now." Qian Tong clearly had something unsaid but did not wish to speak of it at present.

It was clear that Qian Tong had matters left unspoken, but since he wasn’t ready to share, Yang Kai had no intention of pressing him.

The two parted shortly after; Qian Tong returned to Yingyue Hall to preside over his Sect's reconstruction, while Yang Kai set off straight for Wuyou Sea — this trip he intended to hunt down the Insect Emperor and remove him from the world.

Earlier, while searching for the Corpse Spirit Race, he had noted the Insect Emperor's aura but had been unable to locate him.

So he fixed his target on Wuyou Sea, confident in his judgment.

Dark Star was vast; the sea powers and the land powers were essentially two different systems, and cultivators seldom interfered in each other's affairs. Thus, although the Corpse Spirit Sect had wreaked havoc inland and many major Sects suffered heavy losses, the deep-sea powers were largely unaffected.

For that reason many of the Corpse Spirit Race attempted to flee into Wuyou Sea to avoid pursuit by the great Sects.

Yang Kai had been to Wuyou Sea before — when leaving the Imperial Garden he had passed by, but at that time he had been anxious to return to his Sect, and what he had seen of Wuyou Sea was only the tip of the iceberg.

On this trip he specifically sought the Insect Emperor's whereabouts, and along the way experienced customs and scenes utterly different from those of the land.

The deep-sea powers were by no means to be underestimated; many islands were garrisoned by powerful cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yet now that he had become the lord of Dark Star, land and sea made no difference to him — all on Dark Star could be easily dominated by him.

Xiaguang Island belonged to the largest Sect among the deep-sea forces, the Sea Hall.

Sea Hall's renown in the deep sea was immense; deep-sea residents might not know Lingxiao Sect or Star Emperor Mountain, but they would certainly have heard of Sea Hall.

This power's years of inheritance were no shorter than those of the old Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect; centuries of accumulation and the wealth of maritime resources had made Sea Hall ever stronger, its influence occupying nearly half of the deep sea's domain.

In the deep sea, Sea Hall was truly a behemoth.

Had it not been that their cultivation methods were mostly water and ice based, causing their strength to be diminished on land, Dark Star might already have belonged solely to Sea Hall; on sea alone they were dominant enough.

Because of these restraints, Sea Hall could only swagger across the deep sea and could not extend its claws onto the land.

On this day Yang Kai arrived at Xiaguang Island, an island roughly a thousand li across.

Even within the deep sea the island was not small; among Sea Hall's islands it ranked within the top ten. Resources and marine produce were abundant near the island, bringing Sea Hall large quantities of cultivation materials each year — a place the Hall treasured.

Yang Kai became a streak of light; the moment he descended onto the island he was detected by Sea Hall's disciples.

Land cultivators and sea cultivators differed notably in dress and complexion, so the instant Yang Kai landed he was surrounded by a patrol of Sea Hall disciples responsible for island security.

Xiaguang Island was not somewhere one could enter at will; all arrivals had to come through designated checkpoints, have their identities verified, and pay a certain number of Saint Crystals before being permitted entry.

Yang Kai's brazen descent from the sky was undoubtedly a provocation against Sea Hall.

The Sea Hall disciples wore grim expressions; though they sensed Yang Kai's great power, they showed little fear.

Yang Kai had no intention of quarreling; he stepped forward once, and then was gone.

"Where did that brat go?" shouted the strongest among them as he searched in all directions, yet he could not find Yang Kai's trace.

The others exchanged uneasy looks, some chilled to the bone.

That someone could vanish without anyone knowing meant that, if he wished, he could take their lives without a trace.

Only then did the Sea Hall disciples feel a touch of real fear.

"Scatter and search for that fellow's trail — I'll report to the island lord!" The leader's expression shifted and he made the decision at once.

An unknown strong cultivator had suddenly arrived on Xiaguang Island; whatever his purpose, the island lord must be informed.

The others roared assent and immediately fanned out.

At a secluded seaside wooden hut Yang Kai appeared leisurely, looked up, and smiled faintly.

The scenery here was beautiful — facing the vast sea with Xiaguang Island at its back. It was sunset, and the remaining rays of light bathed the island in a thousand hues of shimmering radiance. It was indeed an excellent place for rest and recovery.

A few low-ranking cultivators were on guard outside the hut; upon seeing Yang Kai materialize they froze briefly, then — as if taking an unspoken order — all viciously activated their Saint Yuan, produced their Secret Treasures, and rushed at him.

Yang Kai frowned; sensing something amiss in their condition, he did not slay them outright but simply clenched his hand in midair.

The Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth spontaneously curled into firm ropes, binding those low-ranking cultivators so they could not move.

The guards immediately turned ashen, staring at Yang Kai in terror.

“Since I’m already here, you won’t be able to hide from me. Why not come out openly? There’s little point in skulking about,” Yang Kai called toward the wooden hut. With his hands clasped behind his back, he stood quietly in place, waiting.
