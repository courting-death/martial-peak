## Chapter 872 — Master and Servant
These hundred-odd human experts came from twenty or thirty different powers; although most had never met in person, once a name was announced it was usually enough for others to recognize it.

Especially a few among them who had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm — their renown spread across the land.

Elder Chu was one of them.

Ignoring the shouts of those companions who hated the demons, the man called Elder Chu pondered for a moment and then nodded slightly. “If they’re willing to talk, we can listen… I’d like to know what they intend to do and where they’re headed. This direction isn’t toward the Demon Domain but toward the Yao Realm.”

As he spoke, a look of puzzlement crossed his face.

“Talking is fine. They haven’t killed anyone on the way, and they don’t seem intent on stirring up more hatred.” Another man with the bearing of a scholar inclined his head. He appeared middle-aged but was actually older than ninety percent of those present; he too was one of the few who had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Once the two of them spoke, the others fell silent and deferred to their judgment.

The hundred-plus human experts stood solemnly.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, two figures appeared calmly and strode over.

Once the crowd could make out their faces, surprise spread among them.

Leading them was a young man not yet old, with a heroic frame, wearing an ordinary black robe; his steps were steady.

Following him was a stately, mature beauty.

The woman’s cultivation reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; even before she arrived, a pressure emanated that compelled the assembled experts to take her seriously.

But Elder Chu and the others were astonished to find that, although the woman commanded respect and vigilance, the seemingly ordinary youth possessed a presence that could not be ignored.

Even the woman’s radiance was faintly suppressed by him.

The woman kept a half-step behind him like a guard, maintaining a distance exactly half a body’s length away, never overstepping.

This was plainly the posture of a retainer following their master.

Several top experts, including Elder Chu, exchanged glances, all sharing the same puzzlement; they couldn’t deduce the nature of the relationship between the two.

Before long, the pair arrived and stopped some dozen zhang before the crowd.

Up close, Elder Chu and the others found the youth’s eyes bright as stars and spirited; even facing over a hundred human experts, he remained composed, not the least bit afraid. His gaze swept across them as if appraising their cultivations.

The woman stood motionless behind him, waves of surging power issuing from her.

Elder Chu and the others sucked in breath and turned grave.

As soon as Yang Kai stood still, countless divine senses swarmed over him, shamelessly probing his cultivation. Li Rong frowned, her pretty face cold, about to shout a rebuke, but Yang Kai waved her off.

Grinning, Yang Kai clasped his fist. “You’ve all traveled so far and followed us here — thank you for your trouble. I have something I want to clarify with you. Is this a good time?”

Elder Chu and the others frowned and turned their gazes to Yang Kai. Only now did they confirm that the woman truly deferred to the youth; otherwise, on such an important occasion she wouldn’t have allowed him to speak.

“You may.” The man addressed as Elder Chu composed himself and smiled faintly. “We were just about to ask the same.”

As he spoke, the scholar-like middle-aged man and the red-faced elder who had earlier threatened to ambush Yang Kai stepped forward.

Yang Kai nodded inwardly; he knew the three standing before him were the strongest among them — all at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm. They came from different powers and, together, could represent the whole group.

Elder Chu introduced himself: “I am Chu Yi of the Tianmu Palace.”

He then pointed to the middle-aged scholar. “This is Fang Yuebai of the Mist Shroud Tower.”

Then he indicated the red-faced elder, who looked full of hatred: “This is Wu Zheng of the Xiaoyao Divine Sect.”

Yang Kai inclined his head to each in turn in greeting, his expression cordial.

“And what do we call the young brother?” Chu Yi’s gaze burned as he looked at Yang Kai.

“Some among you already know my identity; Elder Chu can ask around if he wishes — you’ll probably discover it easily.” Yang Kai smiled, not answering directly, but instead looking to a spot in the crowd.

There were a few faces he recognized from the time Zhang Ao and Cao Guan attacked the Nine Heavens Sacred Land — they had met Yang Kai then.

Yang Kai didn’t know their names.

At Yang Kai’s appearance, these men revealed signs of unease, as if remembering how, two or three years ago, Yang Kai had swept through the Nine Peaks in a bloodbath.

“Putting on airs — who do you think you are? Elder Chu asked you a question; answer directly!” The red-faced Wu Zheng snorted coldly, clearly displeased with Yang Kai, his gaze full of rejection and contempt.

Yang Kai was puzzled; he didn’t know when he had offended the man.

“Never mind.” Chu Yi chuckled and turned to ask, “Does anyone here know this young brother’s identity?”

A few people stepped forward, came to Chu Yi, and whispered a few words.

After a moment, Chu Yi’s expression changed to one of astonishment; he measured Yang Kai up and down and exclaimed, “So the young brother is the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? My apologies for the oversight!”

Fang Yuebai and Wu Zheng exchanged a look and were clearly shocked as well.

“You flatter me, elder.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Chu Yi suddenly grew serious and narrowed his eyes. “If you are the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, then you should be one of our human kin, right?”

“Of course.”

“Then why are so many demons traveling with you? And from what I see, your relationship with this lady appears… not simple.”

“Not simple?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“It looks like a subordinate relationship — you’re the master and she’s the servant!” Chu Yi frowned and speculated boldly.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai nodded outright. “Elder Chu’s insight is sharp; I admire it. These demons really are under my command and now answer to me.”

Chu Yi froze, unable to hide his disbelief.

Fang Yuebai and Wu Zheng also widened their eyes and looked toward Li Rong as if to glean some clue from her. Even more shocking was that Li Rong didn’t refute them; instead, she looked honored.

Everyone who witnessed this found it impossible to accept.

The Second Stage of the Saint Realm, while not the absolute pinnacle in this world, still marked one of the realm’s powerful figures — a rare expert.

Such a woman, if she wished, could even found her own sect.

She fully had that qualification.

And yet such a powerful figure could be the servant of the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? What merit or astounding method did Yang Kai possess to subdue a Second Stage Saint Realm expert and make her willingly serve him?

For a time many cast ambiguous looks at Yang Kai and Li Rong, thinking Yang Kai must possess some exceptional ability to have won Li Rong’s allegiance.

They felt both admiration and envy.

Sensing their strange gazes, Li Rong’s expression turned cold; her vast divine sense spread out and instantly silenced everyone.

“Ahem…” Chu Yi cleared his throat twice, his old face a little awkward — for an instant his mind had wandered. He quickly dismissed the unfounded suspicion.

A woman of such caliber could not be so easily subdued.

Moreover, there were nearly a thousand demons with them, and several had reached the Saint Realm; it couldn’t be that all of them shared that same kind of relationship with Yang Kai.

Fang Yuebai suddenly laughed. “Although the Saint Lord’s claim is hard to believe, since this lady does not deny it, we’ll take it at face value… but the two of you coming alone, so composed, isn’t that a bit too dismissive of us?”

His sharp words provoked hostility at once. Many turned hostile, glaring at Yang Kai as if ready to attack to prove their power.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and remained calm. Looking at Fang Yuebai he said, “It’s not that I don’t take you all seriously; on the contrary, coming alone shows the sincerity with which I wish to speak. Had I brought a large force, that would show respect but likely end in fighting before we could talk.”

Fang Yuebai froze for a moment and then burst into laughter. “The Saint Lord is truly extraordinary—no wonder you could take up the mantle of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!”

“May we speak properly now?” Yang Kai smiled and inclined his head toward the three.

Fang Yuebai grew serious and nodded; Chu Yi and Wu Zheng offered no objection.

Yang Kai continued, “You all followed us because you sensed a large number of demon activities and, unsure of our intentions, trailed us to see for yourselves, correct?”

“Indeed.” The three nodded. “So many demons appearing on human territory with considerable strength understandably aroused suspicion. Everyone gathered here did so because of that.”

“Rest assured — our destination is near, and we will not harm the human race.”

“Near?” Chu Yi frowned and peered ahead, his expression shifting. “Saint Lord, will you bring those demons into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

“If they’re my people, of course I will find them a place in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. What’s the problem?”

“There’s a problem!” Wu Zheng snorted. “Though you are the new Saint Lord, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is human territory. To settle so many demons there—how can that be dignified?”

“That is my affair; you needn’t concern yourself.” Yang Kai looked at him coolly. “You aren’t going to manage other sects’ internal matters, are you, Elder Wu?”

“You’re courting disaster — sooner or later you’ll bring about your own annihilation!” Wu Zheng sneered.
