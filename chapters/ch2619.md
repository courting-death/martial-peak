## Chapter 2619 — Get Lost

"What is it?" Yang Kai turned his head to look at Ji Yao and asked.

"Reporting to Master, these three people inexplicably blocked the way ahead and are preventing us from passing," Ji Yao replied.

"Master?" The three people in front were all extremely astonished when they heard this. After all, judging by appearances, Yang Kai and Ji Yao seemed about the same age, yet this man was actually this cold woman’s master!

The Multi-deck Ship was protected by a defensive array, so even though the old man wanted to probe Yang Kai and Ji Yao’s cultivation, he was powerless to do so.

Still, to be someone’s master, his cultivation shouldn’t be lacking. The old man estimated that Yang Kai was at least in the Emperor Realm. After all, this exquisite Multi-deck Ship was an Imperial Treasure, something an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator could never obtain.

With this thought, the old man smiled slightly at Yang Kai and said, "Young man, don’t be nervous. We mean you no harm."

"Am I nervous?" Yang Kai grinned, inwardly thinking that this old man truly had an inflated opinion of himself. He had braved the Wild Ancient Land, stirred up storms before the Four Great Saint Venerables, the Thirty-Two Yao Kings, and the Eight Saint Envoys, and had met more than one Great Emperor. In this world, there was likely no one left who could make him feel the slightest tension.

The old man ignored this and continued, "It’s just that Miss Xue Man has taken a liking to this Multi-deck Ship, so this old man would like to discuss with you whether you’d be willing to part with it. I can pay to buy this Multi-deck Ship from you."

After a pause, the old man said, "I forgot to introduce myself. I am Yan Qing of the Thunderclap Pavilion, this is our Young Pavilion Master Bai Lu, and this is Miss Yan Xue Man, the daughter of the City Lord of Taiping City."

After the introductions, both the old man and the two young people, a man and a woman, all wore extremely proud expressions, as if the Thunderclap Pavilion and Taiping City were truly remarkable powers.

The Young Pavilion Master Bai Lu smiled gently and cupped his fists, saying, "May I ask the young lady’s name?"

He directly inquired about Ji Yao’s name, not paying any attention to Yang Kai, clearly captivated by Ji Yao’s beauty. Although Miss Xue Man, the City Lord’s daughter, was also outstanding, she paled in comparison to Ji Yao.

As soon as he spoke, Xue Man, standing beside him, fiercely kicked him, glaring angrily and shouting, "Why are you asking that? Have you taken a fancy to her? You bastard! Am I not enough for you? You’re even thinking about someone else? I’ll beat you to death, beat you to death..."

As she spoke, she began punching and kicking Bai Lu, but it was just a flurry of delicate fists and slender legs. Not only did it not hurt him, it actually seemed like she was acting coquettishly, making Bai Lu laugh heartily as he pulled Xue Man into his arms, looking every bit the winner in life.

Yan Qing said expressionlessly, "Young Master and Miss Xue Man are used to fooling around. Please don’t take it to heart."

Ji Yao said coldly, "Your affairs have nothing to do with us. My master and I are in a hurry, so please step aside!"

Yan Qing said, "Young lady, our Young Master only wishes to buy this Multi-deck Ship."

"I said it’s not for sale!" Ji Yao’s expression grew even colder.

Bai Lu smiled gently and said, "There’s no need to be so cold, young lady. As the saying goes, more friends mean more paths. It’s just a Multi-deck Ship. Name your price, and I won’t haggle!"

"Very well!" Yang Kai stepped forward, smiling at Bai Lu. "I like friends like Young Master Bai—capable and wealthy, elegant and generous! Since Young Master Bai is so straightforward, let’s sell the Multi-deck Ship. Yao’er, what do you think?"

Ji Yao frowned slightly but still nodded, "If Master says to sell, then we’ll sell."

Bai Lu cupped his fists and said, "Then I thank you, young lady."

From beginning to end, he had only spoken to Ji Yao, as if he hadn’t even noticed Yang Kai. But now, he finally turned to Yang Kai and asked, "May I ask what price you have in mind?"

"One hundred million!" Yang Kai said calmly. "If Young Master Bai can pay one hundred million, the Multi-deck Ship is yours."

Bai Lu’s expression didn’t change. He nodded slightly and said, "One hundred million... For an Imperial Treasure that can fly, that’s not expensive."

Not just not expensive—downright cheap. He thought Yang Kai was deliberately trying to make friends, since as the Young Pavilion Master of Thunderclap Pavilion, not just anyone could befriend him. Thunderclap Pavilion was a notable force in the Northern Territory. He smiled and said, "Yan Lao, pay him!"

"Yes!" Yan Qing nodded, fiddled with something, then tossed a Spatial Ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, swept it with his Divine Sense, smiled slightly, put the Spatial Ring away, and said, "Young Master Bai, the number of Source Crystals seems a bit off."

"What’s wrong with it?" Bai Lu frowned and looked at Yan Qing. "Yan Lao, did you count carefully?"

Yan Qing said, "One hundred million Source Crystals. This old man couldn’t have made a mistake."

"One hundred million Source Crystals is correct..." Yang Kai nodded, then changed the subject, "But those are all Lower-Level Source Crystals..."

Yan Qing’s expression changed. "You don’t want Lower-Level Source Crystals? Do you mean Middle-Level?"

"What?" Bai Lu was also shocked. One hundred million Middle-Level Source Crystals would be ten billion Lower-Level Source Crystals! This man really dared to ask.

"No, no, no!" Yang Kai wagged a finger. "Not one hundred million Middle-Level Source Crystals... I want one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals!"

"You... you’re insane!" Bai Lu was utterly shaken.

One hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals—Bai Lu couldn’t even imagine such a number, nor could he fathom how this man dared to ask for it.

Thunderclap Pavilion was a notable force, but even if they emptied their coffers, they couldn’t gather so many Upper-Level Source Crystals. Even an Imperial-Grade Multi-deck Ship couldn’t possibly be worth that much.

In that instant, Yan Lao’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.

Yang Kai laughed, "Young Master Bai, you just said you wouldn’t haggle, but now you want to go back on your word? A real man’s word is his bond. Looks like Young Master Bai’s credibility isn’t so great."

Ji Yao covered her mouth and smiled.

When Yang Kai said he’d sell the Multi-deck Ship earlier, she’d felt a bit reluctant, but as a disciple, she couldn’t disobey her master. Only now did she realize Yang Kai never intended to sell her Multi-deck Ship—he was just toying with them.

Since when did Master have such a playful side...

In her memory, Master had always been cold and aloof, only showing warmth to a few disciples. She’d never acted like this before.

As she thought about it, Ji Yao suddenly felt something was off. Her brows furrowed, and she looked at Yang Kai in confusion.

That tall figure didn’t seem quite the same as the one in her memories...

"Brat, you’re playing me!" Bai Lu roared in fury.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "What do you mean by that, Young Master Bai? You three blocked the way of me and my disciple without asking for any reason, insisting on buying Yao’er’s Multi-deck Ship Secret Treasure. I was just kindly fulfilling your wish. If you’re not grateful, fine, but there’s no need to slander me. Or do you really think I’m easy to bully?"

Hearing this, Bai Lu’s anger exploded, his whole body burning like a volcano.

Clearly, it was they who were toying with him, yet with just a few words, Yang Kai had twisted the situation to make himself seem entirely in the right. Bai Lu was so furious he nearly exploded, shouting, "Yan Qing, kill this bastard for me!"

Yan Qing already harbored murderous intent. Hearing Bai Lu’s order, he didn’t hesitate and immediately charged forward.

Bai Lu hurriedly added, "Don’t hurt that young lady!"

Even at this moment, he was still thinking about Ji Yao’s beauty. It was clear that women sometimes had unique advantages.

Yan Lao soared through the air, Emperor Yuan surging, unleashing the full power of a First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivator as he struck at the Multi-deck Ship with his palm.

The Multi-deck Ship’s defenses shattered under this blow, offering no protection at all.

Yang Kai was stunned, sensing something was wrong. The Multi-deck Ship was an Imperial Treasure—its defenses shouldn’t be so weak. He turned to look at Ji Yao, only to see her staring at him in confusion, her beautiful eyes filled with chaos.

"Not good!" Yang Kai was secretly alarmed, not knowing what had gone wrong, but Ji Yao seemed to be having a relapse of her old illness.

Ji Yao had been calm and stable while staying by his side recently, but now, at this critical moment, something had gone wrong.

The reason the Multi-deck Ship’s defenses were so weak was clearly because its owner’s state of mind had wavered.

"Brat, how dare you toy with our Young Pavilion Master! Today, you die!" Yan Lao broke through the Multi-deck Ship’s defenses, confidence surging, and struck at Yang Kai with a palm filled with Emperor Yuan and the fluctuations of Laws, as if to smash him into pulp on the spot.

Yang Kai reached out, pulled the dazed Ji Yao into his arms, enveloped her with Emperor Yuan, and met Yan Lao’s palm head-on, shouting, "Get lost!"

Ji Yao had suddenly fallen ill, and he was deeply worried, no longer in the mood to mess around. This strike was unleashed in anger, far beyond what Yan Qing could withstand. Although they were both at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, for Yang Kai, killing across realms was routine.

Let alone Yan Qing being only a First Stage Emperor—even if he were at the Third Stage, Yang Kai wouldn’t fear him.

Boom...

A thunderous crash sounded, and a fierce wind howled.

As Emperor Yuan collided, Yan Qing grunted, as if struck by lightning. He felt his Emperor Yuan and Laws shatter like bubbles, instantly overwhelmed by a tremendous force that traveled up his arm, shattering it completely into flying pieces of flesh.

With a cry, Yan Qing spat blood and was sent flying backward.

Yang Kai stood in place, shielding Ji Yao, unmoving, like a god descending to the mortal world, imposing and unshakable.

"This..." Bai Lu was stunned, watching Yan Lao fly backward, blood spraying in midair, his body suddenly trembling violently.

Xue Man he’d been holding in his arms also turned pale, her teeth chattering.

How could the two of them not realize they’d provoked a true powerhouse? They’d thought that with Yan Lao, an Emperor Realm cultivator, by their side, taking down that young man would be easy. Who could have expected things to turn out so differently, leaving them unable to accept it.
