## Chapter 10 — Losing Wealth to Ward Off Disaster

Yang Kai did not think too much about it. This was Wumei Town, so close to Lingxiao Pavilion. It was normal for disciples to come down and get some activity.

Soon, Yang Kai arrived at the He Family Rice Shop. The shop occupied two storefronts on the main street and was very busy. One shop assistant bustled inside and outside. The shop owner was calculating accounts on an abacus behind the counter, and the owner’s wife was attending to customers.

After a long wait, fewer people came to buy rice, so Yang Kai finally stepped inside.

“Madam,” Yang Kai greeted. The owner’s wife, about forty years old, looked up and smiled warmly, “Little brother, buying rice again?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai walked straight to the cheapest bag of brown rice and pointed, “I’ll take one bag.”

She nodded while filling the cloth bag with rice, chatting continuously, “Little brother, you only buy once a month. Is that enough to eat?”

Yang Kai replied, “Basically enough.”

“Liar!” She rolled her eyes at him. “Look at how skinny your arms and legs are. If you weren’t hungry, how could you look like this?”

Yang Kai smiled awkwardly, “I also hunt in the mountains, so I don’t get too hungry.”

The owner, seemingly focused on his accounts, didn’t look up but said, “Wife, there’s some old rice there. It’s just sitting there. Give some to the little brother.”

“As you say, husband.” The owner’s wife smiled in agreement.

“How can that be? You’re running a small business too,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand.

The owner’s wife frowned, “What’s wrong with that? That old rice has bugs in it anyway and can’t be sold. But the husband says these rice bugs are more nutritious than white rice. Wait here, I’ll get it for you.”

She said this while walking toward the back room.

Yang Kai’s heart was heavy and complicated. He didn’t know what to say. Recently, every time he came to buy rice, the kind owner and his wife would give him some extra rice and make excuses, like the rice having bugs, but it was actually fine white rice. This made Yang Kai, who once thought the world had no true kindness, feel a little bittersweet.

“Thank you, Uncle He,” Yang Kai’s voice trembled slightly.

The owner smiled and looked up, “A lone man—who hasn’t fallen on hard times? If you’re ever hungry, come here. Our rice shop doesn’t have much, but there’s always enough rice to eat.”

“Thanks.” Yang Kai bowed his head. There were still good people in the world.

As he was feeling grateful, two men entered the shop. The only shop assistant greeted them warmly, but before a word was spoken, one of the men kicked him to the ground.

“Ouch…” The shop assistant fell hard, doing a somersault. He was really down for a while, unable to get up.

	“What happened?” Boss He rushed out from behind the counter. Yang Kai helped the assistant up and looked at the two men. Both looked fierce. One was pale and clutching his belly, weak and frail. The other, who had kicked the assistant, was broad-shouldered and sturdy.

“Who’s the owner?” The stronger man shouted.

“I am, I am.” Boss He quickly answered. Just an ordinary merchant, but these two were clearly rough and armed, with knives at their waists. They looked like trouble, so Boss He dared not be negligent.

“Well, you heartless merchant! You sold poisonous rice to my brother. Look at him now! Once a strong man, now like this after eating your rice. My brother can punch tigers easily, but now he’s near unconscious. You only care about money and don’t value life!”

The scolding terrified Boss He, his face pale as death. “Ah, how could this happen?”

“How would I know? My brother bought rice here this morning, cooked porridge, and ate it. That’s why he’s like this. Luckily, I didn’t eat it or I’d be dead too.”

Sweat poured from Boss He’s forehead as he wiped with his sleeve. “Brave man, there must be some misunderstanding.”

“Misunderstanding? Nonsense! If not for your rice, how else would my brother be like this?” The man roared stubbornly.

Yang Kai watched coldly, taking it all in. He knew Boss He’s character well: kind and generous, often giving him extra rice for free. Such a man wouldn’t poison customers or sell bad rice.

If this spread, who would dare buy rice here? These two were obviously extorting money, though their tactics were cruel, aiming to cut off the rice shop’s livelihood.

Though weak, Yang Kai was a martial artist with youthful passion. Boss He had helped him, so Yang Kai couldn’t stand by. His expression hardened as he stepped forward, coldly saying, “Gentlemen…”

“What?” One of them glared fiercely.

Before Yang Kai could speak, Boss He quickly stepped before him, signaling with a shake of his head.

“Uncle He…” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Losing wealth to ward off disaster!” Boss He whispered softly.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly. Boss He’s words showed he understood the men’s intentions. In business, harmony brings wealth. The commotion had drawn much attention. Lingering would ruin the shop’s reputation.

Though he knew they were extortionists, Boss He had no choice but to comply and send them off quickly.

He forced a smile, saying, “Your brother’s poisoning likely has nothing to do with my rice shop…”

As the men prepared to explode, he added, “But even if unrelated, since you came here, I can’t ignore it. Seeing your brother suffer is painful. You should seek medical help quickly. If funds are tight, I can advance the medical fees.”

This was clearly a concession to end the dispute. His words allowed onlookers to infer the truth and kept the shop’s reputation intact.

But the two men showed no sign of compromise. The stronger one shouted angrily, “You heartless merchant treat us like bandits! My brother and I live upright lives with clear conscience. Yet you sell poisonous rice! Where’s your conscience?”

Their words rang with righteous indignation, but Yang Kai sneered silently. Upright and clear conscience? What a joke.

Boss He was stunned, unsure how to handle this.

Just then, a graceful youth stepped from the crowd. About Yang Kai’s age, handsome and well-groomed, with rosy lips and white teeth. Clearly far better off than Yang Kai.

The youth casually circled the two men, clicking his tongue and making comments.

The crowd was confused, but Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. He suddenly recalled seeing these three earlier in an alley.

The strong man had glared at him before, and this youth was also there.

Were these three together? Yang Kai smelled a strong scent of trickery.
