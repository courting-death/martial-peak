## Chapter 10 — Losing Wealth to Avert Disaster

Yet Yang Kai gave it little thought. This was Wumei Town, so close to Lingxiao Pavilion; it was perfectly ordinary for disciples to come down and get some exercise.

Before long, Yang Kai arrived at the He Family Rice Shop. The shop occupied two storefronts on the street, business bustling, with a clerk busily running here and there. The shop owner sat behind the counter, diligently calculating numbers on an abacus, while the owner’s wife attended to the customers.

After waiting a good while, as the crowd buying rice gradually thinned, Yang Kai finally stepped inside the shop.

“Madam,” Yang Kai greeted. The woman, about forty years old, looked up upon hearing his voice and immediately smiled. “Young brother, buying rice again, are you?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai strode directly to the cheapest bag of brown rice and pointed at it. “A bag of this, please.”

The madam nodded, filling a cloth sack with rice while chattering on. “Young brother, you only buy rice once a month; is this really enough to eat?”

Yang Kai replied, “Basically, it is.”

“Lying!” The madam shot Yang Kai a glance. “Look at your arms and legs, so thin. If you were eating well, would you look like this?”

Yang Kai smiled awkwardly. “I also go hunting in the mountains. So I don’t go hungry.”

From behind the counter, the owner, who seemed deeply focused on tallying accounts, without looking up said, “Wife, there’s some old rice over there. It’s just sitting there, just give it to the young brother.”

“All according to the master’s word,” the madam answered, smiling.

“How can that be? You run a small business,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand.

The madam put on a stern face. “What harm is there? Those old rice grains are infested with worms and unsellable. But the master says that these worms are even more nutritious than white rice. Wait here, I’ll bring it to you.”

She said this as she headed to the back hall.

Yang Kai’s heart churned with mixed feelings, unable to find words. Every time he came here to buy rice recently, the kindhearted master and madam would always give him some extra, always excusing it by saying things like the rice was infested with worms, but in fact, it was high-quality white rice. This made Yang Kai, who once thought the world had no true kindness, feel a little bittersweet.

“Thank you, Uncle He,” Yang Kai’s voice trembled slightly.

The owner smiled and looked up, “A lone man—who hasn’t fallen on hard times? If you’re ever hungry, come here. Our rice shop doesn’t have much, but there’s always enough rice to eat.”

“Yes," Yang Kai bowed his head. There were still good people in this world.

Just as he was lost in this feeling, two men arrived at the rice shop. The only clerk inside greeted them warmly, but before he could even speak, one of the men kicked him hard to the ground.

“Ah!” The clerk fell butt-first onto the floor, rolling over completely. It was a harsh fall, and he didn’t get up for quite a while.

“What’s going on?” Owner He hurriedly ran out from behind the counter, while Yang Kai helped the clerk to his feet, eyes fixed on the two arrivals. The two men bore ferocious expressions; one’s complexion was pale and flushed, clutching his stomach weakly. The other man, broad-shouldered and muscular, supported him—this was the one who had kicked the clerk.

“Who is the owner?” the supporting man bellowed.

“I am! I am!” Owner He hurriedly answered. As a simple merchant, he was clearly intimidated by these two burly men, who were laden with knives and swords and looked dangerous. He dared not slack.

“Well then, you black-hearted shopkeeper, you sold my brother poisoned rice. Look at him now—once a robust man, now like this after eating your rice. My brother regularly punches tigers without breaking a sweat, but now he’s near unconscious. You black-hearted merchant only care about money and don’t value human life!” 

The one supporting his brother raged at owner He, who turned pale as a corpse. “Ah, how could this happen? How could it be?”

“How would I know? My brother bought rice from your shop this morning. He cooked some porridge, ate it, and turned like this. Luckily, I didn’t eat any, or else I’d be dead and gone with him!”

Owner He's forehead broke out in cold sweat as he wiped it repeatedly with his sleeve. “Sirs, I believe there is some misunderstanding here.”

“Misunderstanding? Bullshit! If he hadn’t eaten your rice, how could he be like this?” The burly man shouted fiercely.

Yang Kai observed coldly, taking it all in. He knew perfectly well the nature of owner He, who had helped him now and then and so freely given him gifts. Such a kind man would never commit such a cruel act. Even if owner He were a malicious merchant, surely he would not poison the rice he sold.

If this got out, who would buy from him anymore? How could his business survive?

These two men’s pretext was lousy and unconvincing.

Obviously, they came to extort money. But their means were ruthless—almost cutting off the shop’s financial means!

Though Yang Kai’s frame was slender, he was a martial artist, with the hot-blooded spirit of youth. Since owner He had shown him kindness, Yang Kai could not stand idly by. He stiffened his face and stepped forward, voice cold, “Gentlemen..."

“What?” one of the men glared fiercely at Yang Kai, his temper escalating.

Before Yang Kai could speak, owner He quickly stepped in front of him, making a hand gesture and slowly shaking his head.

“Uncle He...” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Losing wealth to avert disaster!” owner He said softly.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly. Hearing this, it was clear owner He had also caught onto these men’s scheme. However, conducting business requires harmony, and the ruckus had already drawn many onlookers. If the quarrel dragged on, the shop's reputation might be forever stained.

Though knowing they intended to extort, owner He had no choice but to humor them, merely to hurriedly chase these two harbingers of misfortune away.

Reluctantly, owner He smiled and said, “The poisoning of your brother is most likely unrelated to my rice shop…”

Hearing this, the two men bristled with anger, but owner He continued, “However, even if unrelated, since you have come to my shop, I, He, cannot turn a blind eye. Seeing your brother in such distress troubles my heart. You must consult a healer quickly. Of course, if funds are tight, I can advance medical fees for you.”

These words plainly showed owner He intended to lose wealth to avert the disaster. If these two men were truly attempting to extort money, they would take this deal and leave. Moreover, owner He’s words allowed the bystanders to infer the truth; the shop's reputation would not suffer—truly a flawless tactic.

Unexpectedly, the two men showed no hint of compromise. The man supporting the weak one growled furiously, “You black-hearted shopkeeper, you treat my brother and me like common bandits? This is unbearable! My brother and I walk upright and straight, with clear conscience. It is you, black-hearted merchant, who sells poisoned rice! Where is your conscience?”

His words were righteous and forceful. Yang Kai listened with a sneer. With this behavior, they were upright and clear-minded? Clear conscience of a lifetime?

Owner He froze on the spot. What? Weren’t these two here to extort money?

Unsure how to proceed, suddenly a graceful young man stepped out from the crowd. This youth was about the same age as Yang Kai, handsome and refined, lips red, teeth white—a stark contrast to Yang Kai’s modest appearance.

The youth strolled to the two men, curiously circling them, clicking his tongue with delight.

The bystanders were puzzled, but Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, he remembered that on the way here, he had seen these three people before in that alley.

The burly man had even glanced at Yang Kai earlier, and the youth was there as well!

Are these three working together? Yang Kai suddenly smelled the strong stench of treachery and deception.
