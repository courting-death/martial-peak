## Chapter 1679 — A Big Fish

After letting Mo Yu catch his breath for a while, Yang Kai finally began inquiring about the situation at the Lingxiao Sect.

However, Du Yanling did not know much either; Haicheng City had been besieged for nearly a year and long since cut off from the outside. Only when some martial artists occasionally fled into Haicheng City for refuge could they bring back snippets of intelligence.

Those refugees said that the entrance to the Lingxiao Sect now seemed to be surrounded by the Corpse Spirit Sect’s army; no one could get in or out, and as for what was happening inside the Lingxiao Sect itself, no one knew.

A year ago the Lingxiao Sect still frequently dispatched powerful experts to aid besieged sects and forces, but as the Lingxiao Sect’s experts suffered losses, the sect has not moved a muscle this past year; things did not look particularly optimistic.

To prevent the Lingxiao Sect’s experts from slipping away, a large portion of the Corpse Spirit Sect’s forces were stationed outside the Flowing Flame Sandland as watchers, and it was said that a Protector sat in command there.

It can be said that although the Lingxiao Sect has not actively stepped out to aid the human race, its mere presence has tied up a great deal of the Corpse Spirit Sect’s combat strength, an achievement not to be understated.

Were it not for that, Haicheng City could not have held out so long without falling; the Corpse Spirit Sect has at least four Corpse General-level existences of the same caliber as Ye Xijun, not to mention the Sect Master who appears and vanishes with no one knowing his true face.

After hearing this, Yang Kai nodded slightly and asked no more.

After a day’s rest in Haicheng City, Yang Kai bid farewell to Mo Yu together with those from the Lingxiao Sect.

Yang Kai had originally intended to take all of the Qiantian Sect people into the Lingxiao Sect — once inside the Flowing Flame Sandland they could sleep soundly and need not worry about being slain by the Corpse Spirit Sect’s experts.

But after a period of deep thought, Mo Yu politely declined Yang Kai’s proposal.

The Qiantian Sect’s disciples were indeed few now. Yet across the whole of Haicheng City there still remained a million living souls.

If the Qiantian Sect’s people went with Yang Kai, then those one million living souls in Haicheng City would surely be slaughtered to the last by the Corpse Spirit Sect!

Most of those people had fled here over the last two years; they came because of the Qiantian Sect’s name, and Mo Yu could not abandon them.

This idea may be somewhat old-fashioned, but it gained unanimous approval from the remaining Qiantian Sect elders; they were all willing to stay with Mo Yu and continue to guard the Qiantian Sect’s last foundation!

Yang Kai was moved.

“You need not worry, Yang Kai. Though our Qiantian Sect has few left, Haicheng City now teems with people — I will find a way to replenish our fighting strength. If the martial artists here can unite, defending the city should not be a great problem.” Before leaving, Mo Yu smiled at Yang Kai and said.

Yang Kai inclined his head. “If that is so, then Senior Mo take care of yourself!”

After clasping his fists deeply, Yang Kai said his goodbyes to Du Yanling and the others, then led Su Yan, Xia Ningshang and the rest out of Haicheng City, heading straight for the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Watching Yang Kai and his company disappear, Mo Yu’s expression turned solemn; he waved and ordered, “Notify every martial artist in Haicheng City who has entered the Saint Realm or above: if you are willing, you may temporarily join my Qiantian Sect and defend this city with me!”

“Yes!” Du Yanling and the others immediately set about executing the order.

Previously they had considered enlisting the martial artists of Haicheng City, but time had been too tight; there had been no chance to do so, and at that time the Corpse Spirit Sect’s host was pressing the city — the city’s martial artists had little morale and could not display their true strength.

Now it was different; the Corpse Spirit Sect’s host that had besieged Haicheng City for a year had been repulsed with heavy casualties. This was a time of high morale for Haicheng City and undoubtedly a good opportunity to grow stronger and absorb living talent.

Haicheng City lied some distance from the Flowing Flame Sandland; if one relied on Star Shuttles alone, it would take at least seven or eight days.

Impatient to return to his sect, Yang Kai directly put the Void King-Grade Warship into operation.

The warship was enormous beyond compare, yet its speed was far greater than a Star Shuttle, and it was sturdy to boot — staying inside it was comparatively safe.

Along the way, they encountered many scattered Corpse Spirit Sect squads—some numbering in the thousands, others only a few dozen—all led by members of the Corpse Spirit Race, spreading chaos across Dark Star.

The warship’s crystal cannons fired in unison, and without exception these enemies were blasted into disarray, suffering grievous casualties.

Yang Kai did not order the ship to stop; after each strike he immediately moved on.

After no more than three days’ travel, the number of enemies killed beneath the warship’s crystal cannons had already reached over ten thousand!

Only a very small portion of those enemies were of the Corpse Spirit Race; the vast majority were human martial artists who had sided with the Corpse Spirit Race, following the Corpse Spirit Sect to do evil. They obeyed the Corpse Spirits’ commands and naturally received no mercy.

The powerful experts of the human, yao and demon races who had been kept within the Xuan Realm Pearl were released by Yang Kai, placed aboard the warship to witness the slaughter along the way.

If they were to make a foothold on Dark Star, they should naturally integrate with the world here.

Yang Kai wanted them to assimilate to this star as soon as possible, to see for themselves the level of its martial artists.

Sure enough, upon sensing the strength of the enemies, Ling Taixu, Lei Long and Changyuan all fell quiet, yet in each of their eyes flickered the desire to become stronger.

Lin Yun’er behaved with the lively energy of her years; at the thought of soon returning to the Lingxiao Sect and seeing those she missed, she became very happy — like a skylark, she flitted about Yang Kai’s side, chirping without stop.

Su Yan and Xia Ningshang both took a great liking to the little girl. After learning of her tragic childhood, their maternal instincts surged forth, and they couldn’t help but shed tears—leaving Yang Kai utterly speechless.

Three days later, the Void King-Grade Warship reached the outskirts of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Standing within the warship and peering through the smooth, polished crystal glass, Yang Kai saw a dense mass of figures gathered around the perimeter of the Flowing Flame Sandland — the crowd stretched to the horizon, its true size unknown.

“So many?” Yang Xiuzhu exclaimed in astonishment.

“They really value our Lingxiao Sect,” Chu Hanyi said coldly.

“According to that City Lord Du, our Lingxiao Sect has now become the last paradise on Dark Star. This is not merely due to a thorn in the throat; it may also be a symbol, an unyielding spiritual pillar. As long as the Lingxiao Sect stands, Dark Star will not abandon its resistance. Were I the Sect Master of the Corpse Spirit Sect, I would also devote all my strength to attack it.” Lin Yurao said softly.

Others nodded in agreement.

“Sect Master, shall we fly through?” the Lingxiao Sect disciple responsible for controlling the warship turned to ask.

“Cut them all down,” Yang Kai said coldly, his expression hard as steel.

“Yes!” The Lingxiao Sect disciple took the order, his face flushed with excitement as he began directing the warship’s crystal cannons to bombard.

With so many enemies gathered at the city gate, he was furious; Yang Kai’s command provided a welcome outlet.

Boom……

White columns of light shot forth from the warship’s crystal cannons; where the beams passed, all dissolved into nothingness.

This Void King-Grade Warship, personally fashioned by Yang Yan, already excelled in performance and siege capability, and the crystal cannon’s power source were the Saint Crystal Origins condensed by the Stone Puppet — a fact that further amplified the cannon’s might.

Under the combined fire of the crystal cannons, the spectacle was terrifying, as if the end of the world had come.

Each shot could sweep away a wide barren swath; both Corpse Spirit Race and the human martial artists who sided with them could not withstand it — upon contact they were reduced to ash.

Below, chaos ensued.

A pitch-black warship, over ten zhang long, suddenly appeared in midair. Its mere presence had already cast an oppressive shadow over the Corpse Spirits—but now that its ferocious form was fully revealed, terror spread through them like wildfire.

Some human martial artists recognized the warship’s origin and began to scream and flee.

The warship paid them no heed and charged above the masses of enemies, unleashing volley after volley of crystal cannon fire.

The earth trembled; the land opened into one massive crater after another, belching thin plumes of white smoke.

“Hm?” Inside the warship Yang Kai sensed something and turned to look in one direction, sneering, “There’s a big fish over there — I’ll go meet him!”

“Junior Brother, be careful!” Su Yan and Xia Ningshang had only just warned him when Yang Kai had already vanished.

Outside the Flowing Flame Sandland stood a palace that looked newly erected. It was not large — occupying only a few dozen zhang across — but it was built with extreme splendor, incongruous amid the barren, scorching sands.

Inside the palace a white-clad man lay slouched upon a grand chair, lazy in posture, propping his chin with one hand and wearing a wicked smile as he watched a dozen or so dazzling young women dancing below.

These women had been offered up by the various forces allied with the Corpse Spirit Sect. Each was fair of face and promising, the rising stars of their factions; but now they seemed to have become playthings and songstresses, there for the amusement of the white-clad man.

They appeared afraid of the white-clad man; whenever their gazes met his they hurriedly looked away, each movement careful as if terrified of making a mistake.

The ground shook; the palace trembled as a fierce energy fluctuation and a thunderous buzzing erupted nearby. The white-clad man’s expression turned grave; he sat up straight and demanded sharply, “What is the matter?”

The dozen or so young girls below also stopped their motions, looking around bewildered.

Immediately someone rushed in from outside, breathless: “Reporting to Protector Kang — a black warship has sailed in from outside and is slaughtering our Corpse Spirit Sect disciples!”

“Presumptuous! What dog dares?” The white-clad man sprang to his feet; a terrifying aura spread, making those dozen girls turn pale and huddle together.

“I... I do not know!” the reporting martial artist stammered, at a loss.

“What use are you?” the white-clad man snorted, and with a single reach he seized the informant. His hand seemed to cross space itself, grabbing the man outright.

With a mere twist he snapped the informant’s neck.

The dozen girls cried out in unison, the terror in their eyes deepening.

“Oh? He dares to come to me of his own accord? Interesting.” The man in white suddenly looked up toward the sky, releasing his Divine Sense across dozens of li to clash fiercely with Yang Kai’s.

Boom……

Where the Divine Senses collided, the void collapsed.

Inside the palace the white-clad man stumbled back several paces, clearly not a match.
