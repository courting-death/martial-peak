## Chapter 260 — Zi Mo's Danger

The energy flowing within him could no longer be called Yuan Qi; it was True Yuan!

The two were fundamentally different in nature!

Originally, there were seventy to eighty drops of Yang Liquid in his Dantian, but now only about twenty remained.

However, each drop of Yang Liquid contained energy equivalent to the sum of three or four drops from before! Such Yang Liquid had a terrifying lethality compared to the past.

After reaching the True Yuan Realm, the True Yuan within a martial artist's body is also graded. From first grade to ninth grade, with first grade being the highest and ninth grade the lowest! Although this classification cannot be counted within the entire promotion system of martial artists, it is a universally recognized method of grading.

Typically, when martial artists advance to the True Yuan Realm, if they do not have heaven-and-earth treasures to assist them, the True Yuan they form is mostly of the ninth grade.

Even with the aid of some heaven-and-earth treasures, they can only reach the eighth grade. Even then, it is a stroke of great fortune, enough to make most people beam with joy.

True Yuan of this grade can indeed exert a stronger force in battle compared to ordinary Yuan Qi, but after all, it is still at the lower end. When encountering opponents with higher-grade True Yuan, even if the Realm is slightly higher, they will certainly not be a match.

The grade of True Yuan will gradually improve as martial artists cultivate and grow stronger.

However, even if one reaches the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, without any special opportunity, their True Yuan will only be around the third or fourth grade. Very few can reach the second grade, and the first grade is merely a legend.

It can be said that when a martial artist advances to the True Yuan Realm, the grade of their True Yuan will influence their future prospects and development, laying the foundation for their entire life.

Those geniuses advancing to the True Yuan Realm typically have at least seventh-grade True Yuan, with some even reaching sixth grade. The higher the grade, the better their future prospects.

Yang Kai did not know what grade his True Yuan was at, but it certainly could not be lower than the sixth grade; at the very least, it was likely at the sixth or seventh grade, or even higher.

Liuyan Liquid, Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, which of these was not a heaven-and-earth treasure for refining Yuan Qi? Both were extremely hard to come by. Yang Kai had used both.

Additionally, during his time in the Separation and Union Realm, he had diligently refined his Yuan Qi, so the True Yuan he formed naturally would not be lacking in grade.

Looking around, Yang Kai was momentarily stunned.

"Earth Demon, what’s going on?" Yang Kai asked in confusion.

He realized he was no longer in that white mist, and there was no stone nearby that could form Soul Cleansing Dew; instead, he found himself standing on a desolate land. As he looked into the distance, lush mountains and forests swayed.

"A few days ago, a peculiar energy surged in, and then you appeared here, Young Master. But at that time, you were at the final stage of breaking through to the True Yuan Realm. I didn’t dare to disturb you," the Earth Demon replied.

Yang Kai frowned, suddenly enlightened.

It seemed he had been sent out of that strange place.

Ling Taixu had once said that when entering that strange land for training, there was no need to look for a way out, as it could not be found. At a certain time, one would naturally leave. This time could vary, taking as long as two to three years or as short as a few months.

This time, it had probably been around a year.

The training in the strange land had ended. It was a pity about the Soul Cleansing Dew; it could form a drop in about ten days, and if he had stayed there a bit longer, he should have been able to collect more.

However, Yang Kai was already content, having collected over a dozen drops.

This place should be Ghostly Underworld Mountain, the only forbidden area of the Great Han. When he entered with Ling Taixu, he encountered numerous fifth and sixth-tier Demonic Beasts, all fierce and numerous.

Now that he was out, he could only rely on himself.

With no trace of others around, they must have long since left Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

Those people were all elites from their respective sects, not weak in strength. They would certainly be able to handle fifth-tier Demonic Beasts, and if they encountered sixth-tier ones, as long as their strength was not too overwhelming, escaping should not be a problem.

"Young Master, this place is a bit strange!"

"What’s strange about it?"

"You might want to fly up and take a look!" the Earth Demon did not elaborate.

Yang Kai nodded. He released his Divine Sense, and in an instant, the area within several miles was imprinted in his mind. This time, during his closed-door breakthrough to the True Yuan Realm, his Divine Sense had inadvertently strengthened considerably.

Not sensing any danger or life force nearby, Yang Kai spread his Yang Flame Wings and flew into the sky, looking down, his eyes narrowing.

"Indeed..." the Earth Demon inhaled sharply.

"This place... it looks like it was struck down by someone's palm!" Yang Kai's brows twitched.

Below, within a radius of several dozen miles, lay a desolate expanse, devoid of any grass, all the trees reduced to powder. Upon closer inspection, one could even see a clear palm imprint covering the ground for several dozen miles.

"Yes, it should have been struck out by someone."

"Who possesses such overwhelming strength?" Yang Kai was taken aback; such a feat and strength were simply shocking.

Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya were certainly among the top experts in the world today, but Yang Kai estimated that even if they joined forces, they could not have left such a palm imprint.

Moreover, this palm imprint appeared to be somewhat old, at least left behind half a year or even a year ago. Even now, the area remained barren, indicating the destructive power contained within.

After a moment of daze, he suddenly recalled something. When Ling Taixu entered Ghostly Underworld Mountain with Gui Li from Ghost King Valley and the old woman from Wan Hua Palace, Ling Taixu had asked the old woman a question. The old woman had replied that there might be changes within Ghostly Underworld Mountain, which was why those fifth and sixth-tier Demonic Beasts had been driven to the outskirts.

The timing roughly matched; was the change the old woman spoke of related to the expert responsible for all this?

"This place is not suitable for long stays!" the Earth Demon said solemnly.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, determined the direction, and directly used his Yang Flame Wings to fly outward.

Previously, he had not dared to act recklessly because he lacked the ability to probe the nearby movements. Now that he had Divine Sense, it was different. With his Divine Sense spreading out, the area within several miles was clear at a glance, and he naturally no longer feared being spied upon.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai had flown out of Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

Touching down on the ground, Yang Kai checked his location, identified the direction, and walked toward a certain place.

"Young Master, are you not returning to Lingxiao Pavilion?" the Earth Demon noticed something amiss, as Yang Kai's direction was not at all the route back to Lingxiao Pavilion.

"Not for now; I need to make a trip to Yao Wang Valley!" Yang Kai nodded.

The Wordless Black Book clearly instructed him to head to Yao Wang Valley; he did not know what awaited him there. Last time, he intended to cultivate for a while longer, waiting until his strength was a bit stronger before going, but unexpectedly, he was brought to Ghostly Underworld Mountain by Ling Taixu for training.

Now that he had reached the True Yuan Realm, it was naturally time to visit Yao Wang Valley.

Having advanced to the True Yuan Realm, Yang Kai's movement technique was now even more ethereal than before, with a single burst of Yuan Qi allowing him to flash over several hundred zhang.

However, he only tried it a few times before refraining from using the movement technique, as it consumed too much True Yuan.

Two days later, Yang Kai was already over a thousand miles away from Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

As he walked along an official road, a sudden wave of unease surged in his heart. This feeling was not his own but was transmitted from a certain direction.

Yang Kai was taken aback and turned to look in that direction.

He vaguely felt that there was something unusual several dozen miles away.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai was puzzled; his Divine Sense could at most cover a range of several miles, how could movements from several dozen miles away be transmitted to him?

"Imprint!" Suddenly, Yang Kai's eyes lit up as he finally understood why he felt uneasy.

During his time in the strange land, he had planted an imprint in the souls of Zi Mo and Leng Shan. Now, several dozen miles away, one of them must be encountering some danger, which was why he sensed it.

Was it Zi Mo or Leng Shan?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai's expression darkened, and he hurriedly rushed in that direction.

Yang Kai's intuition was not wrong; several dozen miles away, Zi Mo was facing the greatest danger of her life. When they parted, her strength had reached the sixth layer of the True Yuan Realm, and after such a long time of training in the strange land, her strength had now reached the seventh layer of the True Yuan Realm.

Coming from a prestigious background, Zi Mo could be considered one of the outstanding talents of the younger generation.

However, now she found herself in a precarious situation, frantically dealing with attacks from her enemies, in a dire state.

A long wound marred her abdomen, blood staining her clothes. Her steps were unsteady, and her beauty was marred by fear. Even in the face of danger, she gritted her teeth and held on, not uttering a word.

When she exited Ghostly Underworld Mountain, her luck had run out, and she encountered numerous attacks from Demonic Beasts. If it were not for relying on the Control Soul Insect to control one of the Demonic Beasts, she would have likely perished in Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

In that battle, she had sustained some injuries, and the controlled Demonic Beast had stayed behind to cover her escape.

Having barely managed to escape, she did not expect to encounter an ambush by someone here!

This person was someone she recognized, the very Wu Chengyi Yang Kai had been searching for.

Wu Chengyi's strength had reached the eighth layer of the True Yuan Realm! Although he was only one layer higher than Zi Mo, one was prepared and waiting, while the other was caught off guard and injured. In battle, Zi Mo quickly fell to the disadvantage, accidentally getting hit by a sword again, her condition worsening.

A stream of sword energy rushed toward her like a flowing ribbon. Zi Mo's expression turned grave as she took out a mirror-like secret treasure, activating her True Yuan to transform it into a shield to block in front of her.

Clang! Clang! The sword energy struck the shield, and although it did not injure Zi Mo, it forced her to retreat repeatedly, gasping for breath.

"I only want the method for the Slave Beast! Hand it over, and I will spare your life!" Wu Chengyi pointed his long sword at Zi Mo, his expression emotionless.

In the strange land, Wu Chengyi had witnessed the power of the Slave Beast method firsthand, so he naturally sought to seize it. This ambush on Zi Mo was for the sake of the secret of Senluo Palace.

"Delusional!" Zi Mo gritted her teeth.

Wu Chengyi sneered, "I'll give you one last chance. Otherwise, once I capture you, you won't even be able to die! A charming foreign woman like you will surely attract the interest of many."

A chill flashed in Zi Mo's eyes as she suddenly laughed, "You interested?"

Wu Chengyi's expression turned icy, "I practice the Heartless Sword; I will not be swayed by women! So you should keep your little thoughts to yourself. However, I have a lecherous master; I believe he would be very willing to take you in!"

Zi Mo's pretty face changed, and she gritted her teeth in anger, "Pervert!"
