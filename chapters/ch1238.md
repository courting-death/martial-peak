## Chapter 1238 — Earth-Lung Fire Pool

The Divine Sense slipped from his body and was twisted and deformed by the blazing heat; although Yang Kai cast it out and drew it back with tremendous speed, a small portion of his Divine Sense was still burned away.

He grunted softly at that, but his Divine Sense was exceptionally powerful and his Warm Spirit Lotus nourished his soul, so he treated the loss as negligible.

In that instant of probing Yang Kai had already locked onto a certain spot; his gaze swept across a distance of several thousand zhang and, looking that way, he saw on the ground a terrifying surge of crimson heat erupting forth. The hot wave rose like a Jiao bursting from the sea, coiling upward as if it would tear a hole in the red curtain hanging in the sky, yet the barrier of the Flowing Flame Sandland on this layer was not something that heat alone could overcome. The wave shot into the sky, merged with the red curtain, and vanished like a drop in the ocean.

From where that heat had erupted a supremely pure strand of Spiritual Qi drifted out, slowly washing over Yang Kai's position before continuing to spread in all directions. In an instant, within the Fifth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland sand and stone churned as if doomsday had arrived.

Yang Kai's heart stirred; he waited in place until the commotion over there subsided, then he painfully set off toward it.

Only after two hours did Yang Kai reach a point a few thousand zhang away, fix his mind, and stare down into a vast pit with an expression that shifted between dark and light.

It was a massive sinkhole; looking down from the rim one saw molten lava flowing like water, presently appearing unnervingly calm, no longer as violently eruptive as before. Wave after wave of pure fire Spiritual Qi seeped up from the depths of that pit and merged into the Fifth Layer's environment, bit by bit strengthening its potency.

Occasionally chunks of rock fell into the pit and dissolved into ash upon contact with the molten sea — one could imagine the terrible temperatures within.

It looked like a volcanic mouth, but it was not a volcano; a great pit had opened on level ground without any signs of a volcanic eruption or the usual traces of volcanic formation.

Yang Kai also keenly sensed that beneath the pit the passages branched in every direction, as if countless side tunnels led away from it. From below came a rhythmic sound, almost like breathing, steady and regular.

His thoughts turned quickly and a name escaped his lips: "Earth-Lung Fire Pool?"

The moment he said it, Yang Kai froze on the spot — he could hardly believe it himself.

The Earth-Lung Fire Pool is an exceedingly rare underground fire vein, prized above all by artificers. When refining, artificers can harness the power of such veins to temper materials, saving vast amounts of effort and countless hours.

Yet the sects that possess an Earth-Lung Fire Pool are exceedingly few. Yang Kai had encountered only a handful of forces and knew little of those sects' secrets, but he was certain that on the entire Dark Star there could be no more than three sects that enjoyed a dedicated Earth-Lung Fire Pool for refining.

One criterion for identifying an Earth-Lung Fire Pool is that inhalation-and-exhalation rhythm — as if the earth itself had lungs — and that regularity was unmistakable, so Yang Kai recognized it at once.

Judging by the purity of the fire Spiritual Qi pouring from this pool, it was among the very best of its kind; any artificer working here could unleash their full ability and temper secret treasures normally impossible to forge, enabling those treasures to perform at their utmost.

Thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind and his face showed unmistakable delight.

He could not take the pool with him, but it was the ideal place to refine his Profound Yin Moon Water. He hadn't expected to find such a site — originally he planned to refine the water nearby — yet now he decided he must go down and take a look.

Despite the danger; the more perilous the place, the greater the reward. Warriors never shrink from danger when cultivation is at stake.

With that thought, Yang Kai's expression hardened. He did not dare slacken for an instant. He pushed his Demonic Flame up to its limit and produced his purple shield, driving its power to form a small sandstorm that wrapped about him.

That was not all — Yang Kai did not stint with his Saint Yuan, condensing dozens of Vast Heaven Shields that whirled around his sides.

When he finished, he inhaled deeply and leapt straight toward the pit's mouth.

Hanging in midair, Yang Kai remained utterly focused; his eyes swept and found a good foothold. His body twisted and wavered in the air and he landed lightly upon it, then stepped across to the next prepared hold as planned.

Ssssss……

The molten sea below was restless, erupting at intervals. Scalding jets of magma splashed and struck the surrounding cave walls, carving riddled scars into them.

The lava here seemed far more potent than that in the ancient sealing formation where Wei Guchang and the others had previously fallen.

Much molten rock rained toward Yang Kai; once struck, a Vast Heaven Shield would shatter, and in the blink of an eye the dozens of shields dancing around him were consumed.

The sandstorm protecting him swept the lava aside, and any that pierced the sand's blockade were blasted back by Yang Kai's Demonic Flame, ridding him of worries and allowing him to focus on finding secure footholds.

As he descended he continually repaired the damaged Vast Heaven Shields.

After roughly thirty breaths Yang Kai's eyes lit up; his body shot aside and he dove into a side cavity.

Once inside the cavity Yang Kai felt the surrounding heat diminish markedly, as if an invisible barrier blocked it — the change immediately piqued his curiosity.

He turned and peered out, his face frozen in astonishment.

Because on the opposite cliff face, he saw countless cave openings similar to the one he was in. Those caves were clearly not naturally formed—their entrances were each carved with numbers, arranged sequentially as first, second, third, and so on.

Those cavities had been deliberately excavated.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and suddenly realized the truth, then hastily began to examine the cavity he stood in.

The cavity was deep — roughly thirty zhang — beginning with a straight tunnel. After those thirty zhang Yang Kai stepped into a spacious stone chamber.

The surrounding stone walls were dotted with strange illumination stones which, despite the passage of countless years, still emitted a soft glow so that the place was not shrouded in darkness.

Using that light, Yang Kai retracted his shields and Demonic Flame and began surveying the chamber.

The chamber floor was level and engraved with a vast formation that still functioned, channeling waves of scorching power from outside inward and converging them toward the very center.

At that central spot stood a huge furnace cauldron — three‑footed, with twin handles, carved with dragons and coiling phoenixes. Its antique style marked it as old; long exposure to the searing energy had reddened it through and through, radiating intense heat.

A quick probe revealed the furnace to be an Origin-Grade Lower-Level refining furnace.

Yang Flame had once used a refining furnace to temper materials, but after the Stone Puppet started assisting her she no longer needed to employ a furnace; only occasionally, when forging very high-grade secret treasures for final shaping, would she make use of one.

Indeed, seeing such a refining furnace brought an expression of comprehension to Yang Kai's face.

His earlier impression upon seeing the many cavities across the way had led him to conjecture this, and the chamber's layout now confirmed his deduction.

This Earth-Lung Fire Pool truly was the place that the great sect's artificers used for refining.

No wonder: with such a place of treasure, the sect's artificers would surely make full use of it. Those individual cavities had obviously been carved expressly for the artificers' use.

The ancient formation within the chamber could draw the searing force of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool into the cavities for the artificers to command.

What an enormous undertaking. Yang Kai marveled inwardly — arranging such mechanisms beneath an Earth-Lung Fire Pool could not have been the work of ordinary people; at minimum it would require experts of the Void King Realm.

What made him regretful was that this Origin-Grade Lower-Level refining furnace had already melted extensively and was no longer whole; after so many years of baking it had simply been unable to withstand the strain.

That the formation had continued operating for tens of thousands of years was surely because the Earth-Lung Fire Pool had supplied a ceaseless stream of energy.

With that thought, Yang Kai glanced about and soon spotted an abrupt stone pedestal in a corner. He did not fully understand formation techniques, but living with Yang Flame had given him some rudimentary knowledge.

That stone pedestal was likely the control core for the chamber's formation.

He stepped forward and poured Saint Yuan into the pedestal. With a thunderous rumble the operating formation shut down and the steady flow of blazing power being drawn into the chamber ceased.

Yang Kai waited a long while until the refining furnace cooled somewhat, then approached to inspect it.

What he saw only deepened his disappointment.

Once cooled, the furnace crumbled at a touch, and whatever had been inside — nobody knew what — had long since become a shapeless puddle of unknown matter, utterly useless.

No wonder — so prolonged a roasting would ruin even the most precious materials. And materials tempered in a mere Origin-Grade Lower-Level furnace could hardly be of very high quality.

But this was only a single chamber; there were so many others beyond.

Following the principle that one cannot return empty-handed from a treasure mountain, Yang Kai proceeded to search the chambers one by one.

It took him two full days to inspect at least three hundred chambers. Aside from some unstarted refining materials left in the rooms, he found nothing to make his eyes brighten — all the refining furnaces were damaged.
