## Chapter 971 — What Could You Possibly Use to Fight Me

A chaotic battle raged from daylight into night; the sky above the sea had become a battlefield. The Bone Race’s numbers plummeted—over two thousand five hundred reduced to mere hundreds in a single day, and still falling fast.

Thousands from the human, yao, and demon races were also present, and at this moment nearly half of them were gone.

They all fell on this battlefield, with no hope of survival.

In the Transcendent Realm and even the Saint Realm, people perished. In such melees an individual’s power is far too slight; only by reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm can one act with reckless abandon across the entire field of battle.

Yang Kai transformed into a golden dragon, his innate bloodthirst flaring as he slaughtered the Bone Race creatures frantically. His scorching power was the Bone Race’s greatest bane—hot waves of force spewed forth; Members below the Saint Realm could not withstand it, turning instantly into pools of blood as even their bones melted away.

The situation gradually shifted from a tense stalemate to a one-sided rout.

Once the Humans, Yao, and Demons gained the upper hand, they pressed their advantage further and further, until the Bone Race was left with no power to resist, slaughtered like swine and dogs.  

Yet Yang Kai harbored an uneasy feeling.

He had been searching for the Bone Race leader Ke Luo, but since the chaos began that fellow had ceased to appear—no one knew where he had gone.

The numerous experts were all busy fighting the enemies before them; they had no leisure to look elsewhere.

Yang Kai shot high into the sky, no longer bothering with the rabble.

He released his mind and searched with all his strength for Ke Luo’s trace.

This man was the Bone Race’s chief and likely its strongest presence—if he did not die in this battle, annihilating the Bone Race would be meaningless.

After a while he frowned.

Ke Luo seemed not to be here; he had long since slipped away. Yang Kai’s divine sense felt nothing of him!

Yang Kai’s heart sank, yet he stubbornly continued his search.

After the time it takes to finish a cup of tea, he finally discovered some thread of a lead.

The blood-and-flesh essences contained in the corpses of those Transcendent and above experts who had died on the battlefield were invisibly seeping into the ground, converging toward a single source. There, an extremely concealed and powerful aura lay in ambush.

Ke Luo!

Yang Kai dove headlong. The golden dragon’s body became a dazzling shaft of light—like a sun plummeting from the heavens—smashing toward the ground.

Boom……

The earth trembled; the violent force transmitted through the soil down into the depths.

A cold snort issued forth as Ke Luo burst from the ground, an unnatural flush of red on his face as he proudly looked down on the gathered heroes. His jade-green eyes held contempt and self-satisfaction.

Astonishing energy rippled from him.

Yang Kai’s eyelids tightened; a cry rose in the depths of his heart.

He sensed that something was wrong!

No sooner had Ke Luo just steadied himself than a pitch-black demonic hand reached from the void, stretching straight for him. As it extended it grew ever larger, as if it could seize the very heavens and earth in its palm.

It was the great hand of Demon Lord Changyuan!

Ke Luo seemed completely unaware, standing motionless in midair.

"Changyuan, withdraw!" Yang Kai barked.

The shout still came a little too late. Changyuan, as a Demon Lord and the foremost expert of the Demon Domain, naturally had absolute confidence in his own strength. Yet just as his demonic hand was about to reach Ke Luo, it suddenly recoiled as though pricked by needles.

An instant later, Changyuan materialized beside Yang Kai, face heavy with gravity. A bead of blood welled from his right palm, and the entire hand was steeped in the chilling reek of a corpse.

Unnoticed, he had already been wounded by Ke Luo.

Fear flushed Changyuan’s eyes. He hastily circulated his Demon Yuan to dispel the strange evil energy Ke Luo had driven into his body.

Figures flickered into being: Li Rong, Meng Wuya, Chu Lingxiao, the Great Lord Lei Long, and others.

At this moment, the Bone Race’s Saint Realm experts had almost all been slain; the remaining Transcendent Realm members scattered in flight. The human, yao, and demon experts pursued mercilessly, leaving not a single prisoner.

Only a few of the absolute top experts remained to deal with Ke Luo.

"Saint King Realm?" Meng Wuya exclaimed in horror.

He knew Changyuan’s strength better than anyone—after all, he had fought him centuries ago. Changyuan had a power beyond the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, yet he had still been lightly wounded by Ke Luo.

At this moment, Ke Luo’s strength seemed to tower above everyone else. Even with experts of the three races eyeing him, he showed not the slightest hint of panic; instead, his demeanor remained calm and composed.  

"Not at Saint King yet—he’s about to break through!" Yang Kai said in a buzz, keeping his golden dragon form.

The aura from Ke Luo was indeed earth-shattering, more turbulent than anyone present, but it was certainly not at the Saint King Realm. His qi rose and fell irregularly—that was the sign of an imminent breakthrough.

"I owe you all thanks!" Ke Luo looked down at the assembled experts and said in an arrogant tone, "Thanks for giving me this chance. If so many experts hadn't died here, I wouldn't be able to ascend so quickly! Thousands of years ago there was a powerful Saint King who slaughtered my race’s experts, but now—let me see what you can use to fight me!"

With that shout a surging pulling force erupted from his body, as if an invisible whirlpool were spinning madly.

The blood-and-flesh essences from countless corpses below visibly flowed into him.

Drops of scarlet blood rose into the air and streamed ceaselessly into Ke Luo, becoming his capital—fanning his momentum wildly.

Those blood drops mostly came from the corpses of experts among the human, yao, and demon races!

In the sky above, the winds and clouds suddenly shifted—Ke Luo was on the verge of breaking through!  

"So this is what you were planning all along!" Chu Lingxiao’s face darkened.

Everyone’s expressions turned grim as realization struck—they had all fallen into his scheme.

This time the three races had united to assault the Bone Race. The Bone Race had fought without fear; they had thought the Bone Race foolish, but now they understood—Ke Luo never cared for his clansmen’s lives. The many tribesmen he’d produced over the past half year were intended to force the living here into a fight to the death with him.

In the great battle, when clansmen died, the living here would also die!

He could seize the opportunity to absorb massive amounts of blood-and-flesh essence.

Those who died among the humans, yao, and demons were all experts of Transcendent Realm and above, including many from the Saint Realm.

With such an enormous influx of energy into his body, it would be hard for him not to ascend.

This was a grand chess game. While everyone thought victory was certain, Ke Luo had already arranged everything.

"You may kill all my clansmen! But as long as I live, I can have as many clansmen as I want!" Ke Luo, feeling invincible, threw back his head and laughed wildly.

Everyone’s faces turned ashen as they stared at the terrifying power gathering in the sky—the baptism of heaven and earth for a Saint Realm breakthrough to Saint King. None of the experts present dared to test its force.

It might well leave nothing remaining but bones.

"You want to live?" Yang Kai dispelled his golden dragon form and looked at him coldly, sneering, "Dream on!"

As he spoke, he flipped his palm and drew something from the Black Book Space.

It was a stone of deep crimson.

The True Yuan, already ascended to Saint Yuan, frantically poured into the stone. In an instant, that crimson rock burst forth with a blazing scarlet light, and from within erupted a pull even stronger than the power emanating from Ke Luo’s own body.

The blood that had been rapidly converging toward Ke Luo was suddenly gripped as if by an invisible giant hand; it halted midair and then, one by one, began to rush into the crimson stone, pouring into it with increasing speed.

The streams of blood-and-flesh essence followed the blood and no longer gathered around Ke Luo.

The energy source he planned to use for his ascension was cut off in an instant.

"Blood Essence Stone!" Ke Luo’s jade-green eyes trembled violently; panic and alarm flashed across his face as he roared, "How do you have a Blood Essence Stone?"

He seemed to fear that strange stone greatly.

Yang Kai grinned, "Without energy replenishment, how do you expect to ascend to Saint King?"

As if to corroborate Yang Kai’s words, the heavenly power gathered above dissipated at that moment.

Ke Luo looked up to the sky. Realizing his ascent was impossible, he finally panicked.

Yang Kai held the Blood Essence Stone high, his True Yuan pouring into it. He drew in the blood-and-flesh essences and blood within dozens of li, refusing to give Ke Luo a single chance.

He sneered, "Looks like you’re afraid of this, huh?"

The experts gathered around him brightened again, seeing hope of crushing the Bone Race.

Quietly they felt fortunate—had Yang Kai found Ke Luo’s trail a little later, once he had gathered sufficient energy, nothing in this world could have stopped him.

Ke Luo’s eyes flickered with murderous intent as he glared at Yang Kai and ground his teeth, "Even if I don't reach Saint King, you are no match for me. I'll kill you first and take your Blood Essence Stone!"

As he spoke, a cold, bloody aura shot toward Yang Kai, carrying strands of spiritual fluctuation aimed straight at Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, attempting to extinguish his soul.

Recognizing it as a Divine Sense attack, Yang Kai showed no fear—he stood his ground without dodging.

"Burn!" he muttered, and Divine Sense Fire leapt from him, incinerating the cold, bloody aura before it could get close.

Ke Luo raised a huge hand and pressed into the void in Yang Kai’s direction.

A ghastly, alabaster skeletal hand suddenly manifested. Its appearance alone gave everyone the impression of imminent death, making their hearts shudder.

The skeletal hand was enormous, crystalline as jade, radiating eerie power—like a mountain, its five fingers hooked as it came crashing down toward Yang Kai.

The land could not bear such pressure and collapsed with a roar; a massive palm print appeared on the ground in an instant.

"Foolish!" Li Rong cried sharply. Magic marks crept across her lovely face, making her look wildly feral as surging demonic qi poured from her, like an arrow releasing toward the skeletal hand.

"Go!" Yang Kai simultaneously gave a low shout. A Saint-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure—the Silver Leaf—flew from his palm and in midair rippled into layer upon layer of water-like waves, overlapping to block the skeletal hand.
