## Chapter 2440 — Holy Son

Yu Ying looked utterly astonished, which made Yang Kai feel extremely puzzled. “What’s the problem?”

Yu Ying exclaimed excitedly, “I’ve heard that cultivators with the Star Lord’s body have huge advantages in the Shattered Star Sea. Their speed in refining Origin Power is far beyond ordinary people. I always thought it was just a rumor, but now I see it’s true! You refine it even faster than the legends say!”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “The Star Lord’s body has such benefits?”

“Senior Brother Feng, you didn’t know?”

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “Since I came in, I’ve been alone, always refining the Stellar Origin like this. I thought everyone was the same.”

“How could it be the same?” Yu Ying cried. “If I, your Junior Sister, tried to refine this Origin Power, it would take at least two months!”

“That long?” Yang Kai looked utterly shocked.

Yu Ying gazed at Yang Kai with burning eyes. “Now you know how amazing you are, Senior Brother Feng? It looks like Senior Brother Yin is the same.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Senior Brother Yin is at least as strong as me, so he’s even more impressive.”

As he said this, Yang Kai sneered inwardly. Yin Lesheng might also have the Star Lord’s body and some special convenience, but without the Star Refining Technique, he couldn’t refine so quickly—at best, just a bit faster than others.

The Star Refining Technique is the greatest advantage in the Shattered Star Sea.

“Senior Brother Feng truly has boundless prospects.” Yu Ying’s gaze toward Yang Kai was blazing. She’d known before that Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng both came from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, so their talent must be good and they’d achieve great things someday. But now, learning he had the Star Lord’s body, Yu Ying immediately realized that this Feng De before her was the second Yin Lesheng.

If she could recruit someone like this into the Netherworld Sect, her own status would rise as well. She’d surely earn great favor from the sect’s upper ranks. When Senior Brother Feng achieved success in the future, who would dare provoke her?

In that instant, Yu Ying made up her mind. She secretly resolved to find a chance to win over Senior Brother Feng’s heart and body, so he’d be hers to use.

“Junior Sister Yu flatters me. Since the Origin here is gone, let’s set out.” Yang Kai was still thinking about Yin Lesheng and had no time to chat with her.

Yu Ying nodded. “Alright.” As she spoke, she suddenly tossed out a small flying shuttle Secret Treasure. It looked extremely delicate, and its energy fluctuations were strong — it was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level flying Secret Treasure, just like the wooden boat Yang Kai had.

Yang Kai was secretly startled. No wonder she was an elite disciple from a great sect—Yu Ying, just at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, could casually produce such a fine item. Clearly, it wasn’t common.

Yu Ying shot Yang Kai a flirtatious glance, her eyes brimming with charm as she shyly asked in a soft voice, “Senior Brother Feng, would you like to come inside with me? The journey through the stars is long—if we travel together, it won’t be so lonely.”

Yang Kai’s scalp tingled and he shivered all over. He really didn’t want to share a room with this woman, but refusing now would be too awkward, so after a brief hesitation, he could only force himself to say, “That would be best.”

Yu Ying smiled. “Please come in, Senior Brother Feng.”

As she spoke, she opened a door on the flying shuttle.

The two entered one after the other.

Inside, Yang Kai found the flying shuttle’s space wasn’t very large. Besides the control area, there was only one bedroom. But the interior was lavishly decorated by Yu Ying. As soon as he stepped in, a decadent fragrance lingered in Yang Kai’s nose.

He had no idea how many people Yu Ying had invited into the shuttle before; Yang Kai disliked such an environment.

Yu Ying looked bashful, her eyes full of spring, as if expecting something good to happen.

Before she could act, Yang Kai spoke up, “Junior Sister Yu, I’ve fought many battles recently and used up a lot of energy, so I need to borrow your secret room to recover for a while. I’ll come see you in a few days!”

After speaking, Yang Kai immediately walked into the only bedroom, closed the door, and sat down cross-legged.

Yu Ying stood there in a daze, lost in thought. After a long while, she snorted and turned to control the Secret Treasure.

The days that followed were tense and exhausting for Yang Kai. He had to tread carefully at every step, constantly on guard.

Yu Ying kept trying to tease and harass him, making him very annoyed. If not for needing her help to find Yin Lesheng, he would have slapped this shameless woman to death long ago.

From all their interactions, it was clear Yu Ying was no good.

Most of the time, Yang Kai secluded himself in the secret room to cultivate. Except for switching with Yu Ying to control the flying shuttle, he rarely came out, so she never found a chance to go too far with him.

Along the way, they occasionally found some broken stars or meteorites containing Origin Power, and of course, they didn’t miss any.

Whenever they came across a broken star or meteorite containing Origin Power, Yang Kai would always activate his Star Refining Technique at full force, leaving Yu Ying with barely any scraps. Because of this, Yu Ying couldn’t help but harbor some resentment toward him—she felt he was far too greedy, snatching up every bit of treasure they found without leaving her anything.

But Yu Ying didn’t dare show Yang Kai any attitude. First, his cultivation was higher than hers; second, she still hoped to bring him into the Netherworld Sect and get his care and protection. So even though she was very dissatisfied, she didn’t show it in front of him—she only cursed him in private.

She didn’t know that, even while cultivating, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was always monitoring her, so he knew her situation perfectly and understood her wicked nature even more.

One day, while Yang Kai was in seclusion, he suddenly opened his eyes. He sensed some Star Seal fluctuations rapidly approaching. Star Seal fluctuations meant cultivators were coming, but he couldn’t tell how many—he could only sense those with Star Seals lower than his own. If their Star Seal equaled or exceeded his, he couldn’t sense them.

After thinking, Yang Kai sent a message to Yu Ying: “Junior Sister Yu, someone’s coming.”

Yu Ying was bored, controlling the shuttle, but when she heard this, she was startled. “Where? How many?”

Seeing she had no idea, it was clear she hadn’t noticed anything. That meant the newcomers’ Star Seal level was the same as hers—Five-Pointed Star Seal—so she couldn’t detect them.

“To the east. Not sure how many, but at least three!” Yang Kai could sense three Star Seal fluctuations, so he was sure of three. He paused, then added, “They’re speeding up—they must be coming for us.”

Yu Ying was shocked and was about to accelerate away when a brilliant light appeared in her view. It shot toward the shuttle like lightning and stopped nearby.

Then, five figures appeared at once.

Yang Kai was secretly surprised. He’d only sensed three Star Seal fluctuations, but now there were five people. That meant two of them had at least Six-Pointed Star Seals.

When Yu Ying saw the five, her pretty face turned pale and she nervously swallowed, clearly very wary of them.

It was too late to run now. Any rash move could trigger a reaction, and judging by their posture, the five were clearly targeting them. No one knew if it was fortune or disaster. For a moment, Yu Ying was anxious and uneasy.

“Who are these people?” Yang Kai suddenly appeared beside her and asked.

Yu Ying’s pretty face turned a shade paler as she replied, “They’re from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. In the Eastern Territory, their sect is just as powerful as ours—our strength and status are about equal.”

Yang Kai said, “Your two sects don’t get along?”

Yu Ying replied with a bitter smile, “Not that bad, but there’s always some friction. It’s like that between disciples of any great sect.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and pointed at two of them. “Those two must be very strong!”

Yu Ying looked at him in surprise. “Those two are the Holy Sons of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, so of course they’re powerful. In our sect, only a few Senior Brothers can match them.”

“Holy Sons!” Yang Kai’s brows rose.

“I’m not sure why they’ve come here, but Senior Brother Feng, please don’t say anything—let me handle them,” Yu Ying quietly urged, a trace of unease in her voice. She was afraid Yang Kai might say something reckless and offend them; if that happened, they would truly be doomed this time.

“Got it.” Yang Kai nodded.

Just then, one of the five suddenly shouted, “You inside, get out here!”

Yu Ying felt bitter, but had no choice but to open the shuttle door and step out.

Yang Kai followed close behind. There was no point hiding now—their Divine Sense was sweeping over, so they’d already been discovered.

After leaving the shuttle, Yu Ying politely cupped her fists and said sweetly, “Yu Ying greets Senior Brothers Chang Hao and Chang Xian!”

The two called Chang Hao and Chang Xian must be the Holy Sons of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, the ones Yu Ying feared. Both had peak Dao Origin Realm cultivation and looked extremely powerful. The other three were only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so Yu Ying wasn’t too worried about them.

The rougher-looking Chang Hao narrowed his eyes and stared coldly at Yu Ying. “So it’s you, you slut!”

He showed no courtesy at all, calling her a slut to her face. Clearly, he knew all about Yu Ying’s promiscuity.

After all, they were all top disciples of great sects in the Eastern Territory, so they knew each other’s reputations. Yu Ying’s wantonness was famous throughout the Eastern Territory.

Chang Xian, however, gave Yang Kai a meaningful look and sneered, “It hasn’t even been that long since we last saw you, Yu Ying, and you’ve already found yourself a new man. You really do know how to keep things interesting!”
