## Chapter 2302 — If You Want It, Just Take It

The next day, the City Lord’s mansion was festooned with lanterns and decorations, music resounded throughout, and the atmosphere was lively beyond compare.

Today was the day of City Lord Luo Jin’s concubine-taking ceremony in Tianhe City. Guests from all directions had come to offer their congratulations. Carriages loaded with gifts arrived in an endless stream, guided by the servants of the City Lord’s mansion toward the rear courtyard, where dedicated personnel recorded, categorized, and stored the gifts in the warehouse.

Everyone in the City Lord’s mansion wore beaming smiles, as if they themselves were getting married.

At the entrance of the City Lord’s mansion, handsome young attendants and beautiful maidservants welcomed the arriving guests, standing in two rows, each with a face full of smiles and impeccable manners.

Whenever a guest arrived, the master of ceremonies would loudly announce the guest’s sect, drawing everyone’s attention. Once inside the City Lord’s mansion, someone would lead them to the inner hall, where, according to their status and position, they were seated at different banquet tables.

The representatives of those powerful sects at the height of their strength were naturally arranged at the very front. Next came other slightly lesser sects or families, and the further out one sat, the lower their status.

No one dared to object to such arrangements. One’s ability determined how close to the front one sat. Every sect and family knew exactly where they stood.

The arrangements at the City Lord’s mansion had surely been decided long in advance, so naturally, there was no cause for anyone’s displeasure.

Yang Kai followed the people from Thousand Leaves Sect to the venue, curiously observing his surroundings.

It was his first time attending someone else’s wedding. Although it was only a concubine-taking ceremony, it was still a major life event, and he found it quite novel. The lively and festive scene involuntarily made him think of Su Yan, Xia Ningshang, Shan Qingluo, and Xue Yue.

Deep down, he felt a wave of guilt. Back when he left his home Star Domain, he should have properly organized such an event, letting them experience the happiness a woman ought to have.

Thinking about it now, he realized he owed them a great deal.

He hadn’t intended to come today, but after Ye Qinghan invited him several times, Yang Kai, not wanting her to worry he’d leave without a word, simply came along with the Thousand Leaves Sect group.

Du Xian and the others had also brought some congratulatory gifts from the sect. Though not particularly precious, there were quite a few. Before entering, they had already been loaded onto a carriage and handed over to the City Lord’s mansion servants to be placed in the rear hall.

Afterwards, under the guidance of another servant, they entered the inner hall where the ceremony would be held.

The inner hall was quite spacious. Even with over a hundred banquet tables set up, it didn’t feel crowded. By the time the Thousand Leaves Sect group arrived, the place was already bustling. Experts from various sects and factions were either drinking alone or gathering in small groups, chatting and laughing heartily. Such occasions were perfect opportunities for many forces to strengthen their ties and deepen their exchanges.

The servant leading Ye Qinghan and the others brought them to a table in the center and said with a smile, “Honored guests, your seats are here. Please wait a moment—the ceremony is about to begin.”

After saying this, the servant was about to leave.

Wuma’s face flashed with displeasure at these words. He grabbed the servant’s collar and growled, “Our seats are here? Are you sure?”

This table wasn’t at the front but rather toward the middle and back. The dozen or so tables nearby, aside from Thousand Leaves Sect, were all occupied by small families and minor sects, the kind that might only have a single Dao Origin Realm cultivator, similar in strength to the major families of Fenglin City.

Although Thousand Leaves Sect didn’t have an Emperor Realm expert overseeing things, they had quite a few Dao Origin Realm cultivators. No matter what, they shouldn’t have been arranged here. Even if not at the very front, it shouldn’t have been this far back.

Such an arrangement was clearly a slight and an insult.

The servant was startled by Wuma, and stammered in panic, “I only lead guests to their assigned tables. I don’t know anything else! Please spare me, honored sir!”

“Let go, Wuma!” Du Xian frowned and gave a calm order.

“Senior Brother…” Wuma seemed to want to say more, but seeing Du Xian give him a look, he glanced around and noticed many people staring at him. His actions had already drawn quite a bit of attention.

“Since we’re here, let’s just go along with it,” Du Xian said quietly.

Hearing this, Wuma gritted his teeth and reluctantly released the servant’s collar, though his face was still full of indignation.

“Let’s sit down first. No need to make a scene,” Ye Qinghan said, frowning slightly as she took her seat.

The other Thousand Leaves Sect disciples also sat down quietly, though none of them looked pleased.

Wuma gritted his teeth and said, “Senior Brother, Senior Sister, they’re clearly trying to embarrass us… How can you just endure it?”

Du Xian glanced at him and said, “And what if you can’t swallow it? Are you planning to overturn this place, or perhaps kill that old fox?”

Wuma muttered, “I didn’t say that, but with so many people watching, and them putting us so far back, it’s obviously deliberate.”

Ye Qinghan said, “Well, this is their territory. If we make a scene, it won’t do us any good.”

Du Xian snorted coldly, “This humiliation—Luo Jin is counting on us swallowing it. Remember today’s disgrace and pay it back double another day.”

Wuma was full of anger, but he knew there was no way to change the situation. The strange looks and whispers from the surrounding martial artists made him feel as if they were all laughing at them, leaving him restless and uncomfortable.

Just then, Du Xian quietly nudged Ye Qinghan and whispered, “Ever since you came in, someone’s been watching you.”

“Who?” Ye Qinghan looked around suspiciously and immediately spotted Qiu Yu, who was sitting at the very front, staring at her intently.

She spat softly, “Don’t talk nonsense. He’s not looking at me.”

Du Xian chuckled, “If he’s not looking at you, who is he looking at? Junior Sister Ye, you’re a rare beauty—how could Qiu Yu resist your charm?”

Ye Qinghan blushed and scolded, “You’re getting more and more improper. You’re the Senior Brother—you should set an example!”

Du Xian could only give an embarrassed laugh.

Seeing his expression, Ye Qinghan’s face was full of sweetness. How could she not know Du Xian was jealous?

At that moment, Wuma suddenly interjected, “That little bastard actually sent someone over.”

Du Xian and Ye Qinghan turned to look and saw an old man who always accompanied Qiu Yu, his protector, walking toward them at a steady pace.

Du Xian frowned, “What’s that brat up to?”

Ye Qinghan snorted, “Ignore him. Once the ceremony’s over, we’ll return to the sect. I don’t want to stay here a moment longer.”

As they spoke, the old man arrived at their table, cupped his fists slightly, and said, “Sorry to disturb you all!”

Since the elder was so polite, Du Xian couldn’t be rude. He returned the gesture and said, “Elder Li, you’re too courteous.” After a pause, he asked, “May I ask what brings you here?”

The old man surnamed Li said calmly, “On my young master’s orders, I’ve come to invite someone over.”

Hearing this, Du Xian couldn’t help glancing at Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan replied impatiently, “Go back and tell your young master I don’t have time!”

Elder Li looked at Ye Qinghan with a strange expression and smiled, “The Young Sect Master is mistaken. My Young Master is inviting this young man here.”

As he spoke, he pointed at Yang Kai.

“Uh…” Ye Qinghan’s face turned bright red in embarrassment. “Invite… him? For what?”

Du Xian and the others were also stunned. Like Ye Qinghan, they had all assumed Elder Li was here for her, since Qiu Yu had always shown interest in her. Who would have thought things would turn out so dramatically, leaving Ye Qinghan at a loss for words.

Elder Li said, “My Young Master didn’t say. I don’t know either. I was just told to invite this young man over.”

Hearing this, everyone turned their eyes to Yang Kai.

At a glance, many couldn’t help but smirk.

Yang Kai had somehow pulled the fruit plate in front of him, grabbing a spirit fruit in each hand and eating with gusto. Several fruit pits were already on the table before him. No one knew when he’d started, but in just a short while, he’d eaten nearly half the fruit.

His eating was animated and ravenous, like a starving ghost reincarnated, leaving the Thousand Leaves Sect disciples dumbfounded.

Because Elder Li had suddenly come to their table, many people were watching curiously. Seeing Yang Kai eat like this, they shook their heads and sighed, their eyes full of disdain, thinking he must be some country bumpkin who’d never seen the world, making a fool of himself over a plate of spirit fruit.

The Thousand Leaves Sect disciples felt thoroughly embarrassed.

“Young Master Yang!” Ye Qinghan’s face was burning as she nudged him, signaling him to restrain himself.

Yang Kai turned his head, his mouth stuffed with unknown fruit, juices dripping as he chewed noisily. He pushed the fruit plate toward Ye Qinghan and said, “You want some? If you want it, just take it.”

Ye Qinghan’s mouth twitched, her face growing even redder.

Yang Kai, seemingly oblivious, pushed the fruit plate toward the other Thousand Leaves Sect disciples. “Don’t be shy, everyone. They taste great, and eating more can even improve your cultivation. These spirit fruits must have been freshly picked—they’re delicious.”

The Thousand Leaves Sect disciples didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. They didn’t know Yang Kai’s background, nor why Ye Qinghan always kept him by her side. Seeing him act so disgracefully, they all turned their heads away, pretending not to know him.

“Ahem…” Du Xian coughed lightly. “Young Master Yang, Elder Li is here to see you.”

“Elder Li? What Elder Li?” Yang Kai said, “Who’s Elder Li?”

“Young man, we meet again.” Elder Li’s forehead veins bulged. He’d been left standing there for quite a while, completely ignored by Yang Kai. As a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, he was naturally annoyed.

Only then did Yang Kai look up at him, grinning. “Oh, it’s you. Why aren’t you with Qiu Yu? What are you doing here?”
