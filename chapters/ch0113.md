## Chapter 113 — The Death of Long Hui

One cannot deny that although Long Hui was a spoiled young master, he knew well how to provoke his enemy, crafting opportunities for his own victory.

Each time he evaded one of Yang Kai’s strikes, he would taunt with a sneer.

Had it been anyone else, they would have long since been driven mad by such provocation.

Yang Kai appeared no different, his eyes bloodshot, Primordial Qi surging restlessly throughout his body, clearly agitated. Yet upon closer observation, his gaze was resolute; despite the relentless mockery, his determination to win remained unshaken.

The fierce battle lasted the span of an incense stick. Yang Kai launched countless attacks, yet not once did he graze even a corner of Long Hui’s garment.

Long Hui’s tongue was dry from taunting, but inwardly he was filled with astonishment.

By all logic, after such a prolonged fight, this youth should have been running low on Primordial Qi, yet every strike he delivered remained as forceful as before. His reserves simply could not support such a relentless assault.

Long Hui’s suspicion was correct. An ordinary Open Origin Realm warrior could not maintain such vigor without faltering. But Yang Kai was clearly no ordinary Open Origin Realm cultivator. Long Hui had gravely misjudged the situation by engaging in a war of attrition.

As he pondered this, Yang Kai struck again. Long Hui hurriedly dodged, but just as his form settled, he heard a sharp slicing sound. A scorching attack grazed his side.

Looking down, he saw a cut torn into his clothing. That strike had nearly inflicted a real wound.

“Such a pity!” Yang Kai inhaled deeply, his eyes shining with excitement, yet mingled with an opposite calmness—a contradictory but perfectly fused expression.

“How is that possible?” Long Hui’s face changed drastically.

That strike was clearly a preemptive attack, anticipating where he would land. Had luck not been on his side, he might have been seriously injured.

But how could Yang Kai predict his landing spot? Could it be that in the brief time of an incense stick, Yang Kai had already seen through his Golden Rainbow Step?

Impossible! At his Open Origin Realm strength, his vision could not be so keen.

“Next time, you will either die or be gravely wounded!” Yang Kai said coldly, his tone resolute.

“Bullshit!” Long Hui roared in anger. “If you want to bluff this young master, you’re still too green!”

Yang Kai said nothing, only pressing forward with a furious assault.

Fury filled Long Hui’s heart. This time, he no longer used Golden Rainbow Step to dodge but met Yang Kai’s attack with a punch.

With a solid thud, Yang Kai’s form remained unmoved, as steady as a mountain. It was Long Hui who staggered backward, feeling a scorching Primordial Qi invade his body.

Howling in pain, Long Hui dared not clash head-on again. He hastily employed Golden Rainbow Step, trying to put distance between himself and Yang Kai.

With a sharp whistle, a drop of crimson liquid suddenly shot forth. Just as Long Hui halted, it struck his chest.

A scream erupted. Long Hui’s face twisted in horror, clutching his chest as he gasped for breath. Blood foamed at the corner of his mouth as he cried out, “Impossible, impossible! This cannot be!”

His Golden Rainbow Step had truly been seen through. The attack landed precisely where he had just stepped, leaving him no chance to evade.

Moreover, the strike was terrifyingly ruthless, piercing through a Common-Grade Upper-Level defensive treasure he wore close to his body, and penetrating into his flesh. Were it not for his own Primordial Qi partially blocking it, this blow would have surely pierced through.

“Nothing is impossible!” Yang Kai’s expression was grim as he stepped forward swiftly. Long Hui dared not linger and immediately turned to flee toward Wen Feichen’s direction, shouting, “Chief Wen, save me!”

Now, Long Hui was like a lost dog, utterly terrified, no trace of his previous arrogance and composure remaining.

No sooner had he landed than a searing pain struck his back, sending him sprawling to the ground.

Before he could rise, a heavy foot pressed down on his neck, the force like a mountain crushing him. Long Hui thrashed on the ground but could not turn over.

“I am the grandson of Long Zaitian, Vice Chief of the Blood Battle Gang. You’ve crossed me. I can give you money, women—whatever you want. Killing me will do you no good; it will only make you an enemy of the Long family,” Long Hui begged desperately, unable to resist. Yet his eyes, turned away from Yang Kai, burned with unparalleled hatred.

	“Young Master Long!” Yang Kai inhaled deeply. “Your screams are most unpleasant to hear.”

“Yes, yes! Brother Yang is right. If you don’t like it, then stop screaming!” Under the roof, Long Hui dared not defy.

“Then shut up forever!” With that, Yang Kai stomped on Long Hui’s head, grinding his face into the earth. Squatting down, he delivered a crushing punch to Long Hui’s neck.

A crisp crack echoed. Long Hui’s neck snapped. His wide eyes filled with terror and regret.

Lifting Long Hui’s corpse, Yang Kai rose and swiftly approached the other side of the battlefield.

After a moment, the figures of Wen Feichen and Xia Ningshang came into view.

At this moment, the two were evenly matched, neither yielding to the other.

One’s strength was sealed, the other injured and not yet recovered, so neither could unleash their full power. Their techniques were thus somewhat restrained.

Yet even so, the battle between such masters was far fiercer than any Yang Kai had witnessed.

Their forms darted and shifted, Primordial Qi bursting forth, the fight intense and unyielding.

Yang Kai watched for a while, realizing that if he faced Wen Feichen one-on-one, victory would be unlikely. But now with Xia Ningshang joining, the odds were less certain.

After some thought, Yang Kai made his decision. Carrying Long Hui’s corpse, he advanced rapidly toward Wen Feichen, shouting, “Chief Wen, look who this is!”

Wen Feichen had already noticed Yang Kai but dared not divert his attention to investigate, unaware of the details here. Hearing this, he turned in surprise, exclaiming, “Young Master Long!”

Long Hui’s chest bore a large hole, blood flowing freely. His neck was limp, bones shattered, head drooping lifelessly against his chest.

Long Hui was dead! Wen Feichen could hardly believe his eyes. This spoiled young master was at least a first-stage Qi Movement Realm warrior, and had cultivated many coveted martial techniques, his combat prowess formidable.

Because Wen Feichen trusted his strength, he had allowed him to fight Yang Kai alone. But now, how could he be dead?

This was bad, very bad! Wen Feichen cursed inwardly. Others in the Blood Battle Gang dying was one thing, but Long Hui’s death would surely enrage Long Zaitian. If this Divine Roaming Realm expert blamed him, Wen Feichen would be unable to bear the consequences.
