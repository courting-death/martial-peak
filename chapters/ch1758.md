## Chapter 1758 — Unexpected

That enormous black shadow took shape and swung its two long arms down, striking like a pair of inky whips; the assault was ferocious, like lightning and thunder.

Feeling the terrifying power hidden in those two attacks, Luo Lan's expression changed; without hesitation she bit her tongue and spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood, and the haftless long sword gleamed magnificently, transforming into a world-shocking great sword that slashed downward.

The collision was soundless; the black shadow's two arms were halted for an instant, and Luo Lan's Secret Treasure long sword was even knocked flying.

The attacks the fused black shadow could unleash were countless times stronger than those smaller black shadows!

A Divine Soul Secret Treasure was driven by the power of one’s Divine Sense. Though its might was unpredictable and profound, any damage it suffered would also rebound upon its wielder’s Soul. Thus, the instant that longsword was struck aside, Luo Lan’s delicate face turned pale, and she spat out a mouthful of blood mist.

With her mighty cultivation at the Void King Stage, she had actually been injured by a single move.

At that moment everyone clearly realized how formidable those bizarre black shadows were.

Fortunately, by then the four had already burst out from underground and flown aloft; they dared not look back or linger and continued to ascend.

From the depths of the ravine came an earth-shattering roar; two huge black arms probed out from the earth, spreading ten fingers that became gigantic demonic claws and reached to snatch at the four of them.

But the distance seemed a little short; when those two giant palms were still more than ten zhang from the last person, Luo Lan, they grasped at empty air.

The next moment the two giant palms slowly withdrew, and the howling that had filled everyone’s ears gradually subsided; the world fell quiet once more.

The leader, Ni Guang, eased his speed and finally hovered in midair, looking down thoughtfully.

"These things... don't seem to be following us out." Yang Kai also noticed the problem.

"Looks like it," Ni Guang nodded in agreement with Yang Kai, "but we still can't let our guard down — it's best to leave this place first."

The other three hastily nodded and followed Ni Guang as they continued flying away.

A quarter of an hour later the four touched down at a safe spot; although the vicinity remained desolate, the crisscrossing ravines were gone. After confirming there truly was no danger, they stopped to rest.

Although the previous crisis had been resolved, they still harbored a lingering unease.

This attack had been utterly unforeseeable; after all, before entering that underground ravine they had scouted the surroundings, and with two Void King Stage experts stationed there they still could not avoid being ambushed. It was truly baffling.

"Elder Luo, how are your injuries?" Ni Guang asked, looking at Luo Lan's pale face.

"Nothing serious, only some disturbance in my Divine Soul," Luo Lan said after frowning and sensing her condition.

"That's good," Ni Guang breathed a sigh of relief; he had once thought that with his Second Stage of the Void King Stage cultivation, even in this Lost Realm things might not be entirely smooth, but he could not have imagined encountering anything truly lethal — after this experience he dared not be so confident.

If Yang Kai had not helped him escape, he did not know how long he would have remained trapped in the illusion — perhaps until his flesh withered and he could not awaken, at which point both soul and body would surely have been annihilated.

"Uncle Ni, what exactly were those things?" Xue Yue asked with lingering fear; what she experienced in the illusion had felt real, and even after Yang Kai awakened her she still could not quickly adapt to the real world.

"I don't know either; I've never heard of such things in the Lost Realm. Elder Luo, have you heard of them?" Ni Guang shook his head and asked Luo Lan.

"I don't know much about the Lost Realm. I have never heard of such strange things," Luo Lan replied.

"It seems those who encountered these things before did not survive, so no intelligence about them was leaked out," Ni Guang mused. "But fortunately, judging from earlier, although they were extremely concealed and even I could not detect their existence, they can only survive in the dim underground; as long as we do not go below, we should not meet them again. And... we weren't delayed much. In that illusion I felt like I lived for many years, but judging from our current states we at most wasted one or two hours. Their methods are truly terrifying!"

Hearing this, the other three all nodded slightly.

"Elder Luo, you should heal first; when you're about ready we'll set out," Ni Guang said, looking again at Luo Lan.

"Then I will trouble you all; I'll be as quick as I can," Luo Lan said gratefully.

She and Ni Guang were not particularly close, so his willingness to wait for her naturally made her grateful — it also testified to Ni Guang's character and showed he was someone worth cooperating with.

Ni Guang's strength exceeded hers; cooperating with a man like him was precisely what Luo Lan desired.

However, it could also be related to her earlier self-sacrificing action; Ni Guang's attitude toward her was noticeably more cordial than at first.

Got it. Here’s the same translation without the em dash and with clean, natural flow:

Luo Lan hadn’t expected that by bringing Yang Kai into the Lost Realm, intending to rely on his mastery of Spatial Power, she would instead gain Ni Guang’s assistance. Without Yang Kai, Ni Guang would never have invited her to act together.

Luo Lan swallowed a Spiritual Pill and began to repair the wounds to her Divine Soul.

Yang Kai's gaze, however, turned to the nearby void.

He could feel faint fluctuations of spatial power somewhere in that void; from the traces of that energy he could even deduce that a hidden spatial rift lay in that position!

It seemed Luo Lan was right — this Lost Realm truly was a deadly place, and it did contain spatial fissures invisible to the naked eye.

But if someone rashly passed through one, they would be sliced in two by the rift, dying with their eyes unclosed.

"What are you looking at?" Xue Yue suddenly came over and asked softly.

He wasn’t sure if it was just his imagination, but ever since a moment ago, Yang Kai had noticed a subtle change in Xue Yue’s attitude toward him. Before, the way she looked at him had been full of conflict, carrying a trace of love and hate intertwined.

But now her look was gentle; even during the escape she had been clutching Yang Kai's arm as if at ease.

"Nothing," Yang Kai shook his head. "What's wrong with you? What exactly did you experience in that illusion? With your disposition you shouldn't have been affected so deeply."

He had asked casually, but unexpectedly Xue Yue flushed as if she recalled something unbearably shameful and snorted, "None of your business!"

Yang Kai was left dumbstruck and couldn't help but snort, "Fine, I won't ask then. It definitely isn't anything good."

Xue Yue grit her teeth and glared at him; Yang Kai immediately felt uneasy and glanced about to divert her attention.

Only then did he notice Ni Guang taking out a beast-skin map, frowning as he scrutinized it, occasionally releasing Divine Sense to compare it with the surrounding terrain.

The map gave no clear information; it was mostly intersecting lines, with a few spots marked differently.

"Your Commerce Guild actually has a map of this place?" Yang Kai's face showed surprise.

Xue Yue smiled. "What's there to be surprised about? Our Commerce Guild people aren't new to places like this. Having a map for one or two spots is nothing remarkable. But the Lost Realm is too vast; we can't possess maps for the whole place. The one Uncle Ni has is just a very small portion."

"I see," Yang Kai nodded. "So you do have a specific destination?"

"Yes, we're heading to a Medicine Valley where many Spiritual Medicines not found in the Star Domains grow. It's said those medicines surpass Void King-Grade levels; some can revive the dead, some can reverse aging and prolong life, and some can greatly increase one's strength..."

Yang Kai looked at her with an odd expression.

"What's the matter?" Xue Yue asked suspiciously.

“You really don’t have the slightest sense of caution, do you? That’s not like you,” Yang Kai said with a smile. Though they were all allies for the moment, what Xue Yue had just revealed was undoubtedly highly important information.

She wasn't a fool; otherwise she couldn't have become the Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Her freely given revelations surprised Yang Kai.

Hearing this, Xue Yue blinked as if realizing something, then looked away and sneered, "So what if I told you? With Uncle Ni here, can you still snatch it out of a tiger's mouth?"

That sounded like a clumsy attempt to cover something up, and Yang Kai did not press further.

From that comparison Yang Kai realized Luo Lan's actions had been too rash this time; Ni Guang dared to enter relying on his formidable cultivation and preparations, but Luo Lan had been hot-blooded, thinking that bringing Yang Kai meant she could do as she pleased — she had underestimated the Lost Realm.

……

About an hour after Yang Kai and the others had left, a figure fell from the sky and landed nearby where they had been in the ravine.

His body was wrapped in a swirl of black qi that emitted an evil, violent aura; this man was none other than the Void King Stage expert Yang Kai had observed earlier.

After he landed he looked around, inhaled deeply, and let out a rasping, mocking laugh: "Good, indeed nearby — seems he hasn't been gone long. That brat Yang, I didn't expect that in just these few years he's grown to this degree, truly unexpected."

Had Yang Kai heard those words he would have turned pale with shock, for he did not know who this Void King Stage expert was; yet from the man's words it was obvious he knew Yang Kai and seemed to care quite a bit about him.
