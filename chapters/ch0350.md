## Chapter 350 — Separation

Above the cave, the people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect, along with the Sisters from the Hu Family, all wore anxious expressions as they silently waited.

It has been half a month since Yang Kai entered seclusion, yet he still had not appeared. Instead, the cave he was in had been completely frozen over by thick layers of ice.

"Why hasn't Brother Yang come out yet? What if something happened?" Cheng Ying paced back and forth, her mouth not able to remain quiet.

As soon as she finished speaking, she sensed three cold gazes directed at her, causing her to shrink her head and laugh awkwardly.

Shen Yi helplessly smiled: "It's a pity that none of us have reached the Divine Roaming Realm. If someone had cultivated Divine Sense, we could investigate the situation over there."

Tao Yang shook his head seriously: "No, even with Divine Sense, we can't probe. That ice cold is probably strong enough to freeze ordinary Divine Sense."

Hearing this, everyone was stunned and grew increasingly worried.

After a long wait.

A cracking sound suddenly came from the ice layer that covered a radius of tens of zhang. Then, the seemingly eternal Xuan Ice shattered like flour, and amidst the swirling crystal powder, a figure shot out, soaring towards them.

Everyone's expressions brightened, rushing to meet him.

"You finally came out. If you had taken any longer, we would have to break in to check on things." Shen Yi laughed heartily upon seeing Yang Kai land.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. He glanced at everyone and nodded: "I apologize for making everyone worry."

"Now that you're out, we should leave this place. The Evil Cave is currently restless." Leng Shan said with some urgency.

Tao Yang also nodded slightly.

The Bloodthirsty Evil Cave had shown such intense energy fluctuations, and two of the Chimeras and Demons under the Ghost King's seat had been lost. With news of a Demonic Spirit appearing, many masters of the Divine Roaming Realm had already arrived to investigate the situation while Yang Kai was in seclusion.

If they stayed any longer, it would surely lead to more troubles.

Thirty li away from the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

The group halted their steps.

Shen Yi curiously asked: "Brother Yang, I saw that the Chimeras and Demons suffered heavy casualties. How is it that you came out unscathed, and you seem to have gained something as well?"

Hearing his question, everyone turned their gaze towards him, curious about the matter.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded: "Just a small gain. Those four old fellows fought against the things that came from the Evil Spirit Fountain and ended up injuring each other. I took advantage of their misfortune due to good luck."

"This..." Shen Yi was left dumbfounded. He couldn't help but chuckle: "Indeed, you have had good fortune. This is quite the miraculous occurrence."

Tao Yang laughed lightly: "It seems that being captured by Chimeras and Demons brought you an opportunity. Those old fellows truly lost out this time. Haha!"

"Why wasn't I encountered?" Cheng Ying mumbled, jealousy and admiration on her face.

Leng Shan coldly sneered: "Unless it's Yang Kai; everyone else here who got captured would undoubtedly perish. Do you think picking up chances is easy?"

Cheng Ying laughed awkwardly: "I was just saying it casually."

How could they not understand how difficult it was to gain an advantage from Chimeras and Demons? Although Yang Kai did not elaborate, it was clear that there were dangers not known to others. Only he could survive in the hands of Chimeras and Demons.

Through their time together, they had witnessed Yang Kai's formidable abnormality countless times and knew he could not be treated as an ordinary True Essence Realm martial artist.

"Regardless of everything," Shen Yi's expression became serious as he affectionately patted Yang Kai's shoulder: "This time, all of us from Ghost King Valley owe you a great deal of gratitude. If you need anything in the future, just call for us. I can't guarantee anything else, but for everyone here, we will do our utmost, risking our lives if necessary!"

The people from Ghost King Valley all nodded in agreement.

Tao Yang laughed: "The four of us fellow disciples also feel the same. Although we might not be adept at fighting, as far as refining treasures goes, if Brother Yang wants to forge any treasures in the future, feel free to come find me at Baoqi Sect."

"Okay!" Yang Kai nodded seriously.

"This place is not far from Ghost King Valley. If it's convenient for you, Brother Yang, you should come by our sect for a few days?" Shen Yi warmly extended the invitation.

"It would be better if he didn't go." Leng Shan said coldly.

"Junior Sister, you are being too unsympathetic." Shen Yi's face turned sour. He had wanted to engage with Yang Kai more, but found Leng Shan giving him a cold shoulder.

"I am just looking out for him, do you understand?" Leng Shan shot him a glare. "Our Master knows him, and if he goes to Ghost King Valley, he might not live to see the next sunrise."

Shen Yi was suddenly apprehensive, remembering that Master Gui Li seemed to have a deep-seated grudge with the leader of Lingxiao Pavilion.

He immediately dared not mention it again and turned to look at Tao Yang: "What about you?"

Tao Yang replied with a smile: "Even without your invitation, we would join you. I am quite curious about the place in Ghost King Valley where they nurture spirits. I wonder if I could have a look."

"That would be wonderful." Shen Yi laughed heartily.

"Then let’s part ways here. Take care of yourselves." Leng Shan said, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Take care, Brother Yang, and the two ladies. Until we meet again!" Shen Yi called out to everyone, cupping his fists towards Yang Kai and the Sisters from the Hu Family.

"Take care." Yang Kai returned the gesture, watching as the people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect departed together.

"The people from evil sects aren't so bad after all." Once only the three of them were left, Hu Mei’er suddenly spoke up, "Those from Ghost King Valley are quite nice."

Hu Jiao’er nodded in agreement and said seriously: "Good and bad only exist in relative terms."

Yang Kai couldn't help but chuckle at her, while Hu Jiao'er blushed and shot him a glare: "You smug brat! I haven't settled that score with you yet."

"What score?" Yang Kai looked confused.

Fuming at him, Hu Jiao'er hesitated to mention what happened earlier, shaking her head: "It's nothing. Where are you heading now?"

Yang Kai was taken aback, pondering for a moment, he could not decide where to go.

Seeing his vacant and dazed eyes, the Sisters from the Hu Family felt a pang in their hearts.

The powerful and strange man before them was no longer the confident and spirited person he was in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave. Now, he resembled a lost child, unsure of where to go or where home was.

Influenced by his bewilderment, Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei’er also felt a tinge of sorrow.

"Let's leave Cangyun Evil Land," Hu Jiao'er quickly changed the subject, unable to look at his lost expression any longer.

"Alright!" Yang Kai's eyes quickly regained clarity and determination. Although he didn’t know where to go, he was certain of one thing: he must continuously grow stronger. The goal on the path of martial arts has always been clear and will not be swayed by anything.

After a pause, he asked: "Where are you headed? To Blood Battle Gang?"

"We can’t go back," Hu Jiao'er sighed. "We can't return until this conflict is over; otherwise, we would draw suspicion."

They from Blood Battle Gang had been entangled in the affairs of Lingxiao Pavilion and were pressured by those mighty forces to participate in this battle. If they returned at this time, it would only bring troubles to Blood Battle Gang.

"Then let's go find the others from the gang," Hu Mei’er suggested, "Fifty of our people came this time; they should still be fighting in that area."

"What do you think?" Hu Jiao'er looked at Yang Kai.

"Count me in with you," Yang Kai shrugged. He also wanted to go to a place with more people to gather information about the situation of those from Lingxiao Pavilion, especially the whereabouts of Ling Taixu and Su Yan's groups.

Looking at the Sisters from the Hu Family, he suddenly smiled: "But before that, you both need to change your appearances."

"What do you mean?" Hu Jiao'er frowned.

"How did you end up being targeted by Xiaoyao Sect? Haven't you learned your lesson yet?"

Hu Jiao'er quickly realized, her expression cooling as she said: "Looking beautiful isn't our fault! If there weren’t so many lecherous people like you in the world, we wouldn’t be so troubled! We never offended anyone, and wherever we go, someone is eyeing us. It's so annoying!"

Though she said so, Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei’er had no choice but to follow Yang Kai's advice.

After all, this was Cangyun Evil Land, where lecherous people were even more rampant and brazen than outside.

After some disguising, the two sisters' beauty was finally masked a bit. With no suitable tools at hand, they couldn't do much, but at the very least, they wouldn't draw attention at first sight.

Their disguises left them looking shabby — the elder sister dust-covered and disheveled, the younger dotted with freckles that completely ruined her beauty.

Once they finished their disguises and exchanged glances, they both found it hard to bear.

Even though their looks were somewhat hidden, their enchanting figures were still impossible to conceal.

The three of them proceeded cautiously through Cangyun Evil Land, trying to avoid contact with others.

At that moment, Yang Kai's Divine Sense displayed its great effect. As he spread out his consciousness, the situation within a radius of thirty li became clear, allowing him to anticipate threats and hiding the Sisters from the Hu Family away before danger even approached.

Without him, the Sisters from the Hu Family would have never escaped from Cangyun Evil Land.

A month later, the three of them, weary and worn out, finally left Cangyun Evil Land after traversing thousands of li.

After a month of hiding and fighting, both Yang Kai and the Sisters from the Hu Family were mentally and physically exhausted.

Fortunately, this journey was fraught with surprises but no real dangers. The most dangerous encounter was with a Fourth Stage master of the Divine Roaming Realm, who suffered severe wounds from Yang Kai’s unexpected soul technique and fled in panic.

In that battle, Yang Kai was also injured quite badly, but after the attentive care of the sisters and the effect of Wan Yao Ling Ye, he recovered fully in just two or three days.

Throughout this month, the Sisters from the Hu Family gradually grew reliant on Yang Kai, placing great trust in him, and they would no longer refute whatever he said.

Even the usually combative Hu Jiao'er no longer dared to treat Yang Kai as the reckless kid he was two years ago. Having witnessed Yang Kai's miraculous abilities multiple times with her sister was enough to change her perception of him.

If it weren't for his protection, Hu Jiao'er didn't know what state she and her sister would be in now.
