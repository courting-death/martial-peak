## Chapter 83 — Xia Ningshang’s Special Trait

That night, when Yang Kai broke through to the Open Origin Realm, a masked woman suddenly attacked him. At first, he thought she intended to kill him, but by the end of their clash, he realized that was not the case. She was only trying to help him; otherwise, with her strength, he would have stood no chance.

From that moment, Yang Kai had his doubts, and now he finally confirmed the identity of that masked woman.

At this instant, Yang Kai’s heart brimmed with gratitude toward Senior Sister Xia.

Old Shopkeeper Meng appeared at an inopportune moment, stepping between Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang like a protective hen shielding her cherished chick, guarding his precious disciple behind him.

Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously. “You know each other?”

Meng Wuya snorted with pride and arrogance. “She’s my disciple!”

“Disciple?” Yang Kai’s jaw nearly dropped to the ground, his eyes darting back and forth between Xia Ningshang and Meng Wuya in disbelief.

Who would have thought that Shopkeeper Meng, so unreliable in every way, actually took on a disciple? Wasn’t that just leading someone astray?

“You two… know each other?” Meng Wuya glanced sideways at Yang Kai.

“No!” Xia Ningshang answered decisively, hiding behind Meng Wuya and waving her small hands vigorously.

Yang Kai caught her meaning and chuckled softly. “Not exactly acquaintances. Senior Sister just helped me out that one night.”

Meng Wuya nodded slightly. Xia Ningshang had told him about that night’s encounter. It was precisely because of that fight that she noticed the purity of the True Yang Yuan Qi within Yang Kai.

“Shopkeeper Meng, what did Senior Sister want me to help with? Can you tell me?” Yang Kai straightened his expression. Since it concerned Xia Ningshang, he naturally would not refuse.

Meng Wuya did not answer but looked at his precious disciple, asking tentatively, “Is he capable?”

Xia Ningshang’s delicate earlobes flushed red. She lowered her gaze, her long eyelashes fluttering, and after a long moment, she nodded faintly.

Seeing her like this, Meng Wuya sighed. “Fine, fine, there’s not much time left. It’ll have to be him.”

Yang Kai watched in confusion but did not ask.

After a moment, Meng Wuya suddenly asked seriously, “Yang Kai, do you know that some people in this world are born different from others? These individuals possess abilities that ordinary people can never even glimpse.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn as he softly replied, “Shopkeeper Meng means those with special constitutions?”

“Exactly.” Meng Wuya nodded. “These people are blessed by heaven, the favored sons and daughters of the heavens. Some have constitutions suited for cultivation, some recover quickly from injuries, and others are naturally suited for combat. There are countless varieties of special constitutions, but no matter which one, if a person possesses such a constitution, they can reach heights in their field that others cannot even dream of. We ordinary folk envy these special constitutions greatly, but such people are exceedingly rare—perhaps not even one in a million. Young Yang Kai, you are fortunate today to meet someone with such a special constitution.”

Yang Kai’s expression tightened as he looked at Xia Ningshang standing behind Meng Wuya in surprise. “Could it be that Senior Sister…”

“Heh heh…” Meng Wuya smiled proudly, clearly delighted, and nodded slightly. “Indeed, Ningshang’s constitution is unlike that of ordinary people.”

Yang Kai’s emotions stirred. He never imagined that this shy, timid Senior Sister could be so blessed.

“What kind of constitution does Senior Sister have?” Yang Kai asked, curiosity piqued.

Meng Wuya did not answer immediately but pondered for a moment before saying, “The fruits on that tree have just ripened. Disciple, go and pick them.”

“Alright.” Xia Ningshang obeyed and walked to the last Three Yang Fruit tree, gently plucking three fruits from its branches.

Yang Kai did not interrupt to ask questions, sensing that his doubts would soon be resolved.

“Disciple, show him your skill,” Meng Wuya chuckled.

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly and stepped before Yang Kai, extending one slender, fair hand. On her delicate palm rested the three freshly picked Three Yang Fruits.

“Junior Brother, please watch,” Xia Ningshang said softly, beginning to circulate her Yuan Qi.

Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed to astonishment. As Xia Ningshang cultivated, a red energy began to seep from the fruits on her hand.

That was the Yang Yuan Qi contained within the fruits. Yang Kai cultivated the True Yang Technique and was extremely sensitive to Yang energy. Naturally, he could sense the energy being rapidly drawn out from the Three Yang Fruits.

But… how was this possible?

The energy flowing from the fruits gathered before Xia Ningshang, held firm despite the howling wind. In less than ten breaths, the three fruits lost their original color, their internal energy completely depleted. Not only that, the fruits quickly withered until, when the wind blew, they crumbled into powder and dispersed into the air.

Xia Ningshang moved again, one hand supporting the condensed Yang energy, the other dancing continuously in the void.

With her movements, the Yang energy from beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine surged upward like a pillar of water, rushing toward Xia Ningshang. She casually grabbed a stream of energy and threw it into the red energy mass before her.

Her delicate hands moved faster and faster, each grasp pulling in more Yang energy from below the ravine, merging it into the red energy sphere.

As time passed, the red energy mass did not grow larger but instead shrank.

However, the Yang Yuan Qi contained within it grew ever more abundant.

After a moment, Xia Ningshang ceased drawing Yang energy from the ravine. She pressed the red energy sphere inward with both hands.

Her palms quickly closed, and when she opened them again, three bright red pills appeared, round and lustrous, their halos and markings clearly visible.

Yang Kai was stunned!

This scene could only be described as miraculous.

Only now did Yang Kai understand how Senior Sister Xia’s bottle of pills had been made. It was all crafted in this way!

But… this was far too simple and effortless. Alchemists were rare, and refining pills carried risks of failure. Moreover, alchemists needed special tools, such as medicinal furnaces and fires.

Yet Senior Sister Xia only moved her hands, using nothing but the Three Yang Fruits, and easily refined three pills.

“Here you go!” Xia Ningshang extended her hand toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming the shock in his heart. He picked up the three pills and carefully examined them, discovering that each pill contained even more Yang Yuan Qi than a single Three Yang Fruit. After all, Xia Ningshang had borrowed the Yang energy from beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine during the refining process.

“If Senior Sister took up alchemy, the people of Medicine King Valley would be out of business,” Yang Kai said with a wry smile. He had never seen anyone simplify pill refining to such an extent.
