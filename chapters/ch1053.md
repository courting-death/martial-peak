## Chapter 1053 — Medicine Fields

The next day, at dawn.

The first ray of sunlight revealed itself from behind the mountain range, passing over the ridges as if magnified a thousandfold — a single thread of light, yet gilded and blinding.

Bathed in the morning light, the mountains looked splendid—briefly gilded in golden radiance that inspired awe.

Countless martial artists lifted their heads to gaze at the summit, their expressions solemn.

A stern aura emanated from the vast mountain body, seeping outward, making the rolling peaks appear as if a divine dragon lay prostrate upon the earth.

On the second floor of the pavilion, Yang Kai opened his eyes from meditation and sent out his Divine Sense to probe; he discovered Xue Yue was no longer there, but another unfamiliar life-sign waited outside.

Yang Kai turned and saw a warrior dressed as a guard; the cultivation fluctuations radiating from him surpassed Yang Kai's by a notch — he should be a Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivator.

The man stood there bored and a little impatient, his face rather displeased, as if someone had tasked him with a duty he did not like.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai hopped lightly down from the second floor, landed before the man and asked casually, "Friend, is there something you need?"

The man heard the sound, turned back, and unwillingly cupped his fist, saying, "You are the guard of Lady Xue, aren't you?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"Lady Xue said she will handle some affairs today with Lord Halika and it might take a few days. She said you are unfamiliar with this place and asked me to entertain you!"

"Entertain me?" Yang Kai's brow twitched.

"My Rainfall Star has many places for merriment — I guarantee you won't be disappointed!" As he spoke he sized up Yang Kai from head to toe. He couldn't fathom why this young man, being Lady Xue's guard, was not beside his mistress protecting her, instead expecting the fair and lovely Lady Xue to fuss over his comforts.

Who did he think he was? If every guard enjoyed such treatment, that would be far too enviable; he himself, also a guard, had never encountered such good fortune.

He felt indignant and almost wished he could trail after Lady Xue as well, to offer his service like a hound.

Hearing this, Yang Kai understood at once — Xue Yue feared he would be lonely, so she intended to have him find something to do. After a moment's thought, he smiled and shook his head, "I appreciate your kindness, friend, but I do not like crowds, nor do I seek revelry."

The man regarded Yang Kai with a strange look, apparently surprised by his sobriety, and nodded slightly. "There are quieter places. Right now the branch is holding a grand auction that lasts several days — many rare treasures will appear. If you have interest, you could take a look."

"An auction?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Yes. About half the items are provided by the guilds, and many outsiders bring gems plundered from expeditions to have the guild auction them. Such great events are held every few years and occasionally produce exceedingly rare treasures."

"That sounds rather interesting." Yang Kai showed a pleased expression. He had never attended such an event before; back on the Tongxuan Continent he had heard of them many times and knew they were an important avenue for martial artists to obtain rare items.

"The Rainfall Star's auction lasts many days, and only Saint Crystal transactions are accepted on the floor. But after the auction concludes, a private market opens. That private market depends on individual preference — you can trade in Saint Crystal or barter with items!" Seeing Yang Kai's interest, the man elaborated and then asked, "Would you like to go and see?"

He had sized Yang Kai up and realized the youth seemed inexperienced, but since Lady Xue esteemed him, he ought to be treated with courtesy.

"How many Saint Crystals must one prepare to take part?" Yang Kai asked.

The man smiled and said casually, "Five hundred thousand, otherwise you may not even qualify to participate."

"Five hundred thousand..." Yang Kai's mouth twitched subtly.

On the Floating Continent he had seized quite a number of Saint Crystals from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance, but the total was not large; after buying the Star Shuttle and ore, he only had a few hundred Saint Crystals left.

Fifty thousand, or rather five hundred thousand — that figure was utterly unattainable for him; to his present self it was an astronomical sum.

He did possess many Origin-Grade and even Void King-Grade Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines; any of those would fetch a high price if sold. But Yang Kai was an alchemist, and those materials would greatly aid his alchemical path, so he had no intention of selling them.

"Have you made up your mind?" the man urged impatiently; he had been ordered to take Yang Kai out for leisure, yet Yang Kai dawdled and annoyed him.

"Forget it, I'll pass." Yang Kai waved his hand; merely attending the auction for spectacle was tedious, and he had no urgent need to purchase anything.

"Do as you please then." The man no longer bothered with Yang Kai, cupped his fist and left.

Bathed in the warm sunshine, one felt comfortable through and through. For someone like Yang Kai, who cultivated Yang-attribute methods and martial skills, sunlight always brought a familiar, kindly feeling.

Standing before the pavilion, his pores opened wide and countless threads of sunlight turned into specks of radiance that sank into Yang Kai's limbs and bones.

His mood lightened, his mind broadened.

Though he had declined the guard's invitation, he himself wished to stroll about.

He did not know when Xue Yue would return; staying here held little purpose.

Besides, he was eager to find a safe way to undo the Soul Chain.

The Soul Chain could be undone whenever he and Xue Yue wished, but doing so was not without risk.

He had never truly believed he and Xue Yue could live in peace — that harmony was an illusion created by the Soul Chain. He had to ensure that once the Soul Chain was broken, Xue Yue would not turn against him; otherwise, the moment the bond dissolved she might strike at him.

He had to be cautious and had long pondered the matter in secret, but could conceive no good method.

He produced his Star Shuttle and broke through the void.

Like a falling meteor he streaked through the clouds, drifting with the current, without a destination, his mind extended far and wide as he flew and thought.

Last time on Shuiyue Star he spent two months traversing the planet — partly to familiarize himself with the structure and customs of cultivation stars in the Star Domain, and partly in the faint hope of finding Su Yan.

Now he came to another cultivation star, hoping again to try his luck.

Rainfall Star was small, much smaller than Shuiyue Star.

Yang Kai needed only twenty days to travel the whole Rainfall Star and yet found no trace of Su Yan.

He was not overly disappointed. The Star Domain was vast and cultivation stars countless; even if Su Yan had come here long ago with the Ice Sect, nobody would necessarily know which star she now resided on — it would not be a matter solved in a short time.

Yang Kai paused atop a mountain peak and looked down.

Suddenly his gaze was drawn to a huge valley in the distance.

The valley covered a considerable area and bore signs of artificial expansion. It should not have been so large, but someone had used a divine technique to naturally extend it outward; at this moment the valley spanned roughly a hundred li across.

In the very center of that valley stood a palace, and around the palace were meticulously tended plots of medicine fields — each plot filled with various Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, their colors dazzling and splendid.

Looking down from the peak, Yang Kai felt that a great formation must have been arrayed over those medicine plots. The surrounding Spiritual Qi flowed ceaselessly into the valley, shrouding it in mist. The Spiritual Qi here was extraordinary.

Even at this distance, Yang Kai seemed able to scent a pleasing fragrance of herbs.

The valley must be home to an alchemist, Yang Kai concluded.

He set off toward it, merely intending to pay a courtesy call to pass the time, but as he approached the valley's airspace a sudden, discordant feeling rose in his heart.

That sensation came from a flicker at the corner of his eye.

He halted his movement and once more scrutinized the medicine plots, comparing them carefully with what he had observed from the peak.

Immediately his eyes narrowed and he understood the source of that discordant feeling.

The rows and ridges of those plots were subtly different from what he'd seen earlier; there were faint, peculiar changes between the plots and the furrows.

He examined more closely, sending out strands of Divine Sense to probe the peculiarities of that medicine plot.

Very quickly Yang Kai discovered that beneath each plot flowed a special force, a power that concorded with certain rules, and it made his heart tremble.

It was precisely these strange forces that altered the distances between ridges and rows, causing each plot to follow a complex rule of change. As the plots' structures shifted, the Spiritual Qi pouring into them seemed more readily absorbed by the herbs and medicines, making them thrive extraordinarily.

Yang Kai's body trembled; his spirit was drawn by those exquisite, uncommon medicine plots. He hovered in midair and sent out his Divine Sense to probe the hidden mysteries within one of the plots.

Inside the palace a small, gaunt old man who appeared half-mad bustled about. He tended to a dozen or more alchemical furnaces, each boiling with concoctions formed from different medicines. The old man was advanced in years, hair and beard white, eye sockets deep, his skin wrinkled and his body scarcely flesh.

Only his eyes shone with brilliant light and boundless excitement; he had nearly poured all his mind into those dozens of furnaces, continuously pulling rare herbs from his Spatial Ring and casting them into the cauldrons.

He busied himself alone with dozens of furnaces, refining dozens of different pills at once without the slightest mistake!
