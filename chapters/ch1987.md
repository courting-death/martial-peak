## Chapter 1987 — Using Tiger Skin as a Grand Banner

Liu Yizhi frowned slightly; although he instinctively felt Mo Xiaoqi's expression was not false and did not resemble some old witch feigning weakness, he still dared not be careless.

After a moment's thought, he asked in a low voice, "May I ask the lady's family name and given name?"

Mo Xiaoqi bit her lip and glared at him, offering no answer.

Liu Yizhi's frown deepened; her silence put him in an awkward position, so he asked again, "Then may I ask which sect you hail from? You seem somewhat familiar—vaguely resembling someone I know. Perhaps our two sects have some ties. If so, please tell me; it would be a shame for relations to be lost because of a misunderstanding."

His obvious intent was to defuse the matter and downplay the incident. After all, Mo Xiaoqi's strangeness unsettled Liu Yizhi; someone like her was best not provoked, lest she bring calamity upon their Sect.

Especially in present-day Fenglin City, where dragons and serpents mixed and representatives from great powers appeared constantly, Liu Yizhi suspected Mo Xiaoqi very likely belonged to the direct disciples of some powerful sect.

Anyone with even a little experience, hearing Liu Yizhi's line of reasoning, would know how to proceed.

But Mo Xiaoqi neither knew nor cared for these subtleties, and she certainly had no intention of giving Liu Yizhi and the Fei Sheng Palace an easy way out. She said, "What ties? I've never even heard of your Fei Sheng Palace before—how could it have anything to do with my Ling... us?"

Liu Yizhi's face darkened instantly; inwardly he cursed Mo Xiaoqi for being tactless, unsure whether she truly did not understand or was pretending not to.

Yet the slip Mo Xiaoqi had made earlier had left Liu Yizhi secretly startled.

She had almost said something beginning with "Ling..." but in this Star Realm there were many forces starting with Ling, and several of them were more than Fei Sheng Palace wished to offend. For a time, Liu Yizhi could not determine her true origins.

Just as he felt increasingly trapped, a strange laugh suddenly rang out from the crowd.

"Who goes there?" Liu Yizhi, already furious, glanced straight toward the source without restraint.

A figure in a black robe stepped forward; his face was hidden, but his voice suggested a man. Power fluctuations of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm rippled from him — nearly the same level as Mo Xiaoqi.

The black-robed man who stepped out was, of course, Yang Kai.

He truly could not stand watching any longer.

Others might not know Mo Xiaoqi's nature, but he did; he realized that if this were not handled well, even if Fei Sheng Palace hesitated, they would still have to strike for face and reputation.

When that time came, he did not know if Mo Xiaoqi could withstand it. Though she possessed many oddities, the other side had a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin who could draw upon the force of heavenly rules. Whether her Secret Treasure could function against that was uncertain.

Rather than answer Liu Yizhi's questions, Yang Kai ignored him and walked toward Mo Xiaoqi, saying, "Miss, so you were here—had me looking all over for you."

"Mi... Miss?" Mo Xiaoqi's heart leapt; believing her whereabouts had been exposed and that her father had sent people to seize her, she reflexively took something from her Spatial Ring, preparing to flee.

But she quickly sensed something was off.

The man's voice sounded oddly familiar to her.

Just then, Yang Kai let a little of his face show.

Mo Xiaoqi stared in astonishment, her beautiful eyes lighting up with joy: "Ah — it's you! You're not dead after all!"

Yang Kai covered his face again and chuckled, "Miss, next time don't hit so hard. I'm tough, but even I couldn't withstand your finishing blow; I had to rest for days to recover."

As he spoke, Yang Kai shot Mo Xiaoqi a subtle look, then, fearing the girl might not notice, quietly transmitted to her via Divine Sense, telling her not to speak.

Mo Xiaoqi bobbed her head like a pecking chick.

The onlookers listened with wry expressions and looked upon Yang Kai with sympathy, as if he were the long-suffering attendant charged with protecting a noble lady who might instead try to kill him—forced to be a nurse and keep watch for her murderous impulses.

"Huh? Miss, what happened here?" Yang Kai feigned surprise and scanned around, then suddenly grew furious and barked, "Who dares attack my lady? Are you tired of living?"

A Void King Realm cultivator at the Third Stage, standing brazenly before a Dao Origin Second Stage expert, wore no hint of fear. Instead he bore a fierce look; murderous intent almost solidified, causing many faces to change.

"Good, good—there truly are such reckless people in the world. Heh heh heh; even if the Star Envoy comes, your life won't be saved now." Yang Kai sneered, eyes scanning with a crimson gleam like a maddened beast.

The viciousness of his expression was one thing, but the implications in his words caused Liu Yizhi's face to collapse.

If even a Star Envoy couldn't help, who were these two? Could they be offspring of high-ranking figures from the Southern Territory's overlord, Star God Palace?

If Liu Yizhi was so fearful, then Ning Yuancheng's reaction was even more extreme.

He had assumed that in Fenglin City, as the young sect lord of Fei Sheng Palace, he could walk with impunity; nobody dared provoke him.

Who knew he would suddenly offend a noble being even the Star Envoy did not reckon with.

In an instant, Ning Yuancheng's face drained of color and his legs trembled as he begged Liu Yizhi with pleading eyes.

Though Liu Yizhi himself possessed the strength of a Dao Origin Second Stage, before those peak powers such cultivation was insignificant; anyone casually sent forth from Star God Palace could crush Fei Sheng Palace to dust.

He swallowed nervously and forced a salute, "Friend, please be calm. This was a misunderstanding between my young master and this young lady; some thoughtless disciples offended her, but they have been punished. Please forgive our improper conduct."

"Oh?" Yang Kai cast a sidelong glance at Liu Yizhi.

"Indeed. Friend, see? This young lady is completely unharmed."

"Hmph—if she were injured, do you think you'd still be standing here talking to me?" Yang Kai scoffed coldly.

Liu Yizhi burned with anger inwardly; after all, his gap in cultivation with Yang Kai was vast, and never before had a Void King Realm cultivator dared speak to him so brazenly. Still, he could not show it—Yang Kai's backing was no small matter, and certainly not just a single Third Stage Void King Realm cultivator protecting that young lady.

There might well be even stronger experts hidden away!

The black-robed man, speaking to him, made a few strange hand signs in one direction, clearly sending information to his companions.

Realizing this, cold sweat began to bead on Liu Yizhi's brow.

Under his Divine Sense he perceived no hidden experts nearby; this could only mean one thing—hidden foes whose strength exceeded his own.

"May I ask where you friends come from?" Liu Yizhi, though cowed by Yang Kai, could not help but test him cautiously.

"Hmph!" Yang Kai snorted, sizing them up and countering with a question, "You lot are from Fei Sheng Palace?"

"Yes." Liu Yizhi nodded, uncertain why Yang Kai asked.

“You want to know where we come from? Sure—you come over here and I’ll tell you. But it’ll cost you something.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, then lowered his voice. “Within three days, Fei Sheng Palace will be wiped from the Southern Territory. I just wonder whether that price is one you can afford to bear.”

Liu Yizhi shuddered and went ashen.

"Still want to know?" Yang Kai sneered down at him.

"I—was out of turn, please forgive me!" Liu Yizhi was thoroughly cowed and dared not utter another word.

"A pack of clowns, frogs in a well—this Lord is too lazy to argue. For the sake of the lady being uninjured, I will let you go this time; if there is a next time..." Yang Kai's face tightened, eyes narrowing as he fixed Liu Yizhi with a look and enunciated each word: "You understand."

Liu Yizhi was drenched in sweat and no longer cared for Sect or face; he clasped his fists hurriedly, "My thanks, friend."

With that he grabbed the stunned, pale Ning Yuancheng and hissed, "Leave!"

The remaining disciples of Fei Sheng Palace dared not linger; they quickly gathered the bodies and fled with Liu Yizhi.

"Miss, let us go as well." Only then did Yang Kai breathe easier and call to Mo Xiaoqi.

But the girl stared at Yang Kai with shining eyes and an expression of adoration; stars seemed to flicker in those two eyes.

"Hurry up and go!" Yang Kai, seeing her like that, couldn't help but urge softly.

That Liu Yizhi was, after all, a Dao Origin Second Stage; while Yang Kai's bluff might frighten him for now, it would not last forever. If he figured things out and came to verify them later, that would be trouble.

To be so brazen before a Dao Origin Second Stage expert would bring no good to him.

"Ah, don't leave—what about the promised fifty thousand Source Crystals?" the earlier seller, still eager for money and seeming to value riches over life, shouted.

"You dare talk about fifty thousand Source Crystals? Do you want your life?" Yang Kai glared, and the old man gave an awkward smile and backed away to keep a safe distance.

"Move!" Yang Kai seized Mo Xiaoqi's wrist, preparing to take her away.

The next moment he let go as if electrocuted; his palm was dripping blood.

"Ah—sorry, Big Brother Yang..." Mo Xiaoqi finally came to her senses and flusteredly began to apologize.
