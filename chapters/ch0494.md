## Chapter 494 — I Do Have a Request

In the Elder Hall, Yang Zhen lectured Yang Kai with reason and logic.

“Elder, the Blood Servants rallying to me clearly prove my skill and charisma, don’t they?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

“Uh...” Yang Zhen hesitated briefly before rushing to say, “That only means your insight is longer-sighted than others’, that you had plans from the start!”

He was naturally referring to Yang Kai’s bold decision to employ Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, thereby gaining the respect of all masters within the Blood Servants Hall.

At first, he was shocked by Yang Kai’s audacity, but now it seemed clear that this young man possessed the means to cure Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, which was why he resorted to this speculative maneuver.

Only he could do such a thing; other Yang Family disciples simply lacked the ability.

“Isn’t that exactly my skill?” Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

“Perhaps.” Yang Zhen pondered for a moment, conceding, “Furthermore, the Blood Servants' involvement in the succession war was originally intended by the family to protect your safety and safeguard the command flag in the early stages. This principle has never changed from ancient times until now. If you truly lead a large number of Blood Servants to attack the remaining contenders, it naturally violates the family’s original purpose in deploying the Blood Servants for the succession war.”

“That is the family’s miscalculation, not mine.” Yang Kai sneered, showing no sign of backing down.

He had laboriously gathered a force superior to his elder brothers’, poised to crush the remaining enemies with overwhelming strength and seize the final victory. Yet, at this critical moment, he was summoned back by the Elder Hall and faced such harsh demands. How could Yang Kai accept this?

“It indeed is the family’s misjudgment. No one expected a single Yang Family disciple to gather so many Blood Servants,” Yang Zhen sighed. “Throughout countless generations and many succession wars, the Blood Servants Hall has occasionally participated, but never has anyone reached your level. On that, you have earned everyone’s respect, including mine.”

“Elder, spare me the flattery; your disciple can’t bear it.” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Yang Zhen’s face flushed with anger but he suppressed it. The other elders present felt secretly comforted, delighted to see Yang Zhen humbled, especially before a junior.

“I have already told you the reason. Most of the Blood Servants around you must be recalled to the family,” Yang Zhen reiterated.

“This is blatant suppression by the family!” Yang Kai retorted fiercely, arguing his point, “No matter how many Blood Servants gather around me, I acquired them through my own means. What right does the family have to recall them? How I use these Blood Servants is my freedom! If the family truly does this, it will earn nothing but ridicule from all under heaven. Elders, I ask you to maintain your dignity! The succession war has lasted many years; it is not child’s play, and the rules aren’t something you can change at will!”

“Impudent!” Yang Zhen finally lost his temper after holding back for so long. He slammed the nearby table into splinters with a furious shout. “Dare to yell at me, do you intend to rebel?”

“If the elders err, isn’t it right that I speak up? What kind of logic is that?” Yang Kai laughed coldly, staring arrogantly at Yang Zhen without a trace of fear.

Yang Zhen stammered a few times but could not form a reply.

Seeing the tension rise, one elder stood up and said, “Yang Kai, don’t be angry. This time, the family is indeed at fault, as none of us anticipated you gathering all the Blood Servants. However, Elder Yang Zhen’s point has merit as well. Consider this: if victory in the succession war is achieved through the Blood Servants, would it be honorable? But I believe, after this event, the family will seriously reconsider the role of the Blood Servants in future succession wars.”

“I value only the result; the process is irrelevant,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “Whether it is honorable or not is your Elder Hall’s concern. The next succession war will have nothing to do with me. I grouped the Blood Servants not through dishonest means or coercion, but by their own will. In any case, the family’s wish to recall the majority of my Blood Servants is impossible to fulfill!”

Pausing, he continued, “If the family does this, then I will simply not participate in the succession war!”

“Do you dare threaten us?” Yang Zhen narrowed his eyes, his aura becoming dangerously volatile.

“If the elder insists, so be it. Changing the rules at whim like children playing house—I have no interest in joining such a game,” Yang Kai sneered, saluting formally. “I take my leave!”

“Rebel!” Yang Zhen roared.

Yang Kai’s face remained unmoved, but after taking only a few steps, he suddenly stopped. Someone approached—a tall figure walking with hands behind his back, his expression calm yet emanating a weight as suffocating as a mountain’s pressure. Yang Kai’s face fell, his aura suddenly disrupted.

But in an instant, the overwhelming pressure dissipated.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai cupped his fists. “Greetings, Great Uncle!”

The newcomer was none other than Yang Yinghao, the current head of the Yang Family.

Yang Yinghao nodded lightly and came to stand beside him. “Don’t leave so soon. I want to speak with you.”

“Greetings, Family Head!” All the elders in the Elder Hall rose together, bowing deeply, despite their seniority. In the Yang Family, the Family Head represented supreme authority, and even Yang Zhen and the others had to show respect.

“Please sit.” Yang Yinghao spoke softly, taking the seat that belonged to Yang Zhen. He frowned as he looked at the scattered ruins of the shattered table. “Elder Zhen, you really need to work on your temper.”

Yang Zhen rolled his eyes and muttered, “After all these years, I’m afraid that’s impossible.”

An elder chuckled, “A wolf roams the world eating meat; a dog roams the world eating shit. That’s the truth of it.”

Everyone laughed heartily, and the atmosphere relaxed somewhat.

Yang Yinghao’s presence here showed he already suspected things had gone wrong and came especially to talk with Yang Kai. One must save the Family Head face. Despite his displeasure, Yang Kai could only stay for now.

“From your expressions, Yang Kai, you must be aware of the situation?” Yang Yinghao asked.

“Mm.” Yang Zhen lowered his head and nodded beside him.

Looking up at Yang Kai, Yang Yinghao said, “This time the family is at fault. I, as your Great Uncle, represent the family in apologizing.”

“I dare not accept such honors.” Yang Kai’s expression softened as his mood gradually calmed. Yet the family’s plan to recall most of his Blood Servants remained hard to accept. Facing the family and Elder Hall's authorities, he felt deeply powerless.

After all, he was a member of the Yang Family; his parents were still within the family. If this conflict escalated, the situation might spiral out of control. Moreover, he had one unresolved wish in participating in the succession war.

“I know this decision is hard on you, but it’s final and cannot be changed. In future succession wars, no matter which son gathers Blood Servants, there can never be more than two alongside him.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s lips curled into a bitter smile. “So even if I defeat my eldest brother and second brother in the future, I still won’t be able to recruit their Blood Servants?”

“That’s right.” Yang Yinghao nodded. “The Blood Servants are far too powerful, especially those who wield the Blood Fury Technique. You should already understand that well.”

“So this regulation is essentially targeted at me?” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “I don’t know whether to feel proud or what. At any rate, this leaves me with very complicated feelings.”

“Not exactly targeted at you. Our elders worried someone might gather all the Blood Servants like you have, but most thought it impossible, so they paid it no mind. Now that you’ve done it, they have no choice but to make this compromise.”

He paused, then continued, “Moreover, the troops from Yao Wang Valley and Baoqi Sect you’ve gathered in your estate have already given you significant advantages! Those forces weren’t supposed to participate in the succession war. You should know the Yang Family disciples protested when those people moved into your estate, but the family took no action because those ties are your personal network and beyond family interference. Blood Servants are different—they belong to the family, not your personal network.”

Yang Kai remained expressionless. Yet what Yang Yinghao said struck at the core of the issue.

“The family is fair. Since we demand the recall of most Blood Servants around you, there will be compensation. If you have any requests, just ask. As long as we can fulfill them, the family will not refuse—you will not be losing out.”

At this point, Yang Kai knew he could no longer resist. He lacked the status and strength to stand against the family. To keep spouting reckless words would only invite trouble.

“I do have a request,” he said after a moment of thought.

“Speak,” Yang Yinghao invited.

“Restore the reputation of my sect, Lingxiao Pavilion!” Yang Kai lifted his gaze to meet Yang Yinghao’s eyes. “Lingxiao Pavilion is not an evil sect—it only had an evil lord.”

At these words, everyone’s expressions changed, and a deep unease flickered in their eyes. Even Yang Yinghao, who had surpassed the Divine Roaming Realm, was no exception.

Evil Lord!

During the war against Cangyun Evil Land, Yang Yinghao had encountered that person. Though also beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, that person had exuded a crushing pressure.

Facing him, Yang Yinghao had even felt his own rationality threatened.

He knew the Evil Lord was among the absolute pinnacle beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

“This request?” Yang Yinghao’s face showed some difficulty. The Evil Lord affair was a grave matter. As head of the family, and sworn enemy of Cangyun Evil Land, suddenly promoting a sect founded by an Evil Lord was indeed problematic.

“This is my only request!” Yang Kai said seriously.

His participation in the succession war was not, like the others, to claim the family patriarch’s seat. His main purpose was to restore the honor of Lingxiao Pavilion — a wish shared with Fourth Master Yang.

Once the sect was vindicated, Ling Taixu, those elders, and the scattered disciples could all have a home—a place to return to where they were born and raised.

“If the family head agrees to this, it would be fine for the family to recall my Blood Servants. I would even willingly withdraw from the succession war now,” Yang Kai said gravely.

Everyone present was deeply moved, staring at him in stunned silence.
