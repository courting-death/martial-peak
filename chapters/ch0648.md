## Chapter 648 — Li Rong's Protection

In the main hall of Mo Shen Fort, Li Rong, whose bearing was noble and dignified, sat at the head seat, and many of Mo Shen Fort's senior figures had gathered below.

These people, aside from the four great commanders, were the most powerful and highest-ranking among them.

One of them, an elder with pale features and cultivation at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm looked furious, his face full of rage as he barked, "Lady Li, that human brat actually dared to commit violence inside Mo Shen Fort and wounded seven of our clan—he must pay the price!"

“Indeed!” another elder at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm stepped forward angrily. “A mere human dares to be so arrogant. Lady Li has shown him great mercy and favored him with treatment that would make others envious, yet he is never satisfied and grows conceited from favoritism. It’s time to teach him a lesson so he behaves and understands who is in charge here.”

The rest all nodded in agreement.

The Ancient Demon Clan was an exceedingly dominant race and fiercely protective. Seven of their juniors had been grievously wounded by Yang Kai; the worst of them would need half a year to recuperate, having nearly died on the spot. Such an event was considered a great disgrace, so naturally they wanted to recover their face from Yang Kai.

But Lady Li had been showing great favor to that human brat recently, which everyone had seen. Before disciplining him, they had to report to Lady Li—after all, she was the host of Mo Shen Fort.

"Is that what you all intend?" Li Rong's beautiful eyes swept lightly over the assembly as she asked softly.

"Yes!" The pale-faced elder at their head nodded heavily.

"Why?" Li Rong rose deliberately, and a hidden chill flashed across her watery eyes as she fixed that pale-faced elder with her gaze: "Is it simply because the injured Pan Lang is your son?"

The elder was taken aback for a moment, then nodded calmly, "That is part of it, but more importantly we are considering the interests of our clan!"

"Lady Li!" another person took up the argument, speaking sternly, "The repercussions of this matter are extremely bad. Many of our clan have already gathered near the stone chamber, all wanting to teach that human brat a lesson. We know he is a talented alchemist and could be a frontline hope for our clan, but those clan members do not care about that—if he is not properly punished to avenge Pan Lang and restore some face, they will not let the matter rest!"

Li Rong laughed softly, "The Ancient Demon Clan reveres martial might—when we ourselves suffer losses, since when do we need others to do the job for us? If Pan Lang truly has the ability, let him heal his injuries and go find him to take revenge himself."

"Though you say that, the clan's emotions are very stirred; they think that human brat is arrogant..." The pale-faced elder, Pan Bu, who was Pan Lang's father, said gravely, "The clan's emotions still need to be tended to."

Li Rong drew a deep breath, pondered a moment, and then asked, "So how do you wish to punish him?"

"Very simple." Pan Bu's expression turned cold. "For every bone of our people he broke, I will crush that many of his bones—blood for blood, tooth for tooth!"

"Will he even be left alive?" Li Rong's expression chilled.

Pan Bu smiled, "Lady Li, rest assured I will not let him die easily; after all, he still has some use to our clan. As long as it does not affect his future pill-refining, that's sufficient."

Li Rong slowly shook her head.

Pan Bu was startled, then shouted out, "Lady Li, our clan has been imprisoned here for countless years—you know what condition they are in. They have been pent up too long. Now that there is some friction, it has ignited their fighting spirit. If this matter is handled poorly, it could bring very bad consequences."

"For example?"

"For example, those dissatisfied might defect to Lord Chu Jian!" Pan Bu's eyes narrowed.

Li Rong smiled lightly, and her formerly gentle, merciful temperament abruptly shifted to extreme majesty.

Several Transcendent Realm powerhouses in the hall felt a chill in their hearts and instinctively averted their gazes; only now did they realize that the reason Lady Li could sit as the head of Mo Shen Fort was not without cause, and not merely due to her mercy and kindness.

Beneath that mercy and kindness, Lady Li also possessed a side of majesty and ferocity.

Li Rong displayed a trace of her authority, then quickly reined it in. After a long silence, as if having reached a decision, she said coquettishly but sharply, "I will handle this matter personally. Restrain your subordinates. From this day forward, if anyone dares to trouble that human again, I will personally deliver him into the embrace of the Great Demon God!"

Pan Bu and the others' faces changed; they stared at Li Rong in astonishment and stammered, "Lady—"

"Did you all hear me clearly?" Li Rong snapped coldly.

"We obey Lady Li's orders!" Pan Bu hastily bowed his head.

"You may leave." Li Rong waved her hand and added, "Duan Ya, you stay."

A reticent-looking demon warrior nodded and remained in place, while the rest took their leave.

After they departed, Li Rong gave a helpless, wry smile, "That outsider..."

"My Lady, any instructions?" Duan Ya inquired.

"Starting today, you are to guard around that stone chamber. If you find anyone who dares harm him, kill without mercy!" Li Rong instructed sternly.

Surprise flickered in Duan Ya's eyes; he did not expect Lady Li to value that human so greatly and hesitated, "What about Pan Bu and his people?"

"They would not lower themselves to target a mere young man. If they truly do, I will personally act."

Duan Ya nodded slightly and respectfully withdrew.

Outside the main hall, Pan Bu's expression was dark; like Duan Ya, he could not understand why Lady Li placed such importance on Yang Kai.

Even if Yang Kai was a talented alchemist, there was no reason for her to show such favoritism.

His son Pan Lang was among the best of Mo Shen Fort's younger generation and could very likely wield great power in the future, becoming a pillar of the next generation. Having been beaten so savagely, he deserved to be avenged, but Li Rong's decision left Pan Bu disappointed and furious.

"What is going on? Lady Li seems to care a lot about that human," one man asked suspiciously, voicing what everyone felt.

"Could Lady Li possibly have feelings for him—"

"Silence! Lady Li is so noble; how could she care for a lowly human—"

"This matter is not simple. Lady Li would not act thus without reason; there must be some hidden mystery."

"But whatever the reason, Lady Li's handling of this is unfair."

Pan Bu said nothing more, his face clouded as he sneered, "If Lady Li persists in acting on her own like this, sooner or later she will lose the support of the clan!"

The others exchanged glances; though they sensed his discontent, they said little.

Inside the stone chamber, an invisible aura spread outward centered on Yang Kai, and he slowly opened his eyes.

His True Yuan and his body of flesh and blood rejoiced, elated beyond measure.

He had reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!

Over the past months immersed in pill-refining, Yang Kai had not even noticed that his cultivation was on the verge of a breakthrough.

During that time he had absorbed countless realm‑imprints and insights left behind by powerful experts; before reaching the Saint Realm he should face no bottlenecks or shackles—so long as his strength kept up, his breakthroughs would be smooth.

If not for that battle, Yang Kai estimated that at the latest he would have broken through to the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm in a month's time.

But that perilous, bloody battle had forced his breakthrough to come a month earlier.

Indeed, battle had its benefits.

His Divine Sense detected that outside the stone chamber a large crowd of Ancient Demon Clan members had gathered, each aura extremely dangerous, eyeing him like predators.

Inside the chamber, not far away, Guan'er watched him with a complicated expression, as if reassessing him; an unfamiliar light danced in her lovely eyes.

"You rascal..." Seeing Yang Kai finish his breakthrough, Guan'er hurried over with a smile and circled him a few times, clicking her tongue in wonder, "How did you beat Pan Lang and the others into such a state?"

Yang Kai chuckled but did not answer.

"You really did it alone?" Guan'er was astonished.

"Who else could it be?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"You're that powerful?"

"What, do you think I'm weak?"

"Not that I think you're weak, just that I didn't expect you to be this strong. A human's body—how can it be more resilient than ours?" Saying so, she reached out a small hand toward Yang Kai as if to touch him, then grew embarrassed and quickly withdrew it.

"You seem a bit gleeful about it?" Yang Kai looked at her with heavy meaning. "Do you have a grudge against Pan Lang?"

"No particular grudge, just that he was annoying and always bothered me. Now that you hurt him, I can have some peace for a while—so from that perspective, I must thank you. But... foreigner, your troubles have just begun!"

Yang Kai frowned and looked toward the outside of the stone chamber thoughtfully: "You mean them?"

"Exactly." Guan'er nodded gently. "They're all gathered outside, wanting to drag you out and give you a proper punishment. No matter how strong you are, you won't be unmatched in front of so many of my clan."

"That will have to be seen."

"Tsk, you're arrogant enough—I'll give you credit for that. You humans sure have a big mouth." Guan'er sneered before becoming serious, "But you still have to prepare yourself. Lady Li and the other Lords in the fort are discussing how to handle this. If Lady Li does not stand with you, then you're doomed."

Winking slyly at Yang Kai, Guan'er said, "Since you taught Pan Lang a lesson for me, even if you are injured I will take good care of you."

"Then you'll be disappointed!" Yang Kai grinned broadly. "Because Lady Li seems to be on my side. Isn't that so, Lady Li?"

Saying that, he turned his head to look aside.

At that moment the air twisted and Li Rong materialized. Hearing his words, a look of surprise flitted across her pretty face before she shook her head helplessly and walked up.

"You really are a carefree one." Li Rong sighed.

Yang Kai shrugged.

"Don't blame my clan for being so roused—they've been imprisoned too long, and you're the only outsider here. You dared lay hands on our comrades, so of course they won't let the matter drop," Li Rong explained softly.
