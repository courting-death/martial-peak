## Chapter 1318 — Steward Lian

Just now, while he was talking with Qian Yue, he learned that the Origin Returning Realm expert who rescued her back to Hehuan House and taught her the Dual Cultivation Technique was this very Steward Lian before him—an immensely powerful cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, ranked first among the three Origin Returning Realm stewards of Hehuan House.

Beneath her rank were two stewards at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

If the other two First Stage Origin Returning Realm stewards had moved to stop them, Yang Kai still had confidence that he could take Qian Yue through their obstruction; but with this Steward Lian intervening, he lacked that certainty. After all, their cultivation levels differed by a Stage. If a struggle dragged on, the other two Origin Returning Realm stewards would surely be alerted and arrive. Then, facing three Origin Returning Realm experts alone while having to care for Qian Yue, the consequences would be obvious.

Since the last accident in the Corpse Den, Yang Kai no longer dared recklessly use space ripping for flight when carrying someone.

A tangle of thoughts ran through his mind. The Steward Lian cast a cold glance at Qian Yue and snorted: “Yue'er, you’ve got nerve—daring to collude with outsiders to try and escape. It seems the punishments you suffered before didn’t teach you any sense!”

As she spoke, her Divine Sense shifted slightly. The moment Yang Kai had been shielding Qian Yue behind him, she suddenly screamed, her delicate body going limp as she collapsed to the ground, sweat-slick and with a face drained of blood.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered with anger, yet he did not act rashly. He could tell the Steward Lian had merely activated the restriction planted on Qian Yue and had no intention of killing her.

It was a long while before Qian Yue’s anguished screams finally weakened, and only then did Steward Lian shift her gaze from Qian Yue to Yang Kai. A faint, scornful smile tugged at her lips as she said coldly, “And here I was wondering who had the gall to spirit someone away from my Hehuan House—turns out it’s just a brat at the Saint King Realm. Tell me, who gave you such courage? Do you have any idea what consequences your actions will bring?”

Yang Kai’s face remained indifferent as he helped Qian Yue to her feet and probed her with his Divine Sense, confirming she hadn’t suffered serious harm. His expression softened a fraction, then he regarded the middle-aged beauty and said coolly, “You’re the Steward Lian, right? I didn’t abduct her—I made a deal with your house and redeemed her. So what? The deal is done; am I not allowed to leave with the woman I paid for? Does your house, besides plying flesh, also dabble in murder and robbery?”

“What gall!” The middle-aged beauty’s face chilled. She snapped sharply and raised a graceful hand; a sash-like beam of light shot at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a light whistle and stood his ground, not dodging. A pitch-black flame suddenly rose around his fist. With Saint Yuan surging fierce and wild, he hurled a punch forward.

Visible afterimages of his fist streaked out, carrying searing power, colliding with the Steward Lian’s attack.

A thunderous roar erupted, light scattering in all directions as innumerable fist phantoms shattered—but the Steward Lian’s attack dissipated mid-flight and was completely stopped.

Yang Kai still stood unmoved. The Steward Lian’s beautiful eyes flashed with astonishment as she looked at him. Though she hadn’t used full force, she had invested thirty percent of her strength into that strike, and with him within the envelope of her Shi, she had expected to punish his insolence. Yet he had easily repelled it, which greatly surprised her.

Even if he were a Second Stage Saint King—or even a peak Saint King—she hadn’t expected this. She had thought she could at least give him a small lesson.

Having failed with that blow, she relied on her position and refrained from further attacks, instead watching Yang Kai with unsettled suspicion, her beautiful eyes filled with contemplation.

She had also noticed that Yang Kai was no ordinary fighter; he seemed an elite among elites, possessing strength unusual for a Second Stage Saint King, and his origins could not be humble. Until she ascertained Yang Kai’s background, she considered it unwise to act rashly and risk inviting a powerful enemy upon Hehuan House.

The commotion had naturally already alerted all of Hehuan House.

Shortly after, the other two First Stage Origin Returning Realm experts hurried over. Seeing the scene, they were astonished and gathered around the Steward Lian to question her.

Meanwhile, a figure dashed up and leapt to Yang Kai’s side, exclaiming in shock, “Brother Yang, what’s happened?”

It was Shen Fanlei! From his tidy clothing and intact Yuan Yang, it was clear he had not yet completed his business and had come immediately upon hearing the disturbance.

Yang Kai gave him a wry smile and said in a low voice, “Not convenient to explain now—I'll tell you later.”

“Oh.” Shen Fanlei didn’t press, but glanced covertly at the others. Seeing the situation, his heart sank; he never imagined his first time in such a place would cause such trouble.

The three Origin Returning Realm stewards of Hehuan House gathered and whispered about Yang Kai, while guards surrounded the area, eyes prowling like tigers.

Shen Fanlei felt as if he might as well die; waves of regret crashed over him—coming here today had been a grave mistake, needlessly inviting this mess.

After a moment, the three Origin Returning Realm experts seemed to have reached a decision. The Steward Lian pressed her face into a stern look and demanded of Yang Kai, “You said you redeemed Yue'er—who did you make the deal with?”

“Reporting to Steward Lian, it was this servant!” came a voice—the young married woman who had conversed with Yang Kai earlier.

The restraint Yang Kai had placed on her was not strong; his intention was merely to stall, so after some time she had broken free and hurried back, catching the Steward Lian’s question and answering without delay.

“Xiao Qing… did he harm you?” The Steward Lian’s apricot eyes cooled as she noticed the woman’s discomfort and asked.

“This servant is unharmed; the young master had no ill intent.” The woman unexpectedly spoke a good word for Yang Kai—apparently moved by the generous price he had offered to redeem Qian Yue.

“Even so, daring to act inside Hehuan House—this shows utter disregard for us.” Before the Steward Lian could speak, another elder in cyan robes snorted, his gaze hostile toward Yang Kai.

“Steward Wang was right — we’ll set this matter aside for now. But what about the deal this young man mentioned just now?” Steward Lian turned to the young woman and asked.

The woman hesitated, then quietly recounted the terms Yang Kai had proposed and the obstacles they’d encountered. The three stewards listened, each wearing a different expression.

Hearing that Yang Kai had offered such a large sum to redeem Qian Yue, the Steward Lian was naturally surprised. Though still irritated by his earlier behavior, the chill on her face had undoubtedly softened several shades.

That Steward Wang from before seemed to recall something, his gaze flicking—intentionally or not—toward a nearby pavilion a few times, his eyes filled with a look of bitter disappointment.

The final Origin Returning Realm steward remained noncommittal, his expression unmoved.

When the woman finished, the Steward Lian slightly inclined her head: “Hm. By our house rules, since this youth is willing to pay such a price, it's permissible to agree. You have the authority to decide. Senior Wang, Senior Xu, why did you insist on keeping Yue'er—what is your reason?”

“Not my affair. I’ve been in seclusion cultivating.” The indifferent Xu steward slowly shook his head.

The Steward Lian then fixed her gaze on the Wang elder.

The elder surnamed Wang looked helpless and was just about to speak when Yang Kai grinned and said from the side, “I’m afraid even Steward Wang isn’t aware of this matter, is he?”

“What do you mean?” The middle-aged beauty’s face went cold.

“Come out!” Yang Kai suddenly barked. A golden thread shot from his hand toward a nearby pavilion. The thread flashed and vanished like it had pierced spatial seals; a terrified scream rose from the pavilion, followed by a burst of Saint Yuan, which quickly subsided.

Yang Kai flicked his wrist and the golden thread returned, and at its other end was bound a man who was thrashing and trying to break free.

“You dare, brat!” Steward Wang cried out upon seeing this and lifted a hand to attack Yang Kai.

“You move and I’ll grind him to pieces this instant!” Yang Kai sneered. The golden thread on his hand gave off a dangerously potent aura.

Steward Wang paled and didn’t dare act rashly, though the look in his eyes burned with such fury he seemed ready to swallow him whole.

The golden thread retracted, drawing the bound man back with it.

The Steward Lian finally showed a trace of emotion. With her Second Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivation, she’d seen everything clearly: the man hiding in the nearby pavilion was at least a Third Stage Saint King, yet he’d been captured by this Second Stage Saint King youth in less than a breath.

Who was this youth? He possessed such terrifying combat strength. Moreover, that golden thread on his hand was extremely strange—somewhat like a secret treasure but not one, its aura drawing notice.

The Steward Lian’s expression fluctuated as she inwardly felt this young man was dangerous to provoke; he might have a powerful backer unlike the Quehe Sect.

“Senior Brother Wang!” Shen Fanlei cried as Yang Kai dragged the captive before them, staring at the man in astonishment. “Senior Brother Wang, why are you here? Weren’t you out on business?”

Wang Yuhan’s face was extremely ugly; he had no mood to answer Shen Fanlei and instead looked toward Steward Wang with pleading eyes, his lips moving as if to speak but unable to, a look of grievance on his face.

“Also surnamed Wang…” A glint flashed in the middle-aged beauty’s eyes as if she’d realized something. She looked at Steward Wang with a half-smile and asked, “Steward Wang, what is this young man’s relation to you?”
