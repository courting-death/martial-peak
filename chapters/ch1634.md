## Chapter 1634 — It's You

Inside the inn’s private room, a beautiful woman dressed in palace attire looked coldly at Yang Kai and gave a slight nod. “Yes, it’s him! Qing Ya, you have done well in finding this person. I will report your merit to the Valley Master and the Elder Council—your reward is certain!”

After Qing Ya sent the message, in only two hours the Thirteenth Elder of Ice Heart Valley hurried to the city and met Yang Kai in the inn.

She had spent a full year searching for Yang Kai with the valley's disciples and so naturally knew his appearance; finding him so easily filled her with pleasure.

"Thank you, Elder." Qing Ya showed little joy and instead asked with some worry, "Elder, may I ask why we are looking for him?"

The Thirteenth Elder turned and cast Qing Ya a glance; her beautiful eyes were icy as she said coldly, "You care for him?"

Qing Ya's expression did not change. She replied, "He once saved my life at the hands of people from Fire Radiance Sect; he is my lifesaver, so..."

The Thirteenth Elder nodded lightly, her doubts dissipating. She said slowly, "We have our reasons for seeking him; you needn't ask. Since he is your lifesaver, I can tell you that Ice Heart Valley will not treat him unfairly—you may rest assured."

Upon hearing this Qing Ya breathed a sigh of relief and hurried to offer her thanks.

Only then did the Thirteenth Elder turn to Yang Kai, scrutinize him for a while, and nod, "Good strength—what is your name?"

"Yang Kai."

"You are not from Chi Lan Star, are you?" the Thirteenth Elder asked, showing some wariness toward him.

"No, I come from Cuiwei Star."

"Cuiwei Star!" The Thirteenth Elder's beautiful eyes narrowed as she formed a vague guess. Still she would not be too certain and instead asked, "You know both Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley are searching for you—why did you volunteer to go to Ice Heart Valley?"

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "I have some enmity with people from Fire Radiance Sect; I've killed several of their men. Now that I seek shelter, of course I must choose Ice Heart Valley."

After speaking, Yang Kai added with implication, "Elder, are you suspecting I have impure motives?"

"One must never be without a mind to guard against others!" the Thirteenth Elder said without denying it. "But your choice is correct; at present only Ice Heart Valley can shelter you. Very well—wait here for one day. Let me make a few arrangements; in a day I will personally escort you back to Ice Heart Valley!"

"Many thanks!" Yang Kai suppressed his emotions and cupped his hands in thanks.

Finally. At long last he would see Su Yan! A surge of excitement swelled within Yang Kai, almost beyond control.

He eagerly anticipated the moment to see Su Yan again. He longed to see with his own eyes how the beauty was now.

Yang Kai waited anxiously within the inn.

As for what arrangements the Thirteenth Elder was making, no one knew.

That night, martial artists from sects and families affiliated with Ice Heart Valley took the initiative to attack the disciples of Fire Radiance Sect. They fought as if packed with fighting spirit; battles of every size erupted incessantly, and for a time nearly everyone's attention was drawn away.

Before dawn, the Thirteenth Elder returned to the inn, called to Yang Kai, and under cover of night took him and Qing Ya away from the city.

About thirty li outside the city, a group of roughly a dozen women waited quietly.

Upon seeing the Thirteenth Elder arrive, they all cupped their hands in salute.

"Move out!" The Thirteenth Elder wasted no words; with a graceful wave she led the way forward.

The dozen women spread out, placing Yang Kai in the center, and followed closely behind the Thirteenth Elder toward Icebound Island.

A succession of different floral fragrances wafted by, and Yang Kai truly felt what it was to be surrounded by beauties.

These female disciples of Ice Heart Valley, whatever their cultivation, were each striking in appearance—slender figures, distinct temperaments, each with her own charm.

During the journey the women would now and then cast peculiar glances at Yang Kai.

They had spent a year out in the field fighting and searching for Yang Kai; seeing him alive, they naturally paid him extra attention.

They were all curious what made this man so special that the two top sects on Chi Lan Star would exhaust themselves to find him.

Because of this man many comrades had been slaughtered and many had gone missing...

Yang Kai felt a distinct sense of hostility.

Of the dozen women assigned to protect him, at least half harbored hatred toward him.

Yang Kai found it inexplicable.

Were it not for the Thirteenth Elder's presence, Yang Kai suspected those women might have teamed up to beat him first.

"Senior Sister Qing Ya, they don't seem too fond of me," Yang Kai quietly transmitted to Qing Ya.

Qing Ya gave a wry smile; as a disciple of Ice Heart Valley participating in the operation she naturally knew the reason, but could not say outright, only replying, "It's normal—people from Ice Heart Valley generally despise men."

"Oh." Yang Kai nodded, accepting it.

The group pushed forward with great speed.

Three days later, the dozen or so passed through a mountain valley.

Suddenly Yang Kai frowned and lowered his gaze to look down.

The Thirteenth Elder, leading at the front, seemed to sense it too and cried out, "Enemy attack!"

No sooner had she spoken than violent fluctuations of energy burst forth—overbearing and scorching. Rows of writhing fire dragons suddenly shot up from the valley below, baring fangs and bearing down on the Ice Heart Valley contingent.

There were seven or eight fire dragons, each containing terrifyingly destructive power.

The enemy's timing was perfect; even with the Thirteenth Elder's warning the women had little time to react.

Their bodies barely had the protective radiance of Saint Yuan appear when the seven or eight fire dragons had already charged into the midst of the group.

Screams rang out; two women of lower strength were swallowed by the fire dragons and perished instantly, while the others scrambled to dodge in disarray.

Yang Kai shielded Qing Ya and slipped to one side, narrowing his eyes to look down.

Figures had appeared in the valley below. They were fewer than Ice Heart Valley's number, but each cultivated to the Origin Returning Realm; the two at the front had auras that rivaled the Thirteenth Elder.

The Thirteenth Elder's phoenix-like eyes narrowed and her expression darkened.

She had not expected such a leak despite her precautions.

Her first thought was not of an internal traitor—these dozen escorting Yang Kai had been strictly chosen and each was utterly loyal to Ice Heart Valley; each also held a deep blood feud with Fire Radiance Sect, making it impossible they would collude gladly with the enemy.

Coincidence? The Thirteenth Elder's thoughts raced as she glanced toward Yang Kai and noted he was unharmed, at which she breathed a small sigh of relief.

"Yu Xueqing, you didn't expect me to be waiting here for you!" came a laugh from below. The speaker was a fair-skinned middle-aged man with narrow, slanted eyes that flashed oddly as he stared at the Thirteenth Elder's graceful form.

"Yan Chilei!" Yu Xueqing ground her teeth and hissed.

The enemy's sneak attack had cost Ice Heart Valley two disciples, and Yu Xueqing's killing intent surged like a tide.

“Yes, it’s me!” the middle-aged man stepped forward. "I knew your recent actions were suspicious—sly and secretive. What are you up to?"

"Elder Yan, why waste words with her? Why not be decisive and strike?" snorted a short old man beside Yan Chilei.

Yu Xueqing turned to look at the old man, her beautiful eyes suddenly narrowing. “Jiang Xi!”

"Heh heh, I didn't expect even the Thirteenth Elder of Ice Heart Valley to have heard of me—I'm honored!" the short old man said with a smug laugh.

Yu Xueqing's face grew even uglier. She covertly signaled the valley's women and asked in a low voice, "Jiang Xi, Ice Heart Valley has no grudge with you—why come stir these waters?"

"No grudge?" Jiang Xi snorted coldly. "Thirteenth Elder, are you blind? The humiliation from twenty years ago I, Jiang Xi, have not forgotten. If you want to ask about grievances, ask your Fifth Elder!"

"That really happened?" Yu Xueqing was astonished.

She had thought it mere rumor and did not expect it to be true.

No wonder Jiang Xi had colluded with Yan Chilei of Fire Radiance Sect—this spelled big trouble.

Facing Yan Chilei alone she would not be afraid, but Jiang Xi was even more troublesome; he had mastered a suite of poisonous arts that were hard to defend against. Her disciples would be no match, especially since the enemy was not limited to the two alone.

"So the rumor is true," Qing Ya murmured, her expression strange as she looked at the short, ugly old man.

She had clearly heard some of the gossip before.

"What's true?" Yang Kai asked, curious.

"They say twenty years ago this man once tried to force our Fifth Elder to marry him, but was rejected; furthermore the Fifth Elder beat him severely. We all thought it was just a rumor, but it really happened."

"Him?" Yang Kai's mouth twitched.

He studied Jiang carefully and could not find a single redeeming feature.

He was short and ugly: a bulbous nose, uneven eyes, thick lips like two sausages, sallow skin, thick neck, and short limbs...

Yang Kai did not know what the Fifth Elder of Ice Heart Valley looked like, but from the caliber of those protecting him the Fifth Elder must be formidable.

To see this Jiang covet the Fifth Elder, Yang Kai could not help thinking of an old saying.

“A toad lusting after swan meat!”

Though the situation remained grave, Qing Ya could not help but laugh softly.

Jiang Xi's hearing was naturally sharp; Yang Kai's words struck his sore spot. He turned his head and glared toward Yang Kai with frigid anger, snorting, "Kid, what did you just say?"

Jiang Xi’s body was crippled, and his mind had become twisted beyond measure because of it—nothing enraged him more than hearing others speak ill of him.

Yang Kai had undoubtedly struck a sore spot.

Yan Chilei also glanced toward Yang Kai's position and suddenly revealed a look of surprise, calling in a low voice, "So it's you!"

In that moment he could not help laughing to himself.
