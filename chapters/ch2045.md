## Chapter 2045 — Discussion

"Hall Master Zong and Hall Master Lian?" Yang Kai, upon hearing it, could not help but be taken aback.

"They are the Blazing Fire Hall's two former Deputy Hall Masters, one called Zong Qing, the other called Lian Yuming," Kang Siran quietly explained at the side.

Yang Kai gave a look of understanding, glanced down, and quickly fixed his gaze on the two Dao Origin Realm experts standing not far off; he thought they must be Zong Qing and Lian Yuming.

Both of the Blazing Fire Hall's Deputy Hall Masters were First Stage Dao Origin Realm practitioners, and both wore the Blazing Fire Hall insignia on their robes—there could be no mistake.

Yang Kai suddenly remembered that when he had trained inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda he had once met a fellow named Zong Zijin at the Dragon Ascension Altar; that man possessed Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation and was also from Blazing Fire Hall, so it was highly possible Zong Zijin was related to Zong Qing—perhaps even father and son.

After a moment the strange phenomenon dissipated, and the enticing fragrance in the air vanished as well.

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple who had led Yang Kai and Kang Siran over then waved a hand, bringing them forward; he clasped his fists before the two Dao Origin Realm experts and reported, "Reporting to the two Hall Masters: two more people were attracted here by the anomaly of Primordial Cauldron Mountain."

Upon hearing his report, the taller of the two Dao Origin Realm experts nodded; after his Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai and Kang Siran he said coolly, "Since they have come, bring them aside and make arrangements."

"Yes." The disciple answered and led Yang Kai and Kang Siran to one side. "Wait here; if anything happens, you will be notified."

"Wait a moment." Yang Kai hurriedly called after him.

"What else?" The Blazing Fire Hall disciple sounded somewhat impatient.

Yang Kai grinned, stepped forward, and subtly slipped a few Source Crystals into his hand, whispering, "It's like this, friend—I'd like to ask what exactly is going on here. If it's convenient, could you explain it to me?"

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple felt the steady flow of Source Crystals being sent from Yang Kai's sleeve and smiled in satisfaction. "What other situation could there be? To be honest, inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain a predecessor's grotto has somehow appeared; if not for the anomaly manifesting, probably no one would have known. You see, our two Hall Masters and many of the hall's elites have rushed over—it's all because of that predecessor's cave."

"A predecessor's grotto?" Yang Kai feigned extreme surprise, his eyes bulging. "Since you've discovered a predecessor's cave, why didn't Blazing Fire Hall explore it on its own? Why don't you stop other martial artists from coming and going, and instead welcome us here?"

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple looked around, lowered his voice and said, "If we could explore it alone, do you think anyone else would have anything to do with it? But our two Hall Masters already tried—their power could not break this cave's last seal. This cave seems to have been left by an Emperor Realm expert; even after countless years the sealing force remains incredibly strong. Even if all our elites attacked together, we could do nothing, so we had to rely on outside help."

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately showed a look of understanding. "I see!"

Beside him, Kang Siran frowned slightly, visibly surprised; after all, he had once gone to secretly probe this cave and felt that while the seal was formidable, it should not have been able to stop Dao Origin Realm experts—still, it was not good to ask recklessly now.

"So you intend to borrow the strength of outsiders like us to break the seal?" Yang Kai asked thoughtfully.

"Naturally—many hands make light work."

Yang Kai chuckled. "I have no objection to lending my strength, but if the seal is truly broken, how will the things inside be divided?"

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple shook his head and said, “That I cannot say — it is a matter for the two Hall Masters to handle. I’ve said all I know; friend, please remain calm.”

With that he walked off without another word, giving Yang Kai no further chance to question him.

After the man left, Yang Kai glanced at Kang Siran; the two exchanged understanding looks and moved aside, both wearing displeased expressions.

"I never expected things to turn out like this," Kang Siran said, his brow furrowed. "Had we known earlier, we should have investigated sooner. Now that this anomaly has appeared, anyone nearby will likely rush over."

Whether we came sooner or later probably makes no difference. If even those two Dao Origin Realm experts couldn't break the seal themselves, then with only the two of us we're likely powerless as well. Still, though this situation has its drawbacks, it may not be without its advantages.

"What do you mean by that, Brother Yang?" Kang Siran asked in astonishment.

Yang Kai grinned and said, "Shopkeeper Kang has resources others lack—that's the advantage."

Kang Siran thought for a moment, then nodded. "Indeed, what I have is of considerable value."

The two were, of course, referring to the map of the grotto’s interior. Years ago the descendants of Gongsun Mu’s servant had given Kang Siran an item that included not only the precise location of the predecessor’s grotto but also a detailed chart of its inner routes.

With that in hand, even if many people entered, Yang Kai and Kang Siran would not lose their advantage.

Moreover, according to the information Yang Kai had previously gathered, the Blazing Fire Hall only knew there was a cave within Primordial Cauldron Mountain; as for whose cave it was or what lay inside, they knew nothing.

Thinking this over, Kang Siran felt reassured. He and Yang Kai exchanged a look, then he calmly closed his eyes and sat in meditation to wait.

As time passed, more and more martial artists were drawn by the anomaly and hurried to Primordial Cauldron Mountain, though their strengths were uneven—many were Origin Returning Realm, and only a dozen or so were at the Void King Realm.

Including those who had already gathered earlier, the number had exceeded seventy.

Two days later, the two Dao Origin Realm experts exchanged glances; Zong Qing lightly nodded and said, "The crowd is about sufficient; let's begin."

Lian Yuming also nodded and said, "The longer one waits, the more complications arise—it's time to act."

With those words, the two rose to their feet.

At their movement, the gathered martial artists all opened their eyes and turned to stare at them.

Zong Qing swept his gaze over the crowd and said, "You friends were all attracted here by the anomaly; thank you for waiting so long. I am Deputy Hall Master Zong Qing of Blazing Fire Hall—many of you should know me."

"Deputy Hall Master Zong Qing's reputation precedes him, of course we know you, but may I ask why you gathered us here and what exactly is inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain?" a restless voice shouted from below.

Zong Qing smiled and said, "Good question. I will explain: to be honest, I don't know all the details of what lies inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain—only that there is a predecessor's grotto, likely left by an Emperor Realm expert."

"An Emperor Realm expert's grotto?"

"Here, inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain?"

"This place used to be barren; I passed by many times and never thought to explore—what a loss."

In an instant the crowd erupted into chatter: some full of regret, some ecstatic, others with shifting expressions.

Zong Qing smiled and said, "Our Blazing Fire Hall previously explored this cave; although we broke the first two layers of seals, we could not break the final seal and thus could not enter. Therefore we must rely on the strength of you friends. Later you and Blazing Fire Hall will exert power together; once the last seal is broken the predecessor's cave will open and you may see what is inside!"

Kang Siran showed a pensive expression; he had previously doubted why the Blazing Fire Hall's two Dao Origin Realm experts could not break the seal—now it made sense: they had been stopped at the final layer, and his prior probing had simply been unable to detect the deeper sealing.

That realization put his mind at ease somewhat; his earlier investigation had not been mistaken, it was merely limited by his own power.

Had the anomaly not appeared, then even the two of them might at best have broken the first two layers, but would have been halted by the third-layer seal.

With that thought, Kang Siran felt more composed.

"An Emperor Realm expert's grotto must contain things everyone understands to be valuable, and from this anomaly I can guarantee there are indeed treasures inside—what's more, they may very well be Spiritual Herbs or wondrous medicines on the verge of maturing!"

The anomaly was obvious: five-colored radiance spouted forth, ripples spread, and a tempting fragrance wafted out; such a phenomenon could not be produced by mere Secret Treasures—only peerless Spiritual Herbs or miraculous medicines could do so.

"Hall Master Zong, I want to ask: if the seal is broken, how will the things inside be divided? You have experts stationed—if you move to seize them, we won't have a chance to resist," a sharp voice suddenly said from the crowd, its source drifting and hard to locate.

At those words the crowd fell silent and all eyes turned to Zong Qing; clearly everyone cared deeply about this issue.

Zong Qing listened without any hint of anger and smiled, "I understand your worries. But I promise: if you truly join your strength to break the seal, then whatever is obtained inside belongs to whoever gets it. Brother Lian and I will not lay hands on any of you."

Lian Yuming, who had been standing quietly at the side, also nodded.

"Words alone are no proof. One sentence from you is not enough—how can we trust you? If you and Brother Lian truly make a move, how could we possibly resist?" the sharp voice demanded again.

Zong Qing smiled slightly, his gaze sweeping the crowd until it fixed on a thin man. He looked at him and said, "If this friend truly does not trust Brother Lian and me, then you may leave—none of us will force you."
