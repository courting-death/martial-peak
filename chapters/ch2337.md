## Chapter 2337 — She Has a Body Now

At this thought, large beads of sweat rolled down Ruan Hongbo’s forehead; he realized the days ahead for Heavenly Extreme Hall would likely be difficult. Originally, Heavenly Extreme Hall and Tianzhao Palace were evenly matched in strength, but now that the other side had produced an Emperor, Heavenly Extreme Hall would have to show its loyalty if it wanted to survive.

Qiu Ze was now a true overlord! No wonder he was so arrogant and pleased with himself during this trip.

Inside the Protective Mountain Array, Ye Hen and the others all wore expressions of utter despair, their faces pale. The Sect had already been thrown into turmoil by that troublemaker Shi Cangying and split into two factions. Now, with Qiu Ze having advanced to the Emperor Realm and standing just outside the Protective Mountain Array, how could they possibly go on?

Shi Cangying was equally horrified, no longer daring to show any disrespect toward Qiu Ze. He said in a panic, “So Palace Master Qiu has already ascended to the Emperor Realm. I, Shi, offer my congratulations to Palace Master Qiu!”

Ruan Hongbo, Mu Zheng, and the others also called out in unison, “Congratulations to Palace Master Qiu on attaining the Emperor Realm!”

Qiu Ze burst into loud laughter, his voice rolling like thunder, sending chills through everyone.

……

Inside the cave, Yang Kai stared intently at the strange stone, not daring to miss the slightest change.

Ever since he shattered those tens of millions of Middle-Level and Upper-Level Source Crystals, turning them into a sea of spiritual mist, an even stronger devouring force had emerged from within the strange stone, constantly absorbing the Spiritual Qi. As time passed, the crimson glow on the stone’s surface grew more intense, and Liu Yan’s aura became increasingly distinct.

After a few days, Yang Kai gradually realized that things weren’t as he had imagined.

Liu Yan was in no danger. Although she had been swallowed by the strange stone, Yang Kai could sense that she was currently in a deep, peaceful sleep. In fact, the aura she unconsciously released even carried a trace of excitement and joy.

It seemed that this ordeal was not a bad thing for her; in fact, it was an extremely good opportunity.

Could it be that Ye Chong hadn’t lied, and there really was a fortuitous encounter here? It was just that this opportunity was useful only to Liu Yan.

Remembering how Ye Chong had stared at Liu Yan the whole time when mentioning the opportunity, Yang Kai felt it was very likely.

As for what this opportunity actually was, Yang Kai still couldn’t figure it out. All he could do now was guard Liu Yan’s side and quietly observe.

After another day, the sea of spiritual mist in the cave had become extremely thin. Although the Spiritual Qi in this secret realm was still very dense, the strange stone didn’t seem to be saturated yet.

Yang Kai once again scattered tens of millions of Source Crystals, repeating the process and letting the strange stone devour them.

At this moment, the entire strange stone was crimson red, as if it had just been fished out of molten lava. The cave was unbearably hot, and the surrounding walls had all melted.

Liu Yan’s aura was also becoming clearer and clearer. What shocked and delighted Yang Kai was that her aura seemed much stronger than before, and there was now an additional, indescribable quality to it…

As he watched, Yang Kai’s heart suddenly stirred, and he exclaimed in a low voice, “Isn’t this just an egg?!”

Previously, he hadn’t paid much attention due to preconceived notions, but now that he looked closely, he realized that the oval-shaped strange stone really did resemble an egg.

At this thought, Yang Kai remembered that Xiaoxiao and his own Incarnation had both hatched from pitch-black stones in the past—that was the unique birth method of the Stone Puppet race. Could it be that Liu Yan would also break out of this strange stone?

This strange stone was different from the two exotic stones he had obtained back then, so it wasn’t a product of the Stone Puppet race. Yang Kai couldn’t say what exactly this stone was, but with this guess, he couldn’t help but look forward to it.

If his guess was correct, then Liu Yan would eventually break out of the shell. He just didn’t know what she would become.

This really was a fortuitous encounter for Liu Yan.

In a flash, another two days passed.

The speed at which the strange stone devoured the surrounding Spiritual Qi had clearly slowed down, and it was getting slower and slower. Yang Kai knew that the stone must be saturated now. What would happen to Liu Yan next would soon be revealed, so he stared at the stone without blinking, his heart full of anxiety.

Half a day later, just as Yang Kai was feeling uneasy, a crisp sound suddenly came from within the strange stone.

Startled, Yang Kai quickly looked over and saw a fine crack appear in the middle of the stone.

Crack…

As soon as the crack appeared, it seemed to trigger a chain reaction. A series of continuous sounds followed, and more and more cracks appeared, spreading all over the stone like a spider web.

Yang Kai’s expression became serious as he focused even more intently, ready to help Liu Yan at any moment.

Crash…

With a sudden sound, the entire strange stone shattered into countless tiny fragments, scattering all over the ground.

Yang Kai was shocked, thinking something had happened to Liu Yan. But when he saw a mass of crimson light where the stone had been, he relaxed again.

Within that light, Liu Yan’s aura was clearly present, proving she was unharmed.

The light was so intense that it dyed the entire cave crimson. Yang Kai squinted, but couldn’t make out any details. Even when he released his Divine Sense, it was all a blur, as if the light had inherited the stone’s ability to devour Divine Sense, preventing him from probing further.

Only after a full incense stick’s time did the crimson light suddenly retract, and the cave returned to darkness.

Only then did Yang Kai finally see the scene before him clearly.

In the next moment, his eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in shock, as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Because he saw that, in the spot where the strange stone had been, there was now the figure of a little girl!

The little girl looked about seven or eight years old, lying on her side, her small body curled up, hands folded under her face, sleeping peacefully.

Yang Kai could clearly hear her breathing.

If that was all, it would be nothing, but what Yang Kai found unbelievable was that he could sense Liu Yan’s aura from this little girl.

Was this Liu Yan?

Yang Kai nearly popped his eyes out of their sockets.

Ever since Liu Yan had gained the ability to take human form, she had always appeared before Yang Kai as a stunningly beautiful woman—dressed revealingly, with a voluptuous figure that stirred the imagination. But after this sudden change, she had actually turned into such a ghastly form.

Yang Kai simply couldn’t accept it.

But to say she wasn’t Liu Yan didn’t make sense either, because the little girl’s body clearly carried Liu Yan’s aura. Not only that, her fiery red hair had been perfectly inherited, the smooth red locks draping over her body and covering her body completely.

Only now did Yang Kai notice that the little girl wasn’t wearing a single stitch of clothing. It was only because of her red hair that he hadn’t realized it before.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, the little girl’s long eyelashes trembled, and she slowly opened her eyes. She seemed a bit confused by the situation, glancing at the dumbfounded Yang Kai before slowly sitting up.

As she sat up, her long hair fell away, revealing her fair body. But she was still dazed, her face blank.

Yang Kai quickly turned his head away and rummaged through his ring, pulling out a piece of clothing and tossing it to her.

In an instant, the oversized clothing covered her completely.

“Master, what are you doing?” the little girl muttered in dissatisfaction, pulling the clothing off her head.

But as soon as she spoke, she froze, her beautiful eyes trembling violently. She raised her hands in front of her face, staring blankly…

A moment later, a heart-wrenching scream echoed through the cave.

……

Half an hour later, Yang Kai and the little girl had gradually calmed down. The two sat facing each other, one with a strange expression, the other with tearful eyes and a pouting mouth.

There was no doubt that the little girl was indeed Liu Yan, though no one knew why she had turned into this form.

At this moment, Liu Yan was wearing Yang Kai’s clothes, but they were far too big for her current body. The loose fit, combined with her extremely aggrieved expression, was enough to melt anyone’s heart and make them want to cherish her.

Looking at her face, there were still traces of Liu Yan’s features—just younger. The little face was exquisitely delicate, like a porcelain doll, her skin rosy and fair, with a bit of baby fat that made people want to pinch her cheeks.

“Have you stared enough?” Liu Yan glared at Yang Kai, clearly annoyed.

Yang Kai shrugged nonchalantly and said, “Do you realize you don’t look intimidating at all like this?”

Liu Yan immediately ground her teeth in frustration.

After turning into this form, even her voice had become that of a child—crisp and pleasant, no longer the seductive tone from before.

“Alright, alright,” Yang Kai comforted, his expression turning serious. “Let me ask you, is there anything wrong with becoming like this?”

“Not really, it’s just a bit hard to get used to,” Liu Yan replied softly.

“Can’t you transform back into your original form?” Yang Kai asked.

Liu Yan said, “Maybe you haven’t noticed, but I already… have my own body now.”

“What?” Yang Kai was shocked and quickly released his Divine Sense to check, but as soon as it touched Liu Yan, it was devoured, leaving him unable to sense anything. It had been like this before, so Yang Kai hadn’t really understood her changes.

Now that she mentioned it, Yang Kai wanted to take a closer look, but since his Divine Sense couldn’t probe, he could only use his hands.

With that thought, he immediately reached out and pinched Liu Yan’s little face.

The moment he touched her, Yang Kai knew Liu Yan hadn’t lied.

She really did have her own body now, because the sensation under his fingers wasn’t pure energy, but real, tangible flesh! Not only that, Liu Yan’s little face was as elastic as a real person’s, and the feeling was wonderful. Yang Kai believed there were few in the world who could compare to her.

He couldn’t help but pinch her a little longer.

Liu Yan slapped his hand away in annoyance. “That hurts!” she complained, rubbing her cheek.

“How could it?” Yang Kai frowned. Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit who had taken human form, originally just pure energy. Gaining a physical body wasn’t impossible. As far as he knew, there was a Spiritual Pill called the Life Origin Pill that could help cultivators who had lost their bodies to regain one, but refining it required the Life Origin Fruit, which had long since disappeared from the world.
