## Chapter 1886 — This Is All There Is

Qian Yan had stared at Yang Kai with a sinister gaze and sneered, "They say humans are arrogant and conceited, looking down on everyone; I used to have my doubts, but now I know the rumors were not hollow..."

Xue Jiao snorted coldly, eyes flashing with ferocity as he glared at Yang Kai. "Humans have been arrogant for longer than a day or two. But brat, this is my Yao Star Di Chen; a human here would do well to tuck his tail and leave."

Yang Kai smiled without speaking and simply watched the two great Lords calmly, showing no sign of rebuttal.

Qian Yan's silver eyes shifted as he said, "Kid, I don't know what your relationship is with Lady Chi Yue, but if you keep standing in our way, don't blame us for being rude. Be sensible and withdraw at once; this is a yao matter and has nothing to do with you."

"Indeed, even if you and we are both at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, two against one—what are your chances of victory?" Xue Jiao barked.

"How likely I am to win isn't decided by words; we'll know after we fight." Yang Kai smiled faintly and gave no sign of retreat.

Qian Yan's face darkened. "You insist on meddling in this business?"

"How could this be meddling?" Yang Kai shook his head. "By seniority, I ought to address Lady Chi Yue as my mother-in-law. Her affairs are hardly something I can ignore."

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao exchanged odd looks, then Qian Yan's expression shifted as if remembering something: "So it's that half-yao's man!"

The "half-yao" he referred to was, of course, Shan Qingluo. Shan Qingluo, born human, had absorbed the primal power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider and possessed the special constitution of the Poison Widow, forming a complementary whole. Now Shan Qingluo's blood ran half human and half yao, a rising new star on Di Chen who drew attention; every yao on Di Chen Star knew of her existence.

From within Half Moon Mountain, Lady Chi Yue's voice came: "Brat, don't call me so affectionately; I still haven't fully accepted you."

Yang Kai turned his head toward her voice and chuckled, "Whether you accept me or not doesn't matter, Senior; Qingluo's approval is what counts."

Lady Chi Yue was left speechless.

"Enough!" Qian Yan roared, his silver gaze fixed on Yang Kai. He said coldly, "Since you insist on seeking death, we'll grant it to you. Xue Jiao, toy with him; I'll break this barrier!"

"Don't worry. Leave it to me." Xue Jiao's face twisted into a bestial leer. He licked his lips and, looking at Yang Kai as if at a sumptuous feast, chuckled, "The brain of a Void King Realm human must be a powerful tonic. I've never eaten anything this fine."

"Enough chatter—finish this quickly!" Qian Yan urged impatiently.

No sooner had he spoken than Xue Jiao charged forth with outrageous speed, his body tearing through the air with a sound of rupture; in the blink of an eye he arrived before Yang Kai and swung an iron arm, crashing it down.

The blow appeared ordinary, but together with Xue Jiao's colossal physical power and formidable cultivation, it could smash even a mountain of ten-thousand zhang into dust.

"Watch out!" Lady Chi Yue's voice came, edged with tension.

As a fellow Yao Lord, she knew Xue Jiao's true nature better than anyone; even she would not dare to make casual contact with him—his innate divine might was beyond what ordinary experts could withstand.

Yang Kai remained standing and did not move; he extended one hand, holding it across in front of himself.

Xue Jiao's face registered surprise, then delight, and he curled his lip into a savage grin. "Overreaching—I'll smash you to pulp!"

With those words, the iron arm slammed onto Yang Kai's forearm.

Clang...

The sound of metal meeting metal rang out like thunder, spreading throughout Half Moon Mountain.

Xue Jiao's confident expression froze and was replaced by one of utter disbelief.

Qian Yan, who had been preparing to strike the barrier, also stood stunned, staring ahead; from within Half Moon Mountain, Lady Chi Yue's hushed exclamation could still be heard.

In that instant, the three yao Lords were all struck dumb, as if walking through a dream.

Yang Kai slowly raised his eyelids and regarded the near Xue Jiao with a detached look, grinning, "This friend seems remarkably confident in his physique."

"You..." Xue Jiao's face shifted violently; his pupils trembled as he stared at Yang Kai, scarcely able to believe that his full-force blow had been so easily blocked, and that his opponent had shown no hint of retreat.

He was the attacker and Yang Kai the defender; in other words, this strike had put him at a disadvantage.

"Your physique..." Xue Jiao suddenly realized something, and surprise filled his eyes.

Yang Kai smiled. "Sorry, my physique isn't too shabby either."

Xue Jiao's eyelids narrowed as his suspicion was confirmed; a feral, humiliated rage contorted his face and he violently activated his yao essence, roaring, "A mere human—how can you compare to the strength of my Blood Jiao? Today I'll show you your true place!"

As he spoke, his fists rained down like thunder, each strike drawing whirlwinds of force and carrying terrifying power.

Something astonishing happened.

Yang Kai did not dodge or evade; instead he laughed aloud and met the blows with his own twin fists.

Each collision produced a violent explosion like two mountains colliding at speed, every shock making Qi and blood churn.

Boom, boom, boom...

In barely thirty breaths' time, Yang Kai and Xue Jiao had exchanged an unknown number of strikes, every blow landing bone-on-bone.

Strangely, neither combatant yielded an inch; both hung steady in midair, using subtle body shifts to neutralize the other's force.

The crude, straightforward duel was astonishing to behold, yet Qian Yan watched with a troubled look—humanity's greatest advantage was not physical power but mastery of Secret Techniques and Secret Treasures.

And yet Yang Kai had forsaken those advantages and clashed in raw physical combat with Xue Jiao, showing he had not used his full strength.

This exchange was nothing more than a probe!

If he employed Secret Techniques or a Secret Treasure, his strength could escalate to an unknown degree.

Realizing this, Qian Yan quickly barked, "Xue Jiao, stop toying—finish him now!"

Xue Jiao's expression darkened; he shouted, "Jiao Transformation!"

At his words, his Qi and blood suddenly erupted with several times their previous intensity; his body swelled, dense patches of blood-red scales rose across his form, horns sprouted from his forehead, and a dragon-like tail unfurled from his back.

The Blood Jiao race had inherited the bloodline of true dragons; in ancient times the mightiest Xue Jiao were descendants of true dragons.

The Jiao Transformation was a technique that awakened the ancestral bloodline's power, granting monstrous strength—alone, that brutal body and rage could crush anything before it.

When the technique unfurled, incomprehensible force struck; Yang Kai felt as if struck by lightning, his body convulsed, and he was blasted away.

Xue Lian howled, “Human, I don’t know how you tempered that body of yours, but before the ancestral bloodline of a Blood Jiao, you are nowhere near enough!”

Saying so, he pursued Yang Kai, fists and feet unleashing brutal assaults at Yang Kai's vital points, the swirling force threatening to shred the space.

Yang Kai did not dare to slacken and scrambled to respond.

Boom, boom, boom...

Two figures darted back and forth as the clash of fists and feet sent repeated detonations through the air.

In an instant Yang Kai fell behind, seemingly only defending while unable to land counterattacks.

Qian Yan could not help but sneer, "How utterly foolish to trade blows with Xue Jiao—human heads are so rotten."

Hidden among the clouds above, two warships were side by side—those of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and the Red Moon Domain.

Yu Xiong, Ba He, Shen Tu and the others watched tensely, seeing clearly how Yang Kai was being overwhelmed.

"Brother-in-law was reckless." Yu Xiong looked worried. "Xue Jiao's physique and strength rank among the yao's elite; for a human to confront him head-on—has he lost his mind? Little Sister may become a widow."

"Shut your crow mouth." Ba He snorted coldly.

Though Yu Xiong was Lady Chi Yue's adopted son and held a high status, Ba He was no lesser—centuries ago he had been Chi Yue's most trusted, and since rising to the Void King Realm he had become her foremost general and was deeply favored.

Yu Xiong dared not speak impertinently before him.

Hearing Ba He, Yu Xiong forced a sheepish smile. "I was only speaking—perhaps Brother-in-law has reserves; he doesn't strike me as someone to die so soon."

Ba He shook his head. "He has overreached this time, though his cultivation is not weaker than Xue Jiao's; he won't be slain, but he will suffer."

No sooner had Ba He finished than the contest below seemed to reach its conclusion.

With a tremendous crash, one figure was sent tumbling like a shattered sack toward the ground, while the other stood proud in the void.

All eyes turned to the figure suspended in midair and found it shrouded in blood-and-Qi, horns on its brow and a dragon tail at its back—none other than Xue Jiao!

Xue Jiao remained unscathed, so the fallen one must be Yang Kai.

The discovery drained many hearts and they quickly focused below.

On the ground a vast crater had formed, radial cracks like a spiderweb fanning outward; Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen, apparently blasted into the earth.

"Hahahaha!" Xue Jiao laughed to the heavens, scorn plain on his face. "A Void King Realm human—this is all there is!"

He had every reason to be so arrogant; in his eyes Yang Kai, no matter how unworthy, was still a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and to so easily subdue a peer filled Xue Jiao with joy.

Qian Yan, who had been tense, finally exhaled and warned gravely, "Xue Jiao, don't celebrate too soon!"
