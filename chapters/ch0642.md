## Chapter 642 — Refining Pills in Peace

In a vast stone chamber, Yang Kai sat cross-legged before a medicine cauldron the size of a water jar, True Yuan spouting forth as he concentrated on inscribing a simple spirit formation within the cauldron.

Before long, the spirit formation took shape. Following a set order, Yang Kai placed herb after herb into the cauldron, wrapping them in True Yuan to melt and temper their medicinal properties.

Soon the herbs had all liquefied into a medicinal brew, coalescing into a mass that, under the combined influence of the spirit formation and Yang Kai’s True Yuan, underwent pleasing yet subtle changes.

A faint medicinal fragrance rose from the cauldron, sharpening Yang Kai’s focus.

After a long while, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes. With a shake of his hand True Yuan surged and withdrew, and a round, blue-yellow Pill shot out of the cauldron, which Yang Kai snatched up in a single grab.

The Pill was still warm. He sniffed it; a fresh fragrance entered his nose. After assessing the Pill’s quality, Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

Earth-Grade Upper-Level!

With his current experience and techniques, he could now effortlessly refine Earth-Grade Upper-Level Pills.

He placed the finished Pill into a nearby jade vial, closed his eyes, adjusted his breath for a moment, and then began preparing another Pill.

The stone chamber he lived in was filled with vast stacks of medicinal materials, all supplied by the demon folk here; as long as Yang Kai devoted himself to pill refining, he need not worry about sourcing ingredients.

Thus he felt no impatience. Although he had been captured by the Coffin-Bearer and brought here, and despite the beautiful matron having presented the matter gravely, Yang Kai was somewhat at ease.

He had previously intended to quietly study the Dao of Pill Refining, but funds had been short and he could not buy materials, so he had only practiced for ten days in Duao City.

Now that such excellent conditions were laid before him—benefits seemingly delivered by the demon folk—he naturally had no hurry to leave; besides, he could not leave even if he wished.

He also knew, to some extent, that the beautiful matron Lady Li, the cold, elegant woman, the old man, Chu Jian and the others were all masters who had entered the Saint Realm.

Before such powerful figures, Yang Kai would not seek to make a fool of himself.

Calmly and steadily refining Pills to improve his alchemy, Yang Kai not only found enjoyment in the practice but also used it to temper himself; as his pill-refining skill rose, his strength and state of mind steadily grew as well, with gratifying results.

The girl Guan'er was tasked with watching Yang Kai’s movements; she remained several hundred zhang away, observing his performance during this time with keen eyes.

Seeing Yang Kai produce another Pill, Guan'er could not help but brighten. She lightly clenched her fist, as if that Pill were partly her accomplishment.

The air beside them warped once more; Guan'er’s expression shifted and she hurriedly adjusted her appearance.

Before long the beautiful matron Lady Li appeared, and this time she was not alone—the cold, elegant woman and the old man accompanied her.

“Greetings, Seniors!” Guan'er hastened to bow.

The three lightly inclined their heads and watched Yang Kai from a distance for a while, after which the beautiful matron Lady Li spoke, asking, “How has he progressed during this time?”

“Quite well.” Guan'er’s pretty face turned serious. “It’s almost unbelievable—he seems to have a natural talent for alchemy. I can be certain he had little prior exposure to pill refining, but in less than a month he can already refine Earth-Grade Upper-Level Pills with ease. In a few more days, I think he may be able to produce Heaven-Grade Pills.”

“That impressive?” Lady Li’s beautiful eyes brightened with a look of expectation.

When they last visited, after a long talk with Yang Kai, Lady Li had been reasonably satisfied, but upon learning he had only just begun studying alchemy she could not help but feel some disappointment.

Among the ten or so others previously captured—those with Divine Sense Fire—some likewise could not refine Pills. Without exception, even if given ten years, their achievements in alchemy would remain pitiable.

Thus Lady Li had not placed much hope in Yang Kai at the time, assuming he would be like the others.

But now, hearing Guan'er’s report, Lady Li could not help but feel pleased.

This man seemed very different from all the others before him.

“If he continues to progress at this rate, he might, within ten years, be capable of refining Saint-Grade Pills!” The old man stroked his goatee and nodded; the wrinkles on his face also showed a gleam of expectation.

“His performance is reassuring, but there is still one problem before us…” the cold woman cut in.

At her words, both Lady Li and the old man’s expressions darkened.

“What problem?” Guan'er asked in puzzlement; seeing the three seniors’ faces, she sensed the matter must be serious.

Lady Li gave a wry smile and replied softly, “It is the issue of materials. Though our Small Xuan Realm is not small in area, the supply of materials is limited, and after so many years of harvesting the yield has dwindled. I do not know whether our stock is sufficient to cultivate him into a Saint-Grade alchemist. If it is not…”

Guan'er immediately grasped the severity of the situation.

For this outsider to grow, he would necessarily require countless medicinal materials to practice and refine his techniques; experience and method must be enriched—there is no avoiding that.

The demon folk believe in physical strength and, due to the demonic qi within their bodies, rarely practice alchemy; the herbs they gather are often simply chewed and swallowed, yielding only meager effect.

For this reason, many demon folk envied humans for having the profession of alchemist, and they would spend great sums to buy Pills from humans.

Over the countless years, the demon folk living here have consumed many medicinal materials. Although Lady Li and the others deliberately cultivated some herb fields, production still cannot meet demand.

“Then what shall we do?” Guan'er grew anxious; it was such a rare hope, and to have all plans fail because of lack of materials would be a pity.

“Could we ask the Senior Coffin-Servant to fetch some materials from the outside world?” Guan'er suggested.

Lady Li shook her head gloomily. “The Senior Coffin-Servant is dead. All that remains is an obsession sustaining the movement of his body—his sole purpose is to traverse the Tongxuan realms searching for those possessing Divine Sense Fire. We cannot communicate with him.”

The old man contemplated for a moment, then said, “In the past hundred years, Chu Jian has not offered materials to the Mo Shen Fort; he should have a decent stockpile over there.”

“You mean to steal from him?” The cold woman’s eyes narrowed. “He will not listen to you.”

“Lady Li is the master of Mo Shen Fort; all disciples of Mo Shen must obey her command. If Chu Jian dares not to, that would be outright rebellion!”

The cold woman sneered, “His desire to rebel is not a thing of one or two days.”

Lady Li took a deep breath; the ample rise and fall of her chest formed a pulse-quickening curve. “Let us not bother with Chu Jian for now. We still have enough materials to last some days; when they truly run out, we will address that matter.”

The cold woman and the old man exchanged a glance and slowly shook their heads, thinking Lady Li was still as merciful as ever.

Her mercy was not something one would expect from a demon folk.

“Guan'er, you will remain here to look after him. If he has any requests, as long as they are not excessive, fulfill them without condition.” Lady Li instructed.

“Yes, I understand.” Guan'er replied quickly.

The beautiful matron cast a distant glance at Yang Kai. As she and the cold woman and the old man prepared to depart, Yang Kai seemed to sense them and turned his gaze toward them. He then grinned broadly and called out, “You’ve come at the right time; I have something to say.”

Lady Li smiled faintly. The three of them flickered through the air and stood before Yang Kai; she asked gently, “What is it?”

Yang Kai did not answer directly, instead his eyes darted about.

The old man’s expression chilled and he barked, “Human, withdraw that filthy look from your face, or this old man will teach you the proper manners.”

Yang Kai laughed in surprise. “I was merely wondering how to address you.”

Lady Li paused, then smiled. “My name is Li Rong.” She gestured and introduced the cold woman and the old man, “This is Han Fei and Hua Mo—Guan'er, you know her. As for how you address us, call us seniors if you wish, or use our names; after all, we are collaborators now.”

“Han Fei, Wintry Elegance…” Yang Kai glanced again at the cold woman and nodded slightly. “You truly are as your name suggests.”

Hua Mo’s expression turned somewhat odd, while Han Fei stared coldly at Yang Kai and said icily, “You do not fear me? Had those words been spoken by another, they would now be a corpse.”

No one could speak of her in such a way.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I merely find you somewhat familiar.”

A group of Mo Shen disciples gaped in astonishment.

“Do not misunderstand. I only know a woman whose temperament resembles yours; people like you are often cold outwardly but warm within, hehe.” Yang Kai said this as the image of Su Yan surfaced in his mind.

Han Fei seemed unable to withstand the remark; the pristine, flawless face faintly revealed an unnatural expression. Just as she was about to flare up, Yang Kai said, “Enough of that. Let us speak of business.”

“What do you wish to say?” Li Rong asked.

“Since we are collaborators, I will be blunt. I know you have concealed certain matters from me, but here I can study alchemy without worry, and I will not pry into what you hide. Let us each take what we need.”

Li Rong nodded slightly, offering no denial.

As the master of Mo Shen Fort, she naturally would not disclose everything to an outsider like Yang Kai; some secrecy was to be expected.

“But if you want me to grow quickly, you must pay a greater price. After all, I am essentially detained here; if I am to exert myself for you, I should gain some benefit—otherwise I feel uneasy.” Yang Kai grinned.

“You still want to profit?” Hua Mo snorted coldly. “Human, do not overreach. We have not restricted your freedom, and that alone is the greatest leniency we have shown you.”
