## Chapter 371 — Qiu Yimeng's Evaluation

One day and night later.

Yang Kai walked out with large strides.

Two Blood Servants and Qiu Yimeng along with Luo Xiaoman had been waiting outside. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had stern expressions, while Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman had already sat down boredly on the side.

Seeing Yang Kai walk out with a calm demeanor, both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Though they hadn’t seen Yang Kai for a day and night, they could clearly feel the pain emanating from within.

Unexpectedly, the young master had completely adjusted himself now, showing no signs of distress.

With a calm demeanor, he radiated confidence, causing both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's eyes to shine.

“Make yourselves comfortable. I’m going down for a bit!” Yang Kai called to the others and walked directly to the cave entrance.

Qiu Yimeng immediately perked up, staring eagerly at him: “What’s down there?”

Having been here for some time, she was quite curious about the Dragon Confinement Ravine. However, the people in the Lingxiao Pavilion were extremely secretive about it, even the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower people advised her not to venture into the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

So until now, Qiu Yimeng had no thoughts of going down to take a look.

But now that she saw Yang Kai was about to go down, she naturally became curious.

“Ha ha…” Yang Kai replied casually with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes, then directly leapt down.

“This guy…” Qiu Yimeng stamped her foot but didn’t chase after him.

It was clear Yang Kai didn’t want her to follow; if she rashly went after him, it would only annoy him.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai vanished from sight, disappearing into the depths of the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

“Please forgive me, Miss Qiu. It seems our young master’s temper is a bit direct.” Tang Yuxian chuckled lightly. Though she had only interacted with Yang Kai for a few days, she had sharply observed many commendable qualities about him that were not present in his peers.

Because of this, Tang Yuxian held a favorable view of this young master and thus made an excuse for Yang Kai.

“It’s nothing.” Qiu Yimeng shrugged, seemingly unperturbed.

Tu Feng turned thoughtful and casually asked, “Miss Qiu, are you and the young master old acquaintances?”

“Ha ha. I dare not hold that honor.” Qiu Yimeng forced a bitter smile and shook her head slowly.

Both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but be slightly moved; whether in terms of status or personal talent, Qiu Yimeng ranked among the top in the younger generation of Zhongdu. Young masters from the Eight Great Families would be honored to associate with her, yet now, she was so humble. To even admit to being acquainted with Yang Kai showed a lack of confidence; what was going on?

The bitterness and unwillingness within that smile were unmistakable, not faked at all. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian could see it clearly.

“You both can sense his indifference towards me as well.” Qiu Yimeng, with no signs of embarrassment, candidly stated, “I can only say we’re familiar with each other… that’s all!”

The two Blood Servants became increasingly curious, and Tu Feng asked: “If convenient, could Miss Qiu elaborate on this? If not, just consider that I haven’t asked.”

Qiu Yimeng's long eyelashes fluttered. She maintained a calm expression for quite some time before replying: “It’s nothing inconvenient. I came to the Lingxiao Pavilion last time to gather specific information about the Evil Lord and got to know him then; back then, we were still enemies. You probably know most of what happened that day.”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian nodded in unison. The leader of the Lingxiao Pavilion and four elders had fought fiercely against the Qiu Family and Bai Family, along with more than ten Divine Roaming Realm masters from Ziwei Valley. Not only did they escape safely, but they also wounded a few, and it was due to that battle that the world came to know there was someone above the Divine Roaming Realm within the Lingxiao Pavilion.

“However, what people don’t know is… it’s quite miraculous.”

“Miraculous?” Both Blood Servants were taken aback. For Qiu Yimeng to evaluate it this way, it seemed there were some unknown secrets from that day.

“Yes, miraculous. The Lingxiao Pavilion is a miraculous sect, and your young master is also a miraculous person!” Qiu Yimeng chuckled.

Before this, she had never known there existed a place in the world that could connect two distant regions.

She had also never expected that a man with a lower realm than hers could leave her at a complete loss, repeatedly facing setbacks.

Nor did she realize that someone could capture the heart of the Enchantress Queen in just one month's time.

Qiu Yimeng considered herself a top-tier individual; if she were male, she would certainly become the next head of the Qiu Family! Unfortunately, born in the wrong gender, this was somewhat regretful.

But even she wouldn’t dare to compare herself with Yang Kai.

The potential of this man was extraordinarily terrifying; if he truly grows, the achievements he can reach will far surpass the current pinnacle level!

Perhaps, he could create a legendary generation!

“How miraculous?” Tang Yuxian inquired, her beautiful eyes sparkling with curiosity.

“How miraculous… Hehe, I can’t say too much, but if you want to know, you should ask Young Master Yang yourself. If I say too much, he might really hold a grudge against me. Such thankless labor, why would I do it?”

“Uh…” The two Blood Servants were immediately dumbfounded. Qiu Yimeng had just piqued their interest but didn’t provide a satisfying answer, which left them feeling quite uncomfortable, as if a cat was clawing at their hearts.

If anyone else spoke like this, the two Blood Servants might even use the Yang Family’s tortures to extract a clear answer from her. But with Qiu Yimeng, they had no method.

Straightening her expression, Qiu Yimeng said: “Though I can’t say much, I can assure you, you must… absolutely… absolutely not underestimate your young master!”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were then left speechless, their hearts thunderstruck.

Qiu Yimeng had used the word ‘absolutely’ three times, her tone quite grave.

What did this indicate? It indicated that this lady from the Qiu Family was extremely confident in Yang Kai! And it was confidence to the utmost degree.

“Those who underestimate him will pay a heavy price!” As Qiu Yimeng’s expression shifted, she smiled broadly again.

Tu Feng's face twitched, suddenly feeling a sense of unreality.

Tang Yuxian frowned deeply, unable to comprehend why Qiu Yimeng spoke so definitively and without reservation.

However, even though they were doubtful, they knew Qiu Yimeng likely wouldn’t speak without basis.

Their expressions grew serious, and they said, “We’ll remember that.”

“En.” Qiu Yimeng lightly nodded and casually asked: “Will your Blood Servants participate in this Yang Family’s struggle for succession?”

Tu Feng forced a smile: “We’re not sure about that; the clan hasn’t made a clear statement yet.”

“If you do participate, if I were you, I would definitely follow him!” Qiu Yimeng stated earnestly.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian could not deny this and only said calmly: “Thank you for your guidance, Miss Qiu. When that day truly comes, we will consider it carefully.”

Qiu Yimeng said no more, knowing that even if she spoke eloquently, she could not influence the mindset of two Divine Roaming Realm experts. When that time came, they would choose who to follow based solely on their judgment; no outside interference could change that.

There was little use in saying so much now; it would only heighten their expectations for Yang Kai’s performance.

In the depths of the Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai halted at the spot where he had initially departed, looking around, and indeed found no trace of the Earth Demon.

That old demon must have left long ago; the originally surging evil energy had now dissipated completely, swallowed cleanly.

The Earth Demon had mentioned that after handling matters here, he would look for him, but what happened afterward exceeded both of their expectations.

The Qiu Family had come in full force, while Su Yan and the others had escaped thousands of miles through the void passage, and Yang Kai ran to the Cangyun Evil Land.

This point was beyond both his and the Earth Demon’s reckoning.

Perhaps even if the Earth Demon wished to search for him, he wouldn’t have a clear direction.

If that were the reason why the Earth Demon had not yet contacted him, it would be quite understandable.

But did he truly harbor ulterior motives? Yang Kai was not quite certain.

Closing his eyes, Yang Kai slowly released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings. After a moment, his expression jolted, and he quickly turned his gaze to a nearby rock face.

That place seemed plain, with nothing unusual, but through Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, he keenly sensed something peculiar.

Here, some traces of evil energy remained!

Focusing his gaze there, he raised his hand to sweep over that area.

A ripple spread out, and at that seemingly ordinary rock face, a line of writings suddenly appeared; the letters looked fresh and seemed to have been written not long ago.

One glance, and Yang Kai couldn't help but smile.

It appeared the Earth Demon had no intention of breaking free from his control, instead using a special method to leave a message here.

“The old servant has completed his tasks and is going out to look for the Young Master. If unsuccessful, I’ll return here in three months! Leave a message!”

This was evidently a note written by the Earth Demon for him. The Earth Demon intended to spend three months searching for Yang Kai’s whereabouts and would return to this place after three months.

Because he knew that regardless of the circumstances, as long as Yang Kai was alive, he would surely come looking for him.

Leaving such a message was enough to prove the Earth Demon’s loyalty.

A joyful expression appeared on his face, and Yang Kai pointed like a sword to engrave a line of writing below.

Zhongdu, Yang Family!

No need to elaborate further; once the Earth Demon returned here, he would surely understand everything.

With a laugh, Yang Kai’s body moved like lightning, shooting upwards.

Upon returning to the cave, both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian cast a concerned glance at him.

Not knowing if it was his illusion, Yang Kai felt their current expression when looking at him was somewhat different from before, much more serious.

“Have you sorted everything out?” Qiu Yimeng inquired, her tone suggestive as she asked with a smile.

“En.”

“What are your plans next?”

Yang Kai grinned broadly, filled with confidence and grandeur: “Returning to Zhongdu to participate in the struggle for succession!”

Qiu Yimeng revealed a knowing expression and said delightedly: “Perfect, I’m also heading back. If you don’t mind, shall we go together?”

Yang Kai glanced at her indifferently: “As you wish!”

Qiu Yimeng chuckled, “Then I’ll be borrowing your luck.”

Yang Kai looked at her with confusion: “Borrowing what luck?”

“You’ll know tomorrow.” Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, not answering but adding, “Wait for me half a day; I have some matters to handle here, and I’ll set off tomorrow morning.”

“Alright!” Yang Kai nodded; what Qiu Yimeng had to handle was also related to the matters of the Lingxiao Pavilion, so half a day could naturally be delayed.
