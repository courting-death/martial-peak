## Chapter 2196 — Facing Death Without Fear

After scolding Luo Yuan, Yang Kai finally turned his gaze back to the round-faced woman and asked seriously, "You know what the Supreme Mystic Pill does, right?"

The woman nodded repeatedly and said, "I do."

"Then you must also understand just how precious it is."

The woman nodded again.

Yang Kai smiled and said, "So do you think a mere Crystal Stone is enough to exchange for a Supreme Mystic Pill?"

An awkward expression crossed her face. She pressed her lips together and admitted in a soft voice, "It can't..."

"That's right. The value of the two isn't even close. Although I'm a bit interested in your Crystal Stone, this is clearly a losing deal..." Yang Kai rambled on, finally spreading his hands and saying, "Even a fool wouldn't do it, right?"

"Then do you want anything else? I can give you something else." The round-faced woman said anxiously. She wasn't stupid—she could hear the implication in Yang Kai's words. He only said it was a loss, not that it couldn't be traded. She immediately realized Yang Kai wanted more items, so she gritted her teeth and said, "I can give you all of these!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, looking contemplative as if weighing his options.

To be fair, the things this round-faced woman had taken out weren't of little value, but to exchange them for a Supreme Mystic Pill was still a bit of a stretch. However... if the effect of that one item that caught Yang Kai's attention was truly as he suspected, then just that one item alone would be enough to trade for a Supreme Mystic Pill.

"Even that's not enough?" The woman seemed desperate to obtain the Supreme Mystic Pill. Seeing Yang Kai's hesitation, she grew anxious.

"If you could add some Source Crystals, then this deal might..."

Before Yang Kai could finish, the round-faced woman reached for her Spatial Ring. In the next moment, a huge pile of Source Crystals appeared before Yang Kai, forming a small mountain. A rough count showed there were at least several hundred thousand.

"This is all the Source Crystals I have. I didn't keep a single one," the woman said.

"Alright!" Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately smiled and said, "Since you're so sincere, I'll trade you one Supreme Mystic Pill!"

"Really?" The woman's voice trembled, and she nearly burst into tears of joy. She looked at Yang Kai with gratitude and surprise, as if she couldn't believe happiness had come so suddenly.

After all, so many people had failed before her, but she had succeeded in making the deal. She hadn't even dared to hope for it, so this unexpected joy left her a bit overwhelmed. She couldn't help but cover her red lips with her small hand.

Yang Kai had already reached into the pill furnace, took out a Supreme Mystic Pill, and handed it to the woman. "If I say I'll trade, then I'll trade. How could I deceive you?"

Only then did the woman extend her trembling hands to receive the pure, round pill, cupping it in her palms as if afraid it would melt. She examined it closely in front of her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai began gathering up all the items and Source Crystals the woman had brought out, stuffing them into his Spatial Ring. When he picked up a soil-yellow bead, he quietly infused it with Origin Qi and Divine Sense, but it was completely unresponsive...

Instantly, Yang Kai was delighted and discreetly put the bead away.

At the same time, the surrounding cultivators burst into an uproar.

Almost everyone's gaze burned as they stared at the round-faced woman's back.

Although they hadn't seen exactly what the woman had traded with Yang Kai, everyone saw her receive a Supreme Mystic Pill.

None of them dared to covet the Supreme Mystic Pill in Yang Kai's hand, but this woman was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, making her an easy target for those with ill intentions.

By now, Yang Kai had finished packing up.

He glanced at the surrounding cultivators, then at the round-faced woman, and suddenly sighed, "Miss!"

"Eh? Does Eldest Brother have any other instructions?" The round-faced woman seemed to snap out of her joy and asked in surprise.

"I just want to tell you one thing!" Yang Kai smiled slightly.

"What is it?"

"An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth!" Yang Kai said solemnly.

The woman was briefly stunned, but quickly understood and looked at Yang Kai gratefully. "Thank you for the warning."

Yang Kai nodded and said, "Since you understand, I advise you to take the Supreme Mystic Pill right now. As I said before, its effects are miraculous, and it's actually better to take it sooner rather than waiting for a breakthrough. You're only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so this is the perfect time. If you trust me, I can stand guard for you for a while—it won't take long."

"No, no!" The round-faced woman quickly waved her hands and murmured, "This Supreme Mystic Pill... I have other plans for it!"

A strange look flashed in Yang Kai's eyes, and he nodded slightly. "Then please do as you wish."

"Thank you for being willing to trade this pill with me. You're a good person!" The round-faced woman gave Yang Kai a sweet smile, then turned and walked away.

Watching her back, Yang Kai looked helpless.

He had said all he could, but she didn't heed him and insisted on taking the Supreme Mystic Pill away. This would obviously cause trouble. In fact, the best thing to do after getting the pill was to take it immediately, so no one would try to rob you.

Or, like Wuchang and Xiao Chen, be so strong that no one would dare to target you.

Yang Kai seemed to foresee a grim future for the round-faced woman...

And sure enough, just as he expected, before the woman even left the broken world he had created, some cultivators with ill intentions were already eyeing her.

Although bullying the weak in front of everyone wasn't honorable, with the Supreme Mystic Pill and the hope of advancing to the Emperor Realm at stake, the proud sons and daughters of the major sects and families were willing to set aside their pride and dignity, ready to make a move as soon as the woman stepped out.

The round-faced woman seemed to realize this too. Suddenly, a fearless aura welled up from her petite body. With a flick of her hand, a ribbon-like Secret Treasure wrapped around her arm. As she walked forward, she called out crisply, "Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, I don't want to fight you. If possible, please let me pass. Thank you!"

Her words were sincere and her expression resolute.

A few people were moved and showed some reluctance, but most remained indifferent, their eyes cold as they watched her.

While she was saying this, she had already walked out of the area covered by Yang Kai's Spatial Force.

In an instant, shouts erupted one after another.

"Hand over the Supreme Mystic Pill!"

"Give up the Spiritual Pill and we'll spare your life!"

"Little girl, cooperate with me and you'll suffer less. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"

As these voices rang out, at least a dozen cultivators charged at her. The moment they moved, each unleashed Secret Treasures and secret techniques, attacking in all directions to block others, while they themselves rushed toward the round-faced woman at top speed.

Panic flashed across the woman's pretty face, but at the critical moment, she fiercely urged her Origin Qi. The ribbon in her hand trembled, suddenly radiating five-colored light that wrapped around her, turning her into a stream of light as she shot toward the edge.

Clearly, she had no intention of fighting these people—she just wanted to escape as quickly as possible.

That was the wisest choice.

But she was too naive. With so many people attacking her, how could she possibly withstand it?

Boom, boom, boom...

After a series of muffled crashes, the round-faced woman's figure was forced out into the open. With a short, stifled cry, her petite body plummeted to the ground like a meteor.

Immediately after, more than a dozen streaks of light chased after her, each face filled with greed and excitement.

The round-faced woman instantly showed a look of despair.

Moments later, she crashed to the ground. Though not seriously injured, she was in bad shape. She struggled a few times and finally managed to stand, but it was already too late...

Several quick-moving fellows had already closed in on her. The fastest one brandished a sharp sword and slashed viciously at her right hand!

That person was utterly ruthless, showing no mercy at all, as if he wanted to cut off the hand holding the Spiritual Pill.

In this moment of crisis, the woman cried out in fright, her face turning deathly pale.

With her Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, there was no way she could avoid this deadly strike. Losing an arm was inevitable.

The attacker even wore a cruel smile, as if he could already see himself obtaining the Supreme Mystic Pill!

As long as he got the Supreme Mystic Pill, he would swallow it immediately, cutting off anyone else's hopes of taking it.

Yang Kai's face darkened. He quietly gathered his Spatial Force, ready to help the woman at the critical moment!

But just then, a figure appeared like a ghost in front of the round-faced woman. The figure was imposing, like a towering mountain, blocking all the raging attacks and making the woman behind him feel an unprecedented sense of safety and comfort, as if she had found a harbor to shelter her...

"Huh?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, looking at the figure in great surprise.

He hadn't expected this person to act at such a crucial moment! Could it be... he was also after the Supreme Mystic Pill?

As this thought flashed through his mind, the man slowly extended a hand...

His movements weren't fast, but they gave off an incredibly strange feeling. The sword-wielding attacker turned pale, suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of impending death...

He tried to dodge the large hand, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't escape.

From an outsider's perspective, it looked as if he was throwing himself into the man's grasp.
