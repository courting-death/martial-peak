## Chapter 2292 — Backbone

"S-Save me?" Fire Ghost stared wide-eyed, his gaze growing dim, utterly stunned.

Yang Kai had already grabbed him by the collar, and with a flicker, both vanished from the spot.

The wilderness reeked of blood, littered with the aftermath of a fierce battle—broken limbs and flesh everywhere, a scene of utter misery.

"Young Master Yang..." Ye Qinghan, face pale, flew back, glancing around but not seeing Yang Kai. Anxiously, she asked Hua Qingsi, "Sister, where did Young Master Yang go?"

Hua Qingsi exchanged a glance with the Incarnation, then with a flick of her delicate body, appeared behind Ye Qinghan. Her hand turned into a knife and chopped down hard on the back of Ye Qinghan's neck.

Ye Qinghan never expected Hua Qingsi to attack her. In her mind, Hua Qingsi was on Yang Kai's side, so she had no guard up. With that chop, she immediately collapsed softly to the ground.

"Did you kill her?" The Incarnation jumped in shock.

"How could I?" Hua Qingsi rolled her eyes at him and pouted, "I just knocked her out." Pausing, she eyed the Incarnation suspiciously. "What are you doing?"

As she spoke, she noticed the Incarnation had walked over to Wind Ghost's corpse and picked it up.

The Incarnation grinned. "What else? This is a great tonic! Tsk tsk, a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm."

Hua Qingsi's face turned pale at his words, as if recalling something. She cried out, "You're going to use that evil art to devour his flesh and blood again?"

The Incarnation replied, "Just making use of waste."

"Disgusting. Don't do it in front of me, or I'll cut ties with you!" Hua Qingsi said with a look of utter distaste.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly flashed back onto the wasteland, waving to the Incarnation and Hua Qingsi. "Come back."

After speaking, he glanced at the unconscious Ye Qinghan, seeming to understand, and nodded. "Knocking her out is fine."

With a wave of his hand, he drew Ye Qinghan into the Xuan Realm Pearl, then opened its entrance for Hua Qingsi and the Incarnation to enter as well.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, by the medicine garden, Yang Kai and the Incarnation reappeared.

Fire Ghost was now weak and barely alive, the Blood Saber still stuck in his chest, blood flowing from the wound. Though miserable, he laughed mockingly: "I've suffered a fatal wound. Unless you have one of those legendary healing holy medicines, no one in this world can save me! I advise you not to waste your efforts. Cough, cough..."

He coughed as he spoke, blood streaming from his mouth and nose.

Yang Kai snorted, "Restoring you completely is impossible, but keeping you alive is no problem."

He walked straight up to Fire Ghost, pried open his mouth, and poured a handful of Spiritual Pills down his throat.

Fire Ghost was stubborn, refusing to give in. He shook his head violently, but with his cultivation sealed, he couldn't resist Yang Kai. After a brief struggle, he had no choice but to swallow the pills.

His gaze was full of venom and mockery, clearly thinking Yang Kai's efforts were futile. He could feel his life slipping away, and though the sensation was chilling, it was better than falling into the enemy's hands and being tortured.

Under his watchful eyes, Yang Kai sat cross-legged before him, formed hand seals, and pressed a palm to his chest.

The palm landed on the Blood Saber, shaking it loose from his chest and sending a gush of blood spurting out. Fire Ghost groaned, his body trembling violently, feeling as if he was about to die.

But in the next instant, Fire Ghost's expression changed—he felt a surge of pure vitality pouring into his body from outside, pulling him back from the brink of death.

The wound in his chest tingled and went numb, the bleeding stopped, and his fading life force was suddenly replenished.

He stared in shock and saw, in the medicine garden, a small, lush tree about half a person's height radiating a green aura. That aura, visible to the naked eye, was being drawn by Yang Kai's secret art and flowing into his body.

"What... what is that!" Even though Fire Ghost knew he was doomed, he couldn't help but tremble all over. He could sense unimaginable vitality from that little tree, and it was this green aura that had saved him from immediate death.

He froze, realizing this little tree must be extraordinary.

"Everlasting Tree. Ever heard of it?" Yang Kai grinned at him, his smile full of wickedness.

"Everlasting Tree?" Fire Ghost shuddered, staring at Yang Kai in shock. He shouted, "Nonsense! The Everlasting Tree is born of heaven and earth, able to revive the dead and regrow flesh and bone. It's said that refining it grants immortality. How could you possibly have such a thing..."

"You know quite a bit." Yang Kai chuckled darkly.

"That's the Everlasting Tree? Who are you trying to fool?" Fire Ghost scoffed.

"Believe it or not." Yang Kai glanced at him and sneered, "You have the energy to argue, so it looks like you won't be dying anytime soon."

At these words, Fire Ghost immediately fell silent, his expression shifting through a range of emotions.

He was horrified to find that just the green aura from the little tree was already healing his wounds and keeping him from death. If he could eat one of its leaves... wouldn't he recover instantly?

The thought left Fire Ghost completely stunned, cold sweat pouring down his forehead.

Though he didn't want to believe it, his own experience told him this little tree might really be the legendary Everlasting Tree!

Gulp!

Fire Ghost couldn't help but swallow, his gaze burning as he stared at the Everlasting Tree.

Yang Kai ignored him and said to the Incarnation, "He's yours. Make sure to get something out of him."

"Don't worry! He'll talk!" The Incarnation grinned sinisterly, his voice making Fire Ghost's skin crawl.

Turning to look, Fire Ghost found Yang Kai gone, leaving only the giant stone man sitting cross-legged, still holding a corpse.

"Wind Ghost..." Fire Ghost looked mournfully at Wind Ghost's body, feeling a pang of sorrow. After a moment, his gaze turned cold as he looked at the Incarnation. "No matter what you are, you'll never get anything out of me!"

"Backbone!" The Incarnation praised. "I like people with backbone. Don't worry, I won't make things hard for you."

Fire Ghost sneered, clearly not believing a word.

But to his surprise, the Incarnation really didn't bother him or try to torture him. Instead, he placed Wind Ghost's corpse in front of him, cupping it in his hands.

"What are you going to do to Wind Ghost!" Fire Ghost's face changed as he shouted.

"What am I going to do... heh heh heh..." The Incarnation let out a strange laugh.

Fire Ghost's forehead throbbed with veins, his nerves fraying. The Incarnation's evasive answers and questions only made him angrier.

As Fire Ghost grew more agitated, the Incarnation suddenly grew solemn and shouted, "Heaven Devouring Battle Art!"

Fire Ghost's eyes bulged, his teeth chattering in terror. He cried out, "Hea... Heaven Devouring Battle Art?"

...

Fire Ghost did not have as much backbone as he claimed—or rather, what he saw had already shattered his mental defenses.

He could stab himself in the heart without hesitation, but after witnessing the Incarnation use the Heaven Devouring Battle Art on Wind Ghost's corpse, his inner defenses collapsed.

No one wanted to be devoured alive, their flesh and blood essence consumed. That was a far too miserable way to die.

So he quickly spilled everything he knew.

The four of them were indeed Blood Saber cultivators, and had received orders from above to capture Yang Kai alive and bring him to headquarters. As for the reason, Fire Ghost didn't know—they were just following orders. Blood Saber was extremely hierarchical, and without sufficient rank, one couldn't access deeper secrets.

They didn't even know who gave the order. They just received a mission directive at a specific place and time.

Through this interrogation, Yang Kai learned that Blood Saber was even larger than he imagined. Its members were scattered across many regions and sects, usually blending in unnoticed. Only when given a mission would they reveal themselves as Blood Saber members and act.

Once the mission ended, they would disappear again, leaving no trace.

When the Incarnation asked where Blood Saber's Southern Territory headquarters was, Fire Ghost's Sea of Consciousness suddenly exploded before he could answer, killing him instantly. It seemed a powerful expert had placed a restriction on him—once a true secret was touched, the restriction would activate to prevent leaks.

After obtaining this information from the Incarnation, Yang Kai’s expression grew so cold and grim it seemed as if a layer of frost could be scraped from his face.

Though it was his first time encountering Blood Saber, from the strength and actions of the Four Ghosts, it was clear Blood Saber was not to be trifled with. Now that he was being targeted, he didn't even know the reason, let alone any details about the enemy.

This left him feeling extremely uneasy, as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat.

When Blood Saber acts, it's to the death! With this mission failed, Blood Saber would not let things rest. Stronger enemies would surely come for him. He could handle the Four Ghosts of Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain, but what about next time? What if Blood Saber sent Emperor Realm experts?

For a while, Yang Kai was deeply worried.
