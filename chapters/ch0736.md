## Chapter 736 — Waste of Effort?

It had been half a month since Yang Kai arrived at the Ice Sect, and during those two weeks he had not left the ice chamber for an instant, keeping silent vigil by the slumbering Su Yan.

In another ice chamber, the Ice Lord and four Saint Realm elders had gathered, apparently engaged in a heated debate; each voiced his opinion and they argued without end, while Ice Lord Qing Ya sat upright on a crystalline ice throne in silence.

One Saint Realm expert who had previously had a Soul Devouring Worm invade his Sea of Consciousness looked furious and barked, “That brat doesn’t seem like a good sort; who knows by what strange art he controls that ancient vermin. From how he dealt with our Ice Sect disciples, he must be cruel and ruthless — a man like that needs to be kicked out at once.”

Another Saint Realm expert who had suffered at Yang Kai’s hands quickly nodded in agreement. “I feel the same.”

Saying that, he turned to Qian Hao and asked, “Brother Qian Hao, what do you and your sister say?”

“He must go!” Qian Hao pondered a moment and said in a deep voice, “The Ice Sect is a place of purity; his arrival brought nothing but strife. A man like him is a calamity — he cannot remain.”

Qian Yue said nothing, but from her expression it was plain she did not want Yang Kai to stay in the Ice Sect.

“Sect Lord!” Qian Hao looked up at Qing Ya. “It’s time to send him away. Letting him loiter in the Ice Sect like this is beneath us.”

Qing Ya smiled slightly. “Why are you so eager to throw him out? His methods were indeed excessive, but from his position he was also driven by necessity. Besides, he showed restraint toward our Ice Sect disciples; those wounded have suffered no soul damage and will recover after some rest. We should not burn our bridges.”

Her beautiful eyes flickered and she sighed. “Besides, he came looking for his Senior Sister. Su Yan has fallen into slumber; who knows when she will wake. If we insist on driving him off, we might force him to release those ancient worms again.”

“So what should we do? Let him stay forever in the Ice Sect?”

“Let him take Su Yan with him!” Qian Hao proposed. “When that old fellow came before he said that if anyone came seeking Su Yan they must be allowed to leave; we won’t trouble them or haggle over past offenses. Why not let him take Su Yan and leave?”

Qian Yue frowned. “Eldest Brother, with Su Yan in her current state, I wouldn’t feel comfortable letting that brat take her away.”

Although she loathed Yang Kai, her fondness for Su Yan ran deep; she would protect her without hesitation and firmly shook her head. “I won’t agree to that.”

“All right, all right.” Qing Ya waved a hand. “Let’s not decide this now. I think that brat is a lovesick fool; he’s been in the ice chamber all this time without moving. I’ll go speak with him first and see what he intends. Perhaps he never planned to overstay his welcome in the Ice Sect.”

The four elders heard this and could only nod in assent.

The three male elders left soon after, but Qian Yue stayed behind. “Sect Lord, I will go with you.”

Qing Ya inclined her head slightly. The two rose and made their way toward the ice mountain where Su Yan lay.

Before long they reached the ice chamber and knocked gently on the door. There was no response, but Qing Ya sensed an unusual energy fluctuation and frowned as she pushed the door open.

Inside the chamber, not only did a biting cold permeate the air, there was also a spreading heat energy. Qing Ya covered her mouth at the sight.

Yang Kai’s hands were pressed against the ice that encased Su Yan’s body, True Yuan surging within him.

“You idiot, what are you doing?” Qian Yue shouted in a petulant voice and, in a flash, came before Yang Kai and struck out at him.

Yang Kai did not resist; he merely turned his head and gave her a cold glance.

Qian Yue’s hand halted midair as the blow neared Yang Kai, and she ground her teeth. “What are you doing?”

“Mind your own damn business!” Yang Kai snorted.

Qing Ya hurried forward, worried. “Don’t do that; you’ll harm Su Yan.”

“I know my limits,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

He cared for Su Yan more than anyone; he would be careful, and would not act recklessly unless certain no accident would occur.

“Are you trying to contact Su Yan?” Qing Ya asked thoughtfully.

Yang Kai nodded.

He and Su Yan had practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique. That art has three major stages: at first the bodies must intermingle to practice together; by the Second-Tier, no physical contact is required — simply being close enough allows True Yuan to converge and fuse, enabling the purification and transcendence of the minds, which benefits both cultivation and combat.

Now Su Yan’s body was encased in a thick layer of ice; the First-Tier method was out of the question. That ice was unusually firm, formed by Su Yan’s own True Yuan, and Yang Kai had no intention of breaking it.

He hoped to employ the Second-Tier method of Dual Cultivation to communicate with Su Yan.

But despite trying for so long, he had made no headway; Su Yan’s True Yuan did not respond to his calls, and the two could not fuse.

“Don’t waste your effort. I don’t know what kind of dual cultivation you practice, but Ice-Body Locking the Heart is a secret of our Ice Sect. Once cast, all sensation is lost. I don’t think your technique can surpass Ice-Body Locking the Heart and break that fetter!” Qian Yue scoffed, pouring cold water on his hopes.

Yang Kai paid her no mind, his brow tightly furrowed.

He had tested for half a month with no progress; now he could only try the Dual Cultivation Technique’s Third-Tier. If that failed, Yang Kai would be helpless and must wait for Su Yan to awaken on her own.

He did not expect to wake Su Yan immediately; casting Ice-Body Locking the Heart would harm her in no way and might even be beneficial, so there was no need to rouse her.

Yang Kai only wished to exchange a word with her and learn what she truly desired.

If Su Yan wished not to remain in the Ice Sect, Yang Kai would take her away at once; if she chose to stay, he would follow her will. This place was a paradise for her cultivation and it would be hard to find a more suitable environment elsewhere.

Seeing him lost in thought, Qian Yue snorted and ceased trying to provoke him.

Qing Ya sighed softly. “Yang Kai, haste makes waste. Don’t be too hasty.”

Yang Kai smiled wryly and raised his head to ask, “Since your Ice Sect has such a secret art, is there no way to undo it?”

Qing Ya shook her head. “Only the caster can lift it. Outsiders have no means, nor can they establish contact; precisely because Ice-Body Locking the Heart obliterates all sensation, it can aid our disciples’ cultivation.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Yang Kai, there is something I want to ask you.” Qing Ya hesitated, her expression somewhat troubled.

“Asking when I leave?” Yang Kai gave a teasing smile and cut straight to the point.

Qing Ya was taken aback by his directness, but then replied frankly, “It’s not that we insist on driving you out, but the Ice Sect does not usually admit outsiders. Su Yan is one thing, but your presence has disrupted our rules.”

“Don’t worry, I have no intention of staying forever. The bitter cold suppresses my cultivation slightly.” Yang Kai pursed his lips. “But for now I’m not leaving. I plan to seclude myself for a while and I hope no one will disturb me.”

“Seclude yourself here?” Qing Ya’s eyes sharpened. “You aren’t thinking of trying to contact Su Yan again, are you?”

“You’d better give up and go while you can, brat,” Qian Yue said with undisguised dislike. “No one can contact someone under Ice-Body Locking the Heart. Don’t waste your effort. Su Yan is here; whether she joins our Ice Sect or not, we will take good care of her. You need not trouble yourself.”

“She doesn’t need your care.” Yang Kai gave Qian Yue a cold look before turning back to Qing Ya. “Sect Lord, please grant me this request.”

“Very well.” Qing Ya nodded helplessly. “You may seclude yourself in the Ice Sect, but only this once. When you emerge, no matter what Su Yan’s choice, you must leave. Whether you take Su Yan with you or she remains here will be up to her — the Ice Sect will not interfere.”

“Thank you, Sect Lord.” Yang Kai inclined his head. Qing Ya was easier to reason with than Qian Yue: young, beautiful, and soft-spoken. He wondered if she and Shopkeeper Meng were old acquaintances.

The thought of her standing next to that dried-up old fox Meng Wuya filled Yang Kai with a sense of wasted beauty.

Entertained by the thought, his expression turned odd for a moment.

Qing Ya frowned slightly but did not press further; she and Qian Yue left in haste.

After they departed, Yang Kai drew a deep breath and stared at the sleeping beauty encased in ice, his gaze gentle.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai closed his eyes, placed both hands on the outside of the ice, and his Divine Sense surged forth.

The Third-Tier of the Dual Cultivation Technique is heart-to-heart communion, a fusion of the souls.

When they parted in the past, Yang Kai and Su Yan had already reached a state of heart-to-heart understanding, but they had never tried soul fusion as a means of dual cultivation.

Now he had no choice but to attempt that method to see if he could reach Su Yan.

From close range he sent his mind calling to Su Yan again and again; subtle bursts of True Yuan emanated between his hands, penetrating that strange, thick ice and reaching Su Yan’s body, seeping into her meridians.

There was no response. Su Yan seemed truly to have lost all sensation; not only was her body motionless, her consciousness showed no ripple.

At this moment she was nothing but a sleeping jade doll.

Yang Kai neither hurried nor despaired, and repeated the monotonous act without pause.

He believed that with the deep bond between Su Yan and himself, he had a good chance of breaking the seal of Ice-Body Locking the Heart and resonating with Su Yan’s consciousness.
