## Chapter 802 — Don't Be So Surprised

Before a ruin, Xu Hui stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, scarcely daring to believe his eyes.

Shi Kun, Cheng Yuetong and the others at his side wore the same stunned expressions.

"Don't be so surprised—did you think I died in there?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Xu Hui finally recovered, tears of joy welling as his body trembled; he cupped his fists and said, "Welcome, Saint Lord, as you emerge!"

Shi Kun and Cheng Yuetong echoed the greeting respectfully.

Seeing Yang Kai appear was like seeing hope itself; the gloom on their faces vanished.

The Sacred Land's nearby disciples gathered too, looking at Yang Kai like a savior.

Yang Kai frowned and raised a hand. "Don't call me that for now. I heard most of the situation from Elder Yu Ying and An Ling'er. Is there anything I can help with? If so, tell me. If it's within my power, I'll do it."

Xu Hui started, then immediately understood Yang Kai’s meaning. No longer risking to displease him, he answered with restraint, "I wouldn’t dare. These are all small matters—calming the disciples and treating the wounded—there’s no need for you to get involved."

As he spoke his gaze flicked to Yang Kai's hand, and disappointment briefly crossed his face.

"Is this what you seek?" Yang Kai turned his palm and took out the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring.

Everyone's expressions shifted as they stared at the ancient ring. Xu Hui nodded repeatedly, radiant and excited, "Young brother, you truly brought out the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly and, before them all, slipped the ring onto his finger. "I planned to hand this ring to you when I emerged, but... some things happened. Until I reach the Saint Realm, I'll keep it. I'll return it when the time comes."

He reckoned that once he entered the Saint Realm he could sever the ring's tie and erase his soul imprint from it.

"No matter, it's yours. Wear it as long as you like," Xu Hui beamed, and the other elders nodded in agreement.

"With the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring, matters become much easier," Xu Hui said, relieved. "Young brother, I must ask you a few favors."

"Name them," Yang Kai replied seriously.

"Many disciples are wounded and we're low on healing pills and medicinal herbs. Please come with me to the storage and fetch what we need."

"Lead the way."

Xu Hui hurried to instruct the other guardians and then led Yang Kai in one direction.

After they left, the guardians exchanged astonished looks.

"He actually came out of the Sacred Tomb—nine months have passed. How did he do it?" Shi Kun kept shaking his head.

"This breaks the records in our annals, doesn't it? I recall the longest trial only took two months."

"If it took him so long to pass, is he really that capable? Maybe we overrated him."

"What matters is the ring was brought out. With it, the Nine Peaks' formations and arrays can be reactivated to stop further incursions."

The crowd murmured, while Yu Ying's eyes showed a very complex emotion.

She couldn't fathom how Yang Kai had slipped past her perception and appeared at her side. Even with the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, without sufficient Divine Sense that would be impossible.

Had they underestimated him, or overestimated him?

"Yu Ying, are you all right?" Cheng Yuetong asked as she noticed Yu Ying's distracted state.

"Nothing—just that this future Saint Lord is unlike others."

"How so?" Cheng Yuetong asked eagerly.

"Hard to say," Yu Ying shook her head, then snapped at the gathering, "Stop staring and get back to work!"

The disciples snapped out of their daze and hurried back to their tasks.

News of the new Saint Lord's emergence spread like wildfire, lifting the spirits of every disciple who heard it.

Before the underground storeroom, Yang Kai and Xu Hui paused.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense could not penetrate the storeroom's construction—the materials were impenetrable, and even his perception could glean nothing of its contents. The surrounding materials were extraordinarily solid.

On the way, Xu Hui explained matters briefly to Yang Kai.

The Sacred Land had stockpiled excess supplies in this vault for generations; over the years the store had grown vast.

Since the old Saint Lord's fall the vault had remained unopened.

After these recent calamities their remaining supplies had been exhausted, and many injured disciples lacked Healing Pills, let alone other refining medicines.

The urgent task was to open the vault and retrieve its provisions.

The key to opening it was the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring Yang Kai had brought forth.

Following Xu Hui's lead, Yang Kai infused True Yuan into the ring and pressed the ring's impression into a recess at the vault door's center.

Radiant light flowed and the once-impenetrable door slowly opened.

A colossal underground warehouse revealed itself, filled with all manner of supplies—herbs for pill refinement, rare materials for forging, and countless already-made pills and Secret Treasures.

Yang Kai stared in awe, deeply moved.

This was the foundation of a major power; its depth exceeded his imagination.

"Young brother, take what you need. I'll fetch disciples to help carry it out," Xu Hui said and hurried off.

Yang Kai happily began to gather supplies.

The cache could easily supply thousands. No wonder the nearby powers risked attacking; beyond being a prime cultivation site, these stores alone were tempting.

Men live for profit and quarrel for gain—an unchanging truth.

Yang Kai took many refining materials into his Black Book Space for future use.

His alchemy still needed improvement; although he could now refine Lower-Level Saint-Grade pills, he was not yet proficient. Only when he could refine Middle-Level Saint-Grade pills would he be able to go to the Endless Snow Mountain to seek out the Coffin-Servant, enter the Small Xuan Realm, and remove the shackles on the Ancient Demon Clan.

Compared with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai cared more for Li Rong and Han Fei's strength.

Because of the Ancient Demon Clan, he preferred not to entangle himself too deeply with the Sacred Land.

Humans and demons could not coexist; if he became both Saint Lord and leader of the Ancient Demon Clan, the two powers might clash and he would be trapped in the middle.

After a flurry of activity he gathered many medicinal materials, even finding those needed for the saint pill Li Rong had mentioned.

With that, the herb list for that pill was complete.

In high spirits, Yang Kai also collected some Crystal Stones for cultivation and finally stopped.

Xu Hui filled Spatial Pouches with supplies and handed them to waiting disciples to distribute to the Sacred Land's alchemists.

Half a day later the situation calmed.

"Don't you need to fetch anything?" Xu Hui asked noticing Yang Kai's empty hands and lack of a pouch.

Yang Kai shook his head. "No need."
