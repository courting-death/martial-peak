## Chapter 1523 — Star Emperor Mountain

Yang Kai read the room and knew he'd said enough; if he went on, those people would likely lose their minds on the spot. He put away the Star Emperor Token and said slowly, "Seniors, I think I have proven myself. You should make your choice now."

Yang Xiuzhu and the others exchanged glances, their eyes meeting for a moment as if reaching some agreement, then they cupped their fists in unison: "We pay our respects to the Sect Master!"

Yang Kai had indeed proven himself—whether it was the Star Emperor Token that sealed the Great Emperor's divine art, or the secrets of the Three Flames Ring and the Flowing Flame Sandland, these were not things ordinary people could obtain or know. Especially that secret: who else could possibly know it except the Great Emperor herself?

After all, that was something even Ye Xijun did not know!

Moreover, Yang Xiuzhu and the others firmly believed that, given Ye Xijun's character, she would not deceive them. When Ye Xijun vouched for it they had already been somewhat convinced, but the matter was weighty and they had to be cautious.

Now that they knew the Great Emperor was in Lingxiao Sect, how could they possibly refuse to join?

To be in the same sect and the same realm as the Great Emperor would be their honor—something they could only hope for!

“Good!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, then suddenly waved his hand and called out with bold enthusiasm, “Who brought good wine? Bring out a few jars—this Sect Master will drink freely with the three Seniors today!”

Yang Xiuzhu showed a strange expression and shook his hand slightly. "Sect Master, we appreciate your kindness, but we're not good at drinking—please forgive us. Besides, the great matter is not yet accomplished; if you truly wish to celebrate, wait until the day the great deed is done."

"Sect Master, the three of them are reclusive cultivators. Truly, they're not adept at this," Ye Xijun said from the side.

Yang Kai nodded in understanding and said lightly, "Very well, then. The three seniors are not only indifferent to fame and fortune but also not given to gluttony—I'm impressed!"

"Sect Master flatters me," Yang Xiuzhu said with a modest smile.

"However, I do have one thing I don't understand—please tell me, three seniors," Yang Kai's expression turned serious.

"Please speak, Sect Master. The three of us will tell you everything we know, without holding back," Yang Xiuzhu gestured.

"I want to know why Star Emperor Mountain suddenly attacked me. Is it because of our warship?" Yang Kai squinted at them. "Since you three are from Star Emperor Mountain, you must have heard something. If you can enlighten me, I would be deeply grateful!"

If it were the Battle Sky Alliance or Leitai Sect coming after him, Yang Kai could understand. After all, whether it was the earlier battle at Dragon Lair Mountain or the opening of the Imperial Garden later, Lingxiao Sect had some friction with those two sects.

And Lingxiao Sect's rapid rise had indeed threatened their standing.

If they truly wanted to strike, there were reasons, but why Star Emperor Mountain? He had no ties with Star Emperor Mountain. After thinking it over, Yang Kai could only come up with the saying: an innocent man is blamed for possessing a treasure.

"Sect Master, you're right. It's indeed because of the warship. This Void King-Grade warship carries tremendous hope—no force wouldn't want to seize it, and Star Emperor Mountain is no exception!" Saying this, Yang Xiuzhu glanced at Ye Xijun and continued, "If a sect leader remained in control of the sect, this might not have happened, but that thief is different. However..."

"However what?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"The warship is only one reason!"

"And the second?"

"From rumors I've occasionally heard, the second reason is the Great Emperor and the ancestral land," Yang Xiuzhu said gravely.

"The Great Emperor and the ancestral land?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Exactly. The Taixuan Sect ruins that Lingxiao Sect now occupies are a place the Great Emperor once stayed. As the Sect Master said, there might be other mysteries there! The thief who controls the sect now naturally wants to take a look, but he doesn't know how to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland. Since Lingxiao Sect can enter, you must have a way—what that thief schemes for is precisely that method!"

"I see!" Yang Kai said with a look of understanding.

It seemed that his offhand mention of 'other mysteries' to win them over had struck exactly the right chord—no wonder Yang Xiuzhu and the others agreed so readily. It looked like not only that person suspected more secrets in the ancestral land, but Yang Xiuzhu and the others thought so too.

But what a pity...

There are indeed secrets, but they're in the Great Emperor's sleeping place; besides Ye Xijun and himself, no one else could likely approach it.

Whether it was because of the warship or because of some supposed mystery, it ultimately came down to the Void King Realm!

The suppression of the world's laws made people yearn endlessly for higher realms, and both the warship and that alleged secret offered hope—so naturally Star Emperor Mountain would covet them.

“Now that we are here to assist Sect Master in this endeavor, that traitor surely no longer has the strength to turn the tide. However, Sect Master, you must still be cautious of the Extinction Thunder Bead. We, the more conservative faction within the sect, have never been greatly trusted, so we have no access to the Extinction Thunder Bead. Otherwise, we would have retrieved it for Sect Master already, saving you from future concerns.” Yang Xiuzhu spoke with a look of deep regret.

“Your concern is appreciated, Senior, but it’s just a single Secret Treasure. This Sect Master already has a countermeasure.” Yang Kai replied with a bright smile.

"That's good." Yang Xiuzhu nodded lightly, then as if remembering something, said, "By the way, there's one more thing the Sect Master should keep in mind."

"Please speak, senior!"

"That thief seems to have been cultivating some secret art for decades. We are ignorant and don't know exactly what he's cultivating, but spending so long suggests the art is no ordinary matter. If you ever encounter him, Sect Master, your first priority should be to preserve yourself," Yang Xiuzhu warned solemnly.

"I've noted it," Yang Kai said gravely.

"Very well. Then the three of us will take our leave and return to the sect to make arrangements for the Sect Master. You can wait here for our news; it's not too late to act afterward."

"Thank you!" Yang Kai solemnly cupped his fists.

After Yang Xiuzhu and the other two returned the salute, they quickly departed.

In the hall, Yang Kai's face lit up; he secretly thought that with Yang Xiuzhu and the others helping inside and out, this trip to Star Emperor Mountain was likely to succeed. Still, he dared not be careless—an emaciated camel is still larger than a horse; one couldn't be sure Star Emperor Mountain wouldn't play tricks in a crisis.

"Sect Master, I will take my leave as well," Ye Xijun said and departed.

Immediately, only Yang Kai, Qian Tong, and Fei Zhi Tu remained in the hall.

Elder Qian and City Lord Fei stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, their expressions strange.

"Do you two have something to say?" Yang Kai glanced at them.

"Ahem..." Qian Tong cleared his throat and earnestly asked, "Yang Kai, you said the Great Emperor himself... is in Lingxiao Sect. Is that true or false?"

Qian Tong still couldn't believe such explosive news.

It's not that he didn't trust Yang Kai—it's just that the matter was too shocking.

"What do you think, Elder Qian?" Yang Kai didn't answer but countered, wearing a mysterious look.

"How would I know? That's precisely why I'm asking you!" Qian Tong said helplessly.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed aloud.

Fei Zhi Tu said, "If that's true, then I shall join Lingxiao Sect as well."

"Old Fei, you..." Qian Tong looked at him in surprise.

“What of it? I’m just a idle City Lord anyway. Yingyue Hall won’t miss me if I’m gone, nor gain much if I stay. If I can truly enter the Great Emperor’s sect, that would be this old Fei’s greatest honor!” Fei Zhi Tu snorted.

“City Lord Fei flatters me—let’s not mention such things again! Otherwise, if the old Hall Master were to hear of it, I fear he’d fight me to the death!” Yang Kai hurriedly waved his hands.

Seeing Qian Tong also showing signs of being tempted, he was a little startled.

Winning over Yang Xiuzhu and the others pleased him, but he didn't want to poach from Yingyue Hall.

Now Lingxiao Sect not only had few disciples, but high-end combat power was severely lacking!

There were only a handful of Origin Returning Realm masters, and ninety-nine percent of them were at the first Stage—Yang Kai himself included.

Only Ye Xijun alone shouldered the burden!

If they could recruit people from Star Emperor Mountain, the situation would change; Lingxiao Sect might leap to become the top force on Dark Star!

Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance were now gone; standing in Lingxiao Sect's way was only Star Emperor Mountain. Once it was eliminated, Lingxiao Sect's position as leader would be uncontested.

This would be very beneficial for future development.

That's why Yang Kai did not hesitate to reveal the Star Emperor Token and expose the Great Emperor's existence.

He coveted Yang Xiuzhu and the others; these were reclusive cultivators, not chasing fame or profit, of pure character and not given to scheming. Once they joined Lingxiao Sect, they'd be the sect's hope and mainstay.

...

Yang Xiuzhu and the others moved with astonishing speed and efficiency.

In just two days, Ye Xijun received their message. Upon hearing it, Yang Kai immediately ordered the warship to set course for Star Emperor Mountain.

The Star Emperor Mountain range rose in towering peaks of strange beauty, its valleys thick with Spiritual Qi and shrouded in mist year-round. From a distance it looked unworldly, exquisitely magnificent.

The branch of the Taixuan Sect that took root here chose a fine place to recuperate and prosper.

People of Star Emperor Mountain seldom acted outside or meddled in external grudges; they kept to their own development, yet no one dared to underestimate them.

Among low-tier martial artists, few might know of its existence; the names they were familiar with were the top sects like the Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, Liuli Sect, and Yingyue Hall.

But among those top sects, there was still Star Emperor Mountain that even they had to look up to!

For tens of thousands of years, Star Emperor Mountain had stood as the symbol of the Dark Star's supreme martial power; no outsider ever dared set foot within a radius of one hundred thousand li.

But today the Lingxiao Sect's warship charged in proudly and boldly, without pause, straight into the mountain's heart.

At the same time, on Kaiyun Peak, crowds gathered—fully eighty percent of Star Emperor Mountain's warriors had converged here.

Except for those in seclusion or cultivating secret arts that should not be disturbed, all the other warriors were present.

Not many—only two hundred.

But if one looked closely, the lineup of those two hundred was enough to make anyone gasp.

Of these two hundred, over one hundred fifty were Origin Returning Realm experts, among them forty were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! Below the Origin Returning Realm there were only a few dozen.
