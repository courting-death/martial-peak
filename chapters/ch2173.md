## Chapter 2173 — Little Snowflake

Amidst the wind and snow, Yang Kai stood in place for a full three hours before Liu Yan finally returned from within the Ice Peak.

Seeing her mysterious expression, Yang Kai couldn't help but become curious and asked, "What did you go over there for?"

Liu Yan didn't answer, but instead called to the side, "Come out, don't be afraid!"

Where her gaze landed, there was nothing at all.

Yang Kai was puzzled, but he knew Liu Yan wouldn't play tricks on him, so he held his breath and focused his attention, carefully observing that spot.

Unfortunately, he still saw nothing. Liu Yan sighed helplessly, "Master, please wait a moment. It still seems a bit timid. I'll talk to it."

With that, Liu Yan squatted down, her beautiful eyes fixed on the snow beneath her, Divine Sense surging as if communicating with someone.

After a long while with no response, Liu Yan became a bit annoyed. Her expression darkened and she said coldly, "If you don't come out, I'll melt you!"

As soon as she finished speaking, a bulge suddenly appeared in the smooth snow, as if something was emerging from below.

Yang Kai couldn't help but widen his eyes, secretly amazed.

In no time, the snow burst apart and something shot out from beneath, turning into a stream of light that danced through the air.

Though it moved quickly, Yang Kai could still see it clearly.

It was a snowflake the size of a palm!

However, this snowflake was nothing like a common flake. It seemed to carry a wisp of spiritual energy, as though it had thoughts of its own. Flame-like patterns rippled across its surface, burning without end and warping the air around it.

"What... is this thing?" Yang Kai's eyes nearly popped out as he asked in astonishment.

Liu Yan said, "I can't say for sure, but it should be something similar to my true form!"

As she spoke, she beckoned to the snowflake. The flying snowflake immediately calmed down and floated in front of her, but no matter what, it didn't dare get too close.

Yang Kai examined the snowflake with great interest and suddenly noticed that at its center, there were faint traces of facial features—though not very clear, they were unmistakably features.

"A naturally formed wonder?" Yang Kai exclaimed in a low voice.

This snowflake was likely a unique creation of the Winter Domain's special environment, formed over countless years. In this world, perhaps no one truly knew what it was.

"You could say that," Liu Yan nodded. "But it's also a kind of ice flame! If not, I wouldn't have been able to sense its presence."

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood.

Liu Yan herself was an Artifact Spirit in human form, having devoured all sorts of heaven-and-earth flames. The essence of this snowflake was probably also a kind of heaven-and-earth flame, which was why she could sense it so keenly...

One was cold and the other hot; the two restrained each other, so the little snowflake didn't dare approach Liu Yan and was terrified of her.

"You brought it here... for what?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

By rights, Liu Yan could have easily devoured this ice flame. Although icy in nature, it had already developed intelligence, which would greatly aid Liu Yan's growth.

But she had no intention of devouring it. Instead, she deliberately brought it before Yang Kai, which showed she didn't want to use it to enhance her own strength.

"It's very familiar with this place. We can have it help us look for things!" Liu Yan smiled slightly.

"Great idea!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up at her words.

Liu Yan frowned, "But... its intelligence is very limited. Communicating is difficult, and I don't know if it will be of any use."

"It's still better than me searching aimlessly," Yang Kai grinned. "As for its usefulness, we'll know once we try."

As he spoke, he looked gently at the snowflake and said, "If there's anything good here, take me to find it."

The little snowflake remained motionless, quietly floating in midair.

Yang Kai looked embarrassed and turned to Liu Yan, "It can't understand me?"

Liu Yan covered her mouth and smiled, "It's never seen a living person before. How could it understand human speech? I can only communicate with it through Divine Sense."

As she said this, Liu Yan's Divine Sense surged and transmitted toward the little snowflake.

This time, the other party clearly understood something. It trembled slightly in midair, then suddenly shot off in a certain direction.

Yang Kai and Liu Yan exchanged glances and immediately followed.

Soon, under the little snowflake's guidance, Yang Kai and Liu Yan arrived together at a valley. On a patch of snow, the little snowflake stopped and circled around a spot repeatedly.

"There must be something good here!" Liu Yan said.

"We'll know once we check," Yang Kai said as he acted, channeling Origin Qi and sending the snow in that spot flying.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, a huge deep pit appeared, and Yang Kai, head down, searched at the bottom.

After a while, he leapt out with a look of joy, holding a spiritual herb as if carved from ice and jade.

"Not bad, not bad!" Yang Kai beamed, looking approvingly at the little snowflake. "It really is useful—much better than me searching blindly."

As if it understood Yang Kai's praise, the little snowflake circled him rapidly a few times, then landed on his shoulder, its indistinct features showing a joyful expression.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that its mind must be very simple. Born in the Winter Domain and never having encountered other living beings, its spirit was as pure as a blank sheet of paper. Otherwise, how could a casual compliment make it so happy?

"Do a good job, or I'll melt you!" Liu Yan played the villain at the right moment, her pretty face cold and murderous intent evident. The little snowflake trembled in fear, hid behind Yang Kai, clung to his shoulder, and peeked out timidly at Liu Yan.

Yang Kai couldn't help but glare at Liu Yan, who stuck out her tongue at him. Their eyes met, and everything was understood without words.

After a moment, Yang Kai's eyes turned as he said, "Have it take me to the most precious thing here, and don't miss any treasures along the way."

Liu Yan nodded and used Divine Sense to convey Yang Kai's meaning.

The little snowflake received the order and immediately darted out to lead the way.

With such a naturally formed wonder leading, Yang Kai truly saved a lot of trouble. He didn't need to search deliberately; in this snowy land, any heaven-and-earth treasure couldn't escape the little snowflake's detection. Whenever it circled a spot, Yang Kai knew there must be something good beneath the snow.

Along the way, Yang Kai's Spatial Ring filled with many ice-attribute spiritual herbs and rare plants, all of Dao Origin-Grade, and even some Imperial-Grade spiritual herbs.

The special environment of the Winter Domain created excellent conditions for growth. Many spiritual herbs and miraculous medicines had gone undiscovered since their birth, only now being collected by Yang Kai under the little snowflake's guidance.

Every herb and miraculous medicine they found was at least ten thousand years old!

Yang Kai gained a huge harvest!

And as they traveled, the little snowflake seemed to grow more familiar with Yang Kai, no longer as timid as at first. Like a newborn child, it was full of curiosity about a living being like Yang Kai, often circling him and observing from different angles.

However, because Liu Yan kept playing the villain along the way, threatening it from time to time, the little snowflake naturally both respected and feared her. Wherever Liu Yan was, it didn't dare approach within ten zhang.

As a result, Yang Kai and Liu Yan had to keep some distance between them.

Although he gained a lot, Yang Kai was a bit disappointed that he still hadn't obtained the Calamity Fruit!

He had acquired several things even rarer than the Calamity Fruit, but the thing he wanted most was still nowhere to be found.

He knew such things couldn't be rushed and could only go with the flow.

A few days later, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, his eyes filled with surprise as he looked ahead.

Not far ahead lay a sparkling lake spanning dozens of mu, ringed by high mountains and breathtaking scenery.

What shocked him most was that this lake showed no signs of freezing.

Large snowflakes fell from the sky, but as soon as they touched the lake's surface, they melted, as if the lake possessed some mysterious power that kept it from ever freezing, no matter how cold it got.

The water was crystal clear, and Yang Kai could even see some strange fish swimming freely below.

Judging by the rows of sharp fangs in their mouths, it was clear these fish were not to be trifled with.

Upon reaching the place, the little snowflake stopped and kept circling Yang Kai, conveying a strange emotion.

After so much time together, Yang Kai had learned to guess its thoughts from its behavior. Seeing this, he asked thoughtfully, "Are you saying the most precious thing is at the bottom of the lake?"

As soon as he spoke, the little snowflake bobbed up and down, as if nodding.

Yang Kai was certain and nodded, "I'll go take a look!"

"Master, be very careful!" Liu Yan reminded him with concern.

Yang Kai nodded, leapt forward, and after observing the area, dove straight into the lake.

As a martial artist like him, he didn't need to worry about his clothes getting wet. He simply channeled Origin Qi to form a protective layer around his body, allowing him to move freely underwater.

The might of the Dao Origin Realm spread out, and the fish scattered in all directions.

Though the fish at the bottom of the lake looked fierce and terrifying, they actually weren't very strong and naturally didn't dare approach.

The little snowflake hadn't followed, so Yang Kai didn't know exactly where the so-called most precious thing was. But heading toward the center was probably right, so he explored the surroundings as he swam toward the lake's center.

On the shore, Liu Yan quietly watched, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai, ready to rush to his aid at any moment. The little snowflake hovered more than ten zhang away from her, its indistinct features full of worry, occasionally flitting about uneasily.
