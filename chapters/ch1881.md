## Chapter 1881 — Spiritual Qi Weaving

"All right, everyone, go back now. Purple Star has suffered a great upheaval; Zi Long is dead, and since Donglai went with him he's likely faring poorly as well. Purple Star cannot be leaderless—henceforth Purple Star will be led by..." he said, scanning the crowd as he spoke.

Gongsun Liang straightened his chest at once.

"Let Wuji take command, with you all assisting and following orders." Kuang Shizong said, looking at Gongsun Liang, "Your Yuan Qi was badly injured this time—it's better you go into seclusion to recover."

"Yes!" Although his face showed reluctance, Gongsun Liang did not resist; he could only reply in a low voice. After all, Kuang Shizong was not wrong: after his battle with Yang Kai his foundation had been damaged, and if he did not recuperate properly he might leave hidden troubles, even suffer a decline in cultivation.

Compared to the position of Purple Star's lord, personal strength was naturally more important.

"Disciple thanks Patriarch. I will spare no effort to lead Purple Star to glory!" Zi Wuji, though bruised and pale, cried out with resolve.

No matter how one looked at it, this outcome was what he wanted most; though the road had been bumpy, he had ultimately achieved his goal.

......

In the space crevice, the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship sailed slowly, surrounded by chaotic spatial currents; Yang Kai still stood on the deck, his Spatial Force surging and wrapping the entire vessel, preventing it from being swallowed by the turbulence.

Spatial turbulence was the most chaotic form of Spatial Force; unless a martial artist like Yang Kai channeled and guided it, anything that plunged into it would be torn apart—its chaos was enough to reduce a Third Stage of the Void King Realm to pieces.

After the initial panic, those aboard the warship gradually calmed; rather than remaining fearful, their curiosity fired up and they eagerly began to inspect the surroundings.

After all, not everyone had the chance to enter a space crevice, much less do so without a care in the world.

Unfortunately, there was nothing to be seen inside the crevice, which left them a little disappointed.

After a brief period of novelty, their curiosity waned and everyone went about their own business.

After a long while, the warship gave a hum, and then light filtered in from outside; the countless stars returned to everyone's sight.

The warship had reentered the Star Domain.

Yang Kai's figure swayed and he appeared among the crowd; his face was a little pale and his body staggered.

"Brother Yang!" Shen Tu was quick and steady and hurriedly helped Yang Kai up.

"It's nothing!" Yang Kai gestured, "Just a bit of exhaustion—I'll be fine in a few days."

He had never before guided an entire warship through a space rift. Although his mastery of spatial power had reached a new height, doing such a thing still placed heavy demands on him—especially after using the Extinction Thunder Bead.

Still, the experience clarified his limits with spatial power, so he had gained something from it.

"Then hurry and rest. I'll take care of things here," Shen Tu urged.

Hua Youmeng and the others likewise watched him with concern.

Yang Kai nodded. "It should be safe now. You can navigate carefully; if anything happens, I'll appear."

"Don't worry, Brother Yang—Li Nuo, arrange a cabin for Brother Yang at once." Shen Tu said, looking to Li Nuo.

"Sir, follow me please." Li Nuo said as she led the way.

Although Origin-Grade Upper-Level warships belonged to the major powers, this particular Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship was Shen Tu's personal vessel and represented the Hengluo Commerce Guild; its interior was thus extremely luxurious. Li Nuo guided Yang Kai into the best cabin and then bowed and withdrew.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the bed and casually scanned the room; he realized the Spiritual Qi inside the chamber was extraordinarily dense, likely due to the arrangement of some formation.

Superior incense had been burned in the cabin; its aroma entered the nose and soothed and calmed the spirit.

Yang Kai reached into his Spatial Ring, took out a Spiritual Pill, popped it into his mouth and swallowed; he dissolved its effects while circulating his cultivation and adjusting his breathing.

Time drifted by.

About six days later, Yang Kai was fully recovered.

The near-exhaustion of his potential in the space crevice had given him another layer of insight into using spatial power, so after recovering he continued to contemplate it.

Several more days passed before Yang Kai wore an expression of deep thought and a faint smile appeared on his face.

He released his Divine Sense; the warship sailed steadily through the Starry Sky while those aboard performed their duties and all was peaceful.

The warship's final destination was the Hengluo Commerce Guild's main star, Shuiyue Star, which was also one of Yang Kai's objectives on this trip, so he decided to remain where he was.

He wondered what expression Xue Yue would wear when he saw her on Shuiyue Star.

Thinking of Xue Yue, Yang Kai also thought of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, and then of Shan Qingluo...

He sighed long and deep; guilt filled Yang Kai's heart...

He drove away the dark thoughts in his mind, formed hand seals and set down a restriction in his cabin, then took out the Xuan Realm Pearl and slipped inside.

In fact, on Purple Star he could have used the Xuan Realm Pearl to take Shen Tu and the others away—that would have been the most convenient and fastest method.

But he did not do so; the existence of the Xuan Realm Pearl was too heaven-defying, the pearl contained its own world within, and the fewer people knew of it the better.

Even though his strength had risen and almost no one in the Star Domain could kill him now, one should always exercise caution; if someone noticed the Xuan Realm Pearl's existence, the losses would far outweigh the gains.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl it was tranquil.

The Stone Puppet was still devouring the Sun's True Fire. Yang Kai approached and pulled out all the precious minerals he had taken from Purple Star's Treasure Vault, then tossed them before the Stone Puppet.

The Stone Puppet's black-bean eyes widened and flashed with divine light; it rushed over, grabbed a piece of ore in each hand and stuffed them vigorously into its mouth.

It showed no chewing motion; the minerals vanished into its belly and its abdomen did not swell, as if another world existed within its stomach.

In a short while, all the minerals had disappeared.

The Stone Puppet looked at Yang Kai like a begging child, wearing a face of unsatisfied desire.

Yang Kai laughed. "That's all there is. Go and refine them."

Though not numerous, those minerals were all treasures kept in Purple Star's Treasure Vault; each piece was priceless, and feeding them to the little devourer would aid its growth.

The Stone Puppet was easy to please; hearing this it scratched its head, gave Yang Kai a simple grin and ran off to refine them contentedly.

Yang Kai turned his gaze to the other side.

There a Void King-Grade refining furnace stood quietly on the ground—it was the Fire Bird Liu Yan's life-origin Secret Treasure and the source of her birth.

From the refining furnace came the Fire Bird's cries; now and then a towering burst of flame exploded from the furnace. Those flames not only contained the Sun's True Fire the Fire Bird had devoured, but also the power of Qiantian Thunderflame and the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame.

It was apparent the Fire Bird was striving to fuse the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai's arrival, the Fire Bird poked its head from the refining furnace, glanced at him, then buried its head and continued its work.

"It should be fine!" Yang Kai nodded slightly; the Fire Bird still had time to take a look at him, clearly handling things with ease.

He shifted and came to a secluded spot.

Here was the herb garden where he had planted countless Spiritual Herbs—the garden he had excavated earlier contained rare medicinal materials brought out from the Lost Realm; many once-extinct spirit flowers and strange herbs thrived here, a scene of vigorous growth.

A rich medicinal aroma drifted about, refreshing and enlightening.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, took out several items from his Spatial Ring and laid them out one by one.

The first was a transparent crystal.

An Earth Vein crystal!

It was one of the three most valuable treasures Yang Kai had taken from Purple Star's Treasure Vault. After observing the Earth Vein crystal for a moment, he did not hesitate to toss it beside the herb garden.

The Earth Vein crystal sank into the ground as if it were nothing when it touched the soil.

In the next instant a towering burst of Heaven-and-Earth Energy erupted; centered on the herb garden, within a radius of one hundred zhang the density of Spiritual Qi surged by many times.

From the ground, threadlike streams rose and danced, swirling between heaven and earth and instantly filling the area around them.

"Spiritual Qi weaving into threads!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up and his expression grew excited.

Heaven-and-Earth Energy was invisible and formless; under normal circumstances it could not be seen with the naked eye. Only when Spiritual Qi became dense enough could one visually perceive it.

The mists hanging over great mountains and rivers might look like clouds, but they were actually accumulations of Heaven-and-Earth Energy that greatly benefited a cultivator's practice.

Yet they still could not compare to Spiritual Qi weaving into threads.

Spiritual Qi transformed into threads represented another form of concentrated Heaven-and-Earth Energy—far purer and far more surging.

Those threads of spirit light were the purest essence of Heaven and Earth. Yang Kai reached out and caught one between his fingers; with the slightest circulation of his technique—and hardly any effort at all—the thread vanished in his palm. In its place, a warm current surged up from his hand, flowed into his dantian, and quietly settled there as part of his own strength.

Countless strands drifted about, making that patch of land resemble an immortal realm, wondrous beyond description.

The strands settled upon the rare flowers and strange herbs, causing them to sway as if rejoicing.

Yang Kai had not expected placing the Earth Vein crystal there would produce such a phenomenon; his intent had been simple—to temper the garden's medicinal materials and to create a good environment for his own cultivation.

Yet the result far exceeded his expectations.

The Earth Vein crystal lived up to its reputation: such a small piece could nurture so vast an energy—truly a terrifying thing.

Yang Kai observed for a while and discovered that the transformed area covered only a span of about a hundred zhang. Yet within this hundred zhang, it was nothing short of a cultivator’s paradise—no spiritual land anywhere could compare to it.
