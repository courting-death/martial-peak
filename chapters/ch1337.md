## Chapter 1337 — Fallen Emperor Mountains

Taking the opportunity, Yang Kai sized up the martial artists who had rushed here with Fei Zhi Tu: three Origin Returning Realm cultivators. One, a middle-aged man about Fei Zhi Tu's age, was in the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the other two were in the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, an old man and an old woman.

Although those two were only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, their auras were deep and far-reaching, by no means comparable to someone who had just broken through. They had clearly dwelt in that realm for many years, their strength abundant.

The arrival of these Origin Returning Realm experts put Yang Kai's mind at ease a little. It seemed Fei Zhi Tu had indeed made preparations; assembling so many Origin Returning Realm cultivators secretly under the current circumstances could not have been easy.

After all, the rescue of Qian Tong was his undertaking alone, making it inconvenient to pull people from Yingyue Hall, and the operation required secrecy. Having so many Origin Returning Realm participants was beyond Yang Kai's expectations. Besides, with a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert leading the group, safety should be less of a concern; the real worry was whether the ancient ruins hid some unseen danger.

After politely speaking with Cai He and the others, Fei Zhi Tu smiled and said, "It seems you youngsters have already met one another, which is good. On this trip each of you will have your part to play; knowing each other beforehand makes cooperation easier. Whether this mission succeeds or fails, this City Lord will remember the favor you’ve shown today. When you return and report to your Family Head, if there is ever a time you need Fei, just give the word."

On hearing this, Cai He, Du Sisi and Lian Guang all showed a flash of delight and quickly offered thanks.

"Alright, since everyone is here, let us be on our way!" Fei Zhi Tu waved his large hand, manifested an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Star Shuttle and took the lead.

Yang Kai had thought he would introduce the other three Origin Returning Realm cultivators, but Fei Zhi Tu had no such intention. After a brief pause, Yang Kai hurriedly invoked his own Star Shuttle and followed.

While chatting with Cai He earlier, Yang Kai had already learned that their sole purpose in entering those ancient ruins was to rescue Qian Tong. Where exactly the ancient ruins were, however, Fei Zhi Tu had not revealed a word.

Now that everyone had gathered, he still offered no explanation. Yang Kai grumbled inwardly but did not press the matter; he simply followed behind and hurried onward.

The three Origin Returning Realm cultivators accompanying Fei Zhi Tu seemed very interested in Yang Kai, frequently casting glances and probing with Divine Sense. The old man in particular, on one occasion when Yang Kai could not help looking back, nodded at him with a smiling, kindly air, which puzzled Yang Kai greatly — he could not tell what the man had in mind.

The Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator and the old woman did not show such overt friendliness, but they too behaved in a pleasant and familiar manner.

Although Yang Kai understood these three harbored no obvious ill intent, he nevertheless felt a prickling unease. He kept his mouth shut and pressed on; for him, avoiding trouble was best. He had many matters on his plate — if Qian Tong had not run into trouble, he would not have left Dragon Lair Mountain and would have returned to seclusion to continue refining his secret techniques.

Ever since the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit awakened, the efficiency of refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl had greatly increased. What had originally been expected to take years to complete had been shortened considerably, and Yang Kai longed to get behind closed doors and fully unleash the refining furnace to finish those treasures.

The eight of them traveled in silence. At first Cai He still tried to court Du Sisi with jocular remarks, but after being rebuffed he wisely stopped pestering the fair lady.

After flying forward continuously for four days, when a vast mountain range appeared ahead—stretching across the land like a slumbering dragon—Fei Zhi Tu suddenly turned and dove downward.

The remaining seven naturally followed closely.

After a short while the group descended to the outskirts of the mountain range. Fei Zhi Tu produced a yellowed beast-skin map from his Spatial Ring and examined it closely.

"Isn't this the Fallen Emperor Mountains?" Cai He clicked his tongue in astonishment. "Could the ancient ruins be hidden in the Fallen Emperor Mountains?"

"Impossible. Countless people come to Fallen Emperor Mountains each year; even you and I have been here several times. If there truly were ancient ruins, how could not a single rumor have leaked out?" Du Sisi shook her head slowly.

As the two conversed, Yang Kai observed the so-called Fallen Emperor Mountains. He had never heard of the range before and had never come here, so he had no say. From where he stood the mountains stretched on for who knew how many li, lush with vegetation, yet oddly silent — not even a chirp of insects or a birdcall could be heard.

Moreover, there was no trace of any beasts or flying creatures to be seen, which filled him with doubt.

"Heh heh, young friend, is this your first time on the Fallen Emperor Mountains?" Just as Yang Kai's doubts heightened, the old man stepped to his side, stroked his graying beard and asked with a smile.

"Yes, I am indeed here for the first time." Yang Kai frowned; he could not fathom why the man had taken the initiative to speak.

"No wonder," the old man replied, changing tack with a smile. "This old fellow is Ning Xiangchen!" Yang Kai's suspicion rose, but he returned the courtesy — the man's age commanded respect.

The old man then pointed out the old woman and the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator and introduced them to Yang Kai. Both greeted him with broad smiles and praised the youth's promise.

The overt goodwill from these Origin Returning Realm masters naturally surprised Cai He and the others, who did not understand why so many experts showed favor to Yang Kai. Du Sisi looked especially put out, as if Yang Kai had stolen her thunder.

"Sirs, what is so unusual about the Fallen Emperor Mountains?" Yang Kai seized the lull in conversation to change the topic. He had by now guessed these three Origin Returning Realm cultivators must want something from him; otherwise they would not have lowered themselves to be so friendly.

Whatever they intended to ask of him, it would surely be troublesome. Yang Kai had no intention of letting them lead the conversation.

At his question Ning Xiangchen's expression suddenly grew solemn and he replied with a question of his own: "Do you know why this place is called the Fallen Emperor Mountains?"

Yang Kai frowned and pondered, then asked suspiciously, "Could it be connected to the legendary Starry Sky Emperor?"

Ning Xiangchen couldn't help but show a trace of approval, and the old woman smiled and said, "Correct — this place is indeed associated with the Starry Sky Emperor, for legend says this is where the Emperor fell!"

Yang Kai's face changed and he exclaimed, "Really?"

Ning Xiangchen laughed softly. "Whether that is true no one can prove, but the Fallen Emperor Mountains do possess a faint trace of Imperial Might that is known to all."

"Imperial Might?" Yang Kai knit his brows.

“You’ve seen it yourself—there are no birds or beasts in these Falling Emperor Mountains. It’s not that this place is unfit for them to live in; on the contrary, the scenery is beautiful, the waters are clear, and the Spiritual Qi is abundant. It would even be suitable as the foundation for a sect. Yet not only are there no sects established here, but not even Demonic Beasts exist within these mountains. The reason is that the entire Falling Emperor Mountains are shrouded by the power of Imperial Might! This formless Imperial Might covers the whole range, growing stronger the closer one moves toward the center. Those birds and beasts simply cannot survive long under such pressure—hence, you see none here.”

"Indeed, long ago Fallen Emperor Mountains were coveted by a fairly powerful sect that wished to establish a base here, but even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert could not remain inside the mountains for long. Under the subtle influence of Imperial Might, no matter how strong you are, you end up in a mad, tragic fate!" the old woman took up the explanation.

"Imperial Might is so formidable?" Yang Kai was astonished.

"Don't underestimate Imperial Might. I once came here to cultivate; had I not left in time I might have suffered Qi Deviation," said the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator solemnly.

"You can still cultivate here?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

"Heh heh, that's precisely what we came to tell you, young friend. Yes, Fallen Emperor Mountains contain Imperial Might, making it unsuitable for living creatures to stay long, and the closer to the center the stronger it is. What exactly lies at the very center remains unknown, but this place is ideally suited for tempering Divine Sense power. Every year many cultivators come specifically to use the Imperial Might here to train their Divine Sense. Moreover, Imperial Might aids comprehension of Shi," the old man continued. "Young friend, I see remarkable talent in you. One day you'll advance into the Origin Returning Realm; when that time comes, you should come to the Fallen Emperor Mountains to grasp the power of shi — you'll find cultivation here doubly effective."

"Indeed, among Origin Returning Realm cultivators on Dark Star, six out of ten have come to the Fallen Emperor Mountains to form their own Shi. Though unverified, the Shi formed here seems a degree stronger than what one normally attains. Young friend, don't miss this singular opportunity!"

"Such a boon!" Yang Kai was greatly surprised and straightened, cupping his fist respectfully. "Thank you, sirs, for the explanation. If that day comes, I will certainly come to the Fallen Emperor Mountains to temper my Shi."

Even if Yang Kai would have learned of such opportunities elsewhere, he felt obliged to show some gratitude for their kindness.

"You're welcome, you're welcome!" Ning Xiangchen chuckled. "If you need an escort when that time comes, simply inform this old man and I will do my utmost."

The old woman and the other Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator echoed the offer, which made Yang Kai even more certain they sought a favor. He hastily declined and deflected the matter.
