## Chapter 2080 — Patch the Leak

At the stretch of the wall where Yang Kai stood, the warriors were stunned for a moment, but because Yang Kai had warned them in time they had some mental preparation; after a brief pause, even more violent secret techniques and martial skills were hurled outward, plunged into the Demonic Qi, and vanished.

Yang Kai's ten fingers danced; under the control of his Divine Sense, strands of Golden Blood Threads moved as if extensions of his limbs, coiling and writhing like dragons and snakes, stirring up sheets of golden light within the pitch-black Demonic Qi.

Most of Fenglin City's defensive formations were one-way, meaning that when these formations were activated, attacks from outside were blocked, but attacks from inside could ignore the formation's protection and blast outward.

The defenses of most cities were of this type; there were also two-way formations, but such formations were never lightly used unless absolutely necessary.

Once used, it meant the city had reached its last line of defense; after those formations were activated, the city's warriors could no longer strike outward and could only sit and wait for death.

Shing, shing—the golden light flashed, and before the wall the ferocious demonic beasts and demonic humans were torn apart, reduced to countless scraps of flesh and clots of blood, scattering down from the sky.

In an instant, an empty zone appeared ten or so zhang in front of Yang Kai.

Those demonic beasts and demonic humans, corrupted by the Ancient Great Demon's Demonic Qi, were not actually weak; each physical body had been greatly strengthened, their natures had turned violent, and they could still use many of the abilities they had in life—if they fought warriors of equal rank, they would be certain to win.

But… Yang Kai was, after all, at the Dao Origin Realm!

Before being corrupted these beasts and demonic humans had been unimpressive, at most at the Void King Realm, so under the furious dance of the Golden Blood Threads they proved as fragile as tofu.

The nearby warriors were greatly encouraged by this and all displayed their signature moves, launching fierce attacks outward.

For a time, the section of wall Yang Kai was responsible for seemed impregnable; those around him grew even more confident.

Yang Kai's expression, however, grew grave, for the number of those beasts and demonic humans was truly too great—so many that the eye could not see an edge; they hid themselves within the pitch-black Demonic Qi and, when the qi rolled, seized the moment to strike.

With a single mistake, the wall's defensive formation would be worn down considerably and its luster would dim.

As his ten fingers flew, Yang Kai suddenly grasped the truth.

He suddenly understood why on the previous day only Demonic Qi had been seen surrounding the city, while by the second day countless demonic humans and demonic beasts had appeared.

Obviously the ancient Demonic Qi that had dispersed earlier was corrupting the various living things around Fenglin City, which was why no beasts or demonic humans had been visible on the first day.

At this point it was likely that no living thing near Fenglin City had been spared—only the full range of the calamity remained unknown.

While he concentrated on holding back the demonic things, the Transmission Compass on his chest suddenly trembled; his face changed and he quickly took the compass out to check its message.

"The situation at the southwest corner has changed—Brother Yang, hurry to aid!"

The Transmission Compass carried the city lord Duan Yuanshan's command!

Yang Kai pocketed the compass and turned to look toward the southwest corner, but it was too far to see anything; he could only make out unusually dense Demonic Qi there, and could faintly hear a roar.

Just as he watched, a figure suddenly flashed past his side. The man had barely appeared before he hurriedly called out, "Brother Yang, go on — leave this stretch of the wall to this old man!"

The speaker was none other than Fenglin City's deputy lord, the Drunken Old Man!

At those words, the Drunken Old Man abruptly took down the green gourd at his waist, gulped a mouthful of strong liquor, then formed hand seals as his face flushed red.

The next moment he puffed his cheeks and spat violently forward.

Boundless Blazing Flame spewed from his mouth, rolling outward; the fire carried an unimaginably scorching force—any demonic human or beast touched by it screamed and retreated, but no matter how hard they tried they could not extinguish the flames on their bodies, and within three breaths they became charred corpses.

The nauseating stench of burnt flesh spread everywhere.

That was not all; the Drunken Old Man tilted his head and the flames swayed with him, forming a wall of blazing fire more than thirty zhang long before the city.

The blaze reached the heavens, illuminating the nine skies, as if trying to burn the very firmament red.

The demonic things all retreated, no longer daring to approach.

The Drunken Old Man drew a breath and swayed slightly; that move had been a fierce blow even for him and could not be used lightly again.

Yang Kai nodded at the Drunken Old Man and then his figure flickered away from where he stood.

He had been on the eastern side of the city and the southwest corner was far off, but for Yang Kai—who could employ spatial secret arts—he could arrive in no time.

In a few flickers, Yang Kai—without regard for the consumption of Origin Qi—had already reached the southwest corner.

His eyes narrowed at the sight before him.

At that spot the defensive formation on the wall had been broken open, a hole several zhang across, and the rolling Demonic Qi flowed in like a cat picking up the scent of fish; many of the demonic creatures hid within the Qi and, once they slipped onto the wall, attacked the nearby warriors.

Dozens of corpses already lay on the ground, and wisps of Demonic Qi slithered like spiritual snakes into their mouths and noses.

In front of the hole, a white-haired elder held a Jade Scepter and kept swinging it; with each swing mysterious light shot from the Jade Scepter, slicing those demonic things that tried to sneak past into powder.

The old man emanated the unique aura of a Dao Origin Realm expert! His Origin Qi surged and his robes snapped in the wind.

On the wall, countless warriors were jointly resisting the invading Demonic Qi and monsters—the scene was in utter chaos.

The moment Yang Kai arrived he wasted no words and invoked his Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level long-sword Secret Treasure, urging forth the Undying Five Elements Sword qi; the long sword in his hand traced out blooming sword-flowers and he thrust downward.

Whoosh, whoosh…

Multicolored sword light descended from the sky, covering a vast area.

Within that area, every invading demonic thing was struck by sword qi—some split in two, others were grievously wounded, roaring in rage.

Even more sword qi swept toward the intact corpses lying on the ground.

Pfft, pfft, pfft…

When the sword qi faded, those intact corpses erupted with explosive sounds, each one blown to powder!

Many warriors who witnessed this froze, then turned and glared angrily at Yang Kai.

After all, among those corpses were their relatives, their friends, comrades who had fought beside them.

To be slain by demonic things was one matter, but for their corpses not to remain whole—and worse, to be destroyed by their own people—how could they tolerate it?

"If you don't want more demonic things to be born, then destroy all the corpses! This Demonic Qi does not only corrupt the living; it will not spare the dead!" Yang Kai roared to dispel their misunderstanding.

At those words some showed relief, but many still harbored doubts.

After all, the dead could not be brought back to life; even if the ancient Demonic Qi was mysterious beyond measure, how could it make the dead stand again?

That doubt did not last long, for one corpse that should have been dead suddenly rose slowly, wrapped in Demonic Qi; its reopened eyes showed no trace of white, only a deep crimson-black.

"What this gentleman says is indeed correct—quickly destroy the remaining corpses!" someone shouted.

No one dared hesitate further; they all struck to destroy the corpses around them on the spot.

The revived demonic human had not yet had a chance to take in his reborn world before Yang Kai cleaved off his head with a single strike, and he toppled backward.

Yang Kai spun and struck again; radiance bloomed and sword qi streaked across the sky.

Whoosh…

The sword light swept through, and more than half of the demonic things were shredded to pieces.

"I'll leave the rest to you!" Yang Kai said, then leapt up into the air toward the white-haired elder.

The crisis at the southwest wall ultimately stemmed from that broken defensive formation—so long as the hole was not sealed, an endless stream of Demonic Qi and monsters would pour in.

Not far off, a Formation Master was already working hard to mend it, but it seemed they still needed some time.

The old man alone could not keep guard at the hole; from time to time a few slipped through the gaps in his attacks and crept into the city, throwing the warriors below into disorder.

From the look of the elder, he was also running low on strength; constantly unleashing the Jade Scepter's power had put him under crushing pressure, and his face had grown a little pale.

"Sir, I'll help you!" Yang Kai flashed to the elder's side; as soon as he finished speaking his long sword trembled and, in a blur, countless sword lights erupted from its tip and shot into the hole.

In an instant the Demonic Qi and monsters gathered at the hole suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat.

The old man, pleased, hurriedly said, "Qin thanks you, Young Brother!"

He truly was at his last breath; standing alone here had consumed him greatly—if Yang Kai had arrived any later he very likely would have died of exhaustion.

As he spoke he stepped back half a pace, letting Yang Kai take the lead.

Yang Kai, seeing this, did not shirk; witnessing the Demonic Qi and monsters gearing up to renew their assault, his face grew cold and he reached forward with his hand.

Spatial Force surged and a black, pitch-dark hole suddenly appeared at the breach, sealing the opening tight.

Spatial secret art, banishment!

All the Demonic Qi and monsters pouring into the breach rushed into the black hole and were swallowed clean in the blink of an eye, without the slightest leakage.

Although the black hole lasted for less than ten breaths before collapsing, that strange secret art nevertheless instilled a thread of terror in the remaining demonic things, and for a time none dared advance.
