## Chapter 902 — Try Your Luck

"I'm not entirely sure either." The Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon shrugged. "Maybe it's related to the Beast Soul Technique he cultivates."

Until a few days ago, the Great Lord had never really understood why Yang Kai carried yao qi; it wasn't until witnessing the Beast Soul Technique that a plausible explanation finally presented itself.

But whether that was truly the cause, the Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon couldn't say for certain.

"Beast Soul Technique? What kind of Beast Soul Technique is it?" The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox widened his eyes and demanded, "Show this old ox when you cast it."

He behaved as if he were one of them—easygoing and unassuming. Yang Kai smiled slightly and did not refuse; with a casual motion he manifested the White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal.

At the sight of the magnificent, lifelike White Tiger and Divine Ox, the great yao lord's eyes widened in an instant, his excitement uncontrollable.

The Divine Ox lineage now had but one outstanding scion, and sensing his ancestor's essence within Yang Kai's Beast Soul Technique naturally stirred him deeply.

He threw an arm over Yang Kai's shoulder and slapped his back with a palm like a fan, slapping so hard it was almost affectionate. "Kiddo, come visit my territory sometime—let us get properly acquainted."

Yang Kai was nearly smacked into coughing blood.

The Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon chuckled. "There really is your ancestor's will hidden in his Beast Soul Technique. If you study it carefully, Old Ox, it may benefit you greatly. But this brat is a bit greedy—get ready to be fleeced, ha ha ha!"

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox's face darkened; he muttered a few words and then released Yang Kai.

But after hearing the Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon say that, Yang Kai finally understood why the other had abruptly changed his attitude and tried to get close to him — he wanted to probe the profound intent embodied within Yang Kai’s Beast Soul Technique.

The Thunder Dragon had deliberately said it aloud—clearly a warning, not wanting Yang Kai kept in the dark.

"Enough idle talk. If you want to get close, you can negotiate after this matter is settled." The Great Lord wore a grave expression. "Old Ox, let me introduce you properly. This kid is the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—Yang Kai!"

"Oh? So you're the new Saint Lord." The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox glanced at Yang Kai and his expression finally took on some gravity.

"This woman by his side is his subordinate, the demon Li Rong. We'll need her power to unravel the mystery inside. Old Ox, don't acts recklessly once you enter."

"Understood." The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox nodded solemnly.

The Great Lord looked at Yang Kai with a serious air. "One more thing: are you sure you want to go in, rather than wait outside for us? You must understand the place is dangerous—if something happens, Old Ox and I may not be able to help you. You might only slow down that woman beside you; the two of you could end up in a bad way."

"Great Lord, rest assured. I will take care of myself; you needn't worry."

The Thunder Dragon frowned. Seeing Yang Kai insist on going in, he sighed and stopped urging further. "So be it."

With no more words, the two Great Yao Lords turned to stare at the rift in the void ten li away, their eyes unblinking as though waiting for the perfect moment.

The hundred-zhang-long rift gaped like the maw of a beast and was extremely unstable. Erratic energy ripples issued from within; if one did not choose the precise moment to enter, chaos could erupt upon crossing the threshold.

Yang Kai's mind silently extended toward the rift, probing into the void.

Unlike the two Great Yao Lords, he had studied the mysteries of space deeply—able to tear open spatial fabric himself and having spent long stretches immersed in spatial turbulence.

Soon Yang Kai discovered with surprise that beyond the rift there were traces of turbulent streams; it was precisely these currents that made the entrance so unstable.

His divine sense, like a tidal hand, smoothed the chaotic eddies. Gradually, the unstable rift steadied.

The Thunder Dragon's eyes brightened; without hesitation he barked, "Go!"

At those words, he lunged toward the rift.

The others hurried to follow.

After a few breaths, the six of them dove into the void rift.

Among the six, Yang Kai alone was a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm; the remaining five were all in the Saint Realm.

The two Great Yao Lords each brought a Second Stage Saint Realm expert, plus Li Rong.

The Thunder Dragon's companion was naturally Caidie, while the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox followed a yao expert named Jin Ni; Yang Kai guessed his true form to be a Nine-Nether Golden Ni Beast, exuding an unbreakable, sharp metal aura.

The lineup was formidable—clear evidence of how seriously the two Great Lords took this matter.

Once inside the rift, darkness surrounded them. In divine sense probing, everyone felt as if they were wading through a swamp; their feet seemed to sink into mire, slowing each step and tugging them downward.

From all directions came chaotic energy waves, pressing in like mountains.

Each person activated their own power to resist the external pressure.

Yang Kai, however, walked calmly, unaffected.

He had seen this environment before when tearing open space—the transitional space into which he entered felt exactly the same.

Having spent much time here, he knew this terrain better than anyone present.

"Old Ox, do you remember which direction we took last time?" The Thunder Dragon asked in a low voice, unwilling to act rashly.

"How should I know? It's pitch black here; there's nothing to navigate by. I'm terrible with directions, useless in a place like this." The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox bellowed.

"What about Caidie and Jin Ni? Do either of you remember?" the Thunder Dragon asked the other two.

Both shook their heads, indicating they could not recall.

"This space is chaotic; even if you remember the direction, it might not be valid now," Yang Kai said urgently.

The Thunder Dragon's heart sank. Last time they'd found a bit of a bright opening and entered through it into a strange place; he had assumed the same would happen now, but it wasn't so.

Just entering the rift had already presented problems; the Thunder Dragon and Earth-Splitting Divine Ox looked grim, sensing their journey would be fraught with peril.

"Follow me!" Yang Kai suddenly waved them on and sprinted decisively in one direction.

Li Rong immediately followed without question, her demon yuan still enveloping Yang Kai to guard him.

The other four yao experts hesitated, frozen in place, unsure whether to trust him.

"What do we do?" The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox asked toward the Thunder Dragon. "You're the one who gathered these people—say something. We can still turn back."

The Thunder Dragon's expression twisted with difficulty; he could not decide quickly.

He didn't know what confidence Yang Kai rode on, yet Yang Kai had already bolted in that direction. The space here truly was chaotic; if they charged there and couldn't find an exit, they might be trapped forever in the rift.

"Say something!" The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox lost patience and urged him on.

"Go!" The Thunder Dragon gritted his teeth. "That kid seems sure of himself—he must have found something."

So saying, he and Caidie pursued after Yang Kai.

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox sniffed, hesitated, then followed cursing, "Damn it—if we die this time it’s all that Thunder Dragon bastard's fault."

Yang Kai and Li Rong walked in front, purposely slowing their pace. In short order, the two Great Yao Lords and their companions caught up.

"Kid, do you actually have confidence? Don't lead us into a dead end." The Thunder Dragon asked anxiously.

"Heh, just trying our luck." Yang Kai replied with a smile.

The Thunder Dragon's face darkened; he felt thoroughly duped and bitterly regretted it.

But it was too late to return—the shifting space here was treacherous, and heading back would mean losing the way entirely.

He trudged along behind Yang Kai, resolved to follow whatever path they took.

Soon he noticed something strange. The space was in chaos as if countless pockets had been shattered and overlaid, creating eddies from every direction.

Yet wherever Yang Kai passed, those chaotic energies smoothed, allowing the six to walk as if on solid ground with no sense of being pulled or disoriented.

The Thunder Dragon's eyes brightened—he began to suspect Yang Kai wasn't merely gambling, but rather had a plan and thus raced forward so boldly.

How could Yang Kai possibly know so much? This anomaly had confounded five Saint Realm experts; what worth did a lone Third Stage Transcendent have?

Watching Yang Kai through the faint light around Li Rong, the Thunder Dragon became more certain of his suspicion.

After a stick of incense's time, Yang Kai abruptly halted and turned to look to one side.

"What's the matter?" The Thunder Dragon asked, alarmed.

"Are those your people?" Yang Kai pointed and asked.

Following his gesture, they saw countless chunks of torn flesh drifting in the eddying stream, as if cut apart by sharp instruments; the cuts were unnervingly clean.

A faint metallic tang of blood hung in the air.

"They're my people!" The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox's expression dimmed. He muttered, "When we first came through, a few of my men and some of Thunder Dragon's were lost here, swallowed by those strange currents and never seen again."

"But how did the bodies end up here?" The Thunder Dragon asked in puzzlement.

"Like I said, the space here is chaotic. You assumed the entry point remained fixed—you're wrong." Yang Kai explained calmly. "The spot you entered before should be near where we stand now."
