## Chapter 1039 — Deal Terminated

The battle continued; the Saint King Realm expert had driven his power to the limit, unleashing secret techniques and Secret Treasures he would not ordinarily use, yet he still could not defeat or kill Yang Kai.

During the fight, Yang Kai did not shrink back in pain from his wounds; instead, his eyes flashed with brilliance and his face wore an expression of delighted enjoyment.

He was reveling in it.

To fight an opponent of equal strength, to pour out all one has in mutual slaughter with only one able to survive—this life-or-death brink enlivened him greatly.

His expression unnerved his opponent; the Saint King Realm expert finally revealed a trace of fear.

In that instant he seemed to perceive Yang Kai's true intent—to use this battle to test his real strength! The two Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivators he had earlier slain had been mere trifles.

Realizing this, he panicked inwardly and could not help but wish to put distance between himself and this horrifying, abnormal youth.

Boom, boom, boom...

With the clash of power, Yang Kai and the Saint King Realm First Stage warrior separated, each breaking free from the other's profound intent; both panted heavily, facing one another across dozens of zhang.

A chorus of crisp cracks issued from within Yang Kai; his bones and flesh shifted, his Saint Yuan stirred, and his face showed nothing but lingering satisfaction.

Opposite him, the Saint King Realm warrior's eyes dimmed; blood flowed from his body, he was exhausted, at the end of his tether.

He stared at Yang Kai in terror, watching the wounds on Yang Kai's body restore under some inexplicable force, watching him bathed in blood yet emanating a dazzling golden light under the scorching sun.

It was, astonishingly, golden blood!

The warrior's eyes bulged in bewilderment.

He had no idea what cultivation method could turn a man's blood this color, but from that blood he felt surging vitality and a regenerative power that filled him with awe.

It was precisely because of that blood that the other's injuries healed so quickly.

He immediately realized he was no match for this youth; he lacked such abnormal regenerative ability—if the fight continued he would truly die.

He still had trump cards and forbidden techniques; he knew that if he wished he could employ a forbidden arts to boost his strength and continue to contend.

But he did not dare.

Because once that forbidden technique was unleashed, his condition would worsen; he might even fall from his current realm and never again have the chance to rise. After this battle he was already half-dead. Even if he fought desperately with the forbidden technique and won, the price would be horrendous.

Most importantly, even with the forbidden arts, he had no absolute confidence.

Who on earth was this brat? Why was he so terrifying?

He was baffled and inwardly alarmed, stunned by the strength Yang Kai had revealed.

So he and Yang Kai stared at one another as he furtively retreated, moving farther and farther away, his expression wilted but his vigilance high—afraid Yang Kai would finish him off.

Only when he had put what he considered a safe distance between them did he hurriedly draw his Star Shuttle, shouting, "Brat, you'll pay for what you did today! Shuiyue Star will have no place for you!"

His voice echoed from afar; the man vanished.

Yang Kai's face was indifferent; he showed no intention of pursuit and simply stood in place, watching the retreating figure.

Yet a strand of his Divine Sense Threads broke free of spatial constraints and leapt forward, clinging to that man like a boneworm.

Immediately he tore open the void with a gesture.

A hundred li away, the Saint King Realm warrior fleeing for his life strained to manipulate his power, extinguishing the clusters of demonic flames clinging to his body.

During the fight with Yang Kai those flames had consumed vast amounts of his Saint Yuan to withstand them; otherwise he would not have been in such a poor state.

This demonic flame was unlike anything he had heard of before—cold and hot coexisting, yang and evil intertwined—a paradoxical combination he could not extinguish in an instant; he could only continually manipulate his power to resist its corrosion and burning, forcing his speed to the limit in hopes of returning to that valley quickly to ask that Lord for help.

With the eerie youth nowhere to be seen behind him, he thought he had escaped death and devoted his thoughts to how he would explain this failure once back.

As he pondered, the space ahead of him suddenly warped; he thought for a moment his eyes were playing tricks from overexertion.

When he focused, the distortion worsened, shattering like a broken mirror; in the next instant a rift yawned open before him like an invisible beast baring a terrifying maw.

Within that rift a figure stood, a mocking smile on his face, waiting for him.

Seeing the man's face, his expression changed as if he had seen a ghost; he could not believe his eyes.

It was the same youth who had just fought him!

The youth reached a hand from the tear in space, seized him unawares, and flung him into the rift; the slit snapped shut, and the youth stood outside, smiling and waving at him.

Darkness engulfed him and he instantly plunged into an endless cold void, currents of strange power flowing and swallowing him like a quagmire.

He roared in fury but could not break free; he could only resentfully accept the fate about to befall him.

Outside, Yang Kai dispersed his Demon God Transformation, moved his limbs, and his face grew stern.

After such a battle he had a clearer sense of his limits.

The first layer of the Saint King Realm was the ceiling he could cross by fighting above his grade; after using the Demon God Transformation he could face such masters head-on without fear.

He was unsure about opponents at the second layer of the Saint King Realm.

The fight taught him much; he became more familiar with employing his new power and learned the dreadfulness of the demonic flames.

What troubled him more was why those three had pursued him and what was wrong with the scene he had witnessed.

It had seemed they were merely transporting supplies, albeit from a somewhat remote location.

Yang Kai could not make sense of it and was too lazy to probe further; he guided his Star Shuttle and left the scene swiftly.

Half a day later, in the valley where Yang Kai had previously passed through, all the supplies had already been loaded into the battleship. The middle-aged man who had earlier been chatting amicably with the handsome, enchanting youth walked over with a smile and said, “Young Master Xue Yue, a pleasure doing business with you. If there’s ever another opportunity like this, I hope Young Master Xue Yue will remember us — we’ll be sure to offer a price that satisfies you!”

The enchanting youth called Xue Yue smiled and nodded, his expression as gentle as a spring breeze, making all who looked upon him feel an involuntary warmth and closeness. Wherever his gaze swept, the female cultivators—regardless of cultivation or age—fell into a daze, their faces filled with infatuation.

There was no doubt that at Xue Yue's beck and a curl of his finger, those women would throw themselves into his arms.

"We'll take our leave, Young Master Xue Yue," the middle-aged man said with a laugh, calling his subordinates to board the warship; many of the women who had accompanied him left reluctantly, glancing back at Xue Yue again and again.

At that moment, a Saint King Realm warrior hurriedly came to Xue Yue's side and whispered gravely in his ear.

Xue Yue's smile stiffened slightly; he asked softly, "Are you sure?"

"Sure. Two bodies were found five hundred li away, another is missing. It does not bode well, Young Master. It seems that passerby likely saw the transaction."

Xue Yue's clear, unblemished eyes glanced over; he nodded, "I understand."

He then stepped forward and called out, "Wait!"

The middle-aged man, satisfied and preparing to leave with his haul, halted and looked back at Xue Yue. "Young Master, do you have further instructions?" he asked.

Xue Yue smiled faintly and said, "Although I regret it, this transaction must be terminated; these supplies cannot be taken."

"Terminated?" the middle-aged man frowned, displeasure flickering across his face. He laughed, "Please, Young Master, don't joke—payment and goods have already exchanged; a transaction is not ended at your whim."

Xue Yue smiled and nodded, as if matter-of-factly, "If I say it's terminated, then it is terminated."

The arrogant, contemptuous manner that dismissed others entirely angered the middle-aged man; he could not help but laugh, "Young Master, forgive me, but since the trade is done I don't intend to return the goods. These items are not purchasable for money alone; their sources are scarce. Take care—perhaps we'll cooperate again."

"There will be no next time." Xue Yue shook his head slowly, his smile unchanged and still radiating warmth that made others drop their guard. "You leave the supplies, and you... will remain here."

At those words the middle-aged man's face changed; unease spread through his body.

A figure cloaked in voluminous robes stepped out from behind Xue Yue, ghostlike, and suddenly appeared before the middle-aged man. He raised a palm that lightly struck the man's crown; a strange force invaded, and the man felt as if every bone in his body shattered and his organs were grievously ruptured—the life quickly drained from him.

"Origin Returning Realm..." he gasped, staring at the robed figure, then collapsed dead.

His death triggered massive panic; the warship descended into chaos, countless screams filling the air.

The robed man strode aboard the warship, slaughtering cultivators as easily as one crushes ants.

Moments later he walked out calmly and reported to Xue Yue, "One hundred and thirty-five people, all dead!"

"Mm." Xue Yue nodded slightly and instructed his followers, "Load the goods up and take everything away!"

"Young Master, what about the warship?" one subordinate asked—the goods could be loaded, but the ship could not be put into a Spatial Ring; leaving it would surely attract attention.

"Throw it onto Second Brother's territory; his people have been acting restless lately and seem to have some grudge with a group of outsiders," Xue Yue said indifferently.

"Yes!" the underlings replied and set about their tasks.
