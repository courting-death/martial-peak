## Chapter 1802 — Return to Floating Continent

Ni Guang shot Ghost Ancestor a look of disbelief, as though staring at a fool. “You stayed here for two thousand years? What could possibly make this place worth clinging to?”

He glanced left and right and found there was nothing particularly unusual about the place.

"Do you think I wanted to?" Ghost Ancestor's face immediately darkened. "I was trapped here for two thousand years! Do you know what that felt like? It was worse than death..."

Whenever he recalled those two thousand years, Ghost Ancestor's heart chilled.

Ghost Ancestor's roar caused Ni Guang's expression to change sharply. "You were trapped for two thousand years... I see, so that's why I never heard of you before. So you were imprisoned for two thousand years—does that mean you only recently escaped?"

"Yes. Thanks to boy Yang, otherwise I’d probably still be trapped now." Ghost Ancestor nodded.

"This place could trap someone like you?" Ni Guang looked bewildered. "I can't see anything dangerous here."

"This place... is the Chaos Abyss, isn't it?" Xue Yue, who had been watching the surroundings, suddenly said contemplatively.

"Little lass, you have sharp eyes." Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "That's right—this is the Chaos Abyss!"

"What? This is the Chaos Abyss?" Ni Guang's face shifted. "Isn't that the region in the Star Domain rumoured to be extremely dangerous?"

"What, are you scared?" Ghost Ancestor glanced at him sideways.

"Of course—I've heard even Void King Realm experts arriving here could end up with no burial place. Do you think I'm not afraid?"

"Heh heh, the rumours weren't wrong. The Chaos Abyss is usually harmless and peaceful, but if a chaos vortex appears and someone is sucked in, they could be torn to pieces!" Ghost Ancestor sneered. "Back then I was pursued by enemies and had no choice but to hide here, and was then swept into a sudden chaos vortex..."

"That didn't finish you off? You must have one hell of a life force." Ni Guang exclaimed in astonishment.

"I was indeed tenacious. I was trapped inside for two thousand years, until boy Yang was also swept in and he guided me out." Ghost Ancestor drew a deep breath. It was because of that event that Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor had met.

But after escaping, the two had not met again until this Lost Realm trip.

"Senior, if what you say is true, then Yang Kai must have gone..."

"Indeed. Yang went to the place that once trapped me." Ghost Ancestor grinned.

Xue Yue's face changed drastically.

"Don't worry. Don't forget what power Yang is proficient in. It was thanks to him that I escaped; he guided me through spatial rifts. If he can enter now, he surely has full confidence. Besides, now that he's inside, that old codger Zi Long can only gnash his teeth outside—we only need to wait calmly. Maybe one day boy Yang will come back on his own."

"Waiting here... isn't that dangerous?" Ni Guang said anxiously. Although the Chaos Abyss was peaceful at the moment, if a chaos vortex appeared, it could cost lives.

"What's there to fear? Chaos vortices don't appear at will." Ghost Ancestor was unusually unconcerned.

"Fine, then we'll wait. But I have many affairs at the Commerce Guild—I can't delay forever; I'll wait here for at most two months." Ni Guang said as he covertly glanced at Xue Yue.

Although he spoke to Ghost Ancestor, the words were actually meant for Xue Yue.

Knowing Yang Kai had dove into the chaos vortex and was not in mortal danger should reassure Xue Yue; she did not need to linger here indefinitely.

"Do as you wish. I'm here to wait for Yang Kai to come out." Ghost Ancestor chuckled softly.

While they spoke, they came to a spot not far from Zi Long and the others.

Zi Long was already in a foul mood; seeing Ni Guang and the others arrive, he snorted coldly, his face displeased.

Ni Guang couldn't be bothered to greet him. After their clash in the Lost Realm, neither could gain the upper hand, and they'd torn off the mask between them—there was no need for pleasantries. They stood apart from Zi Long and his group and waited in silence.

......

On the Floating Continent, Yang Kai tore through the void and appeared at ease.

This place had been his first stop when roaming the Star Domain; it was here he had met Ghost Ancestor and learned what the Void King Realm was, here he had felt his own smallness and vowed to train hard and become strong.

Returning after decades, he couldn't help but feel moved.

Although his cultivation hadn't reached the Void King Realm now, he was no longer weak.

Back then he had been easily captured by a few Saint King Realm cultivators; now, with a mere gesture he could destroy thousands of Saint Kings.

The Floating Continent was just the refuge Yang Kai thought of as the safest haven to evade Zi Long's pursuit.

Before leaving, he had left a Divine Sense thread deep beneath the Floating Continent's surface, so he could follow that Divine Sense to pinpoint the Floating Continent's location and use spatial force to arrive.

Standing there and taking a breath, Yang Kai felt refreshed in body and mind.

How the Floating Continent came to be was unknown; this piece of land floating in the void was not actually very large—only around two or three hundred thousand li across—but it was brimming with Spiritual Qi and teeming with heaven-and-earth treasures.

Back then Yang Kai had gathered a great deal of Void King-Grade medicinal materials here.

Upon returning a second time, Yang Kai discovered the Spiritual Qi here was even denser than before; he could not fathom what miracle had caused such a change.

Strictly speaking, the Floating Continent should be considered a very small star, for it had its own heavenly laws and origin; given enough time, perhaps it might truly become a Cultivation Star.

Could it be that so many stars in the Star Domain were born in this way?

Yang Kai pondered but grasped no answer.

"Ha ha, someone has finally come here!" A sudden loud laugh rang out, full of excitement.

Yang Kai frowned and turned his head in surprise.

He hadn't expected anyone else to be on the Floating Continent.

But when he saw the newcomer's face, he suddenly understood!

He recognized the speaker.

Lü Guichen! A name that had nearly slipped from his memory surfaced in his mind.

This man was a warrior from Purple Star. Back when Yang Kai had been captured by Purple Star warriors and put aboard a Purple Star warship, Lü Guichen had led them and had placed a sealing mark upon Yang Kai.

At that time, the two great forces of Purple Star and Sword Alliance, numbering in the hundreds, had all fallen into misfortune upon the Floating Continent. However, later, when Ghost Ancestor experimented with the Space Array, countless lives were lost, and in the end, only a handful managed to survive.

Back then, the Purple Star and the Sword Alliance had sent hundreds of warriors to the Floating Continent, but after Ghost Ancestor tested the Space Array, countless died and only a few survived.

When Yang Kai left the Floating Continent with Yue Xi and the others and Ghost Ancestor, they did not bring Lü Guichen; they had left him to perish.

Who could have imagined he would meet that man again decades later on the Floating Continent?

If Lü Guichen hadn't approached him first, Yang Kai would have almost forgotten the man.

"Friend, were you also swept in by that chaos vortex?" Lü Guichen, as if unused to speaking to people for decades, greeted him warmly at first; then he frowned, eyed Yang Kai suspiciously, and his gaze suddenly brightened as he pointed at Yang Kai, trembling, "It's you—it's really you!"

He clearly remembered Yang Kai.

After all, Yang Kai had left that cursed place with Ghost Ancestor while abandoning Lü Guichen; Lü Guichen had cursed Yang Kai ever since, and seeing his enemy now, his eyes burned with envy.

"Heh." Yang Kai gave a faint laugh and sized him up; he realized Lü Guichen was in fine condition and that his cultivation had actually advanced to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

To advance from the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in decades was a terrifying leap.

Such miraculous progress was owed to the Floating Continent's rich Spiritual Qi and its heaven-and-earth treasures.

Just as Ghost Ancestor had spent two thousand years here to rise to the Void King Realm, what else was there to do here besides cultivate?

"So it's you!" Lü Guichen's anger melted into rapture. "Ha ha, fate hasn't abandoned me—who would have thought you'd return? Lü Guichen is indeed blessed!"

His laughter vanished and his face turned savage as he advanced on Yang Kai; Saint Yuan surged and he snarled, "Boy, obediently cooperate with this lord and take me out of this cursed place, or I'll tear you to pieces!"

"You call yourself 'this lord' before me?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and scoffed.

"Ignorant fool! Wait until I capture you!" Lü Guichen flew into a rage at Yang Kai's disdain and lunged to seize him.

Yang Kai stood his ground without attempting to dodge and instead looked at Lü Guichen with a strange expression.

That look made Lü Guichen's heart skip a beat; he felt suddenly ill at ease, as if a sheep were daring to attack a tiger.

But with no choice, Lü Guichen pressed forward, caught Yang Kai's shoulder, and poured Saint Yuan into him, intending to subdue him.

The boy seemed to be putting on a show. Lü Guichen was delighted to have him so easily restrained.

With the trick seemingly successful, Lü Guichen barked, "Don't move if you don't want to die. I keep your life for a reason; resist and I won't be responsible..."

"Get lost!" Yang Kai, irritated by the man's bleating, surged Saint Yuan fiercely.

In the next instant Lü Guichen's face changed dramatically—he sensed the Saint Yuan he'd poured into Yang Kai vanish as if sinking into the sea, and instead a force erupted from Yang Kai that not only prevented any resistance but flowed back through Lü Guichen's arm into his chest, coursing through his organs with no way to resist.
