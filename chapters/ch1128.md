## Chapter 1128 — Countermeasures

In the Haike Family's council hall, the many Elders and Guest Elders all fell silent.

If they had still suspected a moment ago that Ba Qingyan was joking, now they no longer dared to entertain any doubt.

There was no reason for a dozen clansmen to collude and tell such a staggering lie to their upper ranks; the only explanation was that it was true!

“There’s such a young junior?” Ian drew a deep breath, shock flickering across his brow, then sighed: “Why wasn’t he born into my Haike Family? If he had been born in our clan…

His words voiced what everyone felt — if such an extraordinary young man belonged to the Haike Family, the clan’s revival would surely be imminent, and they would no longer be such a meek peripheral power under Yingyue Hall.

Being a peripheral power was only a name; put politely, they have some ties to Yingyue Hall; put bluntly, they cling to Yingyue Hall’s banner, send up supplies each year, and hope Yingyue Hall won’t bother them.

They receive no benefits from Yingyue Hall; if Yingyue Hall wished it, it could dissolve their family at any time.

“Family Head, this Yang Kai, though not born in our clan, might still be of use to us.” The beautiful Guest Elder Huang Juan suddenly smiled and said.

“Oh? Guest Elder Huang means…” Ian looked toward her with delight.

Huang Juan pursed her lips and smiled: “Elder Ba said earlier that Wu Yi even spoke of leaving the clan to shelter him. From where I stand, their relationship is probably not simple — at the very least, Wu Yi seems to have some feelings for that boy.”

At her words, everyone’s eyes lit up.

“Guest Elder Huang is right.” Warren nodded in agreement, visibly stirred: “Wu Yi is not unattractive, and her aptitude ranks among the top in our clan. It’s plausible Yang Kai holds feelings for her. We only need to bring them together; it might turn out well. But before that we must probe the young man’s origins — he was able to slay Xu Zhishen with Saint Realm cultivation; he cannot be some nobody. Any proposals?”

“Could he be Fang Tianzhong, the young generation’s top expert of the Leitai Sect? They say Fang Tianzhong has the power to slay across levels. Also, Wei Guchang of Yingyue Hall and Qu Changfeng of the Battle Heaven Alliance possess that strength — is Yang Kai an alias of one of them? Why else haven’t we heard the name?” someone asked.

“Absolutely not! Those prodigies are already in the Saint King Realm; by now they’re likely at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, a full major realm above Yang Kai. They have nothing to do with him.”

“I know a little about his origin.” An old man with a goat beard said in a low voice. When he’d drawn the crowd’s attention he continued: “My son mentioned it — when Wu Yi returned from mining, Yu Feng picked a man up in the Starry Sky. Yang Kai should be that man.”

“Picked up?” A cluster of faces went slack with astonishment — such a talented youth could be simply picked up?

Ian’s expression shifted as he looked to one of those present and smiled: “Guest Elder Chang. Last time Wu Yi went mining I remember you went with her; what do you know about that Yang Kai?”

Chang Qi frowned; he had been close to Wu Yi and had looked after her in the clan. Hearing she’d been forced to leave the clan, he felt great grievance toward Ba Qingyan’s actions. He had not intended to speak, but with the Family Head asking, he could not stay silent.

After all, Yu Feng had retrieved Yang Kai, and when Yang Kai escaped from that blood-red crystal he was present — he knew Yang Kai’s origin more clearly than anyone here.

He paused, then briefly recounted what had happened.

Faces shifted; none had expected Yang Kai’s origin to be so strange — that he had crawled out of a blood-red crystal.

Huang Juan giggled softly: “Now that we know his origin, matters are easier. He may not be a nobody out there, but having come to Dark Star he has no kin or backing here. The Haike Family may be small, but we are a force; if we take the initiative and show him goodwill, he has no reason to refuse. Besides, the Dragon Lair Mountain where he currently lives is our property.”

“Guest Elder Huang is right — young men are headstrong, and everyone loves beauty. From how he looks, he does seem to fancy Wu Yi. We only need to set them up.” Immediately several voices agreed and many others nodded.

“Not appropriate!” Suddenly a dissenting voice rang out.

Ian turned his gaze and asked gently: “Elder Ba, why do you object?”

Ian had not expected the first objection to come from Ba Qingyan.

Ba Qingyan said in a low voice: “First, Yang Kai slew Xu Zhishen today. If the Hundred Mountains Painting were not involved, the Xu Family might swallow their pride and let it slide after demanding some compensation to save face. But the Hundred Mountains Painting has been taken. Even if the Xu Family fears Yang Kai, they will not let this rest. If we rush to curry favor with Yang Kai now, we are bound to be at odds with the Xu Family.”

“What’s so fearsome about the Xu Family? Would the Haike Family bow to them? Elder Ba is being overcautious.” Warren snorted coldly.

“Yes, Elder Ba, the Hundred Mountains Painting isn’t with the Xu Family, so we needn’t fear them. Perhaps we should seize the chance to swallow the Xu Family’s power!”

At that, many were tempted.

They had long been wary of the Xu Family’s Hundred Mountains Painting, but now that the secret treasure was gone, what was there to fear? Befriending Yang Kai might even help them deal with the Xu Family.

Ian frowned and didn’t speak, looking to Ba Qingyan: “Elder Ba, continue.”

Ba Qingyan glanced at the elders brimming with zeal — those who would gladly go wipe out the Xu Family — and sneered: “You are not afraid of the Xu Family, but what about Yingyue Hall?”

The crowd froze, then, remembering, immediately showed apprehension.

“We and the Xu Family are both peripheral clans under Yingyue Hall. While such disputes won’t draw Yingyue Hall’s direct intervention, Wu Yi is the very person Xie Hongwen has set his sights on. If we unilaterally matchmake Wu Yi with Yang Kai, do you think Xie Hongwen will stand by? Xie Hongwen himself is nothing to fear, but his father is a deacon within Yingyue Hall! A deacon’s rank may not be high, but it’s not someone our Haike Family should provoke.”

“Elder Ba speaks sense.” Ian nodded. “Yang Kai is impressive, but he’s rootless — he’s only one man. If courting him earns us Xie Hongwen’s enmity, it’s not worth it. This matter must be handled carefully: recruit Yang Kai without offending Xie Hongwen. Elder Ba, you’re shrewd — go to Dragon Lair Mountain, see what he needs. We can cater to his tastes; if he truly loves beauty, our unmarried girls include several whose looks rival Wu Yi’s. Offering one to him is no great cost if he can serve our clan.”

“As the Family Head commands!” Ba Qingyan stood, bowed slightly, then added after a moment’s thought: “Family Head, how shall we deal with that Saint-Grade artificer, Yang Flame? Her formation attainments may not be insignificant.”

“Elder Ba, act as you see fit. We do need formation masters, but Yang Flame is young; even if she has some attainment, it probably isn’t profound. The primary target this time is Yang Kai.”

“Yes.”

Because the Family Head had said so, Ba Qingyan could not refute him; yet he felt Yang Flame’s formations were not so simple — her value might even exceed that of a Yang Kai.

After leaving the council hall, Ba Qingyan did not rush to Dragon Lair Mountain. He knew Yang Kai was not fond of him and would likely slam the door in his face; besides, Yang Kai had just broken through to the Saint King Realm and was probably secluding himself to consolidate his cultivation.

Consolidate his cultivation? Ba Qingyan’s eyes brightened. He hurried to the family treasury, took out a jade box, and opened it to reveal a pill the size of a longan, emitting a heady fragrance.

If Yang Kai needed anything most right now, it was likely this Saint King Pill. Ba Qingyan smiled smugly and left the treasury.

In the cave on Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai was secluding himself, while Yang Flame, aided by Wu Yi, sorted the materials by category.

Yang Kai’s supplies were a chaotic mix of all grades in massive quantities; the two women were dizzy from sorting but took pleasure in it — they hadn’t expected Yang Kai’s stores to be so abundant.

Suddenly Wu Yi laughed, her whole body fluttering like a blooming branch.

Yang Flame looked at her in puzzlement: “What are you laughing at?”

Wu Yi said: “I’m laughing at how sly Yang Kai is.”

“How is he sly?” Yang Flame asked with curiosity.

“When I picked him up he only had a Spatial Ring and Yu Feng even stole that,” Wu Yi said. “I felt sorry for him and gave him a few Saint Crystals. Now I realize he clearly had other Spatial Rings hidden somewhere — otherwise where did he get so many Saint Crystals and materials? He looked at me with eyes full of gratitude, thanking me profusely. I thought I’d done a good deed; it turns out he tricked me.”

“Hm, he is indeed sly.” Yang Flame nodded. “But those Saint Crystals weren’t his doing — I helped him get them.”

Wu Yi’s curiosity remained; before she could ask more, Yu Feng, who had gone out to buy materials, returned.

“How was it?” Wu Yi asked.

“It was fantastic!” Yu Feng grinned broadly. “Miss, you have no idea — I’ve never been treated like such royalty. The material vendors practically worshipped me and spent money without restraint. The feeling of shelling out big sums was wonderful, and several pretty girls even gave me flirtatious looks.”
