## Chapter 1352 — Kill It

Cai He turned the thought over and bitterly smiled. Back when the old woman was still alive the four of them had searched this place thoroughly; aside from the exit guarded by that puppet there was no other passage — in short, to get out they could only go through that round gate.

Unless they stayed here and waited for Fei Zhi Tu and the others to come rescue them, but who could say? Whether Fei Zhi Tu and the others could find this place was uncertain, and if they stayed they would merely be sitting and waiting for death.

Rather than that, it was better to take a risk and try; with a bit of luck they might actually find some flaw or a workable method to leave.

The hope was slim, but it was still better than waiting forever.

With that thought, Cai He's expression hardened. He nodded at Yang Kai and said, "Brother Yang, I will go with you. Although I, Cai, am not skilled at fighting, more people means more strength."

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "No need. I'm just going to test its capabilities for now. I don't need you to act yet. Once I've probed it, we'll think of a way to leave together."

"That will do, but Brother Yang, be careful!" Cai He warned anxiously.

Yang Kai solemnly inclined his head and, fully on guard, approached the puppet. Cai He and Du Sisi stood tensely where they were, watching.

Half an hour later Yang Kai came running back looking battered and disheveled.

That round of probing had truly exhausted every trick he had, but thanks to his strength far beyond warriors of his rank, nothing major went wrong and he didn't suffer too grievously under the puppet — he had only been grazed by the other's huge staff, and half his body still felt numb.

Cai He and Du Sisi had watched from beginning to end, and when Yang Kai returned, their gazes were filled with newfound respect and awe. All of Yang Kai’s probing attempts just now had practically been experiments made with his own life on the line. More than once, they had thought he was doomed to die, yet each time, he managed to find a sliver of life within the very jaws of death.

After watching for half an hour, the two of them felt even more exhausted than Yang Kai, who had been taking action himself. Every moment dragged on like a year, and their palms and backs were soaked with sweat.

From this they had at least discerned that Yang Kai was no ordinary Saint King Realm warrior — the means he displayed were enormous in power and strange beyond measure; even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert might not possess such capabilities.

How could Cai He and Du Sisi dare to underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest now?

After returning, Yang Kai said nothing. He took out a few Healing Pills, swallowed them, and sat cross-legged to meditate.

Only after a full day did Yang Kai breathe out softly and open his eyes; their light flashed and he seemed to have recovered. Cai He and Du Sisi, who had been keeping watch nearby, hastened over and looked at him with hopeful eyes.

Yang Kai knew what they were thinking and didn't tease them; he said simply, "There is a chance."

At this Yang Kai, Cai He and Du Sisi's faces lit up and a trace of joy showed. Cai He even sat cross-legged in front of Yang Kai and urged, "What must be done to get rid of that puppet? Please, Brother Yang, instruct us. Sisi and I will fully cooperate."

"Get rid of it?" Yang Kai's face showed a strange look, then he smiled faintly. "You can't get rid of it. When I tested it earlier you saw — although it's huge, its movement is like the wind and its speed is extreme. If it were only me I might have a slim chance to escape it, but the two of you absolutely don't have that possibility!"

This was not Yang Kai underestimating them but a frank statement: even he, at full strength and aided by the Wind-and-Thunder Wings for speed, only had about a fifty percent chance to break past the puppet's blockade. During his earlier tests he had tried multiple times to bypass it and rush for the round gate, but each time the puppet forced him back.

That puppet seemed to bear deadly hostility toward any living thing that tried to pass through the round gate — it sought to kill without mercy!

Hearing Yang Kai, Du Sisi's pretty face changed and she immediately cried out, "You can't leave us behind!"

She instinctively believed Yang Kai intended to go off alone.

Cai He forced a smile. "Sisi, you're overthinking. Brother Yang wouldn't do that."

His words were meant to comfort Du Sisi and himself, while he covertly watched Yang Kai's reaction — he was a little worried Yang Kai might do exactly that.

Yang Kai didn't argue much. To be honest, if he had truly broken past the puppet's blockade earlier he would have left alone, but he had no intention of abandoning the two. If he could leave he would seek out Fei Zhi Tu and the others to rescue them; one person escaping was better than all three being trapped here with no hope of survival.

Hearing Cai He's probing, Yang Kai had no desire to explain further and only said, "If we want to leave now we must act together. If I were to face it alone I could barely defend myself; I'm no match for it."

Cai He nodded repeatedly. "Brother Yang is right, but you said just now it can't be shaken off — what should we do? It seems to stand guard at the exit and won't leave far."

Yang Kai had already tested that; once anyone came within ten zhang of the exit the puppet would immediately act, but if one stayed beyond that range it would be like a dead thing, utterly unresponsive.

Hearing Cai He's question, Yang Kai gave a mysterious smile. "Naturally, we kill it!"

"Kill it..." Cai He was stunned.

Du Sisi blurted out bluntly, "Are you stupid..."

She didn't finish the sentence because Yang Kai coldly glanced over; her heart gave a jolt and she swallowed the rest, looking embarrassed, though her expression clearly showed she thought Yang Kai's plan was reckless.

"Since I say it, I have some confidence." Yang Kai knew that if he didn't explain plainly the two would never cooperate. The puppet's immense might and the scene of it killing the old woman had left a shadow in their hearts; they simply couldn't summon the courage to confront it.

"First, its weakness. This puppet guards the round gate; whoever or whatever lies beyond that gate may be worth it for the puppet to never leave, but that very fact can be used. Since you two are Formation Masters, I needn't explain how to proceed, right?" Yang Kai glanced at them.

Cai He and Du Sisi exchanged looks and both lightly nodded.

The puppet's great flaw would give them enough time to set up a grand formation; with the formation's power combined with Yang Kai's efforts there might just be a chance.

“Setting up a formation shouldn’t be a problem. In fact, we can arrange a grand array that restricts its speed,” Cai He said slowly, stroking his chin. “From what I see, this puppet is impervious to water and fire and incredibly sturdy, but its greatest threat lies in its speed. If we can truly slow it down, its advantage will be greatly reduced.”

"You can set up such formations?" Yang Kai was delighted; it seemed Cai He had thought the same as him. A puppet isn't like a living person — some formations that are powerful against the living have no effect on it. Yang Kai had intended to have Cai He and Du Sisi set a formation specifically to hamper its speed; he hadn't expected Cai He to reach the same conclusion.

"That's not hard. I have a set of Formation Plates and a Formation Foundation for the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation; Miss Sisi should have a set of the Ground-Imprisonment Formation, right?" Cai He looked toward Du Sisi.

"Mm." Du Sisi nodded lightly; she wasn't surprised he knew her background — after all the Cai and Du families were both famed in formations, and mutual probing and rivalry were normal.

"How powerful are those two formations?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

Cai He showed a trace of pride. "Their power is naturally not small. If the formations could be fully unleashed, even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert would be restrained within them. But... sadly, Miss Sisi and I do not possess that level of strength and can only bring out less than half of their full power."

"Less than half..." Yang Kai frowned inwardly. Cai He glanced at Yang Kai and said in a low voice, "Don't worry, Brother Yang. I'm confident in these two formations. I can't promise everything, but surely we can slow it by ten to twenty percent!"

"Ten to twenty percent is a little, but it's all we have!" Yang Kai wasn't bothered.

"But Brother Yang, even if Miss Sisi and I slow its speed with formations, how can we actually destroy such a puppet?"

"Yes, when you probed it earlier you didn't injure it at all!" Du Sisi hurriedly asked. This was critical; no one wanted to be careless. If their cooperation failed they might all fall here.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Although I didn't wound it at all, I at least verified one thing."

"What is that?"

"That the puppet moves on its own without anyone guiding it because there is a strand of a Divine Soul inside it!"

"Divine Soul?" Cai He and Du Sisi breathed.

“Exactly—and you could also call it a Spirit Essence,” Yang Kai said seriously as he looked at the two. “When Lian Guang controls his puppets, did you ever notice how he does it? Lian Guang channels a wisp of his own Divine Soul into the puppet—only then can he make them act according to his will. This puppet may appear to be far more advanced than Lian Guang’s, but the principle should be the same. A puppet is, after all, a lifeless thing; for it to move, there must exist something akin to a fragment of soul within it. And since this puppet acts without a master, it must have a Spirit Essence sealed inside—though who knows what kind of being that essence once belonged to.”

Hearing Yang Kai's analysis Cai He and Du Sisi both felt as if clouds had parted to reveal the moon; previously they had been cowed by the puppet's ferocity and hadn't carefully considered this question, but now it made perfect sense.

"You mean, Brother Yang..."

"I don't need to destroy the puppet itself. I only need to locate that strand of Spirit Essence and extinguish it, and then the puppet will naturally cease to move." A bright gleam flashed in Yang Kai's eyes.

Cai He brightened and clapped his hands. "I see — in that case, this can work!"

Compared to destroying such an impregnable puppet, destroying a strand of Spirit Essence was obviously far, far easier.

"Do you know where that Spirit Essence might be?" Du Sisi interjected.

Yang Kai's expression darkened and he slowly shook his head. "I'm not completely sure yet, but there are several suspicious spots. I need your two to restrain its speed so I have the chance to carefully inspect those locations and find where the Spirit Essence is hiding."
