## Chapter 1606 — You Finally Came Out

Lost in wild thoughts, Yang Kai cast his gaze toward the spot on the demonic beast's skeletal chest.

In an instant, his eyes grew even more ardent.

He clearly saw a round crystal of dark crimson there, about the size of a baby's head.

A Void Mind Crystal! It could also be called this Yao King's Inner Core!

Different names, but they refer to the same thing.

Only those at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm can condense such a miraculous Void Mind Crystal within their bodies; Second Stage Void King cultivators have no such qualification.

The Void Mind Crystal contains a top expert's comprehension of the Martial Dao and understanding of Domain — its value is incalculable!

Chi Yue's greatest motive for wanting it is to use it to break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and achieve the exalted status of a Yao King.

Across the entire Star Domain, how many cultivators had reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm? Barely enough to count on one hand—and every one of them was a figure as elusive as a dragon’s head and tail, their whereabouts completely unknown. For ordinary people, catching even a glimpse of such beings was as hard as ascending to the heavens.

Yet now there lay before Yang Kai the corpse of a deceased cultivator of that rank; not only were the bones intact, the Void Mind Crystal remained as well.

Yang Kai's breathing inevitably quickened, his gaze burning as it stared at the Void Mind Crystal.

He carefully released his Divine Sense and extended it toward the crystal, but before his Divine Sense could touch the Void Mind Crystal, the dark-red sphere suddenly flashed with a radiance.

Yang Kai frowned and hastily withdrew his Divine Sense, not daring to pry recklessly.

Chi Yue was right — that Void Mind Crystal still contained a wisp of the Yao King's remnant soul; any attempt to lay hands on it would stir resistance. If that were not the case, the crystal and the bones would have been taken long ago, not left until today.

The only way to safely obtain the Void Mind Crystal is to suppress that lingering soul.

Those who enter the Blood Prison are mostly cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—who among them could possibly subdue the remnant soul of a Yao King?

Only the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin within Yang Kai’s body could accomplish such a feat.

He exhaled softly. Yang Kai steadied his heart and stared solemnly at the Void Mind Crystal, motionless.

In the darkness, an almost imperceptible black shadow was cautiously approaching Yang Kai, clinging to the ground, seemingly without substance and emitting no breath; even someone as powerful as Yang Kai had not sensed it at all.

The shadow crept closer bit by bit until it was within less than five zhang behind him; then the lurking shadow suddenly reared like a spirit-serpent and coalesced, aiming at Yang Kai's back.

At that instant Yang Kai's body shook with a roar, a high, resounding dragon cry filled the air, and an incredible pressure spread around.

On Yang Kai's right arm, patches of golden, dazzling scales bizarrely manifested, wrapping his entire right arm — even the back of his hand. When those scales appeared, his fingers suddenly burst with golden light; his nails strangely lengthened, glinting with deadly edge.

Dragon Transformation!

Having cultivated half of the Yao Transformation Technique, Yang Kai could now barely mobilize the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force within him to partially transform his right arm into that of a dragon.

The entire right arm, in an instant, became hideously fearsome.

The shadow that had been five zhang behind him was clearly startled, immediately flattening back to the ground and hastily retreating.

At that moment Yang Kai moved; his right arm, seemingly slow then swift, thrust forward and in an instant pierced the spatial barrier, descending onto the Void Mind Crystal.

The Void Mind Crystal flashed wildly! A restless aura surged within it, as if it were about to burst.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, gripped the Void Mind Crystal in his hand and squeezed hard, while his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense poured into it frantically.

In the void it seemed a faint sound echoed from the crystal, and the unruly aura slowly subsided.

The golden scales on Yang Kai's right arm gradually faded, and the terrifying arm returned to its normal state.

He released his grip, looked at the Void Mind Crystal in his hand, and smiled broadly.

The remnant wisp of soul within the Void Mind Crystal had been ruthlessly erased by him; now anyone could hold the Void Mind Crystal without worrying about it self-destructing.

The process had been simple and effortless — even Yang Kai had not expected it.

Chi Yue had warned him so gravely; he had expected hardship, but he had obtained it so easily.

"Eh?" Yang Kai looked closely at the Void Mind Crystal, a strange expression appearing on his face.

He vaguely felt the crystal looked familiar, as if he had obtained one like it before.

After thinking carefully, Yang Kai suddenly realized when he had once acquired a Void Mind Crystal.

The first time he entered the Flowing Flame Sandland!

In the Flowing Flame Sandland, in the pool filled with Soul Cleansing Divine Water, he had indeed obtained a crystal-like object; at the time he did not know what it was — when he probed it with Divine Sense, the crystal oddly vanished and entered his Sea of Consciousness.

Eventually that marvelous crystal was entirely absorbed by the six-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, causing the Warm Spirit Lotus to evolve into its seven-colored form, and it was then that Yang Kai comprehended his Blooming Lotus secret art.

So that thing was a Void Mind Crystal! Yang Kai finally understood.

No wonder its effect was so strong — it even caused the Warm Spirit Lotus to evolve. He simply had not derived the subtleties of Domain from it and did not know why; it seems the expert who fell beside the pool of Soul Cleansing Divine Water was at least a Third Stage Void King Realm existence.

Years had passed and Yang Kai had not probed further; once he understood, he put the Void Mind Crystal away.

Though this thing was precious, Yang Kai wanted the Yao Transformation Technique more!

So he still had to hand it over to Chi Yue.

Moreover, Chi Yue is Shan Qingluo's foster mother; if she grows stronger, Shan Qingluo will receive greater protection.

Yang Kai understood this clearly; from beginning to end he had never intended to claim the Void Mind Crystal for himself. He believed that by his own strength, even without the crystal, he would one day advance to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and reach the pinnacle of the Martial Dao.

Turning around, Yang Kai collected the Yao King's skeletal remains as well; naturally he would not miss the Yao King's Spatial Ring. Although he did not know what was inside, the belongings of a Third Stage Void King cultivator would certainly not be meager.

That was the greatest gain of this trip.

After thoroughly searching and confirming nothing was left behind, Yang Kai departed.

The cave was not deep; Yang Kai soon saw daylight again.

"You finally came out!"

Just as he stepped out of the cave, a sinister laugh—one that sounded somewhat familiar—echoed from deep underground. The next instant, a blood-red figure burst out from the earth and landed before him, launching a storm-like barrage of attacks without the slightest warning.

Yang Kai's expression chilled; Golden Blood Threads shot forth at a snap of his fingers, continuously weaving into an impenetrable barrier before him.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

With violent detonations, all the attacks the blood-red figure unleashed were intercepted by the Golden Blood Threads and rolled back to no effect.

"Xue Lian!" Yang Kai spared a glance to see who had ambushed him, and involuntarily let out a cold exclamation, killing intent surging.

"It's your Grandpa Xue Lian!" Xue Lian shouted wildly, his face ferocious; he had already activated the Jiao Transformation, his whole body covered in blood-red scales, looking exceptionally sturdy, and without hesitation he continued to assault Yang Kai.

"You seek death!" Yang Kai sneered; with a thought the two Golden Blood Threads suddenly took the forms of Thunderflame Flying Lizards, baring fangs as they lunged to bite Xue Lian.

"How can flying lizards contend with the power of my Blood Jiao?" The Blood Jiao had apparently forgotten the prior lesson in the palace and showed no fear of Yang Kai, swinging its scaled fists in two heavy blows. Two blood-colored jiao dragons formed from converged yao Yuan and shook their heads and tails as they met the Thunderflame Flying Lizards, tangling with them without losing ground.

At the same time he made a gesture and a gigantic axe suddenly appeared in his hand, slamming down toward Yang Kai's position.

The axe's might seemed to rend the heavens; in an instant it struck before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's figure flickered and he dodged to the side.

Just then another figure leapt from the earth, palms clasped together, thrusting forward; a massive and strange flower abruptly manifested, its petals opening like the gaping maw of a beast, snapping toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face grew cold; Spatial Force surged and he vanished from the spot, only to reappear ten zhang away.

The monstrous flower failed to land a hit and immediately flew back to hover above the second person's head, its petals opening and closing as if breathing, a sweet fragrance beginning to spread.

"Mi Tian!" Yang Kai's mouth tilted up in a playful expression. "Good — both of you have come. It seems you knew I'd come here and laid an ambush?"

"Indeed." Mi Tian smiled gently, his expression amiable. "You bear the Sacred Dragon Origin, and the Void Mind Crystal is no secret to our yao. Besides, you came suddenly from Di Chen to the Blood Prison — how could we not know what you were after? Wasn't it Senior Chi Yue who called you here?"

"Smart!" Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

"Where is the Void Mind Crystal?" Mi Tian's breathing grew somewhat urgent.

"Since I'm out, where do you suppose the Void Mind Crystal is?" Yang Kai beamed radiantly.

"You truly got it!" Mi Tian drew a breath, greed plainly visible on his face.

“You want it?” Yang Kai sneered at him. “With just the two of you? I’m afraid you don’t have what it takes. Careful you don't end up staying here!"

Hearing his contempt, both Xue Lian and Mi Tian's expressions soured.

Though unwilling to admit it, both knew that in a one-on-one fight, none of them could match Yang Kai; he had already proven his strength in the palace.

"Whether you have the ability or not — we'll see when we fight." Mi Tian snorted coldly.

Yang Kai was just about to mock them further when his brow suddenly furrowed. His Shi burst outward in a frenzy, and within a ten-zhang radius centered on him, space abruptly collapsed. Countless fine spatial rifts slithered through the air like spirit serpents.
