## Chapter 594 — Cleaning House

Yang Bai’s expression grew solemn as he looked at Yang Kai with newfound gravity. He said in surprise, “Nephew, you actually possess such power. Not bad, it seems you have external forces to draw upon. But you’re only at the Divine Roaming Realm, Fifth Stage, still too weak.”

“Is that so?” Di Mo took a step forward to stand guard beside Yang Kai. A dense flow of sinister demonic energy surged from his body, identical in aura to that of Yang Bai's. The two energies seemed to attract each other mysteriously.

The eight elder family heads shouted fiercely in unison, raising their powers to beyond their limits, their faces grim and resolute, united in a shared hatred, clearly prepared to fight Yang Bai to the death.

Yang Bai laughed heartily, “You think you can defeat me by sheer numbers? How naive. Very well, before I leave, I’ll let you witness what it means to be at the Transcendent Realm's Third Stage! Brother, I gave you a chance, but you were ungrateful. All this demonic energy you wield—today I will take it for myself.”

His last words were directed at Di Mo.

When Yang Bai had initially emerged from the Dragon Confinement Ravine, his cultivation was still below the Transcendent Realm's Third Stage and he couldn’t absorb all the energy from that Demonic Master’s corpse. He had intended to return later when stronger, but that opportunity was taken by Di Mo.

Now the chance was in his grasp, and he naturally wanted to reclaim the power that belonged to him.

With a slight wave of his hand, a seven-colored light shield spread around him like an armor.

The Eight Great Families’ elder heads unleashed the brilliance of their martial skills and Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures, bombarding Yang Bai. Such an onslaught that should have stirred cataclysms merely caused faint ripples to appear on the light shield covering Yang Bai, unable to break through his defenses.

Despite already knowing Yang Bai’s formidable methods and strength, the eight elder family heads were still incredulous at what they saw, their faces pale with shock.

Di Mo struck like lightning, a blood-red glow condensing into a mist and enveloping Yang Bai. Within that blood light were years of Di Mo’s comprehension and cultivation, subtle and unpredictable, capable of eroding anything in the world.

Yet Yang Bai merely shook his body lightly, dispersing the blood mist.

Di Mo snorted coldly and retreated three steps, his expression grave.

The absolute difference in realm was something his experience could not bridge. If there were enough blood here, he might have been able to use the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art, but all the blood from recent casualties had already been consumed by Yang Bai. Even Di Mo was a clever housewife without rice to cook.

A loud dragon roar rang out. Behind Yang Kai appeared a huge dragon head, head shaking and tail flicking, its blood-red maw opening wide as it lunged to bite Yang Bai.

“A Jiao Dragon?” Yang Bai sneered disdainfully. He formed a grip in midair with his left hand, conjuring a massive seven-colored poisonous python from nowhere. The python’s scales shimmered in a dazzling array of colors, teeth bared, fiercely charging at the black Jiao Dragon, spitting vibrant streaks of light saturated with terrifying demonic energy. In an instant, the dragon was blasted into fragments.

“Is that all?” Yang Bai mocked with a cold smile, calm and deadly. “Release your power all you want. I want to see who dares to stop me! Yang Bai’s entire life has been one of hardship; all I have ever pursued is the enhancement of strength. Whether by righteousness or by evil—if it makes me stronger, I will kill anyone who stands in my way!”

“Even if it’s your master who raised you?” Yang Kai said coldly, eyes fixed on him. Despite the perilous situation, he showed no sign of panic, only a calm demeanor.

Di Mo observed closely. Though unaware of what Yang Kai was relying upon, having followed him for so long, Di Mo knew Yang Kai never acted without confidence. Hastily, he suppressed any impulse to flee and steadfastly guarded Yang Kai.

“Master?” Yang Bai sneered, “I no longer have a master.”

As he spoke, he released the evil energy within him again. The eight elder family heads simultaneously groaned, their knees weakening as they collapsed. Their faces turned seven-colored, their True Yuan and strength drained rapidly, rushing madly into Yang Bai’s body.

The absolute suppression in realm made them all deeply realize Yang Bai’s terrifying power, as well as their own helplessness against him alone.

“Yang Kai, you must leave. We won’t escape...” Yang Yinghao suddenly spoke, his voice fading.

Had they known Yang Bai’s power was so terrifying, they would never have come here with only eight.

They had thought that even if they died, they could at least drag Yang Bai down with them. But such thoughts now seemed laughably unrealistic.

Their only hope was risking their lives to protect Yang Kai.

“No one leaves!” Yang Bai said leisurely, shaking his head faintly. He extended a finger, sending a fierce gust of energy crashing into Yang Yinghao’s shoulder blade, piercing it clean through. Blood immediately spilled out.

“Yang Bai, you disgrace your sect by betraying your master and ancestors. Today, I will clear out the vermin for my master!” Yang Kai roared like an enraged beast, suddenly vicious and brutal.

Yang Bai was stunned, glancing oddly at him. With contempt, he said, “You dare speak such arrogance at merely the Fifth Stage of Divine Roaming? Truly arrogant and ignorant, Nephew. Soon you will die. Are you prepared to become a vengeful ghost to clear up after that old bastard?”

Although from the same sect, he utterly looked down on Yang Kai, believing his current power to be only due to external support.

“Heh…” Yang Kai chuckled harshly, his smile vanishing as he said coldly, “Di Mo!”

Di Mo responded without hesitation, charging at Yang Bai like a madman.

Yang Bai’s expression was disdainful. He waved his hand and struck at Di Mo, a violent surge of energy bursting forth. Di Mo’s True Yuan flickered and quickly vanished. He was blasted backward, crashing heavily to the ground, but immediately stood up without a care.

Unharmed!

This scene shocked not only the elder heads of the Eight Great Families but even Yang Bai himself grew suspicious. After regaining composure, he nodded, “This body really is formidable.”

Di Mo laughed heartily, “I may not be able to defeat you now, but you cannot kill me either. This body is not something you can shake.”

This body had been left in the Dragon Confinement Ravine for hundreds of years, remaining indestructible. Clearly, it had been tempered to the extreme by the Demonic Master back then.

With Yang Bai’s current strength, he truly could not shake this body.

“I thought you had some trump card, but it’s just this,” Yang Bai scoffed. “If that’s the case, I won’t waste time playing with you.”

Di Mo remained silent, then charged at Yang Bai with relentless momentum once more.

Yang Bai curled his lip coldly, “You’re just a brute. You have a body but cannot unlock its power. Give it back to me.”

As he spoke, a fiercer aura exploded from him than before. Yang Bai’s hand shaped like a claw, reaching straight for Di Mo’s head.

Unexpectedly, Di Mo didn’t dodge or evade; he allowed himself to be grabbed.

“Seeking death!” Yang Bai exulted, hastily drawing upon his cultivation to frantically absorb the power within Di Mo. This demonic energy originated from the same cultivation method he practiced, so he could absorb it without restraint. Once he absorbed Di Mo’s power, Yang Bai’s strength would surely rise again.

He could even use a secret technique to claim Di Mo’s current body for himself, forging a puppet.

“Young Master!” Di Mo shouted out painfully, struggling but unable to prevent his power from draining away.

No matter what Yang Kai was scheming, this was the moment to strike. Di Mo’s reckless fury stemmed from his unconditional trust in Yang Kai.

Suddenly, a golden chain appeared mysteriously, accompanied by a fierce yang energy that descended with a roar. Both Di Mo’s and Yang Bai’s demonic energies writhed restlessly as if faced with a nemesis.

The chain was short but exuded a force impossible to ignore, wrapping directly around Yang Bai.

“Locking Demon Chain?” Yang Bai was shocked, panic filling his face as he hurriedly released Di Mo and took a few steps back.

Yang Kai sneered. As he moved his will, the golden Locking Demon Chain seemed alive, instantly binding Yang Bai tightly.

Clang clang clang...

A sound like salt thrown into hot oil rang out as the demonic energy inside Yang Bai frantically resisted but could not break the Locking Demon Chain’s hold. Black smoke billowed from his body.

The golden Locking Demon Chain seemed to dissipate into an intangible form, gradually sinking into Yang Bai’s body, only flickering faintly with bright light.

“Senior Uncle, you’ve underestimated yourself,” Yang Kai mocked with a smile. “Since we have the Demonic Master’s corpse, the Locking Demon Chain that bound him is surely in my hands as well. This thing should be your bane.”

Yang Bai’s face twisted with rage, his gaze full of hatred toward Yang Kai.

The Locking Demon Chain specifically suppresses demonic energies.

It could even hold the Demonic Master’s corpse; how much easier it is now to hold Yang Bai. Both he and Di Mo owe their current powers to inheriting the Demonic Master’s corpse.

Seemingly suppressed by the Locking Demon Chain, Yang Bai’s imposing aura was quickly drawn back, much of his power sealed inside and unusable.

The sudden turn of events thrilled all present. None had expected such a change.

Di Mo looked at Yang Kai with a mix of horror and joy, silently thinking his trust in the Young Master was not misplaced.

He had nearly forgotten the Locking Demon Chain existed, only for Yang Kai to unveil it at this critical moment.

“Senior Uncle, how much power do you have left to use now?” Yang Kai stepped forward, his momentum rising. “Because of you, the great Lingxiao Pavilion is in ruin and misery, Master nearly lost his life, and my father has suffered chronic illness for years. You destroying Zhongdu City might not matter, but damaging Lingxiao Pavilion will exact a price. Now is the time for your reckoning.”

“Foolish delusions!” Yang Bai roared in hysteria. “Do you think a mere Locking Demon Chain can seal me? Maybe when you’re stronger it might. But your current power is still not enough! The might of a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure depends on the wielder’s foundation! Has no one ever taught you that?”

Saying this, Yang Bai clenched his hands, a radiant seven-colored light bursting forth like a violent storm covering the area. Then, with a backward leap, he headed toward the gaping void passage.

Clearly, he intended to leave first and make plans later.
