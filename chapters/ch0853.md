## Chapter 853 — The Distinction Between Primary and Secondary

After a stretch of conversation, Du Wan solemnly handed Yang Kai the Saint-Grade Lower-Level pill he had previously refined, the one that bore visible Pill Patterns.

That Saint Pill had been taken by several of the masters for examination; Yang Kai had remained unconscious throughout, so the pill naturally stayed in Du Wan's custody.

Yang Kai took it casually, holding it lightly, a thoughtful expression crossing his face.

Whether it was because he had finally grasped aspects of the True Alchemy Formula and thus improved his alchemy, Yang Kai found that when he held the pill he had made, he could perceive, without looking, the various essences and traces contained within it.

It felt as if the pill were a part of him, a strange, intimate sensation.

"By the way, I saw you carve many spirit formations in the final moments of refining that Saint Pill… could that have something to do with the creation of the Pill Patterns?" Du Wan asked suddenly.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "There is some relation. Everyone assumes the Pill Patterns form by chance, but I think a deft technique can increase the likelihood of their formation, which is why I carved so many spirit formations."

"Increase the probability?" Du Wan's eyes brightened and he asked in a low voice, "By how much could it increase?"

If this method truly worked, alchemy across the entire continent could undergo a staggering revolution. Imagine if Pill Patterns could be induced — a single set of alchemical ingredients might yield several times the effect.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and shook his head. "I can't say for sure. I only did my best, and I only recently grasped a bit of it, not a complete understanding… I first glimpsed the hint from an ancient Saint Pill left over from antiquity, then observed the masters' techniques and had the idea. I didn't expect Pill Patterns would actually form."

"An ancient Saint Pill?" Du Wan's expression changed. "How did you know it was from the ancient era?"

"Because it didn't bear Pill Patterns… it bore a Pill Cloud. From the condensation of its medicinal effects, one can deduce it existed for at least several thousand years."

Du Wan inhaled sharply, his eyes wide. "A Saint Pill with a Pill Cloud? Where is it now? May I examine it?"

Yang Kai scratched his head and said awkwardly, "I ate it."

"You… ate it?" Du Wan was dumbstruck.

"I almost died from it!" Yang Kai forced a bitter laugh as he recalled taking the Saint Pill. He still shuddered at the memory, but thanks to that pill his Warm Spirit Lotus in his Sea of Consciousness had advanced from five colors to six.

"What a waste!" Du Wan slapped his thigh in frustration. "A single ancient Saint Pill bearing a Pill Cloud, and you just ate it? Truly… such a loss!"

He spoke in a tone of intense regret, as if something precious and beloved had been ruined by Yang Kai.

Yang Kai could understand his feelings to some degree. Once alchemy reaches a certain level, one can glean a refiners' techniques and realm from a finished pill, and even unearth long-lost alchemical secrets.

That was exactly why Yang Kai had personally tried the Saint Pill's effects.

It was no wonder Du Wan was so upset when he learned the truth.

After fussing for a while, Du Wan drew a deep breath to calm himself and said with a sigh, "Luckily you are fortunate; otherwise you might have died for real."

Pill Clouds and Pill Patterns are fundamentally different: Pill Patterns ensure a pill remains unspoiled for a long time, while Pill Clouds help a pill draw in Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth, enhancing its efficacy.

An ancient Saint Pill that had been nourished by a Pill Cloud for thousands of years would contain medicinal power unimaginably vast.

That Yang Kai did not die after ingesting it was already a miracle.

"What did you glean from that ancient Saint Pill?" Du Wan asked eagerly.

"That Pill Cloud… bore traces of artificial manipulation. That's why I performed those actions when refining the other day. It seems Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds can indeed promote each other's formation, though the probability is should not be large," Yang Kai said, frowning.

"If it can be promoted, that's good." Du Wan's eyes shone with excitement. "Study it thoroughly — if you can fully unravel it, it will shake the alchemical world. If you need my help, say the word; I won't refuse if I can be of use."

"Thank you, Elder Du. I'll be sure to trouble you when the time comes." Yang Kai inclined his head seriously.

"Oh, right." Du Wan suddenly remembered something, rummaged in his Spatial Pouch, and after a moment handed over a gleaming golden nameplate with a smile. "This is your new identity plate. Your old one only recorded you as a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, didn't it? Now that you're a Saint-Grade alchemist you should replace it."

"No need, Elder Du… I don't care for it."

Du Wan chuckled. "I know you don't care, but as the steward of the Giant Stone City Alchemists' Association I must present this nameplate to you. If you agree, I also want to report this to the Alchemists' Council! If those people learn that Fuyun City has produced such a young Saint-Grade alchemist, they'd be astonished."

Du Wan laughed heartily as if picturing their shocked faces.

"Elder Du, please don't report it," Yang Kai said with a wry face. "High-ranking alchemists are respected and have conveniences, but they also bring many troubles… I don't want people pestering me every day to refine pills — it would waste my time."

Du Wan's expression turned serious; after a pause he said, "Answer me honestly."

Seeing his solemnity, Yang Kai straightened. "Speak, Elder Du."

"Have you ever considered devoting your life to alchemy?" Du Wan asked gravely. "From your performance, you could one day reach the heights of Elder Li. I don't want such talent and aptitude to be wasted."

Yang Kai snorted softly, thinking for a moment. "Elder Du… we're not strangers, so I won't hide it from you. I told you before: I pursue the pinnacle of martial arts; alchemy is merely an aid. One is primary, the other secondary… I still mean that — primary and secondary must not be confused."

Du Wan's face darkened and he looked somewhat disappointed.

"However… alchemy has brought me great benefits on my martial path, so I won't neglect improving my alchemy while I cultivate martial arts."

Du Wan frowned and exhaled softly. "Cultivating both will inevitably leave one a side branch… but you're young and have boundless potential. Very well, I'll try to live a few more years to see whether, while focusing primarily on martial arts, your alchemy can also reach its pinnacle!"

Saying this seemed to lift a weight from him, and he laughed heartily.

Yang Kai grinned back. "Then please wait and see, Elder Du."

"Mm." Du Wan nodded lightly. "I won't report your alchemist rank to the Alchemists' Council if you prefer, but you must promise me one thing."

"What is it?"

"You've met Wu'er, haven't you?" Du Wan asked without waiting for an answer.

Yang Kai nodded.

"What do you think of her?"

"Her talent is uncommon; whether in cultivation or alchemy, she's not someone ordinary can compare to."

Du Wan smiled. "Indeed. There aren't many permanent members in our Alchemists' Association; usually it's just Ye Xiong and Mi Na keeping me company. Ye Xiong is somewhat slow — with enough opportunity he might reach Saint-Grade, but it's unlikely. Mi Na is better than her master Ye Xiong but has limited future prospects; she won't surpass me. As for Wu'er, I have high hopes."

"You mean…?"

"Heh. If you have time, teach Wu'er more. If your alchemical skills vanish with you, I'd die displeased."

"Elder Du, you flatter me," Yang Kai hastened to say.

"I can arrange for Wu'er to take you as her master. How about that?"

Yang Kai let out an incredulous laugh. "Elder Du, I'm too young to take disciples, and I'm tied up with many worries and tasks. I don't have time to care for her. As you suggested, I'll just talk with her more."

"That will do… I won't force you, then."

Du Wan's proposal was understandable to Yang Kai. A martial artist spends long years wandering with great danger; if he died unexpectedly, the alchemical knowledge he held might be lost forever.

Elder Du did not want to see that happen.

Hence his suggestion that Yang Kai mentor Wu'er.

After agreeing to Elder Du, Yang Kai didn't rush back to Tianxiao Sect; he asked Mi Na to send word and then stayed at the Alchemists' Association for a time.

His own alchemical skill still needed improvement; he was only a hair's breadth from Saint-Grade Middle-Level.

Days with Mi Na and Wu'er flew by quickly.

He did not hide his techniques, teaching Mi Na and Wu'er freely to help them grow.

Occasionally Ye Xiong would come by and shamelessly watch.

To Yang Kai's surprise, the spirit formations that he understood quickly became advanced and convoluted in their hands; even with his instruction, they struggled to grasp them.

Yang Kai considered this and accepted it calmly.

He could comprehend them easily because the True Alchemy Formula was imprinted in his Sea of Consciousness; once he glimpsed the mysteries they became immediately clear. Others were different — they had to learn from the beginning.

Wu'er was better off — she had not studied alchemy long and absorbed knowledge quickly. Mi Na was also competent, but Ye Xiong remained stubborn and slow to understand, often remaining baffled despite repeated explanations.

After a few attempts, Ye Xiong felt embarrassed and stopped sneaking lessons.

Over time, Wu'er's attitude toward Yang Kai shifted: initial hostility gave way to fondness and admiration.

The young girl was energetic and headstrong, full of wild ideas; sometimes her offhand remarks even gave Yang Kai new insights.
