## Chapter 166 — The Little Beggar

These benefits could not be obtained by sitting in one’s cave and diligently cultivating. Yang Kai was quite fortunate that he had made the decision to venture out.

“How many days have I been gone?” Yang Kai asked.

“Thirty-five days,” replied the Earth Demon.

It had been so long, yet Yang Kai hadn’t felt the passage of time at all. He hadn’t expected that a single moment of enlightenment would consume such an extended period.

Fortunately, his Dantian was filled with plenty of Yang Liquid, all refined from the bottle of pills Xia Ningshang had given him; otherwise, he would not have had enough to support such a long period of practical comprehension.

Thirty-five days—he wondered how Su Yan was doing now.

However, Yang Kai had confidence in her. Su Yan was no ordinary woman. The last time she had struggled to maintain her composure, it was likely because he was still at the Lingxiao Pavilion, causing her heart to waver.

But this time, he had already departed. With no way back, she could only resist the stirrings of emotion that arose from her cultivation.

She would surely succeed. He believed that when they met again, Su Yan’s strength would have improved significantly. The Ice Heart Technique cultivated not only the body but also emphasized the elevation of one’s state of mind.

“What place is this…” Yang Kai looked around, completely unaware of where he currently was. After running for over thirty days, he estimated that he was very far from the Lingxiao Pavilion.

As he stood there in confusion, Yang Kai’s ears perked up, and he turned to look behind him, where some commotion was coming from.

After waiting quietly for a moment, a convoy came into view from a distance.

Stepping aside to the roadside, Yang Kai watched as the convoy approached.

There were three horse-drawn carriages in the convoy, accompanied by several armed warriors riding tall steeds, galloping toward him.

Standing by the roadside, Yang Kai clearly caught the attention of those warriors. He felt several wary gazes directed at him, but Yang Kai remained calm, showing no reaction, simply standing still.

After more than a month of enlightenment, he had nearly mastered the ability to completely conceal the Yuan Qi within him. Not only could he stand here without revealing any fluctuations of energy, but even if he were to engage in combat, he wouldn’t necessarily emit much Qi.

These warriors appeared to be of low strength; how could they discern Yang Kai’s depth? Thus, their gazes merely flicked over him before they returned to their previous focus.

As the first horse approached, a middle-aged man shouted at Yang Kai, “Little beggar, get out of the way! Don’t block the road!”

Yang Kai frowned, not wanting to cause trouble, and took a few steps back to avoid the dust.

He had intended to stop them and ask where this place was. However, upon seeing the wary expressions of those warriors, he dismissed the thought; it would be troublesome if a misunderstanding arose.

Several horses thundered past him, followed closely by the convoy.

Yang Kai observed closely. Among the three carriages, the one in the middle left deeper tracks on the ground, indicating it must be carrying some valuable items.

As the last carriage passed by, a faint fragrance wafted from it. Through the window, a pair of bright eyes met Yang Kai’s gaze for a brief moment.

This carriage clearly contained women.

Once the convoy had passed, Yang Kai stepped onto the main road, looking in the direction they were headed.

He didn’t know where this place was, but since the convoy was moving in this direction, it must lead to a populated area, so he might as well follow along.

However, after taking only a few steps, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

He noticed that one person from the convoy had split off and was rushing back toward him. It was the same middle-aged man who had shouted at him earlier.

What did he want? To rob him? Yang Kai couldn’t help but chuckle coldly; he was indeed bold. He stood still, not moving.

Before long, the middle-aged man rode his horse up to Yang Kai, pulling on the reins. The tall horse reared up, letting out a loud neigh.

Yang Kai watched him quietly.

The middle-aged man appeared somewhat impatient. He spoke, “Little beggar, consider yourself lucky. My young lady has a kind heart. She said that in this desolate wilderness, there may be bandits or wild beasts lurking, so we’ll take you along.”

After saying this, the middle-aged man bent down, reached out, and grabbed Yang Kai by the collar. Yang Kai initially wanted to resist but quickly held back.

Although the man’s attitude was unpleasant, he bore no malice. After all, Yang Kai had intended to follow them to a populated area, so this action aligned with his own wishes.

The middle-aged man lifted Yang Kai and placed him across the horse’s back. He then kicked the horse’s belly and shouted, turning the horse around to chase after the convoy.

Yang Kai was jolted about, feeling disoriented. Just as he was contemplating, the middle-aged man had returned to the convoy, lifted Yang Kai by the collar again, and tossed him into the air, laughing, “Old Wu, catch him.”

The old coachman driving the first carriage didn’t even lift his eyelids. He flicked the whip in his hand, which coiled around Yang Kai’s waist, gently pulling him back to sit beside him.

The convoy never stopped for a moment.

This old man was quite skilled! Yang Kai shot a surprised glance at Old Wu, estimating that he was at least in the True Yuan Realm.

Though in a sect like the Lingxiao Pavilion, the True Yuan Realm wasn’t particularly impressive, with the younger generation like Su Yan and Jie Hongchen already having reached that level. However, for those small forces and families, the True Yuan Realm was a status they could only look up to.

Moreover, even those in the Separation and Union Realm could dominate in some small places.

Old Wu remained unfazed, his eyelids drooping, his face lined with deep wrinkles, appearing as if he were nearing the end of his life. Noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, he casually handed him a water flask.

“Thank you, sir.” Yang Kai took it and had a sip, only to immediately spit it out.

The warriors on the horses ahead burst into laughter, with someone saying, “Old Wu, why did you give him this kind of strong liquor? Isn’t that asking for his life? Even we don’t dare to touch your liquor.”

Yang Kai felt as if fire was burning in his throat, secretly astonished. He had drunk before, but this was his first encounter with such strong liquor.

“I’ll return it to you.” Yang Kai felt unworthy of such a drink and handed the flask back.

Old Wu took it, gulped down a mouthful, and his withered face seemed to glow with vitality as he expertly drove the carriage.

Having been kindly taken in, Yang Kai didn’t say much, merely sitting quietly beside Old Wu, waiting to part ways when they reached their destination.

The convoy was not moving very quickly, as they were carrying women and had to take care of their comfort. By the time evening fell, they had only covered about seventy to eighty miles.

As night descended, the convoy stopped, finding a place in the wilderness to light a fire and cook. There were about thirty of them, all seasoned hands, each performing their duties, and soon the aroma of food wafted through the air.

Yang Kai got down to stretch, contemplating his insights from the past days and stabilizing his state of mind.

Before long, someone exited the third carriage.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw three women coming down. One was a beautiful matron in her thirties, plump and fair-skinned, exuding an air of grace.

Beside her were two younger women, both in their teens. One was dressed as a maid, her eyes sparkling and charming, helping the other woman walk.

The one being assisted must be the young lady that the middle-aged man had mentioned. This young lady was indeed a delicate beauty; though she couldn’t compare to Su Yan or the Hu sisters, she was still attractive, especially in her floral dress that accentuated her slender figure.

As these three women appeared, Yang Kai distinctly felt many warriors’ gazes shift toward them.

Whether it was the matron’s dignified elegance, the young lady’s charming features, or the maid’s alluring demeanor, they all possessed extraordinary qualities that naturally attracted men’s attention.

While he was watching, the maid suddenly glared at Yang Kai, scolding, “What are you looking at? Keep staring, and I’ll gouge out your eyes!”

Though her tone was fierce and reprimanding, her words seemed to carry a hint of meaning.

The surrounding gazes quickly withdrew.

Yang Kai cleared his throat and averted his gaze.

“Cui’er!” the young lady said softly.

The maid Cui’er grumbled unhappily, supporting the young lady and the matron as they moved aside to rest.

After a moment, the meal was finally served. The group of warriors busied themselves, while the matron and young lady were taken care of by Cui’er. Yang Kai, as an outsider, was completely ignored, sitting alone in a desolate manner, looking quite pitiful.

The matron and young lady clearly noticed him and whispered something to Cui’er. The latter nodded and went to serve some food, bringing it to Yang Kai. “Little beggar, have something to eat.”

Yang Kai did not refuse, extending his hand to take it and thanking her.

Cui’er smiled at him, her smile charming, completely different from her earlier fierce demeanor. She squatted down and whispered, “Little beggar, don’t be angry. I wasn’t scolding you just now.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly. “What did you call me?”

He had been puzzled earlier when the middle-aged man had referred to him that way, but he hadn’t understood at the time. Now Cui’er was calling him the same thing.

“Little beggar, aren’t you?” Cui’er smiled, her eyes crescent-shaped.

“I’m a little beggar?” Yang Kai finally understood; she was saying he was a beggar?

Looking down, Yang Kai was taken aback. His clothes were indeed tattered and covered in dust and stains, looking extremely shabby.

Cui’er laughed even more joyfully, pulling out a small copper mirror from her pocket and holding it up to Yang Kai. “Take a look at your appearance; how do you not resemble a little beggar?”

Casting his eyes over, Yang Kai inhaled sharply.

This… is what I look like now? His hair was a mess, like a bird’s nest, with several strands stuck together, hanging over his shoulders. His face was covered in grime, making it impossible to see his features clearly. Coupled with his shabby clothing, he was indeed the very image of a little beggar!

After comprehending the footwork for over a month, he had ended up in this state. Vaguely, Yang Kai remembered bumping into trees multiple times and falling into puddles several times.

Cui’er smiled as she took back the mirror, asking gently, “Little beggar, where did you come from? Why are you wandering alone in the wilderness?”

Yang Kai replied irritably, “I’ve been begging my way here; I don’t even know where I came from.”

“How pitiful,” Cui’er sighed, wanting to help Yang Kai brush off the dust on his clothes but hesitating, not wanting to dirty her hands, so she could only frown.
