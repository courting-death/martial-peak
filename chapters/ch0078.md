## Chapter 78 — Enlightenment

The fierce dispute among the younger disciples came to a strange and abrupt end, leaving many bewildered and confused.

This conflict involved many parties. The Enforcement Hall dispatched over a hundred disciples at once just to corner Su Yan, which indirectly confirmed her formidable strength.

The other key figure in this incident, Yang Kai, was also well known among the disciples. Some despised him, others envied him, and countless opinions were voiced without end.

At this moment, Yang Kai lay in a deep slumber.

Since leaving the Forest Prison, Yang Kai had fallen into unconsciousness. Though he was beaten by five Enforcement Hall disciples, the injuries were severe but not fatal. Were it not for a persistent energy lingering in his heart, Yang Kai would have long since perished.

Once the matter was settled, the worries in his heart vanished, and naturally, his body could no longer hold on.

When he awoke, Yang Kai was shocked to find himself lying on an unfamiliar bed, his entire body aching. Rolling his eyes to survey his surroundings, he saw the room was simple yet elegant, furnished sparingly, and exuding an air of serene tranquility.

It was reminiscent of Su Yan’s small room in Black Wind Trade Market.

Struggling to sit up, perhaps the noise he made was heard outside, for soon Su Mu pushed open the door, appearing moved as he entered.

Li Yuntian and the others were also present, following Su Mu inside, their expressions heavy with relief as they looked at Yang Kai.

“Senior Brother Yang, how do you feel?” Su Mu stepped forward to help him up.

“I’m fine now.” Yang Kai slightly circulated his Yuan Qi and found no major injuries, only needing a few days to recuperate.

“Once again, Senior Brother saved me. Thank you, Su Mu,” Yang Kai said awkwardly.

“No need to mention it,” Su Mu waved his hand.

“By the way, these are pills my old master gave you—some for healing, others for cultivation.” Su Mu produced a dozen or so bottles and placed them on the bedside table.

“Second Elder?” Yang Kai was surprised. “Isn’t this too much?”

“Not at all. You were gravely injured this time and should recuperate properly.”

“Please convey my thanks to Second Elder on my behalf.”

“No need to thank him.” Su Mu waved his hand, a trace of anger flashing across his face.

Su Xuanwu felt indebted to Yang Kai this time and thus bestowed so many pills. After all, if not for Shopkeeper Meng bringing the Sect Leader’s order at the last moment, Yang Kai might have been sacrificed. Su Mu was displeased with how Su Xuanwu handled the matter and deliberately brought many pills for Yang Kai.

“Where is Senior Sister Su Yan?” Yang Kai turned to ask.

Su Mu’s expression suddenly grew strange. Naturally, he had long learned from Li Yuntian and the others about Yang Kai’s previous exploits. His heart was filled with both fear and admiration. Since childhood, Su Yan had felt less like a sister and more like a mother to him. In her presence, Su Mu never dared to breathe freely.

But looking at Senior Brother Yang, what audacity! He had taken Su Yan’s hand in front of over a hundred people and uttered such bold words.

And afterward, he wasn’t punished by Su Yan! Not only that, but she had arranged for him to recuperate in her own chamber. Such a thing was simply unfathomable!

During Yang Kai’s two days of unconsciousness, Su Mu had pondered deeply but could not unravel the mystery.

Why? Why was it so?

“Ah! Senior Brother Yang!” Su Mu sighed heavily, patting Yang Kai’s shoulder. After careful thought, he said, “My condolences. Since ancient times, there have been many cases of flowers falling with intention but waters flowing without feeling. Senior Brother, you must look at it with a clear heart.”

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then found it somewhat laughable. He knew Su Mu must have misunderstood him and so did not explain further, only asking, “Where is she?”

It was thanks to her timely rescue that Yang Kai had not been forced to use Yang Liquid to kill those Enforcement Hall disciples. Facing them, Yang Kai was not confident in his ability to kill, so he did not take the risk. But once it came to that, there would be no turning back.

“She left you here and then went to Black Wind Trade Market,” Su Mu replied.

“Did Senior Sister say anything before leaving?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously. He had thought Su Yan would surely have something to say, since his actions had been reckless.

“No.” Su Mu shook his head slowly.

Yang Kai inwardly admired her carefree nature. When it came to her reputation, she had not explained the complicated details to anyone. The innocent remain innocent.

After speaking with Su Mu a while longer, Yang Kai let him leave.

Lying on the bed, Yang Kai did not dwell on matters. Things had come to this point; thinking too much would not help. Since Su Mu had brought many pills, it was time to test his earlier conjecture.

Half of the pills were for healing, the other half for cultivation. Overall, their value was considerable.

Yang Kai first took several healing pills, then silently circulated the True Yang Technique, helping the medicine’s effects spread through his body, carefully sensing the changes.

Indeed, the healing pills were quite effective. The medicinal power flowed through his meridians, quickly nourishing and repairing his injuries, greatly reducing the pain.

However, Yang Kai keenly noticed that part of the medicinal power took a detour through his meridians and entered his bones.

Noticing this, Yang Kai raised his brow, increasingly confident in his suspicion.

To verify his guess, Yang Kai spent the entire day continuously consuming various pills.

The final result confirmed that his Proud Bone Golden Body could indeed absorb energies other than yang attributes.

When he had broken through to the Open Origin Realm a few days ago, Yang Kai had this suspicion but lacked proof.

The True Yang Technique was undoubtedly a special and powerful method, allowing him to refine Yang Liquid without limit. The liquid was devastating in battle. Yet, this formidable technique had a glaring limitation: it required a yang-rich environment to cultivate.

Yang Kai had worried that his cultivation might be hindered by the environment, but the tolerance of his Proud Bone Golden Body relieved him of this concern.

When yang energy was present, he cultivated the True Yang Technique; when absent, it did not matter. The Proud Bone Golden Body was not picky, accepting all kinds of energy.

With this dual approach, his strength would not stall for lack of yang energy.

The non-yang energies absorbed by the Proud Bone Golden Body would be fed back to him in battle, enhancing his combat power.

Yang Kai vaguely sensed an indescribable connection between his Proud Bone Golden Body and the True Yang Technique, though the exact nature eluded him for now.

When he came back to his senses, he was startled.

Unconsciously, he had consumed five entire bottles of pills, each containing ten pills—fifty pills in total. Even if these were common-grade and low quality, most people could not withstand such a dose.

Yet he was unharmed, and his injuries had greatly improved.

In the darkness, Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed with a chilling light as he stared at the seven or eight remaining bottles of various pills beside him. A wild idea surged within his heart.

Once this thought emerged, it could not be suppressed.

After a long silence, Yang Kai finally decided to take a gamble.

He reached for a bottle, opened it, and regardless of whether it was a healing or cultivation pill, emptied it into his mouth. Then another bottle, and another...

He swallowed all the remaining pills, licking his lips with satisfaction afterward.

If anyone else saw this scene, they would surely be terrified! These pills were not poisons, but they were not meant to be swallowed like beans. Medicine always carries some toxicity; any pill has limits. Excessive consumption harms the body and can damage cultivation and foundation.

Yet Yang Kai had just swallowed seventy or eighty pills in a single breath.

His belly bulged, and countless faint and gentle medicinal energies mingled and intertwined inside, soon converging into a terrifying power.

Prepared, Yang Kai immediately circulated the True Yang Technique.

That energy surged like a dragon freed from captivity, roaring within his abdomen. Yang Kai groaned, feeling as if his entire abdominal cavity was being torn apart.

The speed of the True Yang Technique accelerated sharply, as if drawn by an irresistible force. The energy from the seventy or eighty pills melted and condensed, drawn slowly into his meridians.

Yang Kai dared not relax, focusing intently.

This dragon-like energy darted through his meridians, clashing with the True Yang Yuan Qi. Though they mingled, they could not fuse.

Moreover, the two energies flowed in opposite directions.

The True Yang Yuan Qi rotated clockwise, while the vast medicinal energy rotated counterclockwise, colliding incessantly. Each clash burned away harmful substances in the medicinal energy, leaving only pure essence.

Yang Kai’s body flickered between light and shadow; his skin instantly flushed crimson. Beneath the surface, every meridian throbbed as if infested with worms, a terrifying sight.

As time passed, impurities in the vast energy were eliminated, and the pure essence gradually flowed into his bones. The Proud Bone Golden Body seemed to transform into a hungry source, voraciously devouring the incoming energy.

Amid the intense pain, Yang Kai’s perception was clearer than ever. It was as if his body had grown eyes, watching how the True Yang Yuan Qi refined the energy and how the Proud Bone Golden Body accepted it, missing not a single detail.

A faint enlightenment dawned.

Yang Kai recalled the battles he had fought since acquiring the Proud Bone Golden Body. Blood splattered, body aching, and his bloodthirsty excitement surged with pain and unyielding will. Each time, his strength rapidly increased, allowing him to defeat and slay opponents stronger than himself.

Especially the fight in the Forest Prison two days ago, where five opponents far stronger than him had beaten him. The scenes were vivid in his mind.

His blood boiled again, and warmth spread through his bones. The energy devoured by the Proud Bone Golden Body fed back to him, briefly boosting his strength.

Not enough! Yang Kai felt something was still missing for him to truly grasp the secret of the Proud Bone Golden Body.

He needed one more true battle!

With this thought, Yang Kai leapt from the bed, panting heavily. Pushing open the door, he glanced left and right, then strode to the door opposite and kicked it open.

Yang Kai guessed Su Mu must be sleeping there since he had heard noises earlier. He wanted to find someone to spar with, and Su Mu was a candidate.

The door swung wide, and Yang Kai immediately saw a smooth back. Just as he was about to challenge, the words caught in his throat.

Under the moonlight, by the windowsill, a graceful figure stirred his heartstrings.

Fair as jade, cool as ice, turning to glance with a thousand sways.

The scene was truly breathtaking, nearly sending Yang Kai’s soul flying.

Indeed, someone was in the room, but not Su Mu as he had imagined—it was Su Yan!
