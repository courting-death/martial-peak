## Chapter 2069 — First Battle of the Dao Origin

"Heh, when brute force failed, you thought you could buy me off?" Yang Kai sneered, "Could you be any more shameless?"

Jiang Lin's face stiffened; he was furious inwardly, but restrained by the disparity in cultivation and dared not truly lose his temper.

Jiang Taisheng, however, burned with rage and bellowed, "Brat, my Jiang Family has already given you enough face—do not push people too far!"

"So what if I do? Want to bite me?" Yang Kai sneered, looking at him with utter contempt.

“You have angered this old man.” Jiang Taisheng’s qi and blood surged violently, nearly driving blood up his throat. His expression turned cruel as he glared at Yang Kai. “Boy, even if you are at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, this old man will teach you a lesson today!”

"Why say so much, just fight!" Yang Kai roared, and the Origin Qi within him surged like mad.

"I have been in the Dao Origin Realm for over a hundred years—how could a green youngster like you compare?" Jiang Taisheng sneered with self-satisfaction.

"A hundred years and you still haven't broken through to the next Stage—your aptitude must be awful, old man," Yang Kai said with scorn.

Jiang Taisheng's anger flared, Origin Qi surging turbulently within him. He no longer wished to waste words on Yang Kai—lest the brat infuriate him to death—and with a slight shift of his foot he vanished, a soft puff echoing where he had stood.

It was the air bursting apart at the speed of his movement.

In the next instant he appeared before Yang Kai like a specter, his face sullen as he hissed, “I'll let you witness the might of a Dao Origin Realm expert honed for a hundred years!”

As he spoke, he lightly thrust a palm toward Yang Kai with an air of effortless elegance.

Power of the Laws swirled around that palm; before it was fully launched, wild winds howled around Yang Kai.

Mo Xiaoqi, standing not far from Yang Kai, paled and her chest heaved violently; she looked as if she could scarcely breathe.

Although Mo Xiaoqi's origins were mysterious and her background noble, and her personal strength was considerable, she had not reached the Dao Origin Realm; under Jiang Taisheng's oppressive Power of the Laws her expression instantly soured.

Yet she had seen much of the world and would not be cowed by Law pressure; she cried out sharply, furiously summoned her inner strength, shook off the Law's oppression, and in a flash darted away.

At that moment, before Jiang Taisheng's palm, a terrifying surge of force erupted — a torrent like mountains overturning and seas surging bulldozed toward Yang Kai.

The gale slapped Yang Kai in the face, his robes snapping; the hair of Zhang Ruoxi, whom he held in his arms, fluttered wildly…

"Trifling tricks and you dare flaunt them!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. Before Jiang Taisheng's Law pressure could press down, he mobilized the Law of Space as well, forming a tight, invisible protection around his body that blocked the opponent's suppression.

The next moment he lifted a hand.

Likewise, a massive energy palm formed before him and struck out at Jiang Taisheng.

The two energy palms, like titans holding up the sky, collided after a single breath.

Accompanied by a thunderous boom, Heaven-and-Earth Energy suddenly went chaotic; shards of Law power sprayed the void and burst outward in all directions…

A faint, almost indiscernible sneer hung upon Yang Kai’s face, while Jiang Taisheng’s eyes suddenly narrowed, a trace of shock flashing across his aged features as he muttered in disbelief, “How can this be?”

As the words left his mouth, his own palm—still charged with Law power—was pressed down by the palm Yang Kai had struck; that palm continued downward with undiminished force.

Jiang Taisheng's face changed drastically; he realized why—Yang Kai's Origin Qi was denser and purer than his own.

After all, such a killing technique that directly used the body's Origin Qi hinged on the quality and quantity of that Origin Qi!

He had assumed, seeing Yang Kai's youth, that the young man's recent ascent to the Dao Origin Realm meant his foundation might be unstable and not comparable to a century-steeped veteran like himself; but in that one move he discovered he had been mistaken.

Seeing the giant palm come down, Jiang Taisheng dared not remain where he was; he twisted his body and dodged, surging dozens of zhang into the air, glaring at Yang Kai with a sullen expression.

Yang Kai showed no intention of pursuing; he stood there and looked at Jiang Taisheng with a mocking expression, that sneer like a barb that sank into his heart and left him thoroughly ill at ease.

"Damn!" Jiang Taisheng growled. With many from the Jiang Family watching, his dignity was on the line; gritting his teeth, he clenched his hand in the void and in an instant a tiger‑headed great blade materialized in his palm.

The great blade was clearly a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure: heavy blade, carved with intricate esoteric patterns, the hilt fashioned as a lifelike tiger head—an imposing sight.

Clearly, because his Origin Qi could not match Yang Kai's, he meant to rely on his Secret Treasure's might.

This Secret Treasure was the Jiang Family's treasured heirloom; as a Dao Origin-Grade object, only he could wield it, and he had always kept it under his care.

Origin Qi poured wildly into the blade; Jiang Taisheng's face twisted into a savage stare as he fixed Yang Kai in his sights with the intent to kill.

A tiger's roar shook heaven and earth as the blade suddenly spat out a ghostly projection of a tiger; as Jiang Taisheng poured more power in, the tiger's image thickened until, in a short while, it became as real as a demonic beast.

It radiated the aura that only an Eleventh-Tier demonic beast could possess!

The giant tiger measured five or six zhang in length, howling to the heavens with extraordinary momentum. Jiang Taisheng raised the treasure high and slashed down with murderous force, shouting, "Go!"

The tiger immediately strode forward, its two blood-red eyes fixed on Yang Kai, charging like a thunderbolt.

Yang Kai snorted coldly; he neither dodged nor summoned a Secret Treasure—he simply strode out boldly to meet the tiger.

"Presumptuous!" Jiang Taisheng roared; following close behind the tiger, he lurched forward with the blade, his body wrapped in blade-light and becoming a dazzling streak.

Soon the tiger reached Yang Kai and lunged with its jaws; its fangs were even clearly visible.

Yang Kai clasped Zhang Ruoxi tighter in his arms, formed a fist with his free hand, and in a blur unleashed numerous afterimages of his punches, raining blows on the giant tiger like a storm.

Bam, bam, bam…

Strong, rhythmic impacts rang out; the giant tiger whimpered like a living creature, its body contorted and warped, and in less than three breaths it suddenly collapsed and disintegrated.

Seeing this, the Jiang Family members who had been watching the Dao Origin Realm duel turned suddenly grim.

But in the next moment, Jiang Taisheng, wrapped in blade-light, lunged before Yang Kai; the blade-light swelled into a giant blade ten or more zhang long and came crashing down toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai twisted his body and narrowly avoided that terrifying strike.

The blade-light gouged the earth, leaving a chasm over five zhang deep; soil flew and sand stirred in a violent gust.

Before Jiang Taisheng could act again, Yang Kai suddenly threw a punch into the blade-light.

A crisp sound rang out and a muffled grunt followed; Jiang Taisheng's figure reappeared a dozen or so zhang away, his face ghastly as he crossed his blade before him.

On the blade there appeared a blurred dent—the shape looked as if a fist had struck it.

"Your physical strength…" Jiang Taisheng stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, his eyes trembling violently.

Yang Kai had, with a single punch, dented his Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure; its spirit seemed slightly damaged—what manner of terrifying body must this man possess?

Was he even human?

While Jiang Taisheng was stunned, Yang Kai's expression turned fierce and he flicked his fingers; a volley of ink-black Moon Blades shot out like a sudden downpour.

Jiang Taisheng's face changed as he cried out, "Spatial Force?"

Once he discerned that those ink-black Moon Blades were all condensed from Spatial Force, he no longer dared linger where he was and hurriedly tried to evade.

But the Moon Blades clung like maggots to his heels, their speed astonishing, leaving him breathless in flight.

"Hahaha—Jiang Family's old dog, where do you think you can run to? Do you think running will save you? If I do not turn your Jiang Family upside down today, this won't be over!" Yang Kai laughed and shouted, his demeanor supremely unconcerned.

Elsewhere, the Jiang Family cultivators watching all turned pale.

Their dependable elder, after only two exchanges with Yang Kai, had fled madly like a beaten dog—unable to even retaliate—which made them immediately realize how serious this trouble might be.

"Family Head!" an elder of the Jiang Family said gravely, "Let us all strike together and aid the elder!"

"Yes!" others chimed in, "It seems the elder cannot withstand this man."

Jiang Lin's expression darkened; his gaze swept the nearby battlefield, then glanced elsewhere as he said coldly, "Rather than risk helping the elder, we'd better deal with her."

Everyone followed Jiang Lin's gaze and saw Mo Xiaoqi standing seemingly idle, serenely observing the fight as if she had no concern for Yang Kai's safety.

"Right—Yang Kai came out with that woman, so they must be closely connected; if we capture her, Yang Kai will fall into line, won't he?" Jiang Chuhe's eyes brightened and he let his gaze roam over Mo Xiaoqi's lovely figure; when he noticed the crescent-shaped birthmark on her face, he sighed as if moved by some private thought.

The Jiang Family members exchanged looks, then suddenly surged toward Mo Xiaoqi.

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen Void King Realm experts had tightly surrounded Mo Xiaoqi, leaving no gap.

"What are you doing?" Mo Xiaoqi frowned, displeased; she looked around.

“Heh heh heh…” Jiang Chuhe let out a low, sinister chuckle. “Young lady, do you truly not understand what we intend? Be sensible and cooperate. If we have to make a move and you get hurt by accident… that would be unfortunate.”
