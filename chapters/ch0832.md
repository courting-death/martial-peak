## Chapter 832 — Sun Yu's Opportunity

Two months slipped by in the blink of an eye.

Sun Yu, who had been staying by Yang Kai's side, advanced at an astonishing rate; in the short span of two months he had risen from True Yuan Realm, Seventh Stage, to the very peak of the True Yuan Realm!

Sun Yu was ecstatic beyond measure.

He was only about fifteen now — not exceptionally gifted, but not poor either. At his previous pace, reaching the True Yuan Realm peak would have taken at least a year or more.

But now he had done it in only two months.

He knew full well that all of this was thanks to that senior surnamed Yang, and his attitude toward Yang Kai grew ever more respectful and reverent.

During these two months the senior had merely supplied him with crystal stones for cultivation, and every day gave him a single drop of an unidentified medicinal liquid.

Sun Yu couldn't say what mysteries the liquid concealed, but after taking it continuously for two months he felt as if he had been reborn.

His body grew lighter, his meridians tougher and broader, his flesh moved with newfound strength, and most importantly his True Yuan had become incomparably purer and denser; as it flowed through his meridians Sun Yu could even discern subtle sounds.

All of these were signs of growing power.

The most obvious evidence was how quickly he consumed crystal stones while training.

Where once a single crystal stone would take him five or six days to fully absorb, now one per day barely sufficed.

The rate of consumption kept accelerating.

Fortunately, this senior Yang seemed extraordinarily wealthy; crystal stones were no concern — every time he finished a pile, one word was enough and a fresh batch would appear.

Moreover, he provided a large supply of pills for cultivation — Mystery-Grade pills, Spirit-Grade pills, and so many more.

Sun Yu was moved to tears with gratitude.

He understood that although the senior had not taught him any miraculous techniques or martial skills, he had fundamentally improved Sun Yu's body, constitution, and aptitude — a change that would benefit him for life.

Was this the legendary stroke of fate? Sun Yu's heart raced; he was wildly excited.

Back when he was in the palace he had often heard his master and fellow disciples talk about those who encountered great opportunities that others might never meet in a lifetime and so shot to the skies — becoming like dragons — but Sun Yu had always treated such tales as legend.

After all, such fortune couldn't be lucked into casually, could it?

Yet now, for everything happening to him, the only fitting word was 'opportunity'; he could not explain it otherwise.

He was grateful he had been among the last to enter Dragon Valley, grateful to have been pulled into that golden world by that inexplicable force, and grateful to have met a benefactor like Senior Yang.

Sun Yu already pictured a bright future beckoning to him.

He threw himself into cultivation all the more, not daring to slack off for even a moment — opportunities like this did not come to everyone, and he feared wasting the chance or failing the senior who had nurtured him.

He wished he could be in two places at once — foregoing food and sleep.

Yang Kai watched Sun Yu's efforts and was very pleased.

The boy had perseverance, resolve, obedience, and could endure loneliness.

Yang Kai's appreciation for him deepened.

Originally Yang Kai only intended to give him a little favor to keep him quiet, but seeing him train so hard he began to cultivate him wholeheartedly.

Every day he gave him a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye; crystal stones and the Mystery- and Spirit-Grade pills Yang refined were freely supplied without limit.

Every hard-working person deserved such an opportunity.

Thinking of his own hardships in pursuit of strength, Yang Kai couldn't help wanting to help him up.

What was rare was that Sun Yu knew how to relax at the right times; after breaking through to the True Yuan peak and training a while, encountering a bottleneck, he did not press impatiently but relaxed, watched Yang Kai refine pills, and asked questions about martial ways.

Ascending from True Yuan to Divine Roaming was a real hurdle — Yang Kai had been stuck there himself once and had experience — so with a few casual pointers Sun Yu's eyes brightened, and after pondering for a day and night he resumed training.

Days passed.

One day, while Yang Kai was refining pills, he suddenly sensed a ripple of Divine Sense power from Sun Yu beside him and smiled, setting down his work to watch closely.

Now was the crucial moment for Sun Yu to open his Sea of Consciousness; no one could help — it all depended on his own effort.

The process of opening the Sea of Consciousness lasted several days, and Yang Kai witnessed Sun Yu's grit; several times he nearly failed, but he stubbornly pushed through.

When that chaotic darkness tore apart and a vacant, formless space abruptly appeared, Sun Yu's aura changed in subtle ways.

Divine Roaming Realm! He had finally broken through.

Yang Kai breathed out inexplicably; after spending so many days with the boy and seeing his effort, of course he hoped for his success.

Fortunately, Sun Yu held on.

The newly formed Sea of Consciousness was empty and contained nothing — completely unlike Yang Kai's, since Yang Kai had cultivated Divine Sense while still in the True Yuan Realm and his Sea of Consciousness had already gathered much Divine Sense power, forming a sea.

Sun Yu had to start from scratch, gathering Divine Sense power bit by bit to form his own Sea of Consciousness.

"Senior…" Sun Yu cried out, face alight with excitement and slightly incoherent, "I… I've reached the Divine Roaming Realm…"

Yang Kai smiled and nodded. "Do you notice anything different from before?"

"Yes — even with my eyes closed I seem to see clearly around me."

"As your Divine Sense grows, what you can perceive and how far will increase. Right now your Divine Sense is but a candle in the wind — keep working at it."

"Yes!" Sun Yu replied respectfully and hurriedly closed his eyes to sit in meditation.

Soon after he opened his eyes again, troubled, and stammered, "But senior… I don't know how to cultivate Divine Sense power… Master never taught this."

When he came to Dragon Valley he was only at True Yuan, Seventh Stage; his master Ling Jian had expected Sun Yu would need at least two more years to reach Divine Roaming, planning to teach him systematically then.

Yang Kai laughed in mild surprise and generously shared his own insights and experience.

Sun Yu listened, nodding repeatedly.

"Yes — the best way to cultivate Divine Sense power is to sacrifice and temper a Divine Soul Secret Treasure; it's very beneficial for your growth," Yang Kai pondered, then smiled, "I happen to have one suited to you."

As he spoke he flipped his hand and a delicate short sword suddenly appeared.

This little sword Yang Kai had seized from Po Jing Lake during the Succession War in War City years ago; it had been with him some time and was only Heaven-Grade, Upper-Level. As Yang Kai's strength rose, this Spirit-Soul Short Sword had seen little use.

Sun Yu quickly waved it aside. "Senior, you've already given me so much, this secret treasure…"

"I don't need it. It's only Heaven-Grade, Upper-Level — keeping it is wasteful, but it's just right for your current realm."

Hearing that, Sun Yu hesitated a moment but didn't quibble. He respectfully took it with both hands and said solemnly, "Thank you for granting the treasure. Sun Yu will not disgrace your favor!"

Yang Kai chuckled, casually wiping away his own spirit aura from the sword, and said lightly, "Temper it yourself — once you can absorb this treasure into your Sea of Consciousness, that will do."

"Yes!" Sun Yu replied earnestly and immediately began the tempering.

Yang Kai paid him no further mind and continued refining pills.

After so much dedicated study and countless times of refining pills, Yang Kai could now easily produce Saint-Grade pills.

He had evidently become a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist!

He was only one level away from meeting the requirement to rescue the Ancient Demon Clan.

There were few Saint-Grade alchemists across the entire continent.

Du Wan of Giant Stone City was of that level; wherever he went he received respect, and he presided over the Alchemists' Association there. With Yang Kai's current True Alchemy Formula and skills, if he wished he could reach Du Wan's standing.

But alchemy had always been an aid for Yang Kai — a study to support his pursuit of martial path.

His sole wish remained to seek the pinnacle of martial Dao.

In the process of refining pills, the wondrous applications of Divine Sense Fire revealed many issues and insights Yang Kai had not previously considered, giving him greater understanding of controlling Divine Sense Fire.

Although he was now only a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist, Yang Kai estimated that with Wan Yao Ling Ye and spirit formations he had a chance of producing middle-level Saint-Grade pills.

The golden ocean of energy still wrapped around them like an impenetrable fortress; the small dragon-shaped pattern behind Yang Kai had manifested and was devouring the energy, growing larger and more imposing — exuding an aura that put one's heart on edge.

Yang Kai remained calm, working on his affairs and waiting.

He had not had so much uninterrupted time to do as he pleased in a long while, and this upheaval was an opportunity.

Like the golden dragon, Sun Yu grew rapidly day by day; after his constitution was improved by Wan Yao Ling Ye, cultivation came to him smoothly.

The Spirit-Soul Short Sword Yang Kai gave him was absorbed into his Sea of Consciousness in only a month's time; after testing its power several times he was delighted.

His Sea of Consciousness now possessed respectable Divine Sense power.

With plentiful crystal stones and pills daily, answers to questions while training, and guidance when baffled, Sun Yu felt luckier than anyone and treated Yang Kai with the reverence of a master and elder — utterly respectful.
