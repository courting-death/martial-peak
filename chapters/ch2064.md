## Chapter 2064 — Mine

After a brief exchange, the man in the white robe flashed into the cave, stood upon an array, produced several Source Crystals, and placed them into the slots around the formation. With a hand gesture the array immediately began to operate.

With a low hum and a faint ripple of spatial force, the man in white soon vanished.

The other Jiang Family warrior on guard here averted his gaze and closed his eyes to recuperate.

After about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, a small animal suddenly dropped down beside a little earthen mound three li from the cave, and right behind it Mo Xiaoqi and Yang Kai appeared.

The little beast sniffed forward, then gave a sharp chirp.

Mo Xiaoqi frowned and, worried, turned to Yang Kai. “Eldest Brother, Xiao Fu says Ruoxi’s aura vanished into that cave.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew grave at once; he immediately released his Divine Sense and probed in that direction.

After a moment he gave a soft exclamation: “A Space Array?”

“There’s a Space Array in there?” Mo Xiaoqi asked in astonishment, looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded. “Yes, and it looks like it was used not long ago — there are traces of spatial force lingering around. A warrior at the First Stage of the Void King Realm is guarding inside… it seems we haven’t come to the wrong place.”

“Should we go in?” Mo Xiaoqi asked, seeking his opinion.

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded, then his face suddenly changed; he shouted, “Not good, Ruoxi might be in danger!”

He suddenly realized he had only just finished gathering intelligence from the Jiang Family. Now someone had used a Space Array here; it very well could be related to the Jiang Family — perhaps some high-ranking Jiang Family member had sent a message here, or they intended to silence Zhang Ruoxi to cover things up.

Thinking that, Yang Kai tensed and no longer worried about concealment; in a flash he shot straight toward the cave.

Inside the cave the Jiang Family warrior on watch was sharp-eyed; the instant Yang Kai moved he sensed it and opened his eyes. A streak of light rushed toward him and his expression changed drastically.

He forced a surge of Saint Yuan into his limbs and lurched to his feet, staring ahead with a hostile look.

But when Yang Kai’s aura enveloped him, the Jiang Family warrior immediately went pale and cried out, “Dao Origin Realm!”

He was only a First Stage of the Void King Realm warrior; his Domain Field had only just condensed. How could he possibly contend with an expert at the Dao Origin Realm?

No sooner had the words left his mouth than Yang Kai stood before him, lightly pressing a palm to the man’s chest. The man felt a crushing force at his heart and was flung backward, bleeding profusely through the air; when he hit the ground he was unconscious.

Yang Kai did not finish the man off — after all, he still did not understand Zhang Ruoxi’s situation or how the Jiang Family was involved, and he could not bring himself to kill rashly.

Still, the strike would keep the man out cold for several days, long enough for Yang Kai to uncover the truth.

Upon landing, Yang Kai’s gaze immediately turned to the Space Array inside the cave.

Mo Xiaoqi caught up at this moment.

A moment later Yang Kai could not help but make a small sound of surprise.

“Eldest Brother, what did you find?” Mo Xiaoqi asked.

“This array… it wasn’t set by the Jiang Family, and it wasn’t put in recently; it seems quite old,” Yang Kai said, frowning.

The Space Array in the cave was ancient and mottled, bearing countless marks of time; clearly it had existed for many years. Yet it had remained hidden within this desolate mountain cave and was unlikely to have been discovered by chance.

How the Jiang Family had discovered this place, and where it had been used to transmit to, was unclear.

“Could something be hidden here?” Mo Xiaoqi’s interest was piqued; peculiar light shone in her eyes as she examined the formation.

“We’ll investigate later.” Worried for Zhang Ruoxi’s safety, Yang Kai had no mind for a thorough examination. He stepped onto the array, and Mo Xiaoqi nodded and followed.

Yang Kai immediately activated his Spatial Force and channeled it into the formation.

In the next instant the array hummed; light flickered, and the two vanished.

They appeared in a dark, damp environment an unknown number of zhang below ground.

But before they could properly take in their surroundings, a harsh shout cracked through the gloom: “Who are you to dare trespass into my Jiang Family’s secret grounds!”

As the words fell, two violent attacks struck from the left and right without warning, and from the energy fluctuations the two assailants were unmistakably Third Stage Void King Realm warriors!

Yang Kai’s eyes chilled instantly; without looking he bellowed, “Condense!”

The Power of the Laws of Space rose and, as if obeying orders, the surrounding space suddenly stiffened into an extreme rigidity.

Both attacks that had been about to smash into Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi dissipated; two figures were revealed to their left and right.

The two attackers seemed stunned that their strikes had been nullified in such an unfathomable way and froze in place.

The man on the left recovered first, shouting, “Power of the Laws — Dao Origin Realm!”

He stomped his feet and backed away, seeing the dire situation and attempting to flee.

Yang Kai would not allow that. With a flick of his fingers a strand of Golden Blood Threads shot out, circled the man and bound him directly.

Feeling the cutting edge emanating from the Golden Blood Threads, cold sweat broke out on the man’s brow. He dared not move, fearing he would be sliced to pieces; he straightened and stared at Yang Kai in terror.

The other man stood there gaping as well.

Before him Mo Xiaoqi held a sharp dagger that shone with a chill light, its tip pressed against the man’s chest.

Clearly, while the man had been distracted, Mo Xiaoqi had subdued him with decisive, thunderous force.

Yang Kai swept his gaze over the two and his face was cold.

The man on the left trembled and asked, “Who are you two? Why did you break into our Jiang Family's secret grounds and attack us?”

“You don’t need to know who I am. I came here to find someone. Cooperate and maybe I’ll spare your life,” Yang Kai said coldly, his tone grave.

“Looking for someone?” The man’s brow furrowed and he stared at Yang Kai anxiously, a bead of sweat sliding down his forehead as he asked with difficulty, “May I ask whom you seek?”

“Is there a girl here named Zhang Ruoxi?” Yang Kai asked.

The two Jiang Family Void King warriors exchanged a glance. The one who had spoken earlier forced a bitter smile and said, “We were only ordered to guard the entrance; we do not know the names of those people…”

“Eldest Brother, don’t ask — Xiao Fu has already sniffed out Ruoxi’s aura; she really is here!” Mo Xiaoqi suddenly announced excitedly.

Yang Kai looked over and indeed saw the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat’s eyes flashing as it chirped and pointed in a direction, as if it had truly found something.

“This area is yours. I’ll borrow Xiao Fu for a moment.” Having said that, Yang Kai sent several bursts of Origin Qi toward the two Third Stage Void King warriors; both made a muffled groan as blood dribbled from their mouths.

He then waved to the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, which immediately flew forward.

“Eldest Brother, be careful — something odd seems to be here!” Mo Xiaoqi warned from behind.

Yang Kai nodded and continued without slowing down.

As they flew onward, Yang Kai finally had a chance to scrutinize the surroundings.

It was plainly an underground mine: the tunnels branched in all directions, and from the bottoms of some side passages came the clinking of tools — someone was clearly mining.

But the places Yang Kai passed through had already been cleared; only bare rock remained.

Following the little beast’s lead, Yang Kai soon entered a side passage.

In that branch he sensed many sentient auras.

Not long after, by the dim light in the mine, Yang Kai saw many people hammering at the mine walls, with debris constantly falling.

What concerned Yang Kai was that all these people were below the Saint King Realm in cultivation; none of them had reached the Origin Returning Realm.

They were all shackled with special wrist and ankle chains that rattled at the slightest movement, making it impossible to hide their whereabouts.

Perhaps sensing him, the laborers looked up at Yang Kai together.

A host of dull, lifeless gazes made Yang Kai’s heart sink. He couldn’t tell how long they had been penned down here, nor how many days they’d been forced to mine. Every one of these cultivators below the Saint King Realm looked utterly spent, clothes in tatters; only a scant few still clung to a shred of spirit.

Nearby on the ground lay several rotting corpses, and the foul stench filled the poorly ventilated tunnels.

Yang Kai halted and glanced around, then said, “Who’s in charge here? Step forward and speak!”

The workers fell silent, looking at one another; most showed obvious fear and seemed unwilling to step forward.

After a long while, a youth stepped out. He looked not yet thirty, wore tattered clothes that revealed a solid build, and though his aura was weak it was stronger than the others.

He stopped a short distance from Yang Kai, cupped his fist and said, “I am Zhou Kang. May I ask what instruction Senior has?”

Yang Kai looked about the same age but was far stronger, so the youth naturally assumed Yang Kai was a long-lived elder and called him Senior.

“Who are you all, and why are you here?” Yang Kai asked sternly.

Zhou Kang looked at Yang Kai in surprise, then seemed to realize something and brightened: “Senior, aren’t you from the Jiang Family?”
