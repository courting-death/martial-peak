## Chapter 1382 — Still Not Showing Yourself?

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, growing even more confident. He reached into the Spatial Ring and took out a jade vial, handing it to Brother Ge. "I don't have Flowing Flame Fireblaze or Soul Cleansing Divine Water, but Brother Ge, take a look—see whether this pill meets your elder's requirements."

After a few words, Ge Qi's expression remained somewhat guarded, but his emotions finally steadied. He glanced at Yang Kai with suspicion, then forced a smile and reached out with both hands to take the jade vial.

Bowing an apology, Ge Qi carefully unscrewed the cap. In an instant a pure fragrance washed over him, causing his brow to lift in surprise and astonishment; the scent filled his nostrils and he found himself inexplicably refreshed.

When he poured the pill from the vial, Ge Qi's eyes went wide.

"This is..." Yan Pei, sitting beside them, sat bolt upright; his eyes were fixed on the pill without blinking, his face full of disbelief.

Although Ge Qi had retreated with his Elder for years, as a practitioner of the Origin Returning Realm he still possessed some ability to discern objects.

And Yan Pei, as the chief auctioneer of Jubao Tower, had handled countless valuable items over the years, so his eye was naturally extraordinary.

The two of them instantly saw the pill's extraordinary nature.

"An Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill?" Yan Pei exclaimed in shock; heedless of decorum, he snatched the pill from Ge Qi's hand and cupped it in his palm to examine it closely.

"Really an Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill?" Ge Qi asked, as if in a dream, unable to believe it.

"Yes, it is indeed an Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill! The coloration, the fragrance, the medicinal power contained within—it's precisely at the level only such a pill could possess!" Yan Pei murmured.

No wonder he lost his composure; on Dark Star, Origin-Grade Upper-Level pills were virtually legendary. Here the highest rank for alchemists was Origin-Grade Lower-Level; there was no way to advance further, and as everyone knew, alchemy carried a high failure rate. So even those Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemists could not guarantee they could produce an Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill.

Occasionally by luck an Origin-Grade Middle-Level pill would be produced, but each such pill was priceless—if one was made it would be hoarded by the great powers, never seen by the outside world.

As for the even higher Origin-Grade Upper-Level pills...frankly, given Dark Star's alchemical standards, no one could refine them.

Over the years Jubao Tower had acquired a few such pills, but without exception they were found in ruins. After the passage of time most of the pills had their effects condensed and were unusable; only one was auctioned off, and Yan Pei faintly remembered how the great powers on Dark Star went mad over it and nearly came to blows.

That auction nearly collapsed; whenever he recalled it Yan Pei still shuddered.

Now, after so many years, another Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill had appeared before his eyes; regardless of its effect, its value was incalculable.

However, since Yang Kai had produced this pill at this moment, Yan Pei had some guesses as to its purpose.

"This is a Purifying Spirit Pill—has Elder Yan heard of it?" Yang Kai said with a slight smile, lifting his teacup and taking a sip.

"Purifying Spirit Pill—so it really is a Purifying Spirit Pill!" Yan Pei breathed, "This truly is the right medicine for the problem!"

"Elder Yan, you mean..." Ge Qi glanced at Yan Pei anxiously and asked timidly.

"Take it." Yan Pei placed the Purifying Spirit Pill into the jade vial and tossed it to Ge Qi. "This one Purifying Spirit Pill is enough to resolve Brother Ge's crisis. Its effect doesn't match the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, but it's even better than the Flowing Flame Fireblaze he wanted."

"Really?" Ge Qi rejoiced.

"Would I lie to you?" Yan Pei snorted softly. "Brother Ge didn't send you to ask for a pill because he thought Origin-Grade Upper-Level pills didn't exist, so he settled for trying to trade for news of a Flowing Flame Fireblaze or Soul Cleansing Divine Water. But now that there is a high-quality pill that fits the need, what use are those? Brother Ge is fortunate."

Hearing this, Ge Qi's face lit up. He carefully placed the Purifying Spirit Pill into his Spatial Ring and thanked Yang Kai profusely.

“No need. Brother Ge and I are merely taking what each of us requires.” Yang Kai smiled and waved his hand. This Spirit Purifying Pill was something he had casually refined during his last seclusion. He had produced quite a few pills during that time, but not many of Upper-Level Origin-Grade—only two or three in total—and this Spirit Purifying Pill happened to be one of them.

At the auction, hearing from Yan Pei that the owner of the Star Emperor Token wanted information about the Flowing Flame Fireblaze and Soul Cleansing Divine Water, Yang Kai guessed that the man's Sea of Consciousness might be damaged; if so, the Purifying Spirit Pill was undoubtedly the best choice.

After Ge Qi took the Purifying Spirit Pill, he handed the Star Emperor Token to Yang Kai. Yang Kai toyed with it and found it no different from the token he had obtained previously in the Flowing Flame Sandland—practically identical—and casually tossed it into his Spatial Ring.

Having completed his task, Ge Qi was eager to leave and return to his ancestor so he could administer the Purifying Spirit Pill.

Before departing, Ge Qi cupped his fists solemnly and said, "If my ancestor survives this calamity, our family will certainly pay a visit—please do not take offense, Miss Yang Yan!"

With that he bowed to Yan Pei, then hurried away.

In the side chamber, Yang Kai rubbed his nose and exchanged a look with Yan Pei; both were puzzled. Ge Qi's words as he left carried meaning—he said his elder would visit Yang Yan, not Yang Kai, which was intriguing.

"Elder Yan, this Brother Ge..."

"Young friend, there's no need to pry. If my old friend truly intends to visit, you will naturally learn of his background; if he doesn't, I won't tell outsiders his status. But one thing I can let you know: though my old friend has secluded himself for years, he was once a man of great renown!" Yan Pei smiled enigmatically, then lowered his voice and asked, "By the way, Young friend Yang, that Purifying Spirit Pill you just produced..."

Yang Kai, knowing exactly what he was thinking, quickly shook his head: "No more. This is the only one."

Yan Pei clearly wasn't easily convinced, but he didn't press further; instead he looked at Yang Kai thoughtfully: "Could this pill be something you obtained earlier?"

"Indeed," Yang Kai nodded. "You probably know where I come from. Even outside, Origin-Grade Upper-Level pills are rare, so I'm afraid I must disappoint you."

"Is that so," Yan Pei exhaled and smiled brightly. "No matter. If someday you come across other high-quality pills, feel free to consign them to my Jubao Tower for auction; the price will surely satisfy you."

"Certainly, certainly," Yang Kai replied offhandedly.

Yan Pei chuckled and rose. "Mm, I will do my best regarding your request. If I truly locate any excellent earth-type treasures, I will have someone inform you."

"Thank you very much, Elder," Yang Kai also stood. "I will take my leave now."

Upon leaving Jubao Tower, Yang Kai wore a worried expression, glancing at Yang Yan from time to time and secretly wondering what the woman had done before meeting him—why Ge Qi had been so terrified and cautious upon seeing her.

He had no clue; Yang Yan was rather mysterious—the more he interacted with her, the less he could fathom her.

But one thing Yang Kai could be sure of: Yang Yan had no ill will toward him.

"Yang Kai, it seems someone has set their sights on us," Yang Yan said softly as they left Tianyun City.

"Oh?" Yang Kai immediately released his Divine Sense and soon detected someone indeed hiding nearby. Their cultivation levels were not high—the leader was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—and, moreover, they did not appear to be a single group.

Although these people harbored ill intent, they bore no intent to kill. Yang Kai pondered briefly and immediately understood who was watching them. He smiled faintly and said, "Ignore them; this is Tianyun City, they won't dare act. Let's return first."

Saying that, he and Yang Yan used their movement techniques and flew toward Dragon Lair Mountain.

A moment later they arrived before the mountain-protecting array and landed. Yang Kai instructed, "You go ahead; I'll talk with these people."

"Mm." Yang Yan nodded and said nothing further. She strode into the array, which did not hinder her at all; she pressed on and her figure vanished.

After Yang Yan left, Yang Kai turned and a slight smile curled at his lips as he called out loudly, "You have followed us this far—why don't you show yourselves?"

The surroundings were silent, with no movement.

Yang Kai was not surprised. He smiled faintly: "Since you won't reveal yourselves, then I'll go in. Perhaps we'll meet again."

Just as Yang Kai was about to leave, the hidden warriors could no longer contain themselves. On the left, a ripple spread and a group of five or six people materialized strangely; on the right, a burst of light flashed and several more warriors appeared.

As the two waves appeared they glared at one another fiercely, the air tense as if on the verge of drawing swords.

The group on the left bore traces of yao qi; their clothes were embroidered with birds, fish, insects, and beasts—undoubtedly disciples of Myriad Beasts Mountain. Only Myriad Beasts Mountain's disciples, who dealt with demonic beasts daily, would carry such yao qi.

The group on the right had cultivation levels similar to the left, but the fluctuations of their qi and blood were markedly stronger, and a faint stench of blood clung to them.

People of the Demon Blood Sect!

Yang Kai's gaze landed on someone among the right-side group. He raised an eyebrow, cupped his fist, and smiled, "Brother Deng, long time no see."

The man forced a wry smile, appearing helpless, and returned the greeting: "Brother Yang, you still look the same!"

Their familiar exchange caused the Myriad Beasts Mountain disciples on the left to blanch slightly, while the leader of the right-side Origin Returning Realm group brightened and asked Deng Ning, "Do you know this young lad?"
