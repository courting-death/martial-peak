## Chapter 1698 — Pang Zhen

After a long while, light, frivolous footsteps finally sounded from the wooden cabin; moments later a handsome young man stepped out. He looked to be only about twenty years old and his cultivation was only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. He looked at Yang Kai with a mix of resentment and dread, his eyes flashing with disbelief, as if he could not understand how he had been found so easily.

Their eyes met; a faint smile appeared at the corner of Yang Kai's mouth, while the handsome youth stiffened as if facing a mortal enemy.

“How did you discover that I was hiding here?” The youth finally could no longer bear the silent pressure. Yang Kai’s presence now weighed heavily on him, and he could no longer maintain his earlier calm composure. “I'm sure left no trace behind!”

“Finding you wasn't easy.” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “If not for your Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu, I'm afraid I really wouldn't have found you.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai pointed to the several martial artists he had bound.

The youth's face darkened; he glanced at the subordinates he had implanted with the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu and a look of vexation flashed across his eyes.

He had not expected that merely subduing a few followers would turn out to be such a grave mistake.

He had been extremely cautious. This time, after fleeing to Xiaguang Island to recover from his injuries, the few people he had subdued were all of low strength — normally, it should have been impossible for anyone to notice him. Yet somehow, Yang Kai had still spotted a flaw.

“Even so, if you want to kill me it will be difficult; you tried before and failed. How about this: let us make a bargain?” the youth proposed arrogantly, lifting his chin.

“Not interested.” Yang Kai shook his head.

The youth was stunned. “You refuse without hearing? Aren't you afraid you'll regret it?”

“There's nothing to regret. Today you will certainly die!” Yang Kai sneered.

The youth laughed loudly, mocking Yang Kai with a scornful, worldly tone: “Boy, you sure can brag. I escaped from you last time; I'll escape again. But if you stop chasing me, I might give you something useful — a lifetime's worth of benefit!”

“What could you, a man who commands strange insects and beasts, possibly give me?” Yang Kai said with amusement.

The youth's expression shifted; his brows tightened and he probed cautiously, “Do you know my true background?”

“Whether I know or not makes no difference. Today I tell you to die. Then you must die!” Yang Kai snorted, no longer wasting words, and reached out as if to shroud him.

“You have gall!” the youth shouted, refusing to dodge; instead he charged straight at Yang Kai. Saint Yuan within his body surged violently, on the verge of bursting.

He knew that at his current strength he was no match for Yang Kai, so he had not intended to protect this body. Instead he planned to self-destruct the vessel, disrupt Yang Kai's sight, and use the chaos to flee.

Yang Kai looked at him mockingly and made no other movement; his outstretched hand simply clenched hard in the void.

Spiritual Qi rapidly gathered, and the youth was instantly confined, frozen in midair and unable to move. The Saint Yuan that was about to explode was suppressed and calmed in an instant.

Fear finally showed in the youth's eyes; he cried in alarm, “What sort of technique is this?”

Then, as if remembering something, his eyes trembled as he stared at Yang Kai and he screamed hoarsely, “You can draw on the power of the Star — you refined the Stellar Origin!”

“No wonder you're the Insect Emperor; sharp eyes.” Yang Kai sneered without pausing, and clenched his hand even tighter.

With a single crack, the youth's body burst into a spray of blood mist, and from that blood mist a thread of soul-force fled wildly outward.

The last time Yang Kai and Qian Tong worked together they had no answer for that move, but now Yang Kai had become the Star Lord of the Dark Star and had made preparations — how could he allow the man to escape?

With a thought, the space within roughly a dozen zhang was instantly transformed into a solid prison; no matter how that strand of soul force rammed about, it couldn’t break free — invisible barriers surrounded it on all sides, forcing it back each time.

After a few futile attempts, the Insect Emperor clearly realized he could not escape his fate. Abandoning pointless struggle, his visible soul force gathered into a mass, condensing in the void into a vague, human-shaped shadow.

The figure looked at Yang Kai with dimmed eyes, its form flickering like burning flame, and in a deep voice said, “I admit defeat. Spare me — whatever you want, I will give it!”

Yang Kai curled his lip and reached out a hand to seize him.

The Insect Emperor could not avoid it; that strand of soul-force was directly caught in Yang Kai's palm.

He struggled violently but could not break Yang Kai's hold, only able to curse loudly and howl hysterically.

Yang Kai rubbed his hands together, and with a sharp, agonized scream the Insect Emperor's soul dissipated into nothingness, erased from this world.

In Yang Kai's palm remained a jade-green, infinitesimally shrunken knife-shaped Secret Treasure and a small, exquisite bracelet.

Both items radiated a sinister trace of Imperial Might. The bracelet appeared ordinary, but the jade-green, greatly shrunken blade-shaped Secret Treasure surged with a strange power the moment Yang Kai probed it with his Divine Sense, severing his consciousness in an instant.

An Imperial Treasure!

Yang Kai's brow rose; a look of delighted surprise crossed his face.

He did not lack Secret Treasures — he already possessed two items of Imperial Treasure rank: the Extinction Thunder Bead and the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Those two had been the famed twin Imperial Treasure pearls of Star Emperor Mountain.

To suddenly acquire two more was a rare delight for Yang Kai.

No one ever complains about having more treasures, especially Imperial Treasures!

Yang Kai knew the tiny jade-green knife — the Insect Emperor had used it before. Yang Yan said it was the Soul-Severing Blade, its power unfathomable.

As for the small bracelet, Yang Kai had no idea of its origin or purpose.

He attempted to probe it with his Divine Sense but was blocked by an invisible seal and could not penetrate it at all.

Yang Kai had to give up; the bracelet was, after all, the Insect Emperor's Secret Treasure and its sealing was not something he could easily break.

Although unable to discern the bracelet's purpose, Yang Kai felt a ferocious, demonic energy within it that made him uneasy.

After briefly examining them, Yang Kai put away the Soul-Severing Blade and the bracelet; he had no time to refine them for now.

No sooner had he finished when he sensed a powerful aura racing in from the island's center, rapidly approaching their location.

Clearly the higher-ups on Xiaguang Island had detected the earlier Spiritual Qi fluctuation and had come to investigate.

Yang Kai did not leave immediately; he stood thoughtfully and waited.

After a moment, a hulking man suddenly descended from the sky. He was fully four chi tall, with a broad nose and a missing tooth, his natural presence oppressive enough to make anyone nearby uneasy.

A long scar ran down the man's face from brow to chin, making his features even more terrifying.

When the man saw the blood pooled on the ground he flew into a rage and roared, “Who dares to act so wantonly on Xiaguang Island!”

Saying so, he struck out with a palm at Yang Kai without further words.

This man possessed cultivation of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, a strength every bit comparable to Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu in years past. His vast body and enormous palm held boundless force, and the strike rent the void with explosive sound.

Even a warrior of equal rank struck by that palm would have a dozen bones shattered.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow; though displeased that the man launched an attack without asking, he considered that he himself was an uninvited guest and did not make a fuss. With a casual wave of his hand the burly man was sent flying by an invisible force.

His eyes nearly popped out as he stared at Yang Kai like someone who had seen a ghost in daylight, and then he landed lightly, his earlier arrogance gone.

He now understood that Yang Kai had no intent to harm him; otherwise he would have been killed on the spot. Given what Yang Kai had just displayed, killing him would have been a trivial matter.

A chill rose in his heart. The man drew a deep breath and, no longer daring to be presumptuous, asked in a hoarse voice, “Who are you? State your name!”

Yang Kai grinned and cupped his fist in greeting, “Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai!”

“Lingxiao Sect…” the man thought for a moment, his body trembling as he cried, “You are the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai?”

Although he resided within the Inner Sea, the man had heard of the reputation of Lingxiao Sect and of Yang Kai.

He had never imagined the Lingxiao Sect's Sect Master would possess such formidable power.

“And you are…?” Yang Kai asked, looking him over.

The man frowned but answered truthfully, “Island Lord of Xiaguang Island, Pang Zhen.”

“Ah, Island Lord Pang — pleased to meet you!” Yang Kai cupped his fist in salutation.

Pang Zhen's expression shifted; he had recovered from his initial shock. Though he admitted he could not match Yang Kai, he would not lose face nor let Sea Hall's reputation suffer, and in a stern voice said, “Sect Master Yang, though you are the head of Lingxiao Sect, our Sea Hall has no ties with Lingxiao Sect. You cannot come to my island and kill at will. I would like to know your reason for this!”

As the lord of an island he naturally had to protect the safety of the island's martial artists. A death occurring without explanation could not be ignored, for if word spread it would damage his prestige.

Yang Kai pondered a moment and then said, “Island Lord Pang, forgive me. I did not kill without reason; that man had to die. To be frank, I came out to sea this time to find him.”

“Can you explain?” Pang Zhen's expression softened somewhat at Yang Kai's politeness.

“Of course,” Yang Kai smiled and began to relate the circumstance.

Pang Zhen listened in stunned disbelief; he found it impossible to accept that Yang Kai's words were true, thinking the explanation might merely be an invented pretext.

Seeing his doubt, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Island Lord Pang, take a look at these things and you will understand.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai reached toward the handful of martial artists he had earlier bound.
