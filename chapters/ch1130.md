## Chapter 1130 — Have You Ever Married?

"If it bothers you, I can take them away!" Wu Yi saw Yang Kai say nothing and, thinking he was displeased, hurriedly bit her red lip and said.

“Where could you possibly take them?” Yang Kai smiled. “Since they’re already here, let them stay. Besides, this place is yours now anyway.”

"But I already gave it to you," Wu Yi said, full of shame. "If I've given it to you, then it's yours."

“Don’t overthink it. The fact that so many people are willing to follow you is your own matter,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “Anyway, there are plenty of stone chambers in the cave—having a few more people around won’t make any difference.”

"Thank you!" Wu Yi said gratefully.

Yang Kai shook his head, earnest: "I'm the one who should be thanking you."

If Wu Yi hadn't given him Dragon Lair Mountain to live in, he would've never discovered the Ethereal Crystal vein here. Though it's inconvenient to mention for now, Yang Kai noted such a weighty favor. Let alone letting these mere dozens who followed Wu Yi stay—if Wu Yi ever ran into greater trouble, he would step forward for her.

"You two, stop the thank-yous," Yang Yan's voice came. Yang Kai turned to see her walking over looking a little tired; though her face was haggard, her beautiful eyes were full of excitement. She casually tossed something to Yang Kai and said, "This secret treasure isn't bad—see if you want to refine it. If not, sell it; we're utterly broke right now."

Yang Kai took it and swept it with his Divine Sense, only to find it was Xu Zhishen's Hundred Mountains Painting. He immediately slipped it into his Spatial Ring. "I'm not selling this."

In the fight with Xu Zhishen he had taken two secret treasures from him—one was the Shadow Soul Threads, the other the Hundred Mountains Painting. Yang Kai hadn't had time to inspect them closely, but he knew the Hundred Mountains Painting was truly valuable. Xu Zhishen could manifest the phantoms of six peaks with it; if refined, calling forth more peaks would only increase its power.

When a hundred peaks appear together, even those of the Origin Returning Realm might not be able to stop it. Yang Kai had never paid much mind to offensive secret treasures, but he had a fondness for treasures like the Hundred Mountains Painting.

"Then give the Saint Crystals!" Yang Yan straightforwardly held out her small hand.

"Didn't you last time buy materials for fifty thousand Saint Crystals? And they were Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Are they all used up?" Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan in astonishment; this woman was a wiz at making money. She was also a wiz at squandering it.

"Do you think arranging a large formation is simple? Those materials were only enough to lay out the formation. Now so many people have come, and each person's stone chamber needs a small spirit formation set up again. When they cultivate daily, the Saint Crystal consumption adds up."

Wu Yi waved her hand and said, "No need to set those up. When they were with the family before they never enjoyed such treatment; Dragon Lair Mountain's Spiritual Qi is already quite good."

Last time Yang Kai's promotion drained the Spiritual Qi within thirty li around the cave. Over half a month has passed and it has recovered somewhat; at least faint mists of Spiritual Qi can again be seen on those peaks.

"Don't be polite to him. You can't imagine his wealth," Yang Yan whispered into Wu Yi's ear.

She was the only one who knew Yang Kai had countless Ethereal Crystals, so of course she understood he wouldn't worry about Saint Crystals.

Yang Kai shook his head and emptied the remaining tens of thousands of Upper-Level, Middle-Level, and Lower-Level Saint Crystals from his ring, leaving only a few thousand for his own use.

"Wu Yi will be our Dragon Lair Mountain's treasurer from now on; she'll manage the finances. I need to arrange formations and don't have the time. If something needs buying I'll tell you; if you run out of Saint Crystals, tell Yang Kai—he'll get them." Yang Yan shoved the Spatial Ring full of Saint Crystals into Wu Yi's hands.

"Ah?" Wu Yi was startled—she hadn't expected that asking Yang Kai for Saint Crystals was actually to hand them to her. But soon she understood; Yang Yan clearly wanted to give her something to do so she wouldn't brood and become distracted. Touched, she didn't refuse and said in a low voice, "Rest assured, every Saint Crystal that passes through my hands will have a clear purpose!"

Wu Yi harbored thoughts of taking charge of the Haike Family; over the years she'd managed some family matters, so overseeing a mere forty-odd people was naturally no problem.

Yang Kai's eyes flicked and he understood Yang Yan's intention, quietly giving her a thumbs-up.

Yang Yan giggled, "My defensive great formation is nearly finished, but Yang Kai, you really must gather more Saint Crystals. If we want to secure this thousand-li area firmly, the present formation won't do; it only protects about ten li around our cave."

Yang Kai naturally grasped the deeper meaning: the Ethereal Crystal vein was of tremendous importance. The Stone Puppet had been collecting for so many days and was still at work; no one knew how astonishing the reserves beneath were. In any case, he had to hold this place.

Besides, Yang Kai himself intended to remain here, using this place as a springboard to make his name.

He nodded. "Don't worry about the Saint Crystals; I'll figure something out."

Yang Yan looked at him with some concern. "Be careful in everything."

She thought that if Yang Kai were truly forced he would sell Ethereal Crystals, but she had no idea Yang Kai never intended to do that.

"By the way, Yang Kai, Elder Ba of the clan has been coming every day for several days, saying he has something to discuss with you, but you've been in seclusion and haven't been able to receive him. He came again today and is still outside," Wu Yi said, looking a little awkward at Yang Kai.

"Ba Qingyan? What do you mean?" Yang Kai looked at her. "If you want me to see him, I'll meet him. If you don't want me to, I'll send him away right now."

"I don't know," Wu Yi shook her head, fists clenched, her face full of struggle.

"Then tell me—do you still want to return to the Haike Family?"

“No!” This time, Wu Yi didn’t hesitate at all. She shook her head decisively, then gave a self-deprecating smile. “I used to think that, though our family was weak, at least we shared a common goal—and that even if I had to give my life for that goal, it didn’t matter. But now… I truly don’t want to go back. My parents have long since passed away. The family did raise me, and I owe them for that, but I’ve given plenty in return over the years. Even if the debt isn’t fully repaid, it’s close enough.”

"I understand. I'll go see him and make things clear—tell him not to bother you again."

"Mm!" Wu Yi nodded slightly.

Ba Qingyan had already come for four straight days. Knowing Yang Kai was in seclusion to consolidate his cultivation, he waited and only came to Dragon Lair Mountain when he thought the time was right. Unexpectedly, every visit failed to meet Yang Kai, and he couldn't act too arrogantly—only wait patiently, watching his clan's disciples come and go here each day with a bitter taste in his heart.

It wasn't until today that a familiar figure suddenly appeared in the cave. Ba Qingyan's face brightened as he recognized the youth who'd slain Xu Zhishen; he laughed and clasped his fists, saying, "Congratulations, Young Friend Yang! Your aura is deep and calm—seems this seclusion reaped much. Such innate talent, to stabilize your cultivation in so short a time; this old man is impressed!"

Yang Kai cast him a cold glance, knowing the subtext was an attempt to bring up the Saint King Pill.

It's true most do not stabilize their cultivation so quickly without aid, and pills can shorten that process. Ba Qingyan didn't utter the three words 'Saint King Pill,' but he assumed Yang Kai knew full well.

Little did he know Yang Kai had no patience for him. Whether or not he'd taken a pill—what of it? A single Saint King-Grade Middle-Level pill—couldn't he afford one?

"Speak plainly. For the sake of your past standing as an elder of Wu Yi's family, I'll give you thirty breaths. Speak or be gone!"

Ba Qingyan nearly choked on Yang Kai's words!

He hadn't expected Yang Kai would be too lazy even to offer polite words to invite him in and sit; for a moment he couldn't save face, feeling like a warm face meeting a cold backside. His old face flushed; were he not afraid he couldn't beat Yang Kai, he likely would have erupted.

Yet the old man was seasoned and restrained; he forced down his anger and forced a laugh, saying, "That earth-shattering battle half a month ago truly opened my eyes. I never thought there could be a person like Young Friend Yang with such extraordinary combat prowess. Your talent might even match Wei Guchang of Yingyue Hall, Qu Changfeng of the Battle-Heaven Alliance, or Fang Tianzhong of the Leitai Sect..."

Yang Kai regarded him coldly and didn't interrupt; when he finished, Yang Kai impassively said, "You have twenty breaths left."

Ba Qingyan's face twitched—this Yang Kai was impervious to flattery. He'd lowered himself to praise him; couldn't this Yang Kai at least show some modesty? Even if not humble, he should display the proud satisfaction of youth. Flattery wasn't easy at his age; it disgusted him to be doing it.

They say the young grow arrogant upon success, but apparently that's not it—he was boundlessly audacious.

Seemingly having gauged Yang Kai's temper a bit, Ba Qingyan's expression turned serious. He cut to the chase: "Our Haike Family intends to marry several of our family's maidens to you. Have you ever married?"

"Not interested!" Yang Kai remained cold.

"Uh... Young friend, here's the situation. You killed Xu Zhishen of the Xu Family and took his Hundred Mountains Painting. The Xu Family won't let that go. Our Haike Family is willing to shoulder this trouble for you; so long as you move into our clan, we'll accept you. We are prepared to hire you as a Guest Elder and grant you all the corresponding privileges!”

"Not interested!"

"Young friend, please hear this old man out," Ba Qingyan said, inwardly cursing the errand he'd taken—he'd never encountered someone so difficult. No matter how flowery his words, Yang's response was two words: 'Not interested.'

"You offended the Xu Family, killed Xu Zhishen. Next time they come it won't be just one or two people. For the Hundred Mountains Painting they may mobilize their whole nest. Without the Haike Family's protection, how can your little mountain peak resist? Even if you don't fear them, what about the young lady at your side? When the city gate burns, the fish in the pond suffer—you should understand that. Now is not the time for a fit of pride. If you want to preserve yourself and that young lady, our Haike Family is willing to offer what little help we can!"
