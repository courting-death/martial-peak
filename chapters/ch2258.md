## Chapter 2258 — Nice Secret Treasure, I’ll Take It

Drip, drip…

The clear sound of blood dripping reached everyone’s ears, and the air quickly filled with that distinctive metallic scent.

Everyone was stunned, as if they still didn’t understand what had happened. When they looked at Qu Huairen, what they saw left them horrified.

Qu Huairen’s body was frozen in place, unmoving, still in the posture of pouncing, but the hand he’d thrust out had all five fingers severed at the base, the wounds smooth and gleaming, blood streaming out.

That wasn’t all—crucially, a sword tip protruded from Qu Huairen’s back, blood dripping steadily and splattering on the ground, slowly pooling into a crimson stream.

Gulp…

The sound of swallowing echoed as everyone wondered: What just happened?

Just now, they’d seen Qu Huairen charge at Yang Kai with great momentum, while Yang Kai had flailed about with his Secret Treasure in apparent panic. Everyone thought Yang Kai would be injured and lose his Secret Treasure, but the shocking outcome was the exact opposite.

From the looks of it, it was as if Qu Huairen had accidentally impaled himself on Yang Kai’s sword.

And the wound was right at his heart—he probably didn’t even have a chance of survival.

Some of the cultivators’ eyes flashed with understanding. Their previous contempt for Yang Kai vanished, replaced by wariness.

Others still looked confused.

“You…” Qu Huairen managed to utter a word to Yang Kai, but before he could finish, blood gushed from his mouth like a fountain, uncontrollably.

“You brought this on yourself. Don’t blame me!” Yang Kai shouted, slapping Qu Huairen’s chest and sending him flying.

In midair, Qu Huairen’s life force quickly faded, his eyes lost their light, and by the time he hit the ground, he was dead, his corpse in a miserable state.

The Deputy Valley Lord of Evil Moon Valley had died so inexplicably in a small city like Fenglin City. Qu Huairen could never have imagined such an end for himself.

“You actually killed Deputy Valley Lord Qu!” a middle-aged man suddenly shouted coldly. Judging by his look, he seemed to know Qu Huairen. Seeing him die before his eyes, he couldn’t let it go. As he shouted, a burst of golden light appeared in his palm. “Brat, surrender and come to Evil Moon Valley to atone for your crime, or you’ll die for sure!”

As he finished, the golden light in his hand exploded into a golden net, which he threw down at Yang Kai.

In his mind, Qu Huairen had died partly from carelessness and partly because Yang Kai’s Secret Treasure was too sharp. Otherwise, how could a mere First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator kill a Third Stage expert so quickly?

Everyone makes mistakes—Qu Huairen simply fell into a trap.

Fearing the sharpness of the Myriad Sword, the man had no intention of fighting Yang Kai up close. He planned to use his own Secret Treasure to restrain Yang Kai first.

The golden net radiated Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure energy. As soon as it appeared, it seemed to seal off the area, a unique force locking everything down.

“Xuan Gold Heaven-Covering Net!” someone recognized it and called out, their face changing.

The man snorted, forming seals with his hands and focusing his mind to control his Secret Treasure’s power.

Yang Kai stumbled back several steps, but no matter how he tried to escape, he couldn’t get out of the net’s range. The invisible force kept him trapped, and he was amazed at how many strange Secret Treasures existed in the world.

“You can’t escape, boy! Since I forged this Xuan Gold Heaven-Covering Net, it’s never failed. Give up!” the man sneered. With a change of hand seals, the golden net fell over Yang Kai, then shrank into a ball of golden light, sealing him inside.

“Hahahaha!” The man laughed, but his laughter soon froze as he stared in shock. “How is this possible?!”

Inside the golden light, Yang Kai’s figure faded and vanished.

It was just an afterimage.

“That was close!” Yang Kai’s voice came from the side. The man looked over and saw him wiping sweat from his brow, looking relieved.

“You…” The man’s face changed. He couldn’t figure out how Yang Kai had escaped his Secret Treasure’s power without him noticing.

“Not bad, not bad. This Secret Treasure is nice—I’ll take it.” Yang Kai reached for the golden light.

“Ah!” The man panicked as Yang Kai grabbed the golden light. He quickly channeled his Origin Qi and changed his hand seals.

The golden light in Yang Kai’s hand buzzed violently, a powerful resistance making his hand go numb.

After all, this was a painstakingly refined Secret Treasure, connected to its owner’s mind. Yang Kai couldn’t just take it by force.

Sensing the resistance, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed coldly. He looked at the man and said, “Look at me!”

“What?” The man was trying to regain control of his Secret Treasure. He looked up, confused.

The next moment, he shivered as a chilling feeling swept over him.

A surge of pure soul power struck from the front, sharp as a sword from ancient times, slicing through his soul defenses and storming into his Sea of Consciousness, stirring up chaos.

“Aaaah!” The man’s face turned pale as he clutched his head and screamed.

The onlookers were startled and quickly backed away.

After taking Yang Kai’s soul attack, the man’s Sea of Consciousness was in chaos, his soul shaken. He couldn’t control his Secret Treasure at all.

Yang Kai pressed down with his Origin Qi, suppressing the resistance, and poured his soul power into the treasure. In less than three breaths, he erased the man’s Soul Brand and put the treasure into his Spatial Ring.

He really had snatched the Secret Treasure!

Everyone’s faces changed as they realized something was wrong.

Seizing a Secret Treasure wasn’t something just anyone could do. Only if there was a huge gap in soul strength could someone erase the owner’s Soul Brand so quickly.

But Yang Kai had done it.

In other words, his soul was far stronger than the man’s.

Realizing this, everyone gasped.

“A wolf in sheep’s clothing!” someone muttered, now deeply wary of Yang Kai.

If Qu Huairen’s death could be blamed on carelessness, this man’s fate could not.

This was pure strength, not luck.

The man who attacked Yang Kai was still clutching his head, rolling on the ground in pain. With such a soul injury, even if he recovered, it would take a long time—he might even be left an idiot for life.

“Anyone else have a nice Secret Treasure? Show me.” Yang Kai looked around and sneered.

Everyone instinctively took several steps back, each of them feeling the situation had become utterly ridiculous.

They’d all come for Yang Kai’s Secret Treasure, but now the tables had turned—he seemed to be enjoying himself, unable to stop…

“No, no, mine’s just Void King-Grade. You wouldn’t be interested.” someone said seriously.

“Void King-Grade? That’s impressive. Mine’s only Origin-Grade…” another chimed in.

Everyone turned to look at that fellow, all wearing exasperated expressions.

The man shouted, “What? Is it a crime to be poor? Is it shameful for a Dao Origin Realm cultivator to use an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure? What are you looking at?!”

Then he turned to Yang Kai, smiling. “You wouldn’t want an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure, right? If not, I’ll be going now. Farewell!”

Without waiting for a reply, he fled.

The others quickly followed suit, cursing the man for being so quick-witted, and hurriedly cupped their fists to Yang Kai as they retreated.

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly called out coldly.

Everyone froze and turned back, watching him warily.

“You think you can come and go as you please? It’s not that easy!” Yang Kai snorted.

Gulp…

Everyone swallowed hard, their faces turning ugly. They realized things had taken a bad turn and wondered what Yang Kai would do next.

Yang Kai snorted and pointed at the ground. “Take the corpse and that guy screaming like a pig and get out!”

“Ah…”

“Yes, yes!”

“Hurry up and help!”

Amid shouts, they quickly dragged away Qu Huairen’s corpse and the still-screaming man, vanishing in no time.
