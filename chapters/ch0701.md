## Chapter 701 — Trading District

At dawn the next day, Yang Kai, who was meditating, heard some movement next door; he sent out his Divine Sense to probe and discovered that Cang Yan, Li Wan, and Fei Jian had already departed in haste — they had likely gone to Wangtian Cliff to investigate the situation.

Fei Yu, still drunk from the night before, lay awkwardly on the bed, her posture unbecoming; her skirt had been pushed up to her thighs, and the pale, glistening expanse of her skin made Yang Kai feel dizzy.

Yang Kai could only shake his head helplessly, sit up, pick up the quilt, and tuck it over her, covering the exposed skin.

It was not until noon that Fei Yu languidly rose, stretched, and stood quietly by the window for a while.

"Hey, little junior nephew, let's go out and take a look," Fei Yu suddenly suggested.

"But Senior Uncle Cang Yan said to wait in the inn until they return," Yang Kai frowned.

"Don't worry, in Fuyun City it's usually safe; even if there are scuffles, the City Lord's Mansion will intervene," Fei Yu coaxed, leaning close and coyly sitting at Yang Kai's side, her breath like orchids as she murmured, "Let's go see — it's rare to be here, why stay cooped up? Cang Yan and the others might be gone for days; do you expect us to just wait here the whole time?"

Saying this, she unabashedly hooked one arm through his, her full, firm breasts pressing against his elbow.

Yang Kai's face darkened. "Fine, let's go. Just don't take advantage of me."

"You little bastard!" Fei Yu snapped through her teeth.

The two tidied themselves and quickly left the inn, walking along the bustling main street.

Even without Fei Yu's suggestion, Yang Kai had intended to come out and look around.

Elder Du had said that because the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was about to bloom, many outstanding alchemists would gather here, and martial artists from across the realm would also converge; where there are many people, resources will follow.

Rare medicinal materials, Spiritual Herbs, and Spiritual Medicines that are seldom seen elsewhere would all appear here.

Yang Kai needed to gather some herbs.

Although the Tianxiao Sect had been supplying him with materials for his alchemy, he still had his own needs — for his cultivation and for planning for the Ancient Demon Clan of Mo Shen Fort.

When he left Mo Shen Fort, Li Rong had given him a list of ingredients needed to refine Saint-Grade pills; over time Yang Kai had collected many of them, but there were still numerous items missing.

This outing was a rare opportunity.

In Fuyun City shops lined the streets and martial artists jostled shoulder to shoulder; people flowed like schools of fish across the thoroughfares.

Fei Yu, arm linked with Yang Kai's, strolled the avenue; their pairing of handsome man and beautiful woman drew many gazes.

"Senior Aunt, isn't this a bit inappropriate?" Yang Kai felt ill at ease; the occasional physical contact as they walked made his heart flutter.

"What's wrong with it? I'm responsible for protecting you. You little bastard, are you attracted to your Senior Aunt?" Fei Yu smiled faintly as she looked at him.

Yang Kai shrugged. "I'm a young man; this is a normal reaction."

"Don't overthink it," Fei Yu chuckled, seeming to relish the scene; she walked and whispered to Yang Kai as they went.

As they moved along, under her guidance Yang Kai began to accurately distinguish who among the crowd were demons and who were yao.

On the Tongxuan Continent, the three races of humans, demons, and yao stood in balance: humans were the most numerous, demons the next, and yao the least in number.

The fundamental reason lay in the scarcity of Huasheng Pools.

A Huasheng Pool is the root and foundation of the yao; when a Demonic Beast reaches a certain level, it can use a Huasheng Pool to transform into a human body and awaken intelligence comparable to humans.

One could say every yao that possesses a human body is a strong expert, which sets them apart from the other two races.

But that is not the whole picture; some powerful yao can assume human form from birth, and some with heavenly talent need no Huasheng Pool at all to reach that level.

These are the elites among the yao, the experts among experts.

Yang Kai felt his knowledge expand considerably.

They entered a shop run by the Alchemists' Association in Fuyun City; after wandering a few rounds Yang Kai wore a helpless look.

He had not found the herbs he wanted.

"Young man, you've looked through my wares several times but bought nothing — could it be my goods don't suit you?" the proprietor asked curiously.

Yang Kai shook his head. "They're all fine quality, but not what I'm looking for."

"You're an alchemist, aren't you?"

Yang Kai nodded lightly and presented his alchemist's token. The shopkeeper examined it and was instantly moved, his expression becoming much friendlier. "If you don't mind telling me exactly which materials you need, I can keep an eye out for them."

Yang Kai casually recited a few names of medicinal materials.

The shopkeeper's face turned troubled, but he nodded. "Those herbs require extremely harsh environments and are very rare and precious. I don't carry them. They're not easy to obtain. Why not try the Trading District? If you're lucky, you might find some there."

"The Trading District?" Yang Kai's expression shifted.

"Yes. For this grand event, the City Lord and the two Deputy Lords have designated an area where alchemists from across the land can trade. Many excellent alchemists gather there and will trade materials they don't need for those they do; you might get lucky."

"Where is the Trading District located?"

The shopkeeper kindly pointed Yang Kai toward it. Yang Kai bowed slightly in thanks, then set off with Fei Yu toward the designated area.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai stood before the open grounds and the lively scene, a wry smile crossing his face.

"What does that remind you of?" Fei Yu asked, seeing his odd smile.

"Some events back at the Sect," Yang Kai replied casually.

The bustling, familiar scene before him — countless stalls and hawkers — brought back memories of when he was weak: the Black Wind Trade Market at the junction where Lingxiao Pavilion, Fengyu Tower, and the Blood Battle Gang met.

The way business was carried out here and the scene itself stirred a warm sense of familiarity, as if old days were replaying.

Only, this Trading District wasn't surrounded by woods, nor were elite disciples from the three sects stationed here.

Scanning the crowd, Yang Kai was astonished to find many of the stall owners were alchemists. They hung their alchemist's tokens on their chests to proclaim their identity.

Others were not alchemists but capable martial artists who had come by fine medicinal materials during their adventures and were waiting at their stalls for buyers.

There were sellers and there were buyers; the scene was extraordinarily lively.

Some even hung signs requesting alchemists to refine pills for them.

Everything here revolved around medicinal materials and pills; a strong scent of herbs floated in the air.

Yang Kai strode forward with his head held high and began to inspect stall by stall.

He indeed found gains.

Medicines that could not be obtained on the open market were generally available here.

Most sellers did not make special demands; they could be bought with Crystal Stones.

Yang Kai had many Crystal Stones; though he had left most with the Ancient Demon Clan, the remainder still amounted to a substantial fortune.

After some bargaining with the sellers, he quickly acquired several medicinal materials.

Fei Yu played no small part in the process; Yang Kai had never known that his Senior Aunt's tongue was so sharp — with ruthless haggling and a little flirtatious display she often made sellers willingly lower their prices.

By midday Yang Kai had obtained several precious herbs necessary for refining Saint-Grade pills.

He was greatly satisfied.

"I saved you quite a few Crystal Stones. How will you thank me?" Fei Yu, still linking her arm through his, asked with a smile.

"I'll buy you a drink."

Fei Yu's eyes lit up. "Little junior nephew, you really know how to please your Senior Aunt."

"But you mustn't get drunk! If you do and Senior Uncle Cang Yan and the others come back, I'll tell on you."

"I know, I know." Fei Yu pouted.

As they spoke, a burst of exclamations rose not far away, as if something extraordinary had been found.

At the same time Yang Kai clearly sensed a faint, lingering fragrance in the air — cool and refreshing to the nose, involuntarily snapping one to attention.

Yang Kai and Fei Yu both brightened and glanced at each other, knowing at once that some treasure had appeared.

Yang Kai turned his head toward the source of the sound and saw the place already surrounded three layers deep, voices of admiration rising without cease. Through the gaps in the crowd, he could still glimpse faint threads of rosy light blossoming.

"Let's go see," Fei Yu said, linking her arm with his as they moved toward the gathering.

But no matter how hard they pushed, they couldn't get in; meanwhile cries rose from the crowd, "Brother, how much for that item?"

"Ten Saint-Grade Pills!" came an hoarse, weathered voice.

The onlookers sighed and murmured.

"Brother, that's too expensive. Saint-Grade Pills aren't casually made; there are only a handful in the world who can refine them. Opening with ten is a bit ridiculous, isn't it?"

"Yeah, can you take other herbs or Crystal Stones instead?"

"How about Secret Treasures? I have several Spirit-Grade upper-level Secret Treasures. Pick whatever you like!"

"Ten Saint-Grade Pills — that's all I want. If you don't have Saint-Grade Pills, leave."

"Come on, be reasonable, don't be so heartless."

"What arrogance — can that thing be worth ten Saint-Grade Pills? That's a joke! I think this guy has gone mad."

"Eldest Brother, give me that item and this one will be yours — deal?" came a coquettish voice.

"You woman, you have no shame left? Do you have no decency?" someone sneered.

"With your looks you dare to show off? You really lack self-awareness."

"It's none of your damned business."

The bickering erupted and the scene grew ever more chaotic.
