## Chapter 1841 — Wealth Beyond Measure

"Let's go, what are you standing there for?" Yang Kai grinned at Hua Youmeng and led the way forward.

"Oh." Hua Youmeng's whole demeanor went wicked; she completely lost any independent thought and, hearing Yang Kai's summons, actually followed him with a leisurely air into Purple Star City, while several martial artists from the Commerce Guild hurried after them.

The guards at the city gate did not dare to stop them; they looked at Yang Kai as if he were a ferocious beast and all backed away, and the martial artists who had been waiting in line outside to enter the city, seeing an opportunity, swarmed forward in a rush.

The city gate fell into chaos in an instant. A dozen guards didn’t know whether to block the way or stand aside. After a long moment, someone finally came to their senses and shouted, “Quick! Go check on Deacon Min’s injuries!”

That reminder snapped the others awake; they hurriedly crowded around the Deacon and examined him with concern.

"Send a transmission... to Lord Lu Tianfeng!" the Deacon spat a mouthful of blood after uttering a single word, and by the time he finished the sentence he had coughed so much blood he directly fainted.

The guard who had spoken earlier hurriedly took out a Transmission Compass, poured Divine Sense into it, and ground his teeth as he said, "Kid, you're a dead man — daring to hit people in our Purple Star City, even if the Heavenly King himself came it wouldn't save you."

The other guards all wore faces full of resentment as they watched Yang Kai's departing back.

Because of Yang Kai’s outburst, they would inevitably be punished along with him—dragged into trouble for no reason at all. How could they not resent him for it?

For years no one had dared act so wantonly in Purple Star City; to have such a spectacle at the gate today, if it were not dealt with to set an example, the power would be ridiculed by martial artists across the Star Domain and Purple Star's reputation would be affected — consequences they could not bear.

In a side room in the back courtyard of the Commerce Guild.

Hua Youmeng and the others sat there dazed, each face riddled with the panic of impending disaster.

Yang Kai sat there too, glancing left and right with a calm, indifferent expression, utterly lacking the remorse one would expect of someone who had caused trouble; his relaxed, carefree look was as if he were merely out for a stroll.

"Kid, why did you come along too?" After a long silence, a bald, burly man suddenly came to his senses and glared angrily at Yang Kai, his eyes full of hostility.

"Yeah, why are you here?" another male martial artist finally recovered as well and looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

"Uh... I'm new here. I don't know my way around. I happened to be graciously invited by Chairwoman Hua just now, so I thought it would be rude to refuse," Yang Kai said with a slight smile, offering a brief explanation.

Hua Youmeng gazed at Yang Kai blankly, thought for a moment, then lightly nodded and said, "Yes, yes... it was me who asked him."

After returning from the gate, the Commerce Guild members looked as if their souls had been lost; they were completely at a loss. It was hardly surprising — the Commerce Guild was only a small force, wedged among many massive powers in the Star Domain, and whenever they came to Purple Star City they were cautious, fearful of inviting trouble; yet this time at the gate they had beaten the Deacon and a guard until they spat blood, their fates unknown.

For the Commerce Guild this was like the sky falling.

No one had noticed Yang Kai among those who followed back to the Commerce Guild; Hua Youmeng only now finally calmed herself, drew a deep breath, and looked at Yang Kai with complicated eyes before pausing and saying, "Sister Hong, please take him downstairs and arrange a guest room for him so he can rest."

Downstairs, a glamorous woman rose slowly, acknowledged the request, and waved to Yang Kai, saying, "Come with me."

"Thank you," Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and then rose to follow.

"Chairwoman..." the bald man cried out in alarm as Yang Kai moved to leave.

Hua Youmeng shot him a glare; the bald man immediately fell silent and dared not say more, only glaring at Yang Kai's retreating back and biting his teeth in secret.

Yang Kai followed the woman called Sister Hong, taking in his surroundings, and after a while chuckled softly: "Madam, your Commerce Guild seems to possess considerable backing."

"How so?" the woman glanced back at Yang Kai, her expression cold.

"Although this is my first time in Purple Star City, since this is the Purple Star headquarters the land must be worth every inch; for the Commerce Guild to have such a large place here, your financial resources must be substantial," Yang Kai said.

A trace of caution flickered in the woman's eyes as she replied coldly, "This is what the Chairwoman and everyone have struggled to build for more than twenty years; who knows how many brothers and sisters were buried in the Star Domain. This is the only foothold we have in Purple Star City. What talk of being well-funded? Moreover... now that we've caused such a huge trouble, I don't know if the Commerce Guild will even be able to stand here in the future."

Yang Kai smiled apologetically, "Sorry for bringing trouble to your Commerce Guild."

"As long as you know that," the woman's expression softened somewhat; she had nothing more to say and continued to lead the way.

Before long they arrived at a guest room; the woman opened the door and said, "This is it — it's simple, but you can stay here for now."

"Thank you," Yang Kai bowed slightly in thanks.

The woman turned to leave; after a few steps she paused and looked back.

"Madam, anything else?" Yang Kai asked, suspiciously watching her.

She parted her lips and said, "Our Head is naturally kind-hearted and cannot stand to see others bullied; many brothers and sisters stayed because of her benevolence — I myself would have died ten years ago without the Head's help. This time she stood up for you; I will not blame you for that, but... if the Purple Star City authorities pursue this matter, I hope you will step forward to take responsibility. Don't let the Head be drawn into trouble; she truly is a good person. I don't care how powerful you are — if because of this matter the Head suffers some misfortune, even as a ghost I won't let you off."

Yang Kai's expression stiffened and he answered earnestly, "I understand."

"I hope so," the woman said, then turned and left.

Back in the previous side room the bald man paced anxiously like an ant on a hot pan.

"Uncle Yao, can you sit still? You're making my eyes go dizzy," a woman of about twenty to the right said helplessly to the bald man.

"How can I sit still at a time like this?" the bald man shouted angrily. "You saw what just happened — we're finished this time."

Above, Hua Youmeng rubbed her forehead and forced a bitter smile; she had never imagined she'd stir up such trouble today. She had only meant to prevent Yang Kai from meeting the same tragic fate as that middle-aged man earlier — who could have known Yang Kai would be so resolute and dare to strike people, and that he'd hit the Purple Star City guard and the Deacon?"

"Yao Qing, sit down, there's no use being agitated now," Hua Youmeng said, trying to calm him; she was as dizzy from Yao Qing's thrashing about as anyone.

At her words Yao Qing stamped his foot and returned to his chair, but it felt as if a thousand needles were under him; he could not sit still, kept fidgeting, his expression stiff and ugly.

Hua Youmeng turned her gaze to an elderly man of middling age sitting below; since entering he had kept his eyes closed and said nothing, looking deeply inscrutable.

She looked at him and asked, "Uncle Xia, you have the most experience in the entire Guild and the widest knowledge — in the current situation, does Uncle Xia have any way to resolve this?"

Xia Jingwu slowly opened his eyes, pondered for a long moment, and sighed, "It's difficult."

"Even Uncle Xia has no way?" Hua Youmeng's heart sank to the bottom.

Xia Jingwu forced a bitter smile, "Although I have always considered myself the Guild's strategist, I am only a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — my strength is limited, and many methods are of no use. Chairwoman, you are not unaware of whom we have offended this time..."

Hua Youmeng's beautiful eyes dimmed and her expression grew bitter. The Commerce Guild had weathered many disasters before, but it was always through Xia Jingwu's careful arrangements that they passed through them; yet this time even he was helpless.

"Chairwoman, you were too reckless this time," Xia Jingwu said, slowly shaking his head.

"Uncle Xia, please don't blame the Chairwoman; she acted from compassion, not intentionally," the woman in her twenties spoke softly, unable to bear seeing Hua Youmeng reproved.

"I do not mean to pressure the Chairwoman," Xia Jingwu said gently. "Which among us here did not receive the Chairwoman's kindness? If she were not so warm-hearted, I fear the Commerce Guild and those present would not exist today."

Everyone nodded in agreement; it was precisely because of Hua Youmeng's goodwill that they had survived to this day.

"It's just that this time... ah." Xia Jingwu sighed heavily, then looked up at Hua Youmeng and said, "Chairwoman, there are only two paths open to us now."

Hua Youmeng's eyes brightened and she smiled, "I knew Uncle Xia had a solution — please speak it out in detail."

Yao Qing and the twenty-something woman both looked to Xia Jingwu with faces full of expectation.

"You flatter me, Chairwoman; these two paths may not resolve the Guild's crisis, but... let's try," Xia Jingwu stroked his beard and said in a deep voice, "The first is... hand that kid over to Purple Star City!"

Hua Youmeng's brows knit together.

"He was the one who caused the trouble and he was the one who struck people. If we hand him over, perhaps the Commerce Guild can avoid the main responsibility and at most suffer some punishments, not crippling damage. Time is on our side — as long as the Chairwoman remains safe, the Commerce Guild will have another chance to rise in the future."

"Right — Uncle Xia is right, do it. I'll go capture that kid and hand him over to Purple Star City now," Yao Qing stood up without waiting for Hua Youmeng to respond.

Hua Youmeng glared at him, "Sit down!"

Yao Qing shrank back and sat down obediently; one could see that Hua Youmeng held considerable authority over him.
