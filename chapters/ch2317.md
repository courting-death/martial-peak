## Chapter 2317 — What Grudge, What Hatred

Seeing Ke Tian agree without hesitation, Luo Jin rejoiced, "With Lord Ke's assistance, I can rest easy."

Yang Kai sneered, "I really don't know where you get your confidence. Since you refuse the road to heaven and insist on barging into hell, this Young Master will grant your wish!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Kai's figure flickered and he darted straight to Ke Tian.

Ke Tian's expression changed drastically, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to be so fast. He hurriedly retreated in panic.

Yang Kai made no move to stop him, only stared at him coldly and said, "There are secrets in my eyes."

Hearing this, Ke Tian instinctively looked at Yang Kai.

But in the next instant he realized he'd been tricked: the moment he looked, Yang Kai's left eye flared with dazzling golden light. A majestic vertical pupil appeared, and he shuddered involuntarily.

He wanted to look away but couldn't. It was as if the golden vertical pupil exerted a mysterious force that bound his gaze. His Divine Soul wavered and his Sea of Consciousness churned.

"Bloom!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. In the World-Ending Demon Eye a pure white lotus bud flashed and vanished.

Ke Tian convulsed as if struck by lightning, clutching his head and screaming in agony, as though suffering unbearable torment.

All the guests around were silent as cicadas in winter, their gazes toward Yang Kai filled with dread.

They had no idea what had happened. They only saw that after Yang Kai and Ke Tian exchanged glances, Ke Tian became like this.

Luo Jin, however, sensed a hidden surge of Divine Sense and immediately realized Yang Kai must have used a soul secret technique. He shouted in panic, "Lord Ke, guard your mind!"

As he shouted, the Jade Scepter-like Secret Treasure in his hand suddenly grew larger, pressing down on Yang Kai like a mountain.

Yang Kai sneered, reached out, and grabbed the struggling Ke Tian, who was writhing in pain from the Bloom secret technique, and flung him straight upward.

Luo Jin's face changed drastically. He quickly formed seals, trying to recall his Secret Treasure, but having just exerted all his strength, he couldn't retrieve it in time. He could only watch helplessly as Ke Tian was smashed by his own Secret Treasure.

With a thunderous boom…

In the instant the sound rang out, Ke Tian exploded into a mist of blood, his body utterly destroyed. Blood and flesh rained down everywhere. The scene was gruesome to the extreme.

Luo Jin was dumbfounded, unable to believe his eyes.

The surrounding guests all cried out in shock. None had expected that Ke Tian, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, would die so swiftly and cleanly.

Earlier, when he and Luo Jin joined forces to attack Yang Kai, everyone thought Yang Kai was doomed. Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, Ke Tian would die first—and at Luo Jin's own Jade Scepter, no less.

Such a bizarre ending was hard for anyone to accept.

"Heh heh…" Yang Kai laughed mockingly, looking at Luo Jin. "Lord Luo, you really are ruthless—even your own ally wasn't spared. Sir Ke died so tragically. This is what people mean by burning bridges after crossing the river, isn't it?"

He adopted a sorrowful, compassionate expression. The many guests found it both amusing and chilling.

After all, everyone saw that part of the reason Ke Tian died was because Luo Jin couldn't retrieve his Jade Scepter in time. But the greater reason was that he fell to some unknown secret technique of Yang Kai's, leaving him unable to dodge.

If anyone was to blame, it was Yang Kai. Yet now he shifted all responsibility onto Luo Jin, as if it had nothing to do with himself.

Luo Jin was stunned. He had thought Yang Kai only managed to scare off the two elders of Tianzhao Palace by luck. If Qiu Yu hadn't been gravely injured, the two elders would never have left so easily, nor would anyone have been hurt.

Only now did he realize that Yang Kai's strength defied common sense. The fact that he could instantly render Ke Tian helpless spoke volumes about his power.

After hearing Yang Kai's words, Luo Jin shouted, "Nonsense! Lord Ke was clearly—"

Yang Kai snorted. "Sir Ke was clearly killed by Lord Luo's Secret Treasure; everyone saw it. All the guests here can testify. What grudge or hatred did Lord Luo have against Sir Ke to strike so viciously? It's truly heartbreaking."

Luo Jin’s Qi and blood surged with fury, his face flushing red. He wanted to argue, but couldn’t find the words, feeling utterly stifled and wronged. In his rage, he roared, “From this day forth, there can be no reconciliation between us!”

As he shouted, Luo Jin spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood onto his Jade Scepter. Instantly, the scepter shone with dazzling light, energy fluctuations erupting, and an extremely dangerous aura spread out.

Yang Kai sneered, his figure flickering. With Spatial Force surging, he appeared before Luo Jin. Under Luo Jin's stunned gaze, he thrust his sword forward.

Luo Jin's mind was disturbed by Ke Tian's death, and Yang Kai's shameless words had driven his anger to the limit. His Qi and blood churned, and he couldn't maintain his composure.

When Yang Kai stabbed at him, he couldn't even react.

With a soft squelch, Luo Jin froze in place. His hot blood suddenly turned cold as he stared blankly ahead.

Yang Kai wore a devilish smile as he sneered, “Lord Luo, you’d best not move. I’m rather timid—if you make any sudden moves, I might get startled and accidentally pierce your heart. That wouldn’t be very fun, would it?”

Cold sweat poured down Luo Jin's face as he felt the Myriad Sword pressed half an inch from his heart. How could he dare move? He could only nervously swallow again and again.

"No, don't!" Suddenly, Luo Bing rushed over like a madwoman, throwing herself between Yang Kai and Luo Jin and spreading her arms to shield her father. Tears streamed down her face as she pleaded, "Don't kill my father! Eldest brother, please, don't kill my father!"

She cried as she spoke, her beautiful face covered in tears.

Chai Hu looked at her, wanting to speak but stopping himself, and sighed heavily.

The surrounding guests all looked solemn, feeling sorry for Luo Bing.

Of all those affected by today's twists and turns, the one most impacted wasn't Chai Hu, who started the trouble, nor the overbearing Yang Kai, nor even the gravely injured Luo Jin.

It was Luo Bing!

When Chai Hu was wounded, Luo Bing had desperately begged her father to spare him, since he had saved her life and she couldn't bear to see him harmed.

When Luo Jin was wounded, she came before Yang Kai and begged him to spare her father. After all, blood is thicker than water—Luo Jin's blood flowed in her veins.

Before today, she was still the carefree, happy princess of Tianhe City.

But in a single day, she had witnessed too much bloodshed, too many battles, too many upheavals. Torn between family and gratitude, she didn't know what to choose.

Her delicate body could hardly bear such repeated shocks.

Yang Kai frowned at her, his face cold.

To be honest, his first impression of Luo Bing wasn't good. He thought she was just a spoiled, willful little princess.

But today's events changed his view of her quite a bit.

The scene of her desperately defending Chai Hu was still vivid in his mind.

She might be a bit naive, but at least she knew how to be grateful.

"Please, don't hurt my father. Let him go. I'll do whatever you want!" Luo Bing cried, kneeling on the ground, clinging to Yang Kai's leg and refusing to let go.

The guests were all moved by the scene, looking at Luo Bing with complicated expressions, as if seeing her for the first time.

Chai Hu couldn't bear to watch, his Adam's apple bobbing as he rasped, "Young Brother Yang..."

Yang Kai sighed lightly. "Don't worry, your father isn't dead yet."

Given all that Luo Jin had done, Yang Kai felt that killing him ten thousand times wouldn't be enough. But Luo Bing's desperate pleas touched him, and he suddenly felt a bit of reluctance.

Chai Hu, dragging his injured body, came to Luo Bing and pulled her up. "Get up and talk."

Luo Bing looked up at Yang Kai, her face streaked with tears, and cried, "Please don't kill my father."

Yang Kai said, "That depends on how he treats my friends. If any of them are harmed..."

Luo Jin quickly said, "I only sealed their cultivation and locked them in the dungeon. I didn't hurt them."

Yang Kai glanced at him. "You know what to do."

Luo Jin trembled and shouted, "Bring those honored guests out!"

With his life in someone else's hands, he couldn't act tough anymore. All he wanted was to survive.

The City Lord’s mansion guards heard Luo Jin's order and dared not delay, immediately springing into action.

The guests all looked curiously in that direction, wanting to see who Yang Kai had gone to such lengths to rescue.

Soon, led by the City Lord’s mansion guards, three people emerged in a line.

The leader exuded a sinister aura, as if he had cultivated some evil art, making others uncomfortable. He was an old man, and the wicked smile at the corner of his mouth was chilling.

Following him was another elderly man, but this one stood straight as a sword, his whole body radiating invisible sword intent—a clear master of the sword.

The last was a burly man with a naturally imposing presence, his fierce gaze sweeping the surroundings.

All three, without exception, were at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

As they walked over, it was clear they didn't know what had happened here. They looked around curiously and warily, exchanging Divine Sense in secret.

"Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother!" Chai Hu called out excitedly as soon as he saw them.

The three looked at him, their eyes lighting up, and hurried over. The wicked old man in the lead said, "Fourth Brother, what are you doing here?"

As he spoke, he kept winking at Chai Hu, clearly telling him to run.

Chi Yue smiled and said, "Fourth Brother came here to save me."
