## Chapter 1025 — Time Is Short

An accidental discovery left Yang Kai feeling conflicted; whether that cluster of energy was truly the Star Origin, he still did not know. Under the Ghost Ancestor's tight surveillance, he dared not probe further, so the matter was left unresolved.

He had his own conjectures: if it truly was a Star Origin, it must have formed within the past fifteen hundred years, or else it had the means to evade the Ghost Ancestor's detection—otherwise it would not have remained untouched under the Ghost Ancestor's nose.

He did not withdraw the single strand of Divine Sense he had left behind; it remained there, being nourished and strengthened by that inexplicable energy.

He planned to come back when he had another opportunity and take a closer look.

The strand of Divine Sense left behind would give him an exact location.

Yang Kai handled the matter without leaving a trace, silently and unobtrusively, and it did not draw the Ghost Ancestor's undue attention.

As time passed, Yang Kai's mastery of spatial mysteries deepened. His Divine Sense spread wider, easily covering half the continent. Divine Sense suffused with spatial subtleties leapt through the void, able to reach any spot he wished to peer into.

He probed the seven‑colored sky many times and kept experimenting; after countless strands of Divine Sense were lost in the chaotic field, he finally gained some assurance that he could leave this place.

He kept a low profile, made no boast, and continued his probes and experiments, striving for perfection and to make no mistakes.

Every day Yang Kai reported the situation to the Ghost Ancestor, but he did not reveal the truth, so the Ghost Ancestor knew nothing of it.

One day Yang Kai returned from the seven‑colored sky and had barely reached the flat ground halfway up the mountain when a metallic tang of blood in the air met his nostrils.

His expression shifted slightly; his Divine Sense spread out and quickly detected that something was wrong.

The survivors on this continent were gathered in one place, and the atmosphere was heavy—seemingly in the middle of some discussion.

"What happened?" Yang Kai walked over and asked.

"Someone's dead!" Shen Tu said with a sullen face.

Yang Kai looked ahead in surprise and indeed saw a cultivator sprawled on the ground, life extinguished. His flesh and blood seemed to have suffered extreme pressure and exploded in an instant, leaving the corpse a grisly sight.

"Which side was he from?" Yang Kai asked.

"Our side!" He Zao replied gloomily.

He Miao and Yue Xi wore expressions of grief and anger. Even Lü Guichen could not help showing a touch of sympathy born of shared loss.

Back when the Purple Star and the Sword Alliance had over a hundred cultivators fall here, more than a year had passed and only about ten remained alive, living in uneasy peace for several months. Now another person had died under their noses.

No one even knew how he had died.

"Who killed him?" Yang Kai asked, looking up.

No one dared answer; they only gave bitter smiles.

Yang Kai immediately understood: here, apart from the Ghost Ancestor, no one else dared kill.

The old weirdo must be in a foul mood; otherwise he would not have senselessly struck down a junior.

"Yang Kai. Can you go speak to the Ghost Ancestor for us? We don't intend to resist him—could you ask him to stop killing?" He Zao pressed her lips together and looked at Yang Kai.

This time the dead man had been a cultivator of the Sword Alliance; if the Ghost Ancestor were to kill again next time, who would be the victim?

It might be someone else—or it might be themselves!

Everyone present, except Yang Kai, had to live on tenterhooks.

If the Ghost Ancestor wiped them all out and saw no hope of leaving, he might no longer spare Yang Kai. He could use the Soul‑Searching Technique to strip Yang Kai of his memories and devour his understanding of spatial mysteries—burning his bridges to study escape methods alone.

"Yes, Yang Kai," Shen Tu also said, "you are the only one here who can speak to the Ghost Ancestor... I don't want to die without knowing why."

The others looked at him eagerly, treating him as a straw to clutch for salvation.

Yang Kai nodded lightly. "I'll speak to him, but whether he'll listen, I can't say."

"As long as you can talk to him," Shen Tu said with a helpless smile.

"He Zao, He Miao, bury him with me," Yue Xi said softly.

"All right." The three remaining Sword Alliance members together carried off the dead cultivator and found a place to bury him.

Yang Kai turned and walked into the mountain's interior, took a few turns in the corridor, and, familiar with the path, found the stone chamber where the Ghost Ancestor resided.

Yang Kai had never been in this particular stone chamber before; he only knew the Ghost Ancestor lived here—this was his first visit.

The entire chamber differed from the surrounding area; it seemed plunged into endless darkness with no light. Shades flitted within, and ghostlike energies swam around. As soon as he entered, Yang Kai felt a chill sweep through him and heard ghastly wails at his ear, unsettling his mind as strange scenes flashed before his eyes.

In those visions, pale‑faced fanged fiends lunged at him, eager to devour his flesh and soul, to drag him into the Nine Nether Purgatory and keep him out of the cycle of reincarnation forever.

His whole body stiffened; he could not move.

Suddenly clumps of demonic flame burst from his flesh, joining into a sheet that made him look as if he were on fire.

He struggled free from the illusion.

The Ghost Ancestor's raucous chuckle sounded in his ears as he said coldly, "Kid, what brings you here?"

Yang Kai frowned, letting the demonic flames continue to burn and dispel the ghostly influence. Choosing his words carefully, after a long while he said, "Did you kill someone today, Senior?"

The Ghost Ancestor laughed. "What's so remarkable about killing someone? You wouldn't come to trouble me over such a trifle, would you?"

"They're very nervous and afraid they'll be next," Yang Kai said in a low voice.

"Mm, being nervous is correct," the Ghost Ancestor said with pleasure. "I've grown tired of this boring continent and these dull days. I just found some amusement. I like seeing people fret and panic; let them be anxious."

"You kill simply because you're bored?"

"And what if I do?" the Ghost Ancestor snorted. The dark chamber suddenly brightened; the strange stones on the walls glowed, and the Ghost Ancestor sat in the chamber's center with eerie eyes fixed on Yang Kai, smiling lowly: "You come to plead for them? You're not that sort of person, are you? Even if I slaughtered them all, you wouldn't feel the slightest compassion."

"Senior, you jest. I am human too. Some of them are my friends; naturally I do not wish you to continue this slaughter."

"Friends?" The Ghost Ancestor paused, then laughed loudly. "You can fool others, but not me. Yes, you have some ties with a few of them, but not enough that you'd defy me for their sake. To put it simply: if it benefits you, you'd bring them along; if you face danger, you wouldn't give your life for them. You're not a fool—you know what happens if you cross me!"

Yang Kai fell silent; the Ghost Ancestor seemed to have hit upon his inner thoughts.

"You're afraid I'll kill them all and then turn on you!" the Ghost Ancestor said lowly.

Yang Kai nodded calmly. "Indeed. Senior, you see through things; I do have such worries."

The Ghost Ancestor nodded slightly. "If you're truly concerned, then work harder to find a way out—before I kill them all and come for you. I trust in your ability; more, I trust you haven't shown your full strength yet."

"I already have some clues," Yang Kai said, frowning.

The Ghost Ancestor's body trembled and a flash of light bloomed in his eyes. "Good, good, having clues pleases me. Your news makes me happy; my mood will likely hold for a while. Keep working—don't disappoint me!"

"I'll take my leave." Yang Kai cupped his fist and quickly withdrew.

The instant he turned, Yang Kai's expression grew grave.

He suddenly realized the Ghost Ancestor wasn't killing from mere ill temper, but was warning him—applying pressure.

He should have been wary over what he was hiding; otherwise the Ghost Ancestor would not have started killing suddenly.

He did not know precisely what he was concealing, and could not lay it bare, hence the Ghost Ancestor resorted to such means.

The Ghost Ancestor wanted to tell him his patience was limited: if he failed to satisfy him, the next corpse might be his.

Yang Kai's mind cleared, so in the end he had to soothe the Ghost Ancestor with a few words.

But that soothing might not last long; if the Ghost Ancestor grew impatient again, he really might make a move against him.

Yang Kai's face darkened; a deep sense of helplessness welled up within him.

He had always planned to slip away once he found a way out, to leave the Ghost Ancestor to remain trapped and rot here.

But the vast gap in their strengths left Yang Kai constantly on the defensive.

He realized his idea might be unrealistic.

Even if he succeeded in finding an exit, he might be intercepted by the Ghost Ancestor before he was safely away.

Yang Kai pondered whether he should trust the Ghost Ancestor's earlier pledge and leave together with him, so that everyone would be happy in the end.

That option carried obvious risks: Yang Kai did not know if the Ghost Ancestor truly would keep his word.

Thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind like lightning; his expression grew more and more solemn.

Back in his stone chamber, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged, recovering his expended strength while racking his brains.

Soft footsteps outside announced Bi Ya's uninvited arrival; she crept to Yang Kai's side, pressed her body against him, and with her full, heated form caressed his back, her small hands gently kneading his shoulders.

She parted her lips and said, "Master, when the day comes that we can leave, will you take me with you?"

"Of course," Yang Kai replied offhand.

Bi Ya smiled wryly and did not stop her ministrations. She murmured, "Don't bother humoring me; I know you've never planned to take me. After all, I have been rude and disrespectful to you before, and I'm not exactly a good person."

She suddenly began to wallow in self‑reproach, leaving Yang Kai baffled and unsure what performance she was putting on.
