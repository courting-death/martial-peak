## Chapter 766 — Divine Tree

The leader was the same expert who had earlier lifted the restriction on Yang Kai; his face was dark with helplessness. As they entered he waved his hand, and several clansmen immediately opened the cell doors on both sides.

"Kid, your time has come," the man said coldly. "We've kept you well fed and comfortable for days; now I want to see how useful you can be!"

As he spoke he once again suppressed Yang Kai's True Yuan and barked to the clansmen, "Take them all away!"

Gou Chi and his clansmen cursed loudly, only to be met with a flurry of blows and kicks; they were dragged out of the cell. Yang Kai and An Ling'er did not resist, thereby spared that fate.

Walking down the dungeon corridor, Gou Chi seemed unwilling to cooperate, stopping and starting and taking many lashes. By the time they left the cell he was covered in blood, yet his pride remained unbroken—he didn't even let out a groan; instead a stream of coarse, filthy words poured from his mouth, grating on everyone's ears.

The Yang Clan expert sneered repeatedly: "Keep cursing; soon you won't have the chance. They say you're the offspring of some Demon General? I reckon your old man is no better—he doesn't even come to rescue his son who's about to die."

"If you have the guts, let me go; I'll fetch reinforcements and have my father wipe you all out!" Gou Chi yelled.

"Idiot!" the man sneered disdainfully.

While Gou Chi spoke he kept glancing at Yang Kai as if about to act; Yang Kai quickly signaled him to stay calm.

This was when the expert was most on guard—even at his peak Yang Kai wouldn't risk trying to escape, let alone now when his True Yuan and Sea of Consciousness had been tampered with.

They had to wait for an opportunity, find the perfect moment, and release the Soul Devouring Worm to take control of a large number of Yang Clan talents.

Seeing this, Gou Chi fell silent and stared at Yang Kai with suspicion, unsure of his plans.

As they were escorted forward, the closer they went the stronger the Yang attribute energy fluctuations became, and the less stable everything felt.

They seemed hurried; their steps sped up.

Before long they arrived at an open field; within several hundred zhang there was nothing else—only a colossal tree, a hundred zhang tall, its canopy dense and its whole body golden, rooted here.

All the Yang attribute energy Yang Kai sensed was emanating from this giant tree.

It was like a protective umbrella, its vast canopy spread out and radiated energy far and wide, forming a visible semicircular protective membrane under the sky, covering the area where the Yang Clan lived.

Upon arriving, Yang Kai felt his True Yuan stir; his flesh twitched as the seals placed within him were invisibly shattered in many places.

His eyes brightened; Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

He hadn't expected such a wondrous tree to exist—this must be the Divine Tree the Yang Clan had spoken of, the very root of their people's power.

Because of their cultivation method, as long as they had this Divine Tree their strength would rise rapidly, without having to, like Yang Kai, search everywhere for Yang-attributed treasures and concentrations of Spiritual Qi.

This place was precisely the paradise Yang Kai had longed for.

Looking up, Yang Kai saw fruits hanging upside down from the towering Divine Tree—the same kind he'd eaten before—many in number; some fully ripe with years behind them, others still green and tender.

Not far from the tree's root the Yang Clan's elders waited; detecting the newcomers they turned and looked over, and when their gazes fell on Yang Kai each face was full of expectation.

The Divine Tree itself gave off an unusual fluctuation, sending an urgent, almost desperate message; visible ribbons of pure Yang energy extended like ropes from the tree and wrapped around Yang Kai.

Everyone's spirits leaped at the sight.

The leader stroked his beard with a smile and nodded: "It seems the Divine Tree likes this human."

"We're saved. With this human the Divine Tree can be stabilized for a while; we'll have ample time to seek new nourishment!"

"To be transformed into the Divine Tree's nourishment would be your honor!" mocked the expert who had escorted Yang Kai over.

"I don't see any honor in it," Yang Kai snorted, yet he didn't break free of the energy chains binding him to the tree.

The chains didn't restrain his movement; rather, they made him exceedingly comfortable.

They advanced further. Nearby the ground was littered with bones and dark-red bloodstains—clearly the corpses of demonic tribesmen previously dragged here for blood sacrifice.

At a glance the place looked like a sea of bones, shocking and heart-stopping.

An Ling'er's pretty face turned pale; at the thought that she might soon become like that, terror flooded her heart.

Crack, crack...

As they walked, they crushed bones beneathfoot; the snapping produced eerie, spine-chilling sounds.

Gou Chi ground his teeth, breathing heavily; his eyes reddened as resentment and a feral aura seeped from his body.

Those bones and dried blood were from his clansmen, and of course Gou Chi was enraged.

As they drew closer to the Divine Tree Yang Kai's expression grew strange; he seemed to sense some ineffable message from the tree and, for a time, his mind was immersed within it.

After a moment, the party was brought to the root of the Divine Tree.

The Yang Clan wasted no time and immediately prepared the blood sacrifice to placate the tree's agitation.

The leader fixed Gou Chi with burning eyes and coldly said, "Start with him."

At once someone stepped forward and pinned Gou Chi to the ground.

"Kid, what are you waiting for?" Gou Chi suddenly shouted at Yang Kai, and as he spoke his body swelled; his flesh pulsed with explosive power and the seals placed within him shattered.

Without hesitation Gou Chi thrust a claw-like hand at the nearest Yang Clan member's heart, seeking to end him with a single strike.

The Yang Clan members' faces remained unchanged; they regarded Gou Chi as a clown. The aged leader waved his hand and Gou Chi's movements froze. No matter how he struggled he couldn't move; cold sweat trickled from his brow, his crimson eyes burning with unwillingness—but before absolute power he was powerless.

"So you want to fight to the death?" the leader chuckled. "How childish; do you think I'd give you the chance?"

"You old bastard!" Gou Chi spat, veins bulging as he tried to force his True Yuan, but he still couldn't break free.

He was not weak—he had the level of Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—but before an expert of the Saint Realm he couldn't resist; moreover this was the Divine Tree's root, and in the dense Yang energy his Demon Yuan had been suppressed to the lowest. Even Yang Clan members of his own rank could easily deal with him.

"Kill him!" the leader ordered impatiently.

The two Yang Clan men who had held Gou Chi sneered and raised their palms as True Yuan surged, ready to strike.

"Wait!" Just as Gou Chi was about to be slain, Yang Kai suddenly shouted.

"What are you doing?" the leader glared at Yang Kai grimly. "Do you intend to die for him?"

At those words Gou Chi's expression turned strange.

Yang Kai curled his lip: "Sorry, my relationship with him isn't that deep; whether he lives or dies is none of my concern."

"Then why did you stop them?"

"I just think I may have a way to resolve the problem and calm your Divine Tree." Yang Kai smiled casually.

Every Yang Clan face changed; the leader's expression grew colder as he stared intently at Yang Kai: "Young man, youth and bravado are one thing; if you dare mock us I'll make you suffer horrors worse than death."

"If it's empty boasting, let me try—what do you lose?" Yang Kai said, his body shuddering.

In the next moment his True Yuan surged.

"You..." The escorting expert gaped at him, apparently surprised he could so easily shatter the imposed seals.

"Don't be so surprised; it's not that I have the power to crush your seals—it's the Divine Tree helping!" Yang Kai chuckled, pointing at the energies winding around him.

"Strange!" the man shook his head, puzzled.

"So will you let me try? Honestly, if you want to kill people now I have no objection—at most I die. But if you let me try you might be in for a surprise. If it fails you can still kill us afterward. The choice is yours."

Seeing his nonchalant, dare-to-die attitude, the Yang Clan hesitated.

Mainly the Divine Tree's strange behavior surprised them—there had been no precedent for it to bind its energy to a person; even Yang Clan members had never encountered such a thing.

So Yang Kai's words carried some credibility.

Perhaps as he said, there would be an unexpected surprise.

After a short discussion they turned their gaze to the leader.

The old man pondered and eyed Yang Kai with distrust for a long while before nodding slightly: "I agree. Tell us what you intend to do."

"Can't really explain—just watch." Yang Kai laughed lightly, ignoring the Yang Clan's oppressive stares and strode forward.

"If you dare damage the Divine Tree in the slightest I'll extract your soul and torment you for eternity!" the leader warned coldly.

Yang Kai snorted inwardly and paid him no mind.
