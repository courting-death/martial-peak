## Chapter 907 — Blood Sea Surges

"Yes." Lei Long nodded. "Back then I truly served under Great Lord Blood Jiao, and the Great Lord's death had something to do with the owner of this Secret Treasure."

"Was he killed by that fellow called Meng Wuya?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox cried out.

Lei Long shook his head slowly. "It wasn't like that. They fought, and the Great Lord was defeated within the span of an incense stick, left grievously wounded, and ultimately died of his injuries. Only after his death did I ascend to the position of Great Lord and become the ruler of this part of the yao realm."

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox's eyes nearly popped out; his voice rolled like distant thunder. "The Great Lord's strength back then should have been on par with the two of us now—how could anyone possibly fell him within the time of one incense stick?"

"Indeed, it was within the time of an incense stick. I watched their battle from the side back then! Meng Wuya's methods… were truly earth-shattering. Later I made inquiries and learned that the man was the foremost expert among humans; none could stand against him."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; the image of Shopkeeper Meng— that shameless old fellow— flashed through his mind, and his face twitched slightly.

Shopkeeper Meng actually had such a glorious past?

Although Yang Kai had long suspected Meng Wuya was formidable, he had still underestimated the extent of his prowess.

Only now did Yang Kai gain a clearer understanding of Shopkeeper Meng's background.

"And this Secret Treasure of the Heavenly Journey Palace belonged to that Meng Wuya…" Lei Long the Great Lord gazed at the treasure in Yang Kai's hand, his expression complex as he sighed softly. "Because of the Great Lord's death, I kept watch over that fellow's movements, but I heard he later went to the Demon Domain to challenge the current Demon Lord, fought alone, and died there…"

He paused, then added ruefully, "That man was an oddity—no sect, no master, apparently cultivating alone without a successor. How he reached such a realm is unknown, so now I have no avenue to seek vengeance. Boy, where did you obtain this Secret Treasure?"

"Heh heh. If I said it's what he left me, would you believe me?" Yang Kai said with an awkward laugh.

Lei Long frowned. "What do you mean? You mean to say he is still alive?"

"Yes."

"Impossible—there's been no trace of him for centuries. If he were alive, wouldn't there have been some commotion?" Lei Long sounded skeptical. He added suspiciously, "Why has the Heavenly Journey Palace been flickering like this?"

"Maybe it's sensing its owner's aura!" Yang Kai replied, gazing intently at the Heavenly Journey Palace. Ever since he had taken it out from the Black Book Space, the palace's flickering had grown more frequent, convincing Yang Kai that Meng Wuya might actually be nearby.

"He can't really be alive, can he?" the Great Lord Lei Long blurted.

"Do I seem like a liar?" Yang Kai looked at him seriously.

"You don't."

"Then that's settled."

Lei Long's expression shifted; his eyes brightened and he exclaimed, "So if we follow the Heavenly Journey Palace's guidance, we can find Meng Wuya? And escape this maze?"

"That's what I'm thinking." Yang Kai nodded heavily and poured his True Yuan into the Heavenly Journey Palace.

When Meng Wuya once used the Heavenly Journey Palace to shield Yang Kai's manor, it spared the manor from destruction by the Evil Lord and his kings. To make it convenient for Yang Kai to enter and exit the barrier, Meng Wuya had left a restriction within the palace that allowed Yang Kai to command it.

Only, this Secret Treasure did not truly belong to Yang Kai, so it could not unleash its full power.

But it was already enough.

As True Yuan flowed in, the Heavenly Journey Palace trembled and hummed. Yang Kai sensed the treasure on his palm stirring, as if it wanted to fly away.

He snapped to attention and shouted, "Follow me!"

Carrying the Heavenly Journey Palace and feeling the direction it pulled toward, Yang Kai sprinted forward.

The others followed close behind.

As they raced, Yang Kai's emotions rose and fell.

He wasn't certain whether Meng Wuya was truly here—perhaps he had once been here and left traces before departing. If that were the case, they still wouldn't find him or his Little Senior Sister this time.

But it was a clue, and it was hope.

He had already found Su Yan; he wasn't worried about Di Mo. If he could also find Xia Ningshang, then his purpose for coming to the Tongxuan Continent would be fulfilled.

Leaving Zhongdu and coming to this world, ten years had flashed by. In that decade his power had changed drastically, yet there remained one matter that weighed on his heart and made him sigh whenever he thought of it.

When he met Meng Wuya, he vowed to pluck that old lecher's beard clean! Yang Kai swore inwardly and redoubled his speed.

After who knew how long, the hazy view ahead suddenly shifted.

Something seemed to stand erect before them in that world.

As they approached, the Heavenly Journey Palace's light grew much stronger.

Yang Kai's spirit jolted and, without hesitation, he rushed forward. When he made out what stood before him, his brow furrowed.

The other five also came to a halt, staring ahead with grave expressions.

Ten zhang away from them stood a stone pillar, its height unknowable as it pierced the sky with no end in sight; it was thick enough that three people could only encircle it with their arms.

Several large characters had been carved onto the pillar, written in the same demonic script they had encountered when they first entered this place.

"Li Rong, what do those characters say?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

Li Rong glanced and then withdrew her gaze, unwilling to linger. She said in a low voice, "Tongxuan Pillar!"

"Tongxuan Pillar?" Yang Kai frowned, not knowing what the phrase signified.

Yet a decidedly unusual power surged from the pillar, a strength so intense it chilled every heart.

Following the Heavenly Journey Palace's guidance they had not found Meng Wuya, but discovering such a strange pillar made everyone's spirits sink.

Still, Yang Kai could sense the palace pulling them onward; it continued to point the way.

"Let's go. At least we're out of that maze," Yang Kai said, trying to comfort them.

The five nodded lightly and fell in step behind him.

As they moved, each kept extreme vigilance, fearful of sudden danger.

Half an hour later Yang Kai suddenly slowed, sniffing the air. "Do you notice anything strange?" he asked.

"The scent of blood!" Lei Long answered immediately, eyes sweeping the surroundings with wariness. "There's a bloody stench here."

"Yes, and it seems to be growing stronger," Yang Kai nodded.

"Wait—there's movement." Lei Long hissed.

Everyone halted and strained their ears.

A subtle sound rolled in from the distance, like waves swelling and receding.

The sound approached with shocking speed, and in moments it was not far off. Looking up, the gray world ahead began to glow with dark red light.

Gradually the dark red deepened, and the tide-like sound by their ears swelled clear and loud.

In an instant the whole world turned as crimson as fresh blood.

"Not good!" the Great Lord Lei Long roared, immediately unleashing his power. Arcs of electricity danced over his body as a bluish curtain of light enveloped them.

At the same time, ahead of them a viscous, boundless crimson torrent surged like a breached dam, roaring and thundering, and in an instant it swallowed the six of them.

The heavy metallic tang of blood filled their nostrils; before their eyes stretched nothing but thick crimson fluid. It was as if they had plunged into an ocean of blood, lost and disoriented with no way out.

The ruddy mist seeped everywhere, penetrating Lei Long the Great Lord's defenses. The Heavenly Journey Palace on Yang Kai's palm was only lightly touched and its light dimmed considerably, its spirit greatly weakened.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai drew the Heavenly Journey Palace into the Black Book Space.

Sssss...

Strange crackling sounds came from all directions; the blood mist seemed highly corrosive. A weird sound rose from the surface of each person's skin as it burned, agony wrenching through them.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and fought to keep the mist at bay, True Yuan draining away like water.

"What the hell is this?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox bellowed. A soil-colored light cloaked his body, but under the mist's erosion it faded quickly and he had to expend ever more power to defend himself, his strength depleting at a terrifying rate.

The surrounding sea of blood and its emanating mist seemed to eat away at their power.

"We must have triggered some restriction—rush outward with me, get out of this blood sea!" Lei Long shouted, bracing against the pressure of the torrent and pushing his defenses to the limit.

"Great Lord, watch out!" Caidie cried, flapping her iridescent wings as ghostly beams shot forth.

Following the direction of her attack, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

From that crimson sea countless figures formed from coagulated blood—Blood Men—emerged. Their features were blurred and their forms unstable. Caidie's strikes passed through them as if through mist, disappearing into the sea.

Before they could react, several Blood Men leapt and clawed at the Great Lord Lei Long.

Lei Long's eyes hardened. A purple lightning flashed out like a fang-serpent, slicing through those Blood Men and reducing them to puddles of blood.

Yet one Blood Man reached and grabbed the Great Lord's wrist.

Like a branding iron searing skin, a sizzling sound rang out. Lei Long's face contorted in pain as his body shuddered and the blood-hand was swept away.

But the imprint of a red, five-fingered hand remained on his wrist, flesh torn and split.

Everyone's faces went pale.

Lei Long, as a top-tier expert and a demonic beast with an immensely tough body, still could not resist the grip of that Blood Man—showing how terrifying the power in that blood truly was.

What dashed their hope even further was that the Blood Men Lei Long had smashed into puddles of blood reconstituted themselves unharmed and stood up again.

They appeared to be undead—impossible to eliminate completely.
