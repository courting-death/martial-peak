## Chapter 287 — Reviving the Dead

Inside the room, Yang Kai stepped forward, extending two fingers to rest on Ling Taixu's wrist, closing his eyes to examine.

As his Divine Sense swept over, Yang Kai's heart gradually sank to the depths of despair.

Ling Taixu's internal organs were all displaced, and he had no idea how many bones had been broken throughout his body. His vitality was minimal, and the power of his blood and Qi was barely detectable.

The True Essence within him was ethereal and nearly imperceptible, with countless meridians severed, causing a blockage in the flow of True Essence, hindering the operation of his cultivation technique.

Moreover, there were many evil auras invading his life force, devouring his True Essence. If not for a pure strand of Primordial Qi protecting his heart pulse, Ling Taixu would have likely perished long ago.

The Master’s injuries could only be described as catastrophic; he was hanging by a thread, and could pass away at any moment.

He clung to this last breath of Primordial Qi, perhaps just waiting for Yang Kai to return safely, as he had sent Yang Kai to another realm for training without any news until now.

“Have you used any medicine?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

The Senior Aunt let out a bitter laugh, “With the Sect Leader in this state, how can he withstand any medicine? Some time ago, he took a few pills, but now I dare not give him anything.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. The Master’s condition was too fragile; unless it was a pill that could instantly revive him, taking anything else would only deplete that last breath of Primordial Qi. At that point, there would truly be no hope left.

Fortunately, he could make it in time.

Furrowing his brows in thought, Yang Kai eventually said, “Senior Aunt, you should step outside for a moment. I have some words to share with the Sect Leader.”

The alchemist of Lingxiao Pavilion hesitated for a moment before rising to leave. Although he did not know the exact relationship between Yang Kai and Ling Taixu, the Sect Leader had instructed him to bring Yang Kai to see him as soon as he returned.

The Sect Leader valued Yang Kai so highly; their relationship was evidently not ordinary.

Once the Senior Aunt left, Yang Kai hurriedly took out some Wan Yao Ling Paste from the black book space.

He dared not take too much, only half a piece the size of a fingernail.

He did not know if Wan Yao Ling Paste could truly revive the dead, but he could only place his hopes on it now. After all, this was the essence gathered from thousands of years and millions of pills.

There was water in the room. Yang Kai took a cup, placed the Wan Yao Ling Paste inside, and poured in hot water to dissolve it.

He then held the cup, pinched Ling Taixu's mouth open with one hand, and slowly poured the medicinal liquid inside.

It took quite a while for Ling Taixu to finish half a cup of hot water.

Not daring to be negligent, Yang Kai placed both hands on Ling Taixu's chest acupoints, slowly infusing his True Essence to assist in refining the medicinal effects.

At the same time, his Divine Sense extended out, carefully observing the changes within his Master’s body.

As the effects of the Wan Yao Ling Paste began to unfold, Yang Kai distinctly felt a trace of vitality erupting from Ling Taixu's previously withered Dantian. Even the flow of blood throughout his body gradually quickened, and the heartbeat in his chest seemed to strengthen a bit.

There’s hope!

Yang Kai's expression brightened, and he slightly increased the output of his True Essence.

He could hardly express the worry he had just felt; Ling Taixu was far too weak now. If he couldn’t withstand the effects of the Wan Yao Ling Paste, and if it couldn’t revive him, it would mean he had personally ended Ling Taixu’s life.

This man before him was Fourth Master Yang’s Master! He was Yang Kai's own Master; how could he not be concerned?

Fortunately, the Wan Yao Ling Paste indeed played its role.

Moments later, a trace of True Essence gradually emerged within Ling Taixu's Dantian. Under Yang Kai's guidance, the True Essence flowed through the meridians, wrapping around the medicinal effects, quickly repairing the severed meridians. Under the scrutiny of his Divine Sense, the entire process was clear to see. Ling Taixu's displaced internal organs were also rapidly returning to their rightful positions.

Ling Taixu's pale face gradually regained color, and he unconsciously let out a sigh, the pain on his face easing.

Seeing this, Yang Kai became even more focused.

The Wan Yao Ling Paste truly possessed the power to revive the dead.

After a stick of incense, hurried footsteps suddenly echoed from outside the door. Yang Kai couldn't help but frown, straining to listen.

Moments later, someone arrived at the door.

He heard Su Xuanwu's voice say, “I heard Yang Kai has returned?”

Su Yan replied, “Yes, he’s inside.”

Elder Wei Xitong's voice followed, “Why are you out? Didn’t I tell you to stay by the Sect Leader’s side at all times?”

This was directed at the alchemist.

The person replied, “Nephew Yang said he has something to discuss with the Sect Leader…”

“Ridiculous!” Wei Xitong shouted angrily, “The Sect Leader is unconscious; how can he say anything?”

The Elder could never understand why the Sect Leader valued Yang Kai so much. The only words he uttered before losing consciousness were to have Yang Kai come see him immediately upon his return.

Even though Yang Kai had defeated Bai Yunfeng at the Separation and Union Realm First Stage, it shouldn’t have warranted such attention from the Sect Leader. Did the Sect Leader truly see him as the future helmsman of Lingxiao Pavilion?

This speculation made Wei Xitong uncomfortable; his relationship with Yang Kai was not harmonious, and he naturally did not want to see him gain power.

As they spoke, he led several other Elders into the room.

The sight that met their eyes shocked the four Elders. They saw Yang Kai’s True Essence surging, both hands pressed against the Sect Leader's chest, infusing True Essence within.

“Brat!” Wei Xitong was furious. The Sect Leader was barely breathing; he couldn’t even be touched, let alone withstand the infusion of True Essence into his body!

Wasn’t this asking for his life?

With an angry shout, he raised his hand, sending a gust of wind towards Yang Kai's back.

Su Yan’s eyes flashed with cold light. Before she could act, Su Xuanwu also struck out with a palm, intercepting Wei Xitong's attack midway.

The two palm winds collided, dissipating into nothingness.

“Junior Brother, what are you doing?” Wei Xitong glared at Su Xuanwu, his face filled with anger.

Su Xuanwu suppressed his displeasure and frowned, “I want to ask what Senior Brother is doing.”

Wei Xitong coldly replied, “What am I doing? You should first look at what this brat is doing… Brat, hurry up and let go! Do you want to kill the Sect Leader?”

“Shut up!” Yang Kai turned his head, his face dark as he shouted.

Although he had never liked Elder Wei Xitong, and he had just attacked him, Wei Xitong was still concerned for the Sect Leader. Thus, Yang Kai did not take it to heart. However, he was too self-righteous; making such a ruckus was irritating.

Wei Xitong was taken aback, never expecting this brat would dare speak to him in such a tone.

Just as the Elder was about to assert his authority to teach Yang Kai a lesson, a faint cough interrupted him. Then, the seemingly lifeless Ling Taixu suddenly said, “Stop making noise.”

His voice was weak, but it was indeed Ling Taixu's voice.

The four Elders were instantly stunned, their eyes nearly popping out of their sockets, their expressions filled with disbelief, as if they thought they were hearing things and couldn’t believe Ling Taixu was speaking.

“Sect Leader?” Wei Xitong called out uncertainly, half-convinced, peering over to see Ling Taixu opening his eyes, looking towards them.

“The Sect Leader has awakened?” Su Xuanwu rushed forward in a single bound, followed closely by Third Elder He Beishui and Fifth Elder You Zizai.

“Sect Leader…” Once they confirmed that the Sect Leader had truly regained consciousness, the voices of the old men trembled, their eyes instantly moistening. Even Wei Xitong, who was most adept at vying for power, was no exception. The Sect Leader’s awakening made them feel as if a heavy cloud had been lifted, and the weight on their hearts had suddenly been relieved.

Lingxiao Pavilion could lose anyone, but it could not lose Ling Taixu, especially at this critical moment.

“You all step outside first,” the Sect Leader instructed lightly.

“Yes!” The others did not dare hesitate, quickly exiting respectfully. Before leaving, they all cast suspicious glances at Yang Kai, unsure of what kind of miraculous means he possessed to bring the critically injured Sect Leader back from the brink of death.

Once the others had left, Yang Kai smiled at Ling Taixu, “Master!”

Ling Taixu looked at Yang Kai with gratitude, murmuring, “It’s good to be back, good to be back!”

As he spoke, his expression gradually relaxed, and he fell asleep again.

However, this time, his slumber was without the threat of death, and Yang Kai couldn’t help but exhale a sigh of relief.

Outside, the four Elders exchanged glances, utterly bewildered.

The alchemist was equally perplexed.

Half an hour ago, Ling Taixu had been hanging by a thread; how was it possible that he had awakened in less than half an hour? Moreover, looking at his complexion, it was much rosier than before, clearly indicating a significant recovery of his vitality.

“What medicine did you give the Sect Leader during this time?” Wei Xitong asked the alchemist, his expression uncertain.

The latter slowly shook his head, “No medicine was used. The Sect Leader’s body can no longer withstand the impact of medicine; using any would undoubtedly lead to death.”

The expressions of the others grew increasingly suspicious.

“Could it be that Yang Kai saved him?” You Zizai speculated uncertainly. They all understood the Sect Leader's injuries. Regardless of how miraculous one’s abilities were, it was impossible to reverse such severe wounds; how could he have inexplicably awakened?

“Surely not,” He Beishui clearly did not believe Yang Kai had such capabilities. “Let’s not mention whether he has the strength; even if he did, healing requires pills, right? Where would he find such a miraculous medicine that can revive the dead?”

Wei Xitong furrowed his brows, murmuring, “This is truly strange.”

Su Xuanwu snorted, “It’s a good thing that the Sect Leader has awakened. Why do you care so much? Once the Sect Leader’s condition stabilizes, we can just ask him; speculating now is futile.”

“Indeed, that’s true,” the Elders relaxed their expressions. The Sect Leader’s awakening was a tremendous joy; why should they care how he awoke?

“Forget it, I’ll go back to heal,” Wei Xitong shook his head, no longer pursuing the matter.

The others hurriedly followed suit. The Elders had all sustained serious injuries in the previous battle, and after some time of recuperation, they had improved significantly, but their injuries were still not fully healed and required further nurturing.

For several days, Yang Kai continued to administer Wan Yao Ling Paste to Ling Taixu. The Master’s condition improved day by day, and after four to five days, his injuries had actually healed.

Only the evil aura that had invaded his body remained unresolved, causing his complexion to occasionally reveal a faint trace of black aura.
