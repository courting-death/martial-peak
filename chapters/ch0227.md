## Chapter 227 — Encountering Chen Xueshu Again

If it were someone else being besieged by Demonic Beasts, Yang Kai would have to think carefully. He wouldn't want to save someone only to attract trouble upon himself. In this world, human hearts are not as they once were, especially for young Martial Artists training in foreign lands. Who wouldn’t want to keep a watchful eye? They would wish to see through the hearts of others, discerning whether they were black or red.

However, since it was two members of the Yingyue Sect in danger, Yang Kai had fewer concerns.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu left a good impression on him; they were not treacherous individuals. They had crossed paths before, and Yang Kai considered them trustworthy.

To gather information about this place, seeking them out was undoubtedly the best choice.

With this thought, Yang Kai no longer hesitated. He quietly climbed down from the tree and swiftly approached the battlefield.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu wore grave expressions, their true essence unleashed fiercely as they executed their killing moves. Although they had slain several Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts, the situation remained dire. The number of Demonic Beasts was overwhelming, surrounding them from all sides. Particularly, three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, possessing considerable intelligence, took advantage of the moments when they engaged with the Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts to launch sneak attacks, leaving the two of them in a precarious position. Chen Xueshu's injuries were a result of this.

If it weren't for their mutual understanding and seamless cooperation, they would have been in grave danger long ago.

During the battle, a glint of determination flashed in Chen Xueshu's eyes as he said solemnly, “Junior Sister, I will open a gap for you with all my strength. You must escape at the fastest speed. I will hold off the remaining Demonic Beasts.”

Upon hearing this, Shu Xiaoyu immediately understood his intentions and shook her head vigorously. “No! If we leave, we leave together. If we die... we die together!”

“Be obedient!” Chen Xueshu shouted angrily. “Our true essence is nearly depleted, and there are too many Demonic Beasts to escape! Only by leaving one person to hold them off can there be a glimmer of hope for survival! Once you leave, do not look back. Find a safe place to hide and don’t come out again. When this place closes, you can return to the sect!”

“I don’t want to hear it! I don’t want to hear it!” Shu Xiaoyu shook her head vigorously.

Chen Xueshu wanted to persuade her further, but unexpectedly, Shu Xiaoyu resolutely declared, “If you say another word, I will charge up and let these Demonic Beasts tear me apart!”

“How can you…” Chen Xueshu felt both anger and heartache.

“Do you think I wouldn’t dare?” Shu Xiaoyu glared with wide eyes.

“Fine! Senior Brother won’t say anymore. Then let’s fight our way out! Let these beasts witness the supreme skills of the Yingyue Sect!” Chen Xueshu’s spirit surged, and the resolve of death he had harbored was instantly dispelled.

Shu Xiaoyu smiled brightly, standing shoulder to shoulder with Chen Xueshu, their true essence surging within them. They raised their hands and unleashed a combined palm strike.

A half moon suddenly appeared in the sky. Streams of moonlight, resembling silver threads, cascaded down. This moonlight contained unparalleled lethality, piercing through the bodies of the surrounding dozen or so Demonic Beasts. They could not help but let out miserable howls, with half of the Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts instantly killed, and even one Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast heavily injured. Blood spilled across the ground.

The ultimate technique of the Yingyue Sect, the Full Moon in the Sky!

If this move could unleash its full power, those dozen Demonic Beasts would surely have no hope of survival. Unfortunately, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu were at the end of their strength, and their combined effort only produced a waning moon, greatly diminishing the technique's power.

Yet, the Demonic Beasts, struck by this attack, retreated in unison. Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu exchanged breaths and glanced at each other, their eyes filled not with regret but warmth.

They had done their utmost, with their true essence depleted by ninety percent, leaving them with no strength to resist. The next time the Demonic Beasts attacked, it would be their moment of death.

The surviving Demonic Beasts seemed to realize this as well. After a brief retreat, they bared their fangs and surrounded the two again, their cold, sinister gazes locked onto them, poised to pounce!

The two did not sit idly by. Chen Xueshu protected Shu Xiaoyu at his side, his fighting spirit ignited, his face stern.

Swish, swish, swish... The remaining Demonic Beasts charged forward. Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu simultaneously shouted and unleashed their last bit of true essence.

One of the foremost Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts had its skull shattered, dying on the spot.

Another Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast was also sent flying, howling as it fell, clearly on the brink of death.

However, the number of Demonic Beasts was still overwhelming. The two could hardly fend off the multitude. During the battle, the two intact Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts launched a surprise attack, targeting the already weakened Chen Xueshu.

The stench of blood wafted through the air, and the breath of death descended.

Suddenly, a figure fell from the sky, landing gracefully in front of Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu.

The two siblings exchanged a glance of astonishment.

In the next moment, they saw this person’s palms imprinting on the backs of the two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

Two simultaneous cries of agony erupted, and the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast that had nearly bitten Chen Xueshu was forcefully knocked to the ground.

A series of dull thuds echoed from within the two Demonic Beasts, a scorching sensation radiating, bringing with it a wave of warmth.

Once the person landed, they unleashed four punches in rapid succession, like lightning!

Bang, bang, bang...

The four Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts that had lunged at them were all sent flying, struggling on the ground but unable to rise, blood frothing from their mouths.

“It’s you!” Shu Xiaoyu exclaimed in shock, her mouth agape, then looked at Yang Kai with joy and excitement.

“Junior Brother Yang!” Chen Xueshu couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. The feeling of escaping death was so wonderful.

“Let’s talk later!” Yang Kai dashed forward with the wind at his feet.

Although he had knocked the two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts to the ground with two palm strikes, he had not taken their lives. At this moment, the two Demonic Beasts sensed the danger and, while baring their teeth and growling in intimidation, began to retreat slowly, attempting to escape.

Yang Kai’s expression was cold as he charged toward the two Demonic Beasts without a hint of fear, raising his hand to strike one of them on the head.

The Demonic Beast reacted swiftly, narrowly avoiding the blow. But before it could react further, Yang Kai’s palm transformed into a sweeping motion.

With a loud slap, he struck the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast across the face.

The massive Demonic Beast spun like a top in mid-air, flying over ten zhang away before crashing into a large tree and falling to the ground.

Yang Kai had already aimed his fist at the other Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, executing the Triple Flame Yang Explosion, striking it squarely on the forehead.

After three dull thuds, the Demonic Beast staggered as if drunk, swaying unsteadily, and a blood-red crack burst forth from its hard forehead.

Yang Kai swept a kick, sending it flying as well, landing right next to the first Demonic Beast.

Moving like the wind, he rushed forward, unleashing a flurry of punches.

The Demonic Beast's howls of agony continued, gradually fading into silence.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu were left dumbfounded, with Shu Xiaoyu’s mouth hanging open and Chen Xueshu equally astonished.

After a moment, Yang Kai returned, panting lightly, bloodied, and looked at the two with confusion. “What’s wrong?”

Only then did Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu come back to their senses. The former forced a bitter smile and cautiously asked, “Junior Brother Yang, what realm are you at now?”

“Seventh Stage!” Yang Kai chuckled, then tossed a blood bead, formed from a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast's death, into Shu Xiaoyu’s mouth.

“Ah…” Shu Xiaoyu was startled, hurriedly closing her mouth. After she reacted, her expression was filled with surprise and joy.

“Seventh Stage?” Chen Xueshu looked incredulous.

“You’re lying!” Shu Xiaoyu, though grateful for the blood bead Yang Kai had given her, was annoyed at his nonchalant attitude of tossing it in without warning. What if it was something dirty? She immediately retorted without reservation.

“Why would I lie to you?” Yang Kai chuckled, handing another blood bead to Chen Xueshu.

Chen Xueshu hesitated for a moment, then reached out to take it, saying, “Great kindness requires no thanks; Chen will remember this!”

“No need for thanks. I can see your true essence is nearly depleted. You should quickly gather these blood beads to recover,” Yang Kai pointed to the side.

The two nodded and walked over to collect all the blood beads.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Chen Xueshu cautiously surveyed their surroundings, then led Yang Kai and Shu Xiaoyu away swiftly.

They seemed to be in a hurry, as they began refining and absorbing the energy of the blood beads on the way, without any delay.

With the help of the blood beads, the two quickly restored their true essence. After about half a stick of incense, Yang Kai heard the sounds of battle coming from not far away.

“This way!” Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu’s spirits lifted as they dashed toward the sound.

Yang Kai, filled with confusion, could only suppress his curiosity and follow behind them.

Before long, they arrived at the battlefield, and the scene before Yang Kai made him frown.

He discovered that there were dozens of various Demonic Beasts attacking a group of Martial Artists, just like the earlier predicament faced by Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu.

“Junior Brother Yang, if you don’t want to get involved, just stand aside and watch. We will discuss things with you once we handle this!” Chen Xueshu instructed sternly, then charged into the fray with Shu Xiaoyu.

“Brother Chen and the others are back!” Someone quickly spotted Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu, shouting excitedly.

“Brother Chen truly possesses profound strength, able to escape from so many Demonic Beasts!” another person shouted.

Chen Xueshu could only smile bitterly, as only he and Shu Xiaoyu understood that they had nearly been torn apart by the Demonic Beasts. If Yang Kai hadn’t appeared at a critical moment, they wouldn’t have had their lives spared.

The praises they heard now felt so jarring.

Silently, the two from the Yingyue Sect quickly joined the group of Martial Artists, engaging in fierce combat with the Demonic Beasts.

Perhaps Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu's safe return invigorated the group, or perhaps the Demonic Beasts realized that continuing the fight was futile. After a while, a loud beast roar echoed from afar.

Upon hearing this roar, the dozens of Demonic Beasts abandoned the Martial Artists and retreated in unison, quickly disappearing into the forest.

On the battlefield, there were several corpses of Demonic Beasts left behind, along with one corpse of a Martial Artist.

Yang Kai stood to the side, feeling bewildered, unable to suppress his astonishment.

He noticed that these people had somehow gathered together, setting aside their sect differences, uniting their efforts to fight against the Demonic Beasts.
