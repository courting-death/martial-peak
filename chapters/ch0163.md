## Chapter 163 — The Unconscious Junior Sister

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

“If you truly cannot suppress it… you can seek out other women,” Su Yan's long eyelashes fluttered as her expression turned serious.

“Isn't that a bit much? I'm not some kind of lecher,” Yang Kai replied with a bitter smile.

Su Yan shook her head slowly. “You don’t understand the pain of that feeling when it surges up and I’m not by your side. I came to find you two days ago, but this Xia Junior Sister has been nearby the whole time. It was only out of desperation that I acted against her. Sigh, I hope she doesn’t blame me when she wakes up.”

“Is that feeling really that intense?” Yang Kai frowned. He understood Su Yan's nature well; for her to come seeking him like this, she must have reached a breaking point.

“Extremely intense, intense enough to make one’s body and mind tremble!” Su Yan said earnestly. “So, I do not oppose you seeking out other women.”

Yang Kai felt a bit guilty upon hearing her words. Lacking full confidence, he dared not respond.

Su Yan nestled closer to Yang Kai, her eyes glancing to the side. “For example, this Junior Sister Xia is a very good candidate. I see that she cares for you a lot. Although she’s veiled, she must be a beautiful person. Her strength is not low, her heart is kind, and her temper is gentle. You might as well spend more time with her. If you cannot hold on when I’m not around, at least there’s someone to comfort you.”

“You shouldn’t say that; the consequences could be severe.” Yang Kai immediately thought of Meng Wuya and felt a headache coming on.

“How do you know her?”

Yang Kai briefly recounted the events that transpired in the Jiuyin Valley, omitting the kiss that had been filled with confusion and passion. It wasn’t that he wanted to hide it from Su Yan; it was just that this matter involved Xia Ningshang’s reputation, and he couldn’t speak carelessly.

“So that’s how it is. I should thank her more,” Su Yan said, feeling a bit of goodwill towards Xia Ningshang after hearing Yang Kai's words. The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew that Yang Kai had given her had indeed come from Xia Ningshang.

“When she wakes up, find a time to apologize. Senior Sister Xia won’t blame you,” Yang Kai said with a wry smile.

“Mm. I will.”

The two embraced until midnight, sharing many heartfelt words.

Around the fourth watch of the night, Su Yan got up and dressed.

“I should leave,” Su Yan said softly, stepping away from Yang Kai. For her, this was also a kind of mental training and test.

“Don’t rush to leave!” Yang Kai pulled her to the cave entrance, pointing to the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng rooted nearby. “First, give it some Yuan Qi.”

“What is this?” Su Yan squatted down, looking at the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng with curiosity. “It seems to be smiling at me. Is it a spirit of heaven and earth?”

“Indeed, it’s a spirit of heaven and earth that absorbs both Yin and Yang Qi to survive. This place only has Yang Qi; you need to supplement it with Yin Qi.”

Su Yan did not hesitate. She reached out to touch the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, channeling her Yuan Qi into it, making the expression of this spirit of heaven and earth much more joyful.

After a moment, Su Yan withdrew her hand, standing up to embrace Yang Kai.

After the embrace, she turned to leave.

Yang Kai smiled as he watched her retreating figure, not attempting to keep her.

Just as Su Yan was about to vanish from sight, Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and hurriedly asked, “By the way, when will Senior Sister Xia wake up?”

“By dawn, I suppose,” Su Yan's voice drifted back.

She had deliberately left Xia Ningshang here, hoping Yang Kai would spend more time with her. As for what Yang Kai should say when the girl woke up, she need not worry. With Yang Kai's cleverness, it would be easy for him to fabricate a lie to win her favor.

After leaving Yang Kai’s cave, Su Yan flew to the Dragon Confinement Ravine, glancing back with a mix of guilt and unease. At that moment, she felt like a bad woman, the feelings surging in her heart. She had come over to fiercely do something to Yang Kai, then left feeling satisfied.

As this thought arose, Su Yan’s face flushed.

Filled with self-reproach at the Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai stood at the cave entrance, his mind in disarray. After a while, he began to sweat profusely.

He suddenly recalled an important matter he had overlooked.

According to Su Yan, she had used a drug to put Xia Ningshang into a stupor. However, she had no idea what kind of physique Xia Ningshang possessed!

The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body! It was the best alchemical furnace in the world, and combined with her cultivation technique, she could refine all energies in the world into pills.

In terms of alchemy, Xia Ningshang was a master! How could such a person be easily subdued by a mere drug?

Even if she had fainted at that time, it was impossible for her to remain unconscious until dawn. With her special physique, she should be able to awaken in an instant.

No way…

Yang Kai’s sweat poured down…

He stood rigidly at the cave entrance for a full hour, feeling an impulse to dig a hole and hide.

After a long time, Yang Kai mechanically turned around and walked step by step into the stone chamber where the stone bed was placed.

Inside the sealed stone chamber, a damp scent lingered.

As he approached, Yang Kai distinctly felt Xia Ningshang’s breathing had become somewhat turbulent. Though it was very slight, if one did not pay close attention, it would be undetectable. But with Yang Kai’s mind fully focused on Xia Ningshang, this small change could not escape his notice.

This is really… awkward.

Wiping his face, Yang Kai steeled himself and sat down beside Xia Ningshang.

Since being placed on the stone bed, this Junior Sister had remained lying there without moving. Her delicate chest rose and fell with her breathing, her petite body occupying only one side of the stone bed, her long legs straight and adorned in a green dress, bringing a touch of spring to the otherwise empty stone chamber.

Yang Kai quietly watched her, not blinking.

Xia Ningshang’s breathing indeed changed again, her heartbeat becoming much more rapid, her eyelashes fluttering slightly, and a faint blush appeared on her face.

“Ah…” Yang Kai sighed deeply, leaning down to Xia Ningshang’s ear and softly calling, “Junior Sister, Junior Sister…”

Xia Ningshang remained motionless, eyes still closed, as if truly unconscious.

Yang Kai felt helpless and said, “I’m going to lift your veil.”

Speaking of which, since he met her, Yang Kai had never seen her true face. Every time Xia Ningshang appeared, she was veiled. Even during that kiss in the Jiuyin Valley, she had only lifted a corner of her veil, not revealing her full appearance.

It was impossible for Yang Kai not to be curious about her looks. However, he wouldn’t be so bored as to demand to see her face.

At this moment, Yang Kai had no choice but to resort to this tactic. As he spoke, he reached out to lift the layer of veil slowly.

Throughout the process, Yang Kai kept observing Xia Ningshang’s expression for any changes.

But until he was about to fully lift the veil, Xia Ningshang showed no signs of resistance.

She really can endure! Yang Kai was impressed.

After several attempts and finding that she truly wouldn’t wake up, Yang Kai finally let go of the veil, chuckling as he said, “Junior Sister, if you don’t wake up soon, I will… hehehe…”

The laughter was filled with suggestive tones, its meaning self-evident.

As he spoke, Yang Kai spread his ten fingers, as if possessed by a chicken claw frenzy, shaking them on Xia Ningshang's flat abdomen, pulling back immediately after each touch, causing waves of strange ticklish sensations.

Xia Ningshang involuntarily moved her body, and a clear smile appeared at the corners of her mouth.

Yet she still did not open her eyes, allowing him to torment her as she lay there unconscious.

After threatening her for a long time, even pretending to grab at her delicate chest, she remained indifferent.

“Alright, you really are unconscious.” After toying with her for a while, Yang Kai had to concede defeat, sighing softly, “Junior Sister, sleep well. By dawn, you’ll forget everything.”

After speaking, Yang Kai stood up and walked to the cave entrance to continue meditating.

The night passed without incident. When dawn broke, Yang Kai walked back in to check on Xia Ningshang and couldn’t help but feel speechless.

It was quite a feat for her to maintain this position without moving for an entire night. He wondered if her body had gone numb. After some thought, Yang Kai turned her over, letting her lie on her side on the stone bed.

After doing this, Yang Kai climbed up to the upper part of the Dragon Confinement Ravine through the passage he had previously cut.

Yang Kai had no worries about Xia Ningshang. Whether she was awake or unconscious, this Junior Sister had a simple nature. Even if she stumbled upon his affair with Su Yan, she wouldn’t pose any threat to him.

As he walked towards the Lingxiao Pavilion, passing the Contribution Hall, Meng Wuya greeted him enthusiastically, “Little Yang Kai…”

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically, pretending not to hear, he hurriedly sped away, disappearing in an instant.

“Why is he running?” Meng Wuya frowned, pondering for a long time, but couldn’t recall where he had offended him.

He had no idea that Yang Kai was feeling guilty about last night’s events.

“Greetings, Shopkeeper Meng!” A group of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples respectfully bowed to Shopkeeper Meng.

Before the appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Meng Wuya had never received such treatment. Everyone regarded him as just a small shopkeeper.

But since that day when he single-handedly suppressed the entire Blood Battle Gang, the news spread, and everyone knew that this usually lecherous shopkeeper was a hidden expert. In front of him, no one dared to act recklessly; they all behaved more obediently than rabbits.

Seeing that Meng Wuya did not pursue him, Yang Kai couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. Just as he was walking, he noticed a crowd gathered in front of the Martial Arts Pavilion, bustling with excitement. After listening for a while, Yang Kai quickly understood what was happening.

This time, with the opening of the Inheritance Celestial Cave, many disciples had obtained various martial techniques or cultivation methods through different means. The sect was naturally interested in collecting these martial techniques to enrich the Martial Arts Pavilion.

If any disciples were willing to contribute the martial techniques and methods they had obtained to the sect, they could receive some Contribution Points as a reward, and the rewards were quite generous.

Not only Lingxiao Pavilion was doing this; the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower also had similar reward measures.

Yang Kai himself had obtained two sets of martial techniques in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, one being Flame Yang Explosion and the other Mark of the Stars. However, he had no interest in submitting them, especially the Mark of the Stars, which was a significant weapon unique to him.
