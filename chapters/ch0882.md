## Chapter 882 — The Long Shuttle Secret Treasure

In the starry sky, meteorites darted about; no one knew where they came from or where they were headed. It seemed they had drifted through the starry sky since time immemorial, waiting to be discovered.

Yang Kai even suspected that Tongxuan Continent itself might be nothing but an unimaginably vast meteorite.

He and Li Rong searched the starry sky for an hour or two and soon found several meteorites of various sizes.

Some were as small as washbasins, others as large as mountains.

After smashing those meteorites, Yang Kai did indeed obtain some rare ores, though the quantity was limited and the grades not especially high.

His main purpose in coming to the starry sky this time was to verify whether the memories in Zhang Ao’s mind were accurate.

But since they had already come this far, they couldn’t return empty-handed.

Besides, the minerals in Black Book Space had already been exhausted, so this was a good opportunity to gather more.

Yang Kai was curious to see what changes the two jet-black spheres would undergo after absorbing enough mineral essence.

“Master, it looks like a large meteorite is flying over there!” Li Rong’s divine sense detected movement; she pointed off into the distance.

“Let’s go see!” Yang Kai immediately flew in that direction.

Before long, a meteorite the size of a house hurtled toward them. Its pitted surface showed the wear of countless years; it looked barely able to withstand much more.

Li Rong rushed up and, before the meteorite even arrived, slapped it once with her palm.

Her delicate jade hand unleashed a shocking force; the massive meteorite shattered outright, exploding into countless fragments that scattered in all directions.

Quick-eyed, Yang Kai zeroed in on a dark-red piece with an unusual appearance, intercepted it, examined it, and then, satisfied, stowed it in Black Book Space beside the two jet-black spheres.

Inside meteorites there are often rare minerals. These minerals are hard and difficult to break.

So smashing meteorites to search for them was undoubtedly the fastest and most convenient method.

Li Rong collected a couple as well and hurried over to hand them to Yang Kai.

“Master, are you collecting these to forge Secret Treasures?” Li Rong asked with a smile.

Although most of the ores gathered from the starry sky cannot be named at a glance, judging by their texture they were at least Spirit-Grade minerals, and many were even Saint-Grade.

Treasures forged from such materials would naturally be of respectable quality.

Seeing Yang Kai busily collecting, Li Rong naturally assumed he intended to make Secret Treasures.

“Something like that.” Yang Kai didn’t bother to explain. While he was surveying the surroundings, his expression suddenly shifted and he glanced to one side.

The starlight flickered, and a short distance away—dozens of li from them—there seemed to be a dense cluster of tiny black dots rapidly rushing past.

“A meteorite sea?” After watching for a moment, Yang Kai cried out in delight, signaled to Li Rong, and shot toward it.

Before long, the sight of a vast congregation of meteorites came into view.

The meteorites stretched like a great river for who knew how many li, flowing through the boundless starry sky.

Countless meteorites lay within that sea—some large, some small—an awe-inspiring spectacle.

They drifted through the starry sky in absolute silence, eerie and uncanny.

“So many meteorites?” Li Rong stared at the scene in astonishment.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, “Now we don’t have to search everywhere.”

Saying that, he plunged into the meteorite sea; Li Rong smiled and hurried after him.

The two unleashed their inner power to wreak havoc among the meteorites. Strangely, sound seemed unable to propagate in the starry sky; their communication relied solely on divine sense, and even shattered fragments made no noise when they exploded.

One by one, ores of varying sizes were stored in Black Book Space by Yang Kai—materials rare on Tongxuan Continent.

If any master artificer saw this scene, they might well go mad with envy.

Outstanding artificers sometimes traverse thousands of mountains and rivers to find rare ores; even then, obtaining truly satisfactory materials is difficult.

Yet the starry sky contained endless, easily accessible mineral wealth.

Such an astonishing fortune was now solely available to Yang Kai.

Li Rong seemed infected by Yang Kai’s joy; her pretty face stayed lit with a smile as she busied herself without pause.

Most meteorites contained nothing; when smashed they produced only rubble, but the meteorite sea was so vast that even with small odds, after a few hours Yang Kai and Li Rong had harvested greatly.

Drifting among the dense meteorites, Yang Kai and Li Rong moved with casual ease.

Gradually, the seemingly endless meteorite sea reached its end and was about to slip out of their sight.

“That should be enough.” Yang Kai said, preparing to stop.

In any case, the gateway to the starry sky lay within Poxuan Palace; if they wanted to return later they could come anytime, so there was no need to keep collecting here.

“Mm.” Li Rong nodded, took the last piece of ore she had knocked out, and flew to Yang Kai’s side.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a faint, concealed energy fluctuation emanating from somewhere in the meteorite sea.

That faint energy did not seem to come from ordinary minerals, and it naturally drew Yang Kai’s attention.

He concentrated and looked over; a faint gleam of light entered his sight.

Yang Kai’s brow tightened and his figure flickered—he vanished from where he stood and reappeared near the light. When he saw what was emitting the glow, his expression turned strange.

He reached out, picked it up, and returned to Li Rong’s side.

“Did you find something, Master?” Li Rong asked suspiciously.

“This…” Yang Kai handed over what he had retrieved from the meteorite sea.

Li Rong took it, examined it closely, then revealed a look of surprise and exclaimed, “This is… a Secret Treasure?”

The object they had found in the meteorite sea was only about the size of a palm. Its shape was smooth and elongated, like a shuttle—pointed at both ends and flattened in the middle—and it emanated a mysterious energy fluctuation.

However, perhaps because of the long passage of time, its energy had dwindled to the point of being barely perceptible.

“I think it’s a Secret Treasure too.” Yang Kai’s expression was grave as he gazed at the receding meteorite sea and frowned.

“But… how could there be a Secret Treasure here?” Li Rong found it hard to believe.

The starry sky belonged to the realm of legend—no one had ever set foot there, let alone explored it.

If not for the Void Passage inside Poxuan Palace, neither she nor Yang Kai would have been able to reach this place.

Yet a Secret Treasure lay within the meteorite sea of the starry sky, and the implications were intriguing!

“A Secret Treasure means there were martial artists… perhaps someone has already explored the starry sky,” Yang Kai said in a low voice.

“Impossible, right?” Li Rong covered her mouth in astonishment. “Even the Great Demon God only longed for this place in the past; he never managed to penetrate it.”

“What if there were figures more powerful than the Great Demon God?” Yang Kai said lightly.

Li Rong’s face paled, her heart stunned—she could not imagine what level such a person would possess.

The Great Demon God had been hailed as the strongest being in the world across the ages; no one had ever surpassed him. What sort of caliber could someone stronger than the Great Demon God be? Li Rong could not conceive.

Yang Kai drew in a breath and said, “I only spoke casually; don’t dwell on it. But judging from the energy signature of this Secret Treasure, it indeed dates back some time. Even if such figures existed, they likely no longer remain in the world.”

“That’s true.” Li Rong relaxed considerably, exhaled, and handed the shuttle-shaped Secret Treasure back to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sent his divine sense to probe it but could not glean much information. He asked, “Can you tell its grade?”

Li Rong shook her head, “I can’t tell. It contains a peculiar power that’s close to fading, and it kept resisting my inspection. Master, you should take it back and study it properly. It’s best to figure out exactly what it does.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded and tucked the long-shuttle Secret Treasure away, intending to refine it when he returned.

He presently wore only one other Secret Treasure on his person—the Silver Leaf Secret Treasure.

It had belonged to the previous Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, ranked as an Upper-Level Saint-Grade treasure, with boundless uses both offensive and defensive. Refining this shuttle in addition would not be excessive.

Ordinary martial artists usually had at least two or three Secret Treasures, and those of noble birth even more.

Speaking of Secret Treasures, Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and asked, “You, Han Fei and the others don’t have any handy Secret Treasures, do you?”

Li Rong smiled, “The Ancient Demon Clan originally had some Secret Treasures, and their grades were not low, but they were lost with our ancestors’ passing. Our clan’s greatest asset is our bodies; in battle it doesn’t matter whether we have Secret Treasures.”

“That may be, but having Secret Treasures is still better—they might be useful.” Saying so, Yang Kai retrieved several Secret Treasures of different shapes from Black Book Space and handed them to Li Rong. “Take these back and let Han Fei, Hua Mo, and the others choose ones suitable for them to refine.”

“So many? And they’re all Saint-Grade?” Li Rong looked astonished.

Saint-Grade Secret Treasures are rare—each one worth a fortune.

The Saint Realm masters across the continent all hope to possess a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure, but such things aren’t available to everyone.

Most Saint Realm experts still use Spirit-Grade Secret Treasures.

Saint-Grade Secret Treasures are as hard to make as high-grade pills: materials are scarce and forging is difficult.

Most importantly, there are few artificers capable of forging Saint-Grade Secret Treasures; even they face a chance of failure.

Renowned Saint-Grade artificers enjoy high status and respect, but their schedules are packed since so many people beg them to craft Saint-Grade Secret Treasures.

Why does the world’s top pill alchemist, Old Man Tianzang, move about so erratically?

It’s because so many people want him to concoct pills for them—if he didn’t hide his whereabouts, he’d be bothered to death and have no time to teach his disciple.
