## Chapter 695 — I'm Going!

Cang Yan delivered a large consignment of medicinal ingredients a day later, and Yang Kai immediately threw himself into the great undertaking of pill refining.

When refining wore him out he would sit in meditation to rest, and once his spirit was replenished he resumed his work.

Qixiu Peak was indeed very quiet; this peak housed only Yang Kai and Fei Yu, and whenever Yang Kai was refining pills or cultivating, Fei Yu never disturbed him—coming and going she held her breath and moved with the lightest of steps.

Each day's three meals were made of rare Demonic Beast flesh, rich bone broths and other restorative delicacies; although with Yang Kai's current cultivation he could go months or even half a year without eating, Fei Yu still insisted on bringing these provisions daily.

She left them at the door, and when Yang Kai needed them he would take them himself to eat.

Occasionally when he went out of the stone chamber, the four guardians would all gather to explain their cultivation experiences and their own insights into the Heavenly Dao and the Martial Dao.

Here Yang Kai felt care that left no detail unattended.

The people of Tianxiao Sect provided him with the finest environment for both cultivation and pill refining.

Yang Kai was grateful; although he knew much of this favor came from the talent he had shown and his identity as an alchemist, the four Senior Aunt and Uncles had indeed treated him very well.

After several consecutive months, Yang Kai's alchemical skill rose again, and without relying on a spirit formation he successfully refined a Saint-Grade Lower-Level Pill.

This brought him many steps closer to his goal.

Over the following months Yang Kai spared no effort, producing great quantities of Pill for Tianxiao Sect; the sheer number and high caliber left the four Senior Aunt and Uncles astounded.

They only knew Yang Kai's Alchemists' Association registration listed him as a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, and never imagined that from his hands there flowed Spirit-Grade Middle-Level and Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Pills.

Many of those Spirit-Grade Pills even developed Pill Patterns!

The four guardians realized the seriousness of the matter. After a brief discussion, Yang Kai's existence and abilities were quickly classified as Tianxiao Sect's greatest secret, and Fei Yu had all but become Yang Kai's bodyguard, never leaving Qixiu Peak.

During these days Yang Kai saw Fei Yu only a few times, and every time she appeared she was tipsy; it seemed she truly enjoyed drinking, and when the wine took hold she lost all trace of Senior Aunt decorum, often clinging to Yang Kai and creating situations that left him both exasperated and amused.

Yet each time she sobered she remembered nothing, leaving Yang Kai utterly helpless.

In the rare leisure Yang Kai would also visit Chu Lingxiao to hear his instruction, and he benefited greatly.

Since he began cultivating, Yang Kai had essentially been groping his own path; never having had instruction makes a great difference compared to having someone to guide you.

Fortunately, Yang Kai now possessed the World-Ending Demon Eye, which allowed him, by slaying certain strong opponents, to forcibly absorb their insights into the Martial Dao and Heavenly Dao and thereby profit.

What pained Yang Kai slightly, however, was that although Chu Lingxiao had also ordered people to look into Su Yan and Xia Ningshang's whereabouts, there had been no progress.

Tongxuan Continent is vast; trying to find two people among its boundless crowds was truly like searching for a needle in the sea.

Several months later, one day while Yang Kai was refining a Pill, he suddenly sensed faint footsteps outside the door.

They were Fei Yu's footsteps.

She had never interrupted him while he refined, and now she had come, deliberately making some noise—clearly she had business with him.

Yang Kai hastened his hands; after the time it takes an incense stick to burn, a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Pill was completed.

Putting away the Spirit-Grade Pill, he rose and opened the stone chamber door, looking at Fei Yu waiting outside and said, "Senior Aunt? Is there something you need?"

"Did I disturb you?" she asked.

Yang Kai shook his head.

"Good," Fei Yu breathed out softly. "Cang Yan is looking for you; he's right outside."

"I'll go see." Yang Kai said as he hurried out.

Not long after, Yang Kai saw Cang Yan; this time not only he had come, but Li Wan and Fei Jian were present as well, and the three men carried a somewhat grave air.

Yang Kai's expression tightened; he had no idea what had happened to make them treat him with such seriousness.

"Junior." Seeing Yang Kai appear, Cang Yan hastily greeted him.

"I heard Senior Uncle called for me?"

"Sit first." Cang Yan waved a hand to indicate.

The men took their seats in turn, and Yang Kai waited quietly.

After a while Cang Yan spoke in a low voice, "Junior, it's not that we suspect you—tell me plainly, what level of alchemist are you truly at now?"

From Elder Du, Cang Yan knew Yang Kai was registered as a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist.

But from what he had seen recently, Yang Kai's performance was far beyond what a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist could do: Spirit-Grade Middle-Level and Upper-Level Pills kept coming from his hands—Yang Kai was clearly not limited to the Lower-Level standard.

Elder Du would not lie to Cang Yan; the only possibility was that Yang Kai had hidden his true skill in the Alchemists' Association registration.

Fei Yu's beautiful eyes also glittered with surprise as she stared at Yang Kai and said, "Some time ago I recall you even refined a Saint pill!"

Upon hearing this, Cang Yan's face changed, "Really?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, taking out that Saint-Grade Pill and saying, "I got lucky—one completed pill."

Cang Yan quickly took it and examined it carefully, his face becoming visibly excited, "Can you refine Saint-Grade Pills again?"

"I should be able to." Yang Kai nodded; he had always refined without relying on a spirit formation, and he had never used Wan Yao Ling Milk.

A spirit formation can raise the success rate of refining, and Wan Yao Ling Milk can raise a Pill's quality.

If both those aids were counted, Yang Kai could now easily refine a Saint-Grade Lower-Level Pill.

"Then aren't you a Saint-Grade alchemist?" Li Wan exclaimed.

The others all showed expressions of incredulity.

"Not quite." Yang Kai said modestly.

The men all drew a long breath and glanced at one another; Fei Jian, baring his buckteeth, said, "This can be done!"

"Indeed!" Cang Yan nodded heavily.

"Are you asking me to help refine Pills?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

"In a way." Cang Yan nodded. "But that's not all. Junior, have you heard of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

Cang Yan smiled wryly, "Ah, I forgot you're from another world and wouldn't have heard. You should at least know that on Tongxuan Continent the three great races of humans, yao and demons stand in competition, yes?"

"I know that." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Human Territory, Demon Domain, Yao Realm—these are the collective names for the three races' areas. Human Territory is the largest, Demon Domain next, and Yao Realm smaller still. Between them lies a neutral zone."

Yang Kai also knew these things; Shui Ling had explained them when he first arrived on Tongxuan Continent.

"In that neutral zone there is a place called Wangtian Cliff! It stands upon a mountain ten thousand zhang high, and on Wangtian Cliff grows the only Thousand-Year Demon Flower in the world— it blooms once every thousand years, and each bloom lasts no more than two hours before withering."

"What use is this Thousand-Year Demon Flower?" Yang Kai keenly grasped the crux of the matter and asked in a low voice.

"It won't work for you, nor for most people in the world, but for the four of us it's immensely valuable."

"It can help us comprehend the mysteries of entering the Saint Realm; drawing on the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's energy, we might break through our current bottleneck in one go," Fei Yu said, her voice faintly excited.

Yang Kai's expression changed.

"But because of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's particular nature, it requires an alchemist of profound skill—at the moment of its bloom to refine from it a medicinal elixir—and that alchemist must be at least a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemist to succeed."

"So you need me to go?"

"Exactly!"

"Surely the Sect has alchemists more powerful than me?" Yang Kai was stunned.

Tianxiao Sect was such a large sect that there might well be Saint-Grade alchemists; even if not, there should be several Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemists, and those people's aptitude would be far more seasoned than Yang Kai's.

"Those people are honored guests of the Sect; this expedition is highly dangerous and they may not be willing to go. Besides, even if their alchemy surpasses yours, their combat strength may not be as great as yours."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded heavily. "So many people are watching that Thousand-Year Demon Flower, right?"

"More than you can imagine!" Cang Yan said gravely, sighing slightly. "It blooms once in a thousand years—those with intent will naturally pay attention to its movements. We can get news of its impending bloom and others can as well; any strong cultivator wishing to enter the Saint Realm will strive for it."

"Junior, this is truly dangerous. If you don't want to go we won't force you," Fei Yu looked at Yang Kai and spoke softly.

"I'll go!" Yang Kai smiled faintly. "If it can help the Senior Aunt and Uncles ascend into the Saint Realm, then I'll venture into any dragon's den or tiger's lair!"

Gratitude shone in Fei Yu's beautiful eyes.

Cang Yan and the others were visibly moved as well.

"Good kid, our care for you isn't wasted," Li Wan laughed heartily.

"Then prepare yourself; we'll depart in five days, there's still time," Cang Yan instructed.

Yang Kai nodded.

The three men left soon after; they too had to make preparations for the upcoming journey.

"Whether this succeeds or not, I must thank you." Fei Yu said softly.

"You have treated me well—this is the least I can do." Yang Kai shook his head.

Fei Yu looked at him quietly, as if trying to read his heart, and after a long while she suddenly laughed coquettishly, "I'm going to bathe—want to join?"

Yang Kai's face darkened, "You've been drinking again?"

"No fun!" Fei Yu pouted, her graceful form swaying as she slipped away.

Yang Kai could only shake his head; this open and unrestrained Senior Aunt was difficult to deal with—she often said startling things that left others at a loss.

In the five days Yang Kai didn't prepare anything special; he continued, as always, to refine Pills.

Five days later everything was ready. Yang Kai emerged from the stone chamber to find Fei Yu already waiting outside; she smiled and lightly beckoned when she saw him.

"Where are Cang Yan and the others?" Yang Kai asked.

"They're waiting outside."

Flying out of the cave, sure enough Cang Yan and the others stood beneath the waterfall, looking up and waiting.
