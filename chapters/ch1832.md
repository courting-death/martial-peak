## Chapter 1832 — Tragic Ghost Ancestor

The Ghost Ancestor felt that his life was unbearably tragic.

Three days of discoursing the Dao and resolving doubts had instantly made his image in the minds of nearly ten thousand disciples of the Lingxiao Sect towering and formidable; he was quite pleased, proud that he had so quickly gained the disciples’ recognition and been integrated into the Lingxiao Sect.

Yesterday he had strolled through the Lingxiao Sect at his leisure; after all, this would now be his sect too, so it was only natural to familiarize himself with the surroundings.

The Lingxiao Sect had eighty-one peaks, Spiritual Qi thick and the terrain imposing, and he was extremely satisfied.

The Three Flames Ring that guarded the Lingxiao Sect from outside struck him with awe as well — what sort of expert had arranged such measures? Even a powerhouse like him dared not probe too deeply.

Passing by the Hundred Flowers Residence, he took a whim and went inside.

Yang Yan was then with her eyes closed, feigning sleep; the Ghost Ancestor stood by and watched for a while, mistaking her for someone cultivating a technique. When Yang Yan opened her eyes he struck a lofty pose and offered a few pieces of instruction, assuming he would earn her gratitude and worship. To his surprise, Yang Yan only gave him a single soft "hehe."

That single "hehe" completely baffled him.

He froze on the spot, and that sound kept echoing in his mind as if endless; only today did he gradually wake from it.

The Ghost Ancestor knew full well he had hit a wall. He immediately thought of Yang Yan as celestial and no longer dared to act wantonly in her presence.

He still did not know what level of cultivation Yang Yan actually possessed.

A single meaningless laugh had plunged him as if into a nightmare, leaving him unable to collect his thoughts — such a method might be beyond even someone at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. If he had not experienced it himself, the Ghost Ancestor could never have believed such an absurd thing.

The only certainty was that Yang Yan’s cultivation had to be higher than his; no matter how he examined her he could not perceive her depths. The woman had no secret treasure to block Divine Sense probes.

What on earth was this woman’s background? She was terrifying to such a degree!

That brat Yang was also terribly inconsiderate — the sect harbored such a powerful figure and he didn’t notify this old man beforehand, causing him to make a fool of himself. How shameful.

Recalling the few words of instruction he had offered yesterday, the Ghost Ancestor wished he could crawl into a hole and never come out.

The sensation was like a toddling child bragging to an adult that he would teach him how to fight…

What kind of sect was this, anyway? In it there were not only a perverse young prodigy like Yang Kai — who had reached the Void King Realm at such a young age — but also that woman in white and even a Void King-Grade alchemist; now another terrifying woman had appeared.

Had he stumbled into a pit? The Ghost Ancestor’s heart churned and he felt restless and anxious.

"Sect Master, you know how I am; say a good word for me," the Ghost Ancestor appealed to Yang Kai when Yang Yan remained displeased.

Yang Kai cleared his throat, thought a moment, and said, "Yang Yan. The Ghost Ancestor meant well; let us let this matter drop."

Standing to the side, the Ghost Ancestor nodded repeatedly. “It was truly an unintentional mistake on my part. As they say, those who are ignorant should not be blamed. I beg Your Excellency’s forgiveness.”

Yang Yan snorted softly, though her expression considerably softened.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Since you slept for so long, it’s been more than a decade since we last met — you wouldn’t really sulk at me the moment we see each other, would you?"

"Who said I’m sulking at you?" Yang Yan shot Yang Kai a cold glance.

Yang Kai awkwardly scratched his nose. "You do seem angrier now, unlike before."

The Ghost Ancestor barked angrily from the side, “It must be that you, boy, were still pining over romantic trifles and ended up neglecting this esteemed lady!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the Ghost Ancestor realized his mistake; he had meant to flatter Yang Yan but those words carried an unintended double meaning.

Sure enough, Yang Yan glanced at him and then gave another "hehe."

There it was again…

The Ghost Ancestor’s face changed greatly; in the next instant his whole body stiffened in place and his eyes lost their light.

"There’s no need," Yang Kai said with a rueful smile. With his vision he immediately realized the Ghost Ancestor had been cowed by Yang Yan’s spirit; he would likely endure some nightmare-like torment.

"It’s only a light punishment to admonish him; why worry so much?" Yang Yan said coldly. "And it isn’t without benefit to him. Do you think anyone can be suppressed by this one's Divine Sense?"

"If it benefits him, then it’s fine," Yang Kai said with a small smile, watching Yang Yan. "It feels as if you’re different since you awakened."

"Before I was only an incarnation; now I am my true self — how could I be the same?" Yang Yan’s expression was indifferent, a chill that seemed to keep others at a thousand li away. Yang Kai felt uncomfortable and lost the will to speak, quietly sipping his tea.

After a long silence Yang Yan suddenly said, "Your cultivation progressed well. I didn’t expect you could advance to the Void King Realm in such a short time. Perhaps with your ability… you really could guard this Star Domain."

"Me?" Yang Kai pointed at himself with a finger and laughed. "The only things I intend to protect are my family and friends. The Star Domain is too vast; it’s none of my concern."

"If you truly think that, then you are mistaken," Yang Yan said seriously, looking at Yang Kai. "Do you know why I descended into this Star Domain?"

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, sensing that Yang Yan was likely to speak of some hidden matter. He shook his head. "You never told me. How would I know? But I suppose it has to do with the Insect Emperor."

In this Star Domain, across countless years, only the Insect Emperor could match Yang Yan. Back then the two fought — one’s mortal body was destroyed, the other fell into a long sleep. Outside the Dark Star many stars shattered, and the imperial might left behind formed the Death Domain; that showed how fierce the battle had been.

Yang Yan’s question immediately led him to think of the Insect Emperor.

"Correct. My coming here is indeed related to the Insect Emperor. Do you know why the Insect Emperor came here?" Yang Yan asked.

Yang Kai shook his head again.

Yang Yan said, "He came to devour the force of the Laws of heaven and earth, to attain the supreme imperial Dao. If he succeeded, all the Cultivation Stars in this Star Domain would turn into Dead Stars, so I chased him here and fought him to the death."

"Why would he try to devour the Laws?" Yang Kai asked, shocked at Yang Yan.

“The path of the Emperor is about mastering the Laws. Only by mastering the Laws can one attain the body of a Great Emperor!” Yang Yan explained. “But the power of the Laws is not something so easily grasped. Among those who have become Emperors, nine out of ten have only shallow control over it. To comprehend the power of the Laws, aside from one’s own cultivation and insight, there exists another shortcut…”

Yang Kai seemed to realize something and cried out in alarm, "Refining a Star’s Origin?"

He had once refined a Stellar Origin and could vaguely sense the law of the Dark Star, so he made that connection.

“Correct,” Yang Yan nodded. “However, what the Insect Emperor had planned was not to refine the Origin of a Cultivation Star, but to devour it! He intended to consume the Origin, fuse that Star’s Laws into himself, and refine them — that was the shortcut he meant to take.”

Yang Kai’s cold sweat burst forth instantly.

If the Insect Emperor were to succeed, countless Cultivation Stars in this Star Domain would be destroyed; it might even mean the annihilation of the entire domain.

“You must understand, this world is not limited to just your Star Domain—there are countless others beyond it. Between these Star Domains exists the power of the Domain Barrier, and even an Emperor would find it difficult to break through. That is why you know nothing of the worlds beyond,” Yang Yan said, ignoring Yang Kai’s shock and continuing calmly, “Many, many years ago, the powerful experts of our place discovered such a shortcut to becoming Emperors and comprehending the power of the Laws. One after another, they used their great divine abilities to shatter the barriers between Domains, traveling to different Star Domains to refine and devour the Heavenly Laws within them. The result was that, in merely a hundred years, nineteen Star Domains fell silent and completely collapsed! And each of those nineteen Star Domains had once been far more prosperous than yours.”

Yang Kai broke out in still more cold sweat.

"Any Star Domain is the root of its martial artists; a domain’s destruction is a grave matter. At the time, ten great experts realized the severity and joined forces, rallying other experts to stop those with ill designs from invading major Star Domains. If caught, they were slain without mercy. Though effective, this could not eradicate the practice completely — some still dared to risk everything. The Insect Emperor was one of them; I pursued him here, and that led to what followed."

"This… is a lot to take in. I can’t absorb it all now. Tell me another day when you’re in a better mood?" Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his brow and was about to turn away.

He had a lingering sense of unease.

The next moment he found himself bound by an invisible force, forced to sit in place and unable to move.

Yang Yan glanced at him from the side and continued, "Each Star Domain actually has its own guardian. This prevents those with ill designs from invading. Once someone of power beyond a Star Domain enters, those guardians immediately get word and go to intercept. However, the guardian of your Star Domain went missing tens of thousands of years ago; no one knows if he lives or not. That is why I came. By the way, that Xuan Realm Pearl of yours belonged to him."

Yang Yan looked at Yang Kai with a playful smile. “I too have my own Star Domain to guard, and I’ve already been away from it for far too long. Now that I’ve awakened, it’s impossible for me to remain here any longer. From now on, the safety of this Star Domain will depend on you. Since you’ve obtained that person’s Xuan Realm Pearl, it is only right that you inherit his mantle and become the guardian of this Star Domain. Besides, your family and friends are here—you can’t simply stand by and do nothing, can you?”

"If you lack the ability, and one day someone comes and refines the Dark Star, you cannot blame others. If you want your loved ones to be safe, then strive to cultivate. When you one day reach my level, you will be able to guard this Star Domain."

Having said that, Yang Yan no longer paid him any mind and lifted her cup to sip tea slowly.

The force that had bound Yang Kai dissipated; yet Yang Kai did not leave. He sat there with his brow furrowed, pondering Yang Yan’s words.
