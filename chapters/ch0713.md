## Chapter 713 — Demon Flower Blooms

"Who exactly is this senior, and why would Elder Du call himself a disciple?" Mi Na still hadn't recovered, tugging Yang Kai and asking in a low voice.

"Ask Elder Du yourself another day." Yang Kai drew in a light breath.

"So mysterious." Mi Na pouted.

If it were her old temper, encountering such a situation she would have strode forward and shouted, "Hey you old man, who are you?"

But seeing Elder Du conduct himself so solemnly, Mi Na did not dare be reckless.

She was indeed honest and straightforward, but she was no fool.

The group had yet to come fully to their senses from shock. Yang Kai looked at Tianzang Elder and said, "Elder Li, the information Brother Zhai knows about the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was given to him by you, right?"

"That's right." Elder Li nodded slightly, looking kindly at Yang Kai. "Little fellow, I sensed in you an aura somewhat like my own. When this matter is over, could you spare a few words with me? If you don't mind, I have many things I wish to tell you and to hear from you."

Cang Yan and the others' eyes brightened; they repeatedly glanced at Yang Kai, signaling him to agree.

Yang Kai was a pill-refiner and the man before him was the foremost alchemist in the realm; any alchemist would crave instruction from him, and with such a rare opportunity suddenly presented, who could possibly refuse?

Yang Kai smiled wryly; he had been debating whether to reveal the secret that he bore the Divine Sense Fire, yet the other had already perceived it.

In that case there was no need to hide it, and Yang Kai felt no malice from the master, so he hurriedly said, "I'd be honored!"

"Good, good, good." Elder Li nodded repeatedly, his smile genial.

"Teacher, let's speak of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower. Brother Yang and the others must be baffled and are waiting for your explanation," Zhai Yao suggested.

Everyone hurriedly turned to look at Elder Li.

Elder Li drew a light breath and said, "Mm. Having Zhai Yao wait here was my intent, for the celestial anomaly has not yet truly appeared. The Thousand-Year Demon Flower is making its final preparations; it will take about another half day before it appears. There's no harm in going up later—above it is merely a chaotic battlefield now, and going there would be of no use."

"A thousand years ago when the Demon Flower bloomed, it was Teacher who refined the medicine, so in this matter he knows more than anyone," Zhai Yao explained softly.

Cang Yan and the others' bodies trembled.

They had never heard this news.

A thousand years ago, Tianzang Elder certainly did not possess the aloof status and universal reverence he now enjoyed; in those days he must have been, like Yang Kai and Zhai Yao, hot-blooded and sharp.

Over time he gradually built his reputation, and people eventually forgot his true name, calling him Tianzang Elder.

Events prior to that have largely been forgotten by the world.

Elder Li chuckled softly and said, "The Thousand-Year Demon Flower is said to be a product of the starry void. Legend has it that many years ago a seed fell upon Wangtian Cliff and the Thousand-Year Demon Flower arose. Its medicinal nectar has great effect in promoting Transcendent Realm practitioners into the Saint Realm, so every thousand years this place becomes extremely lively—and many die."

"Many experts have tried to monopolize the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, but no matter how many come, or who arrives here, before the time is due they cannot find any trace of the flower. Wangtian Cliff once rose ten thousand ren; now it stands only eight thousand ren in height, because those experts, in searching for the Demon Flower, leveled away layer after layer of the cliff."

They listened intently, fearful of missing a single word, their expressions utterly focused.

"Why couldn't they find it? I've always been curious—if this flower is so important, why has it remained on Wangtian Cliff and not been taken away?" Mi Na asked, puzzled.

"Because the Thousand-Year Demon Flower is a rootless flower!" Elder Li said with a smiling glance. "It is not a physical object!"

"Not a physical object?" everyone exclaimed.

"Mm. It is a product of Heaven and Earth, containing extraordinarily profound energy. Wait a little and you will see it yourselves, and then you will naturally understand my words," Elder Li said without reservation. "Moreover, it is extremely sensitive. Once it detects the aura of a Saint Realm expert, it will close and not emerge. Several times in the past the interference of Saint Realm practitioners prevented the Thousand-Year Demon Flower from blooming, so in recent times Saint Realm experts have not come here."

"Elder Li, what should we do once we go up?" Cang Yan asked quickly.

"Escort the two youngsters into the flower's core, then leave the rest to their own fortunes. You will not be able to help them."

Cang Yan was stunned at those words.

Elder Li chuckled, "I cannot explain it now; you will understand then."

Cang Yan and the others nodded slightly and did not ask further.

As they spoke, fierce battle fluctuations continued to emanate from the peaks; the entire mountain range seemed to have become a battlefield. Those Transcendent Realm experts escorted the pill-refiners of their teams forward while risking combat with others.

Gradually the sounds of battle subsided considerably; it seemed everyone had noticed something amiss about the Thousand-Year Demon Flower and were no longer as ferocious.

Half a day later, the multicolored glow at the horizon suddenly erupted. In the void a resplendent, multihued flower bud emerged, dazzling the heavens and earth.

The bud was unimaginably huge; even from Fuyun City dozens of li away it could be seen clearly. It hovered in the void directly above Wangtian Cliff.

To the eye the bud seemed to have no solid form; it was composed purely of energy, inscrutably profound.

With the bud's appearance, Heaven-and-Earth Energy within hundreds of li surged as if gone mad, frantically flowing toward the bud.

Visible to the naked eye, those streams of energy poured into the bud and vanished.

At the same time, the survivors of the great battle among the mountains sprang forth together and rushed toward the bud.

Dozens of teams and hundreds of Transcendent Realm practitioners exerted every ounce of their strength.

The battle that had only just calmed flared up again, and this time it was even bloodier and more brutal than before.

Those experts kept falling from the sky; amidst the chaotic Martial Skills and Secret Treasures their bodies were shattered and their souls annihilated; even the pill-refiners they protected did not escape.

In an instant, several teams were completely annihilated; not a single person survived.

Seeing this, everyone wore grim expressions, instantly realizing the cruelty of this competition.

"Elder Li..." Cang Yan asked solicitously, his face tense.

"Don't rush!" Elder Li slowly shook his head, his expression still calm.

Cang Yan drew a deep breath to steady his emotions and waited quietly.

Before long, people rushed to the bud; the first team to arrive had no time to rejoice before being engulfed by the crowd that followed.

Around the bud countless people fought desperately, falling in waves.

Some shrewd individuals avoided the whirlpool of battle, attempting to find a method to condense the Demon Flower's nectar, but they could not find the key; helplessly they circled the bud, only to be spotted by opponents and dragged into combat.

The blooming of a single Thousand-Year Demon Flower would cost dozens of factions great strength and bring heavy casualties.

After about another hour, the Heaven-and-Earth Energy gradually thinned, seemingly all absorbed into the bud by the Demon Flower; having received such vast nourishment, the previously tightly closed bud finally showed signs of opening.

"It's time." Elder Li nodded slightly.

"Go!" Cang Yan shouted low, and together with the others they sheltered Yang Kai and Zhai Yao in the center, deploying movement techniques and swiftly charging toward the bud.

The party of twelve—aside from Yang Kai and Zhai Yao, the others were all Transcendent Realm: six at Third Stage and four at Second Stage. In numbers and strength, such a team was far ahead of all others.

Yet Cang Yan and the others still dared not relax; in a compact formation they shielded Yang Kai and Zhai Yao tightly.

Everyone's eyes fixed on the enormous bud. Gradually its petals unfurled outward, and quickly too; by the time Cang Yan and the others were halfway there, the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was almost fully open.

A thousand-hued radiance washed the heavens, and an inexplicable energy fluctuation swept through the world; under its influence, everyone calmed.

The remaining experts could no longer brawl; they dropped onto the opened petals of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower and each sought a position, wary of the surroundings while allowing their pill-refiners to begin condensing the nectar.

Unexpectedly, each of those pill-refiners did not know where to begin. Their True Yuan flowed out and enveloped the petals, yet they could not refine them.

This discovery caused everyone's hearts to sink.

They had rushed here risking their lives only to make no progress—what meaning had all this effort?

By the time Cang Yan and the others arrived, the Thousand-Year Demon Flower in the void was already teeming with people, with almost nowhere to stand.

"Go to the bud's core!" Zhai Yao suddenly shouted low.

Cang Yan, unsure of what to do, heard this and hurriedly surged in that direction.

The core of the flower, naturally the most coveted spot, was at this moment occupied by two formidable teams, both desperately searching for a method to refine it.

Cang Yan and his group charged over menacingly, immediately drawing their vigilance and attention.

With hostile expressions they formed up; in that moment the two opposing teams moved in surprising unison.

Assessing the enemy's numbers and cultivation, Cang Yan frowned, made a beckoning gesture, and a Saint-Grade greatsword appeared in his hand. Roaring flames burned upon the blade like a raging fire-dragon, imposing in presence.

"Don't rush to engage them," Zhai Yao said, then smiled and called to the people below, "How about yielding a spot? I can tell you how to refine the Thousand-Year Demon Flower."

"You know?" Someone in the crowd below immediately brightened.

"Probably." Zhai Yao chuckled. "But if you refuse, then there will be a fight."
