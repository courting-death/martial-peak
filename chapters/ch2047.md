## Chapter 2047 — Cutting Off the Bridge After Crossing

When Zong Qing spoke, every face tightened and a few people looked sheepish; as he had said, the warriors who had cooperated with the two Dao Origin Realm practitioners had held back, each hoping others would expend more effort so they could reap the rewards.

If the third layer restriction had been broken in one fell swoop, that would have been one thing—no one would have any cause for complaint. But since the third layer seal had become locked in a stalemate during the attempt to break it, some people suddenly found themselves in an extremely awkward position.

Zong Qing added, “I do not know what you all were thinking, but I want to see what treasures lie inside!”

After he finished speaking, he redoubled the power in his body and poured it more ferociously into the dagger.

Someone in the crowd saw this and couldn't help but shout, "Since Deputy Hall Master Zong speaks so sincerely, what are we hiding? If we don't act now, when will we?"

As he spoke, he stopped holding back and poured all his strength into stimulating his Saint Yuan.

The others glanced at each other, their eyes hardening, and they all began to push their power as well.

In an instant the already enormous dagger swelled considerably, clearly the result of even more power being fed into it.

The increase was enough to make even Lian Yuming feel he was losing control; his face changed and he roared, “Good — with everyone’s combined assistance, even if I must risk my life, I will tear this restriction apart!”

He opened his mouth and spat a mouthful of crimson Essence-Blood forward, which became a spray of blood mist that enveloped the dagger.

Quickly the blood mist was wholly absorbed by the dagger, and the once-chaotic blade immediately gained a layer of crimson radiance and steadied.

With a roar from Lian Yuming, the dagger collided and cut against the third layer restriction with earth-shaking sound, and the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth suddenly became turbulent.

Crack...

At last a faint sound issued forth; everyone looked toward it and couldn't help but show joy on their faces.

For that impregnable third layer restriction had finally split open a gap.

Lian Yuming once again shifted his hand seals, gathering a single surging burst of power like a raging tiger, and drove his Dao Origin–Grade, Middle‑Level Secret Treasure forward in a vicious slash.

With a crashing sound, the third layer restriction shattered to pieces in an instant, like a mirror smashed — it simply disintegrated.

The moment the third layer restriction was broken, the first and second stage restrictions vanished like popped bubbles.

“It worked!” someone shouted with great joy.

Some people already began moving, preparing to rush forward.

But at that moment Lian Yuming and Zong Qing suddenly retreated ten-odd zhang, and at the same time the disciples of Blazing Fire Hall made the same motion, all backing away.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s heart skipped; without a word he grabbed Kang Siran, who had been ready to charge forward, and drifted back dozens of zhang.

The next moment, a whistling sound suddenly burst forth.

Blinding shafts of light erupted from the stone wall ahead, pelting the crowd like a dense, crashing rain.

“What is that?!”

“Danger, get out of the way!”

Screams and shouts rang out; the unprepared scattered warriors, seeing something amiss, frantically dodged.

But the attacks erupting from the stone wall came too fast — they were upon people before they could properly react.

The next moment, screams of agony followed one after another.

The warriors suspended in midair erupted in spurts of blood, tumbling from the sky like a scatter of dumplings; some of the weaker ones were blown apart into a crimson mist, not even a single bone remaining.

Dozens of warriors fell in an instant—more than half perished. Not a single Origin Returning Realm cultivator survived, and the remaining Void King Realm fighters, even if still breathing, were all wounded; some grievously so, missing arms or legs, a pitiful sight to behold.

Far off, Yang Kai’s expression darkened, and Kang Siran was pale, his face showing clear lingering terror.

If Yang Kai had not acted quickly to pull him back just now, Kang Siran would have at best been grievously wounded, if not dead.

“So after the restriction was broken there were more traps!” Zong Qing’s voice suddenly came from the side.

Lian Yuming nodded lightly, “Fortunately we were prepared, or else...”

As he spoke, he turned to scan the crowd; the surviving warriors who met his gaze bristled with righteous indignation, their faces alight with fury.

Yet no one dared speak.

Everyone knew that speaking now would do no good; although Blazing Fire Hall had acted unscrupulously, the world outside was full of deceit and scheming — they could not blame others for failing to guard against tricks; they could only blame themselves for not being more careful.

All the more so when the Blazing Fire Hall had come out of this completely unscathed and still had two Dao Origin Realm experts holding the field. They had not even taken the initiative to strike at anyone else—so if someone were to accuse them now, they might very well provoke them into wiping everyone out.

No one was foolish enough to do that.

“Hm?” Zong Qing suddenly glanced at Yang Kai and Kang Siran standing dozens of zhang away and made a small sound of surprise, apparently astonished these two were unscathed.

But he did not care much, and instead called to the Blazing Fire Hall people, “The restrictions are open, go in.”

Saying this, he led the way and charged toward the entrance exposed in the stone wall.

The rest of the Blazing Fire Hall followed close behind, and before long the hall’s people were gone.

Only then did curses and grumbling break out, but those wounded could merely vent with words; after taking such heavy losses, who still dared probe that predecessor's tomb? Leaving aside whether more terrifying restrictions existed inside, the despicable fellows of Blazing Fire Hall were not to be trifled with. If anyone in their state entered, it would be near-certain death.

So after cursing a bit, many immediately fled, apparently seeking places to recover.

Yang Kai and Kang Siran exchanged a look, both with ugly expressions.

Although they had long expected Blazing Fire Hall would be hard to deal with, no one had imagined they would stab with a borrowed knife and eliminate most potential rivals so directly.

Now among the outsiders, only Yang Kai and Kang Siran remained intact; if they rashly entered and collided with Blazing Fire Hall’s party, the outcome would be clear to them both.

While the two hesitated, rumbling came from the gap in the stone wall; startled, they looked up and saw the opening subtly beginning to close.

"The entrance won't stay open for long?" Yang Kai's expression changed involuntarily as he hurriedly asked, "Brother Kang — do we go in or not?"

Kang Siran’s expression flickered as he hesitated, watching the mouth of the cave nearly seal; he bit his teeth and said, “Brother Yang, you go back — I’ll go in alone!”

He clearly did not want to drag Yang Kai down.

With that he shifted his form and flew straight toward the stone wall.

Moments later he slipped inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain, and when he looked back the entrance had already closed.

As if sensing something, Kang Siran turned and saw Yang Kai smiling at him.

He had not noticed how Yang Kai had slipped in behind him and cried out in surprise, “Brother Yang, you—”

“We’ll talk later; first handle what’s ahead.” Yang Kai chuckled, then turned and fixed his gaze forward.

Ahead, two Blazing Fire Hall disciples at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm glowered coldly at them, clearly hostile.

On the left stood a tall, broad-shouldered man whose entire skin seemed flushed red—very likely the effect of cultivating a fire-attribute art. Even his hair burned a fiery crimson. On the right stood a short, pudgy fellow with a great round belly. He regarded Yang Kai and Kang Siran with a perpetually squinting smile; his face was all soft flesh, and with his tiny eyes squeezed into slits, not even his pupils could be seen.

Seeing this, Kang Siran frowned, recognizing the two as Blazing Fire Hall guards left to watch the entrance against further intruders.

After a moment's thought, he cupped his fist and said, "Gentlemen, what is the meaning of this?"

The tall man said nothing, but the fat man grinned, “You don’t understand? We’re all reasonable people, so I won’t waste words. The entrance is closed; it seems none will come in. Do you want to spar with us Senior Brothers here, or shall we sit and chat to pass the time?”

Kang Siran’s face darkened and he barked, “So you do not intend to let us pass?”

The fat man cupped his fist, “I act on the orders of the two Deputy Hall Masters; I dare not disobey. Friends, don’t force us — after all, we did help break the restriction together earlier, so we have some connection.”

“A rabbit is cooked and the dog gets tossed aside — Blazing Fire Hall’s methods are skillful.” Kang Siran’s face was ashen as he said in a low voice, “And if I insist on passing through?”

The short fat man’s face went cold, a murderous glint flashing in his slit eyes as he said in a chilling tone, “If that’s the case, then don’t blame the Senior Brothers for being ruthless.”

“Wait!” At that moment Yang Kai suddenly held up a hand and called out.

The fat man immediately looked to Yang Kai, thinking he wanted to speak, but the sight that met his eyes was a beam of light slicing toward him like an arrow released from a bow.

The fat man’s expression changed; without thinking he drew in a deep breath and his already stout body swelled larger still, his shape ballooning.

He opened his mouth and spat a mass of roaring fire that became a fire-dragon to meet the incoming beam.

As the two attacked, Kang Siran and the tall man also reacted; Kang Siran silently produced a pestle-shaped Secret Treasure, and as Origin Qi poured into it the treasure transformed into a purple ray that shot toward the tall man.

The tall man, startled but unafraid, flicked his wrist and seized a long blade, shouting, “Blade Rolls the Rivers!”

He slashed the long blade and its gleam flashed, heat pouring forth like a flowing sheet of light, meeting Kang Siran’s Secret Treasure.

Boom... a tremendous crash resounded.

The four Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivators had rushed to battle in the narrow corridor, and the power they unleashed seemed ready to tear the mountain apart.
