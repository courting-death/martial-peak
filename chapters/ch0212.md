## Chapter 212 — One Resolution to Confusion

A day later, Yang Kai donned his attire and stepped out of the thatched cottage.

In the courtyard, the Sect Leader stood beneath a plum tree, one hand resting behind his back while the other stroked his beard. He remained motionless, his gaze distant as he stared ahead.

Yang Kai approached him from behind, choosing not to disturb him. He stood silently, following the direction of his gaze, and noticed several flower buds on the branches, poised to bloom in the cold wind.

The old man and the young man stood there for an entire day and night, waiting until the flower buds fully blossomed. Only then did the Sect Leader turn around, his expression gentle as he asked, “How is your injury?”

“It’s nothing serious now.” Yang Kai grinned, “Should I address you as Sect Leader or as Elder Eleven?”

The person before him was both Ling Taixu, the Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion, and the Elder Eleven he had encountered by the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

At that time, Yang Kai had not known much about Lingxiao Pavilion. Although he had his doubts, he did not ponder deeply. It was only later, after hearing many stories from Su Mu and the others, that he confirmed the true identity of Elder Eleven.

There was no Elder Eleven within Lingxiao Pavilion, but Ling Taixu was indeed the eleventh Sect Leader, a man of great talent and ambition, yet who had been mired in sorrow for over a decade due to his two disciples.

Had it not been for the tragic ends of his two disciples over a decade ago, Ling Taixu would surely possess far greater strength. Unable to resolve his heart’s knot, he could not break through the shackles of the Divine Roaming Realm to reach another level.

Ling Taixu smiled slightly, “Call me as you wish!”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but Ling Taixu interrupted him, “I know you have many questions.”

“Please enlighten me, Sect Leader!” Yang Kai asked solemnly. Since he had already guessed what he wanted to ask, there was no need to voice it.

Ling Taixu’s gaze was profound, and a hint of reminiscence appeared on his face. After a long moment, he slowly spoke in a low voice, “In my life, I have only taken in two disciples. The elder was simple and kind-hearted, while the younger was clever and astute. If nothing unexpected occurred, both would have become the pillars of Lingxiao Pavilion, leading our sect towards glory. But the world is unpredictable; the younger one, driven by a strong sense of competition, willingly fell into the evil path and even dealt a fatal blow to the elder, which is intolerable!”

Yang Kai listened quietly. He had heard this part of the past from Su Mu before, but hearing it from the mouth of the Sect Leader, who was directly involved, carried a different weight.

“There are rumors outside that the elder was killed and the younger one is sealed within the Dragon Confinement Ravine, is that correct?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Ling Taixu chuckled lightly, “That rumor is only half true. The younger one is indeed sealed within the Dragon Confinement Ravine, but the elder is not dead!”

Ling Taixu declared proudly, “My eldest disciple is named Yang Yingfeng!”

Yang Kai could not help but be moved, his face displaying shock. After a long while, he exhaled softly, and at that moment, the doubts that had troubled him for many years vanished.

Yang Yingfeng was the name of Fourth Master Yang from the Yang Family, and it was also the name of Yang Kai’s father.

Who would have thought that Fourth Master Yang had truly trained at Lingxiao Pavilion back in the day, and he was even Ling Taixu’s eldest disciple—the unfortunate senior brother rumored to have been killed by the second disciple who fell into the evil path.

No wonder his father had been plagued by chronic ailments over the years, struggling to improve his strength. It must have been due to the hidden dangers left by that second disciple who had fallen into the evil path.

It was also no wonder he had sent him to Lingxiao Pavilion; it turned out there was such a connection.

“By seniority, you should call me your Grandmaster!” Ling Taixu smiled slightly.

“Disciple greets Grandmaster!” Yang Kai performed a somewhat reluctant bow.

Ling Taixu observed Yang Kai’s expression and did not get angry. He merely chuckled, “You blame me for knowing your identity yet still turning a blind eye, allowing you to suffer greatly. Is that right?”

“A little,” Yang Kai replied in a muffled voice. In the first three years at Lingxiao Pavilion, he had truly experienced the warmth and coldness of the world. However, he did not mind too much; his suffering was due to his own lack of ability. How could he blame others? Others were not born to be his caretakers; why should they look after him?

“Do not blame me; if you must blame someone, blame Fourth Master Yang of the Yang Family. I have not completely vented my anger either,” Ling Taixu lightly huffed.

Hearing this, Yang Kai could not help but shrink his neck. He was not a fool; how could he not discern the meaning behind Ling Taixu’s words?

Disciples of the Yang Family were like cuckoo birds’ eggs, impossible to nurture!

Back then, when Fourth Master Yang came here, he must have been greatly favored by Ling Taixu. Yet, after pouring his heart and soul into teaching for ten years, it turned out he was merely sewing clothes for others. If the second disciple had not fallen into the evil path, Ling Taixu would still have some hope. But the honest and loyal Elder was a white-eyed wolf from the Yang Family, and the second disciple also fell into the evil path, leaving him with nothing but a futile effort, causing him to be filled with a heart knot and unable to break through his own bottleneck.

In other words, Fourth Master Yang had to bear a significant part of the responsibility for Ling Taixu’s heart knot.

As the saying goes, “A son must repay his father’s debts!” Fourth Master Yang owed Ling Taixu, so how could Yang Kai remain uninvolved?

With this thought, Yang Kai quickly put on a smiling face, “Grandmaster, please do not be angry. That Fourth Master Yang is truly not a good person; you need not take him to heart.”

Ling Taixu had initially worn a stern expression, but seeing Yang Kai’s quick change of demeanor, he could not help but laugh, “How did such a clever little rascal come from such a dull Elder?”

“A true man can bend and stretch!” Yang Kai, seeing his expression, knew he was just joking and was not truly angry.

Ling Taixu took a deep breath and slowly said, “The Elder is not a liar. In fact, three years after he entered the sect, he had already informed me of his identity. Therefore, I was mentally prepared for his departure from Lingxiao Pavilion. You need not take it too seriously.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and flattered, “Grandmaster, you are magnanimous. When I return to the Yang Family, I will teach him a lesson for you.”

Ling Taixu’s lips curled slightly, as if he wanted to smile but held it back.

“On the day you arrived at Lingxiao Pavilion, I received a message from your father. The reason I did not intervene was precisely because it was your father’s wish. He mentioned in the letter that you were not suited for cultivation and only hoped you could spend ten safe years at Lingxiao Pavilion until the Yang Family called you back,” Ling Taixu explained.

“Do you know why you are not suited for cultivation?” Ling Taixu asked.

“My father said I was born with insufficient aptitude,” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

“Indeed, because the Elder was severely injured before, and he has not fully recovered over the years, which led to your congenital deficiency at birth,” Ling Taixu nodded. Then, his eyes sparkled as he looked at Yang Kai, “Congenital deficiency is nearly impossible to cure, but now you can cultivate, and your talent is outstanding, with rapid progress in strength. I do not care what kind of mystery lies within, but in the future, apart from your parents, you must not reveal this to anyone else.”

Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. Although it was his first time speaking so openly with his Grandmaster, he could feel his concern and sincerity.

“Actually, if you were just an ordinary person, I truly would not care about you. Living is the greatest happiness, even if you suffer and are bullied, that is still living. But since you have talent and strength, I find it hard not to care. Your ruckus the other day was to draw me out, wasn’t it?”

Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly, “I didn’t expect it to be you; I thought it was someone among the five elders who had ties with my father.”

Ling Taixu laughed, “It’s not surprising that you didn’t think of it. Your father sent you here for two reasons: one is to ensure your safety, and the other is to help resolve my heart knot. The Elder is too simple; he thought my heart knot arose because of him. In truth, I have never blamed him.”

Yang Kai listened, sighing sorrowfully, unsure how to comfort him.

“Alright, your doubts have been resolved, right?” Ling Taixu smiled at Yang Kai.

“En.” Yang Kai felt a bit embarrassed. He had been pondering many things these days, and after this conversation with his Grandmaster, he finally felt enlightened.

“Now it’s my turn.” Ling Taixu’s expression became serious.

“What does Grandmaster want to ask?” Yang Kai looked at him in confusion.

“Your aura!” Ling Taixu’s face turned extremely serious. “In that battle the other day, I observed your aura was bloody and violent, not inferior to that of the younger brother back in the day. I only ask you one question: have you cultivated any evil techniques?”

“No!” Yang Kai shook his head decisively. He was also aware of the strange aspects of the Unyielding Will and quickly demonstrated this mysterious martial technique.

Yuan Qi surged, and Yang Kai’s strength soared from the Separation and Union Realm First Stage directly to the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, with energy surging and a malevolent aura surrounding him.

Killing intent surged, disregarding everything, as if he alone ruled the world.

Ling Taixu’s deep-set eyes locked onto Yang Kai’s, as if he could see into the depths of his soul.

“Draw your sword!” Ling Taixu said in a deep voice.

A crimson long sword instantly appeared in Yang Kai’s hand. With the Shura Sword in hand, the killing intent became almost tangible.

This treasure of the Shura Sect seemed to resonate with Yang Kai’s own Yuan Qi, responding to each other. With the sword in hand and the sword drawn, Yang Kai felt like a different person.

Ling Taixu stared at Yang Kai without blinking, carefully sensing the changes in his body and the fluctuations of his emotions. His expression gradually shifted from tense and alert to relaxed, then shocked, and finally became unpredictable.

After a long while, Ling Taixu nodded slightly.

Yang Kai sheathed the Shura Sword and dispersed the Unyielding Will, returning to his normal state.

“It seems like you are on the verge of going astray, but not quite,” Ling Taixu frowned slightly. “Your Divine Sense is clear?”

“En.”

“Strange, such a violent and bloody aura, even I would be affected and disturbed by my inner demons after long exposure. How can you remain unaffected?” After pondering for a moment, Ling Taixu’s eyes lit up, “I see, you are cultivating a Yang attribute technique. The most rigid and Yang, it is precisely the nemesis of Yin and evil aura. With Yang attribute Yuan Qi protecting you, you can avoid falling into depravity.”

After saying this, Ling Taixu was momentarily stunned. How could these two contradictory forces perfectly combine within one person?

After thinking for a long time without reaching a conclusion, Ling Taixu knew that Yang Kai must have some secret that allowed these two auras to coexist, but he did not ask.

Raising his gaze, Ling Taixu said, “You caused quite a ruckus the other day and revealed the news of your Mystery-Grade martial technique. You will likely face many troubles in the future.”

“Then… I’ll go out and avoid the storm,” Yang Kai had long since made plans.

Ling Taixu smiled, “Where can you go to avoid it? For now, do not run around; just stay within the sect.”

“Oh.”
