## Chapter 2426 — This Young Master Is Timid As A Mouse

Bing Yun's eyes narrowed, and she said, "Is her longevity lamp still here?"

An Ruoyun replied, "It is; Third Junior Sister is still alive, we just don't know where she is."

"That's good." Bing Yun let out a sigh of relief.

An Ruoyun added, "Fifth Junior Sister... failed to break through to the Emperor Realm and perished."

Upon hearing this, Bing Yun's delicate body trembled slightly, but she quickly regained her composure and sighed, "Such is fate. Little Five's temperament was always too impulsive. I knew her path would not be smooth."

An Ruoyun, eyes red, said, "It's my fault as Senior Sister for not taking better care of her."

Bing Yun shook her head and said, "It has nothing to do with you. What about Little Nine? Is she alive or dead?"

An Ruoyun replied, "Ninth Junior Sister has been in seclusion in the valley for ten years. She said she won't come out unless she breaks through to the Emperor Realm."

"Very good." Bing Yun smiled faintly. Of the nine disciples she had taken in over three thousand years, seven had already reached the Emperor Realm. Among them, An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu had lived up to her expectations, reaching the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. One had perished during the Baptism of Heaven and Earth, and only the youngest, Little Nine, remained in seclusion.

This result was still acceptable to her. To be a master to this extent, even in the Star Realm, was unique. Who else could have so many disciples reach the Emperor Realm? She didn't know if it was her teaching or Ice Heart Valley's nurturing.

"Bing Yun, let's save the small talk for later," came a loud, impatient urging from Feng Xuan.

Bing Yun snorted coldly, turned to look at him, and said, "I've been gone for three thousand years, Sect Master Feng, you've certainly taken good care of my Ice Heart Valley."

Her tone was thick with sarcasm, clearly furious that Wenqing Sect had bullied her sect while she was away, forcing their best disciples to marry out.

Feng Xuan replied indifferently, "Our two sects are both top sects of the Northern Territory. We should join forces! I see nothing wrong with that. Bing Yun, why can't you accept it?"

Bing Yun snapped coldly, "Is it that I can't accept it, or is it that Sect Master Feng is bullying others too much? For someone of your seniority, does it really bring you satisfaction to throw your weight around and oppress a few young girls?"

Feng Xuan frowned and said, "Bing Yun, you're still as sharp-tongued as ever. This Lord won't stoop to your level! Today, I have only two matters: first, to see my son marry Zi Yu, and second, to take back the Bloodjade Qilin! Bing Yun, if you still value our old friendship, please grant me these two requests!"

Bing Yun sneered, raised her slender jade finger, and said coldly, "Then let me make it clear. First, Zi Yu is a disciple of my Ice Heart Valley and will never marry your useless son, so give up on that. Second, as for the Bloodjade Qilin, it's none of my concern. If you have the ability, take it. If not, get out of Binglun City before you embarrass yourself in front of all the heroes of the Northern Territory!"

Bing Yun's forceful attitude took Feng Xuan by surprise.

On the other side, Hu Yuan and the others were all shocked, feeling an oppressive aura pressing down on them like a mountain.

These two experts looked ready to fight at any moment. If they really did, Binglun City would be destroyed for sure, and whether they could escape unharmed was uncertain. They were already considering whether to leave now to avoid becoming collateral damage.

Feng Xuan was silent for a while before sneering, "Could this brat be your illegitimate son? You protect him so fiercely!"

At these words, An Ruoyun and the others' expressions changed. For someone of Feng Xuan's status to slander Bing Yun in front of so many people was truly malicious.

In an instant, all the women of Ice Heart Valley were furious, gritting their teeth and glaring at Feng Xuan as if they wanted to tear him apart.

To everyone's surprise, Bing Yun wasn't angry at all. Instead, she glanced meaningfully at Yang Kai and said lightly, "If I had such a child, I would have no regrets in this life."

Feng Xuan was dumbfounded.

An Ruoyun and the others gaped at their master in astonishment.

Someone was screaming inwardly—what did this mean? Was she admitting it? Could this young man really be Bing Yun's illegitimate son? Otherwise, why wasn't she angry and even say such a thing?

For a moment, everyone's gaze at Yang Kai changed, as if looking at someone branded by Ice Heart Valley.

Yang Kai couldn't help but wipe the sweat from his forehead and said to Bing Yun with a bitter smile, "Senior, saying things like that is bound to cause misunderstandings."

Bing Yun simply smiled and said, "I was just speaking casually—don’t take it to heart."

She hadn't meant to take advantage of Yang Kai, but she knew Feng Xuan was deliberately trying to upset her, so she acted indifferent.

"It seems this boy really does have a deep connection with you!" Feng Xuan immediately realized that Yang Kai's relationship with Bing Yun was unusual, or else she wouldn't have said such things without caring about her reputation.

"But even if he is your illegitimate son, the Bloodjade Qilin must be handed over today, or don't blame this Lord for being ruthless!" Feng Xuan shouted, suddenly stepping forward.

The whole world seemed to tremble under his step, as if compelled to submit.

For no reason, it felt as if a great mountain pressed down from the sky over Binglun City, making it hard to breathe.

Yang Kai's face turned a shade paler. He raised the Bloodjade Qilin high and snorted, "This Young Master is timid as a mouse, Lord Feng Xuan, please don't scare me. If I get nervous and break this thing, that wouldn't be good."

Everyone was speechless, thinking, "You really dare to talk nonsense with your eyes wide open. If you're timid as a mouse, then there's no one bold in this world."

As Yang Kai spoke, he secretly activated his Origin Qi, and a faint cracking sound came from the Bloodjade Qilin.

Seeing this, Feng Xi's eyes bulged as he cried out, "Father, he's really going to destroy the Bloodjade Qilin!"

"Stop!" Feng Xuan also shouted, "If you destroy it, I'll make sure you die without a grave!"

Yang Kai cried out, "Oh dear, everyone says this Young Master is timid as a mouse—why does Lord Feng Xuan still insist on scaring me? I'm absolutely terrified of dying!"

As he spoke, he increased the force in his hand, and the cracking sounds grew louder.

Feng Xuan's breath caught, his face turning ashen.

The Bloodjade Qilin wasn't actually a precious treasure, but it was the symbol of the Wenqing Sect's Young Sect Master's wife. Every generation of Young Sect Master had many wives and concubines, but only the one holding the Bloodjade Qilin was the true wife, managing the harem so the Young Sect Master could focus on cultivation without being distracted by jealousy.

If such a symbolic item were destroyed in front of everyone, it would be a huge slap in the face for Wenqing Sect.

Seeing that force wouldn't work, Feng Xuan could only take a deep breath, restrain his aura, and say with an ugly expression, "Boy, what do you want?"

Yang Kai snorted, "I've already stated my terms, Lord Feng Xuan, why pretend you don't know?"

"You dare ask for a billion Middle-Level Source Crystals!" Feng Xuan roared. Although a billion Source Crystals wasn't much to Wenqing Sect, giving them to Yang Kai for nothing was hard to accept.

Yang Kai squinted and said, "Then how much is my lord willing to offer?"

"At most a hundred million. Don't push your luck!" Feng Xuan snorted.

"Fine, a hundred million it is. I'm easy to deal with," Yang Kai grinned.

This reaction stunned everyone. No one expected Yang Kai to agree so easily. After his earlier outrageous demand and lawless attitude, everyone thought he would extort Wenqing Sect for a billion Source Crystals. Judging by how much Feng Xuan valued the Bloodjade Qilin, if Yang Kai insisted, he could have gotten the full amount. Yet he didn't even haggle and just gave in.

Was he scared? Young people always act impulsively, but once they calm down, they get scared after the fact.

Still, for someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to extort a hundred million Source Crystals from the Sect Master of Wenqing Sect—no one has ever done that before.

"Senior Bing Yun, may I trouble you to lend a hand?" Yang Kai suddenly turned to Bing Yun.

Bing Yun didn't know what trick he was up to and asked suspiciously, "What for?"

Yang Kai held the Bloodjade Qilin in his hand, gestured with it, and said, "Since Lord Feng Xuan is only willing to pay a tenth of the price, I can only trade a tenth of it. Senior, please cut off a tenth for the deal. We do business fairly—no cheating, no taking advantage!"

Bing Yun found this idea amusing. She shot Yang Kai a glare, then with a flip of her wrist, a snow-white sword appeared in her hand, as if she really intended to cut off a tenth.

Yang Kai looked up at Feng Xuan and sneered, "My lord, are you satisfied with this result?"

Feng Xuan was so angry he nearly spat blood. Before he could say anything, Yang Kai added, "If you can offer five hundred million, I'll have Senior Bing Yun cut it in half. You'll receive as many Source Crystals as the goods are worth. I'm very fair. So, how much do you want now?"

Feng Xuan's qi and blood surged, and he almost couldn't catch his breath.

He felt he'd never been so humiliated in his life, all thanks to that young man!

Hu Yuan and the others were also secretly frightened, thinking this young man was ruthless—he wouldn't budge from a billion Source Crystals. If he really cut off a tenth or half, what would be the point of the Bloodjade Qilin?

But... to offend Wenqing Sect to this extent, how could he survive? Unless he really was Bing Yun's illegitimate son!
