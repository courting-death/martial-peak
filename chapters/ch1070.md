## Chapter 1070 — At Worst, This Old Man Will Take You as His Master

In the Alchemy Room, Yang Kai was sweating like rain as one Pill after another was born from his hands. Zong Ao’s eyes were wide, staring unblinkingly at Yang Kai for an instant that seemed never to end.

As the sun set in the west, today’s alchemy came to a close. Yang Kai put away the final Pill without even a glance, slipped it into a jade bottle, and, still seated cross‑legged, took out a Pill to swallow, restoring the Divine Sense he had expended.

Zong Ao strode over as if flying, went straight to the jade bottle, grabbed it, poured out the ten Pills refined today, and examined them carefully.

“How can this be? How can this be?” After a moment, Zong Ao muttered in a daze, his face full of disbelief. Those ten Pills had given him an immense shock, shaking the principles he had upheld for a hundred years until they tottered.

His complexion suddenly turned somewhat pale. He stared blankly at Yang Kai, then gave a bitter smile. As though all the strength in his body had been drained, he slumped to the ground.

Ten Pills—among them, three bore Pill Patterns!

Such odds utterly exceeded Zong Ao’s imagination.

He was an alchemy master of his generation. After pondering for decades, he finally devised a method of winning by quantity, came to Rainfall Star, and, using the herbs supplied by the Hengluo Commerce Guild as a foundation, had been painstakingly refining for nearly a hundred years, each time refining dozens of Pills simultaneously.

Even so, only when luck was extremely good would three Pills with Pill Patterns be born at the same time; sometimes, when luck was poor, there wouldn’t be even a single one.

However, that boy displayed a power that could turn decay into the miraculous — as he refined pill after pill, nearly thirty percent of them actually bore Pill Patterns.

This wasn’t a matter of one or two days; it had been so for nearly a month!

He refined exactly ten each day—no more and no less—yet among those ten, every day two or three Pills would give birth to Pill Patterns!

This dealt Zong Ao an enormous shock and blow.

From when Yang Kai began refining Leaving Flame Pills until now, two months had passed. In the first month, he refined three hundred ordinary Leaving Flame Pills, and Zong Ao had fiercely mocked him, believing he couldn’t even refine Pill Patterns, let alone a Pill Cloud.

But starting from the second month, this kid continually used facts to bombard Zong Ao’s pride.

On the first day of the second month, Yang Kai refined two Leaving Flame Pills with Pill Patterns. Zong Ao merely took it as luck, gave him a slight word of praise, and remained disdainful. When his own luck was good, he could do the same.

On the second day of the second month, it was still so, and Zong Ao’s disdain vanished.

On the third day, it remained the same, and Zong Ao became unable to sit still.

Until today—he was nearly driven mad.

A century of persistence and doctrine was smashed to pieces by the Pills Yang Kai refined each day; all his pride was swept clean away.

If Pill Patterns were so easy to generate, what had he been doing for this past hundred years?

After exhausting his mind to temper a unique alchemy method that won by quantity, in the face of these Leaving Flame Pills bearing Pill Patterns, it appeared so naive and laughable.

Holding the still-warm jade bottle, Zong Ao’s hands trembled. Ignoring that Yang Kai was in the midst of recovery, he strode up and hurriedly said, “Brat, tell this old man—what knack here is it that this old man doesn’t know? Why can you refine so many Pill Patterns?”

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes to see Zong Ao’s pair of blood-red eyeballs, shot through with veins—obviously the result of poor rest.

During this period, Zong Ao had been racking his brains, yet still couldn’t figure out what Yang Kai had done to make Pill Patterns come into being, thinking until both eyes were red—perhaps with a trace of jealousy as well.

“No knack—just luck.”

Before Yang Kai finished speaking, Zong Ao shot him a look of disdain. “This old man isn’t a fool. Do you think I can’t see whether this has anything to do with luck? Brat, don’t hoard your broom. Be frank and confess. This old man will give you benefits.”

He wished he could invade Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness and spy upon his thoughts.

Yang Kai shook his head. “Senior Zong, you also know that every school regards its alchemy arts as treasures not to be lightly transmitted…”

“Stinking brat, didn’t you once peek at this old man’s spirit formation in my medicine fields? And flip through many classics in my study? When did this old man ever say a word?” Zong Ao couldn’t help but puff his beard and glare.

“Senior Zong, that’s not right. Supporting juniors is precisely an elder’s duty. Besides, what I saw were peripheral trifles, not worth much. But this method of mine for refining Pill Patterns is different—it is the core secret of my lineage. How can it be compared with those spirit formations?”

“This old man doesn’t care. If you don’t talk today, this old man will pry off your skullcap and refine your divine soul!”

Shameless—he was actually playing the rogue!

Yang Kai despised him inwardly.

But he also knew that Zong Ao was merely speaking out of frustration. With Zong Ao’s status and strength, if he truly wanted to force the answer out of him, there was no need for all this pretense—he could have simply taken action directly.

His acting like a rogue now was clearly a last resort. He coveted the method of refining Pill Patterns to such a degree that he had ceased to care about his status.

“At worst… this old man will take you as his master!” Zong Ao snorted, his face firm and sonorous, feeling not the slightest impropriety.

Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment, not expecting him to say something so shameless. Inwardly, he was greatly impressed.

He still shook his head. “Senior Zong, it isn’t that this junior refuses to open a convenient door; it’s just that this method can’t be learned by others.”

Back then in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, when he taught the alchemy masters of the Tongxuan Continent to refine Pill Patterns with this method, although they gained somewhat, they were far inferior to Yang Kai’s level—until Xia Ningshang came over and could stand shoulder to shoulder with Yang Kai.

In the final analysis, it was the marvelous use of Divine Sense Fire.

“Whether it can be learned, this old man will apply himself. There’s no need for you to worry!” Zong Ao’s expression gradually became hideous. To unravel the mystery, his face had already become worthless.

Yang Kai was helpless; he had long known such a situation would arise. After pondering, he said, “Senior Zong, how about we exchange?”

“Exchange what? What does this old man have that you would fancy?”

“Your method of large-scale alchemy—I want it,” Yang Kai said directly.

He had never before seen anyone capable of refining dozens of Pills at the same time. Zong Ao’s alchemy was consummate; he had the ability to found a school. This craft had to be learned.

Zong Ao relied only on Saint Yuan to refine, yet could open dozens of furnaces at once.

Yang Kai possessed both Saint Yuan and Divine Sense power; both could be used for alchemy. Once he learned Zong Ao’s method, it wouldn’t be difficult to carry it forward and expand it.

“See for yourself!” Light flashed from the ring on Zong Ao’s hand, and an archaic-looking book was tossed to Yang Kai without the least hesitation.

Yang Kai received it and flipped a few pages, discovering that it was indeed an alchemy method Zong Ao had pioneered, with exceedingly detailed introductions. It was clearly penned by Zong Ao to be passed to his true inheritor.

Yet now it fell cheaply to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod, stored the book in his Spatial Ring, sniffed, and said, “These pill furnaces…”

“I’ll give you ten!” Zong Ao waved his hand. Though forthright, the skin on his face still twitched imperceptibly.

It was obvious he was in extreme heartache.

Back then, in order to collect these dozens of furnaces, he had traversed a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers, gathered the materials for forging them himself, and several times brushed past death. After the materials were collected, he personally sought out artifact refiners he knew and asked them to forge them.

It could be said that every furnace was the crystallization of blood and sweat, the proof of his years of toil!

Now, to give away ten in a single breath, the pain made him nearly bleed from the heart.

“Half,” Yang Kai raised a finger and wagged it.

Zong Ao stared at him with bloodshot eyes, his face ferocious, as though he wanted to swallow him whole. But after hesitating for a long while, he still nodded and said, “Half it is!”

Anyway, when this brat fails to refine Leaving Flame Pills with a Pill Cloud, he’ll be enslaved by me for a lifetime. By then, won’t what’s his still be mine? Zong Ao had never thought highly of Yang Kai being able to refine a Pill Cloud, even with the enormous stimulus of this past month.

Unless his luck truly defies the heavens and a Pill Cloud suddenly births itself—if it really comes to that, Zong Ao will have nothing to say.

But the odds of that were truly too small.

Yang Kai grinned; he hadn’t expected it to go so smoothly. He had thought Zong Ao, having lived alone for long and possessing an alchemist’s pride, was neither versed in nor adept at negotiation—who knew the other party was nursing another abacus?

“Senior Zong, have you never thought of refining a spirit formation into the Pill at the very moment it takes shape? Put plainly, Pill Patterns are nothing but a condensed formation. Otherwise, how could they keep a Pill’s efficacy eternal and undiminished?” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

“Refine a spirit formation into the Pill?” Zong Ao’s eyes bulged as he murmured, then he was shaken as if thunderstruck. In that instant, the shackles and barriers that had bound him for years seemed to be ripped apart by a keen blade, allowing him to see a vaster world in which he could soar and roam unrestrained.

When alchemists refine Pills, they need to use spirit formations; when artifact refiners refine artifacts, they also need to use spirit formations. Many foundational spirit formations are even the same. But since ancient times, the function of spirit formations has been regarded by alchemists and artifact refiners as auxiliary to refinement—during the process, allowing various materials, through the power of formations, to fuse perfectly and display their peak effect.

No one had ever told Zong Ao that those spirit formations which assist alchemy could be refined into the Pill.

“Senior Zong, there may be naturally generated Pill Patterns, but the ones I refine are all deliberately generated Pill Patterns. Moreover, it requires the use of Divine Sense Fire. Only Divine Sense Fire can swiftly inscribe a perfect composite spirit formation, bring out the full might of the formation, and refine it in at the instant the Pill takes shape. I don’t know how much effect you can achieve using Saint Yuan, but with this method, the chances of giving birth to Pill Patterns should be a bit higher than with your original method.”
