## Chapter 768 — What Good Is It to You?

Yang Kai put on an expression of brazen fearlessness, as if nothing in heaven or earth could frighten him, which in turn made those from the Yang Clan feel cornered.

The leader let out a few strange laughs—one couldn’t tell if it was mockery or admiration—and spoke in a sardonic tone: “Kid, you’re bold. Do you think we won’t dare to make a move? You have only one life; best cooperate and behave!”

Yang Kai stared at him coldly and said nothing, making it clear by his silence that he would never betray the truth even if it meant death.

If he wanted to seize the initiative now, silence was his only option; once the Yang Clan learned what he had done, they’d treat him as a long-term nutrient source for the Divine Tree, forcing him to keep producing Yang Liquid to feed it.

That was the last thing Yang Kai wished to see.

Judging from their tone, Yang Kai faintly suspected they truly didn’t know how the Divine Tree was evolving; he frowned in thought, then a flash of insight struck him and he understood.

What he could investigate came from the fact that his Spirit Body had slipped into the trunk and seen things firsthand with ease.

Their Spirit Bodies apparently lacked that ability. Inside the trunk flowed dense, scorching Yang attribute energy; if their Spirit Bodies entered, they would likely be burned to death.

They did not possess the Divine Sense Fire that could ignore such searing heat.

With that realization, Yang Kai relaxed inwardly and felt ever more confident and unafraid.

As long as they didn’t know what was happening on the inside, he could completely take the advantage going forward.

The Yang Clan leader fixed Yang Kai with a long, dark stare; his brows clouded, his expression shifted, and only after a while did he chuckle and nod: “If you won’t speak, you won’t. You don’t tell me, but I’ll have my ways to find out.”

This was their territory and his cultivation far exceeded Yang Kai’s, so naturally he believed Yang Kai couldn’t conceal the truth for long.

Yang Kai shrugged, neither denying nor affirming.

“Since you have the ability to calm the Divine Tree, you have some use. For today we won’t kill you, but heed my warning: don’t try any tricks, or you’ll suffer the consequences!”

Yang Kai gave a light laugh. “Rest assured, I know my limits. As long as you don’t harm me or my companions, I’ll cooperate.”

“This kid is interesting!” The leader laughed strangely; Yang Kai’s willingness to bend but not break opened the man’s eyes.

“But before that, I have a few demands to put to you.”

“Don’t get greedy—how dare you make demands of us? You don’t have that right; have you lost sight of your position?” the leader snorted, his face growing dour.

“I’m not asking for myself. I’m asking for your Divine Tree. If you want it to recover sooner, it’s best to listen to me—though it’s up to you whether you do.”

The Yang Clan members all frowned and watched him with distrust.

“Go on,” the leader said with a stern face.

“First, from today on I want every member of the Yang Clan to stop drawing Yang attribute energy from the Divine Tree. If you wish to cultivate, keep well away from it.”

“Why?”

“I can only say it’s related to the Divine Tree’s violent episodes,” Yang Kai replied glibly.

The Divine Tree’s evolution required nutrients, and he was spending his own Yang Liquid to aid its progress. He didn’t want its energy siphoned away by the Yang Clan, which would only increase his own burden.

“Are you joking? You expect my entire clan to stop cultivating at your word?” a Yang Clan expert barked.

“That’s for you to decide. I don’t mind either way; I’m merely making a suggestion.”

“How long must we stop?” the leader asked.

Yang Kai frowned and shot back, “How long has your Divine Tree been acting up?”

The leader replied, “About three years. At first it wasn’t noticeable, but recently it’s become more frequent.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. If the Divine Tree’s evolution began three years ago, his deduction was correct: given enough conditions it wouldn’t take long before the tree finished evolving, at which point it would develop awareness and become a higher form of life.

“In that case, you’ll only need to endure at most a year—maybe six months, perhaps even less.”

“Acceptable!” The leader nodded and agreed to Yang Kai’s request; though some of the other Yang Clan experts felt reluctant, they dared not argue.

At worst, they’d only have to hold out a year.

“Second, I need things to replenish True Yuan—preferably fruits of the Divine Tree, as many as possible,” Yang Kai said lightly.

At those words, all the Yang Clan faces turned strange.

The leader laughed mockingly: “As many as possible? Do you think the Divine Tree’s fruits are endless? Each fruit here has grown for decades or centuries. Even we can’t consume them casually—who do you think you are to demand such treasures?”

“Aren’t there plenty hanging there?” Yang Kai’s expression soured. There were indeed many ripe fruits dangling from the Divine Tree—dozens at least—wafting an intoxicating aroma that made him salivate.

“Those are the wealth our clan has accumulated over centuries; no outsider may partake,” the leader said unwillingly.

“If you won’t give fruits, Yang attribute spiritual herbs or medicines will do. You must have those, right?” Yang Kai snapped impatiently.

The fat must come from the sheep; since he provided Yang Liquid to the Divine Tree, it was only right the Yang Clan supply what replenished him.

“You saw for yourselves that calming the Divine Tree cost me all my True Yuan; without replenishment I can’t recover.”

Hearing that, the leader could only nod. “Fine, as you say—we’ll provide the True Yuan supplements. Don’t worry about that.”

“Third…”

“Cut it off, kid—we don’t have the patience to haggle over terms,” the leader said displeased, interrupting Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled. “I’m merely saying, since you need me, you should provide me a decent environment. I can’t escape from here, so why keep throwing me in a dungeon?”

“Agreed!”

“And my female companion—yes, I’ve gotten along well with those two demon-clan friends recently. If convenient, arrange for them to stay with me.”

Gou Chi looked at Yang Kai in surprise, his face shifting; he seemed somewhat grateful.

“I promise you everything!” The leader had reached the end of his patience and his expression turned vicious. “I’ll fulfill your demands. But if you fail to satisfy our clan, you know what fate awaits you.”

“I understand perfectly.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, a brilliant smile spreading across his face.

“Take them away and arrange things as he requested!” the leader ordered with a wave.

The expert who had escorted Yang Kai and the others earlier immediately stepped forward and led them away again.

After they left, one of the Yang Clan high-ranking members scowled and said, “This kid is utterly insolent to dare make so many demands—why did you agree, chief?”

“What does it matter? They’re minor things. I want to see how he calms the Divine Tree next time. Have someone watch them, especially that young human—see what he does in the coming days.”

“Yes!”

……

In a palace chamber, Yang Kai and his three companions were led inside.

After arranging their lodgings, the Yang Clan escort who had brought them left.

Both Yang Kai and Gou Chi could feel many powerful experts watching outside the palace, their Divine Sense probing in; it was clear there would be no chance to escape.

Settled into more comfortable quarters and having just escaped death, the group remained shaken. Gou Chi and the unknown demon-clan man especially could not understand why Yang Kai had looked after them so much.

In the inner room the four gathered; Gou Chi regarded Yang Kai with mixed emotions and, hesitating several times, finally voiced his doubts.

Yang Kai laughed lightly. “No reason. Since we’ve all fallen on hard times together, it’s only natural to help. Brother Gou Chi, aren’t you overthinking?”

Gou Chi’s face reddened; he scratched his cheek then suddenly sobered: “In any case, I owe you my life, Brother Gou Chi will remember this debt. If we manage to leave, I’ll repay you!”

If not for Yang Kai’s unexpected action this time, he surely would have been blood-sacrificed by the Yang Clan.

“You’re overstating it, Brother Gou Chi,” Yang Kai waved lightly. “Whether we can leave is another matter; we might die here yet.”

“If it comes to that, I’ll fight them to the death.”

“I’ve already seen enough. Hmm, this palace is quite large—pick rooms and rest. For the moment none of you will be in immediate danger, but I need to recover quickly.”

“Then I won’t bother you. Rest well!” Gou Chi said and hurried off with his clansman.

An Ling’er stayed behind, studying Yang Kai with her beautiful eyes, her face thoughtful.

“Anything else?” Yang Kai asked.

“You lied,” An Ling’er said, knitting her brows. “I can tell you didn’t save Gou Chi from pure kindness—you must have some scheme!”

“Knowing too much can get a person killed, beauty!” Yang Kai sneered.

“I’m not afraid of you. You just like to talk,” An Ling’er pouted, seeing through him. After a moment’s thought she asked, “What do you want from him? What can he give you?”

“Nothing much,” Yang Kai smiled blandly. “What I want is his gratitude.”

“How does that help you? His gratitude won’t save you here.”

“Maybe not here, but what about outside?” Yang Kai looked at her with meaning.

“Outside…” An Ling’er frowned, genuinely puzzled.

“Idiot!” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “They say large breasts mean little brains—true enough!”

“I…” An Ling’er’s face flushed as she glanced down at her ample bosom and bit her lip, “They’re not that big.”

“They look fine—well-developed,” Yang Kai leered lecherously.

“Pervert—shameless!” An Ling’er snapped, her neck flushing red.
