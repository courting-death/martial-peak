## Chapter 1088 — Avian Tree

Generally speaking, a martial artist’s body will store only one attribute of energy; it’s not a hard rule so much as the truth that trying to master too many leaves nothing whole.

One attribute, one realm — that alone is enough for a martial artist to spend a lifetime probing and comprehending.

Yet most fighters can call upon several different attribute powers, whether through Martial Skill or via a Secret Treasure; for example, Yang Kai could already wield the Yang attribute and the evil power hidden within the Indomitable Golden Body.

He could also muster the wind and thunder forces contained in the Wind-and-Thunder Wings.

The four forces had their primaries and secondaries—Yang attribute power and the corrupt energy within the Indomitable Golden Body were Yang Kai’s life’s main thrust, the mysteries of which he had long plumbed, eventually fusing the two to form the earth-scouring, all-consuming Demonic Flame.

The wind-and-thunder power could only be employed to any degree when the Wind-and-Thunder Wings were manifested.

That Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion’s Inner Core naturally contained both wind and earth forces, perfectly fused; its value could not be overstated.

Guiche and the other three gathered together, each bristling with battle-intent, their eyes bright as they discussed positions and who would take responsibility for what in the coming fight.

The Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion was a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast, equivalent to a martial artist at the Origin Returning Realm; four Saint King Realm cultivators trying to kill it still risked serious injury, yet judging by their confidence, they clearly felt assured of victory.

None of the four were fools—dangerous business was not something they’d blithely meddle in.

Yang Kai didn’t join them; his Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation left him utterly unqualified to take part in this grand clash. He didn’t press the matter, merely standing to the side, looking bored.

An hour later, with plans finalized, Guiche gave a grim laugh. He surged forward first toward the sand-choked area; Ganji and Ji Ping wore solemn expressions, taking no chances, while Luo Yao let out a girlish trill and fell to the rear.

The four’s expressions differed, and they paid Yang Kai no heed; like streaks of rainbow light they quickly vanished from sight.

A moment later Yang Kai detected violent energy rippling in that direction; the winds and sands linking sky and earth grew even more furious. Even dozens of li away he could scent the rank stench belonging to the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion.

The brilliance of Martial Skills and Secret Treasures flared, punctuated by the four’s shouts—roars that spoke of a fierce battle.

Yang Kai squinted toward the scene but could see nothing save shifting silhouettes moving through the tempest of sand.

As time passed the murderous aura weakened, but the energy waves radiating from Guiche and the others only intensified—clearly they were preparing to finish the Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast in one decisive effort.

Sensing the moment was right, Yang Kai leisurely flew in that direction, a smile at the corner of his mouth, thoroughly at ease.

When he arrived he found, on the yellow-sand plain, a ferocious beast the size of a house lying motionless, its life extinguished.

Guiche and the others were nearly all wounded, each standing to catch their breath. Ganji fared especially badly; a foot-long wound gaped in his thigh. Flesh peeled back, revealing pale bone and thick meridians.

The wound had come perilously close to damaging his groin; Yang Kai felt a chill at the sight.

There was no time to treat spoils; the four each produced Pills and swallowed them.

Yang Kai strolled to the beast’s side, circled it a few times, and knocked on its tough carapace—clicking his tongue in wonder.

He could tell the others had not lied; the scorpion’s shell, pincers, and tail were all ideal materials for forging artifacts—paired with the right ore and a skilled armorer, they could be smithed into a Secret Treasure of Origin-Grade quality.

No wonder the moment they learned of a Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion everyone had grown excited.

It took half a day for the four to recover; the bout had cost them greatly.

Guiche first asked the others’ opinions, then approached the carcass, prying open the junction between the shell and the belly. Feeling about within, he soon produced a fist-sized Inner Core that shimmered with blue and yellow light.

Guiche laughed heartily: “This Inner Core won’t be worth less than fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Hmm, I’ll keep it for now and sell it when we get—we'll split the Saint Crystals evenly.”

Saying that, he placed it directly into his Spatial Ring without asking anyone’s consent.

Yang Kai watched clearly; Ganji and the other two frowned, displeased, but none protested.

Guiche then exerted effort and tore the scorpion into eight pieces.

He took the beast’s carapace—perfect for forging an exceptional defensive armor—Ganji got the tail, and the two huge pincers were split between Ji Ping and Luo Yao.

Yang Kai stood aside; having not fought, he naturally had no claim to the spoils.

Even the scant blood was collected by Guiche into his pouch, as if Yang Kai had not even come to reconnoiter earlier.

The distribution was selfish but passably fair; though a few grumbled inwardly, no one voiced complaint. As for Yang Kai’s opinion, they couldn’t have cared less.

“Rest a little longer.” Guiche ordered, and the others settled to meditate.

Ji Ping took out the beast-skin paper and studied it carefully, brows knitting.

Suddenly Ji Ping shouted, startling the group, who turned to see him all smiles and waving his hands in excitement.

“What did you find?” Guiche asked hastily.

“I think we may not be far from the target.” Ji Ping’s face shone; his earlier displeasure over Guiche’s spoils had already vanished.

Hearing this, the others clustered around Ji Ping; Yang Kai moved closer to watch as well.

The beast-skin paper was covered in strange symbols. At the top sat a giant X—likely the objective they sought—and elsewhere on the map were symbols denoting special significance.

“Look at this yellow area. I didn’t know what it meant before, but now I see—it marks the place where the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion resides.” Ji Ping pointed at the paper and explained his discovery.

“If that mark is our current location, then this swath of blue must be the jungle we passed through earlier,” Guiche mused.

“Then this must be that lake.” Luo Yao pointed to a spot and offered her opinion.

“That seems right, everything matches. If we keep moving ahead, it won’t take many days to find the place.”

At those words everyone brightened.

“There seems to be danger ahead.” Yang Kai interjected, pointing to a mark on the beast-skin paper: a flying bird—clearly no harmless thing.

Avian demonic beasts are bound to be more troublesome than land ones; swift and nimble, a flying Demonic Beast at the same rank will generally be far more formidable than its terrestrial counterpart.

“We’ll take it step by step. If that place is truly perilous, we’ll bypass it.” Guiche inhaled deeply.

After resting a while longer and regaining their peaks, the group resumed their journey.

The bird symbol on the map kept them on edge; they frequently scanned the sky, but even as they neared the edge of that area they saw not a single Demonic Beast, leaving the fighters puzzled and wondering if they’d taken the wrong trail.

Suddenly a bright arc of electricity flashed ahead; a cold, biting thunder aura washed over them, and their faces changed.

Looking out, they saw, some dozen li away, a modest tree standing alone, its sparse leaves intermittently crackling with longer and shorter bolts of light.

The five opened their Divine Sense and probed across dozens of li. Once they confirmed no danger approached, Guiche led them closer to the tree.

After a short while they stopped and stood before the tree, staring in shock and moved.

This single-person-tall tree harbored a horrifying thunderous aura; its scant leaves seemed all formed of lightning, the glow coursing across each surface. Every leaf looked incredibly hard, like translucent jade.

“What kind of tree is this?” Luo Yao asked curiously.

Among this group, except for Yang Kai’s ignorance, the other four considered themselves well-traveled, yet none recognized the tree.

“Is it not recorded in your ancestral texts?” Ganji asked Ji Ping, who slowly shook his head: “No record. Maybe the tree didn’t exist when my ancestor was here.”

“A Spiritual Object like this can’t simply appear for no reason—have you been hiding something?” Ganji looked at Ji Ping skeptically.

Ji Ping snorted and replied with displeasure, “What reason would I have to conceal it?”

“It’s an Avian Tree!” Guiche suddenly announced, his eyes alight with excitement.

“Avian Tree?” the three others exclaimed. Ji Ping quickly recovered and looked at Guiche: “You mean…?”

“That bird symbol on the beast-skin map must mark a lightning-attributed avian Demonic Beast. It died here; its flesh and Inner Core spawned this Avian Tree!” Guiche said in a low voice, growing ever more excited.

Ji Ping also seemed to recall something and spoke gravely: “My ancestor’s texts do record that he once saw a great bird wrapped in lightning—according to his account, it was a Thunder Luan!”

A collective gulp escaped; faces went pale with lingering fear. The three looked at Ji Ping with altered expressions.

Ji Ping shrugged: “If I’d told you earlier you wouldn’t have come in. But the Thunder Luan is already dead; we need not fear now.”

“We’ll settle this later when we’re out. You knew a Thunder Luan was here and still dared lead us in,” Guiche ground his teeth.
