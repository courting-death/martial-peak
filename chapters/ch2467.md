## Chapter 2467 — Soul Descent

Escape! Hurry and escape, or it might be too late.

Just as the yellow-faced youth and the scholarly middle-aged man had this thought, Yang Kai suddenly turned his head, his icy gaze sweeping toward them.

Both men sucked in a cold breath. Under Yang Kai’s chilling stare, their legs went weak, and they couldn’t muster a shred of strength.

“Will you come over here and die yourselves, or do I have to go over and cut you down?” Yang Kai stood with his sword, his figure calm and unruffled, his clothes neat and tidy, as if the fierce battle just now hadn’t cost him anything at all.

The result was as if Feng Xi were merely a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, and he was the lofty Emperor Realm master. The expected scenario had been completely reversed, leaving everyone unable to accept it.

Monster! The yellow-faced youth and the scholarly man’s teeth chattered violently, making a clacking sound. They were so terrified they couldn’t utter a single word.

“Looks like you’ve chosen the latter.” Yang Kai snorted coldly and took a step toward them.

The two men’s breathing halted at once. They wanted to flee, but their bodies wouldn’t obey, and a wave of despair instantly drowned them.

But in the next moment, Yang Kai suddenly frowned and turned to look to the side.

What he saw made Yang Kai’s eyes go wide.

The Feng Xi who should have been lying on the ground waiting to die was now slowly standing up. But his state was extremely strange—he seemed to have no consciousness, his eyes tightly shut, his body stiff, like a puppet being lifted by someone else.

Instead, the Origin Qi within his body was churning wildly. Not only that, but there was also an aura awakening inside Feng Xi that made Yang Kai feel wary and horrified.

Very soon, Feng Xi straightened up and suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes.

Those eyes were icy cold, yet shone with dazzling brilliance, bright as the stars.

Yang Kai was greatly shocked!

The moment Feng Xi opened his eyes, that strange aura inside him surged to its peak. The power of Imperial Might erupted, making Yang Kai’s breath catch and his blood seem to freeze in his veins.

“What the hell?” Yang Kai muttered with a frown. At this moment, Feng Xi gave off an incredibly dangerous aura—just meeting his gaze made Yang Kai feel as if he were being stalked by a wild beast. The sensation was deeply unsettling.

Feng Xi’s entire demeanor had changed dramatically. Gone was the image of the Sect’s Eldest Young Master; now he exuded a noble and regal air. His gaze was commanding, as if he intended to rule the world.

Yang Kai’s heart pounded. This feeling was familiar—he’d experienced something similar from experts like Yao Changjun, Chi Ri, and Bing Yun, all Third Stage Emperor Realm powerhouses.

But Feng Xi had only just broken through to the Emperor Realm. How could he compare to those top experts?

Could it be a secret art of the Wenqing Sect? Yang Kai wondered. Suddenly, he swung his hand, sending two Moon Blades in a crisscross pattern spinning toward Feng Xi, sealing off all his escape routes in an instant.

Feng Xi looked at the two crossing Moon Blades, a flash of amazement in his eyes, as if it were his first time seeing Yang Kai use a space divine ability. His expression was calm and steady, not matching his age, and he made no move to dodge. Instead, he slowly extended a single finger forward.

That finger pointed out, landing precisely at the center of the crossing blades. Not a hair off.

And under the power of that finger, the two Moon Blades instantly shattered, not harming Feng Xi in the slightest.

“What?” Yang Kai was truly shocked this time. Of course, he knew better than anyone where the weakness of his secret art lay. Although this was his first time using the crisscrossing Moon Blades in actual combat, he had rehearsed the move countless times in his mind, so wielding it felt as natural as breathing.

And the weak point of this secret art was exactly where Feng Xi’s finger had struck.

How did he see through it? Yang Kai’s expression turned stormy.

If Feng Xi had such insight and skill, he wouldn’t have been beaten so badly just now. It seemed that in the brief time between his unconsciousness and awakening, something earth-shattering had changed within him.

“Who are you!” Yang Kai suddenly recalled a legendary secret art, his heart trembling as he shouted the question.

Feng Xi looked coldly at Yang Kai, the corner of his mouth lifting. “You’re quite something, boy. I thought you were extraordinary the day I saw you. Now it seems my judgment was right.”

“Hiss…” Yang Kai sucked in a cold breath and couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

Feng Xi suddenly speaking to him in such a senior tone only confirmed Yang Kai’s suspicions.

He swallowed hard and blurted out, “Soul Descent! You’re Feng Xuan!”

He’d long heard that some top experts, to protect their favored descendants or disciples, would leave a trace of their Divine Soul within them. Normally, it wouldn’t activate, but in a life-or-death crisis, this power would erupt to fight the enemy.

But the price for using such a secret art was steep, and once activated, it would also greatly harm the descendant or disciple. So very few experts would do this, and even if they did, the power would only appear when absolutely necessary.

But now, the power within Feng Xi had manifested, which clearly meant he’d just reached the end of his rope.

“Not bad, boy. It is I!” Feng Xi shouted in a deep voice.

“What?”

“Sect Master?”

The yellow-faced man and the scholarly middle-aged man were also shocked, but soon became wild with joy. They rushed to Feng Xi’s side, knelt down, and trembled as they said, “Disciple greets Sect Master!”

Feng Xi glanced at them indifferently and snorted, “Two useless things. You couldn’t even protect the Young Sect Master, forcing me to appear in person. What use are you!”

The two men’s faces changed dramatically, but they didn’t dare make a sound. Their hearts were filled with bitterness.

Both thought that the Young Sect Master was already an Emperor Realm cultivator, far stronger than them, yet he was still beaten unconscious by Yang Kai in just a few moves. What could they possibly do with their meager strength? They’d just be flicked to death.

Though they grumbled inwardly, they didn’t dare say a word, only lowering their heads as cold sweat poured down their foreheads.

Feng Xi snorted, “Later, take the Young Sect Master somewhere safe to heal. If you can’t bring him back to the Sect whole and unharmed, don’t bother coming back yourselves.”

Since these two could enter the Shattered Star Sea, they were undoubtedly elite disciples of the Wenqing Sect. But in Feng Xuan’s eyes, their value probably wasn’t even worth a single hair of his son’s.

And from Feng Xuan’s tone, it was clear he expected to deal with Yang Kai quickly, which was why he told them to take Feng Xi to heal afterward.

The two men felt as if they’d been pardoned from death and quickly replied, “Yes!”

Feng Xi turned his head and looked at Yang Kai again, snorting, “Boy, the wounds on Xi’er’s body—are they your doing?”

Yang Kai replied with a dark face, “If I said no, would you believe me?”

Feng Xi said, “What do you think?”

Yang Kai snapped, “Then why the hell are you asking?!”

Feng Xi’s face darkened. “You’re quite arrogant, boy, daring to shout at me? I was going to give you a quick death, but since you’re so insolent, don’t blame me for being rude.”

Yang Kai sneered, “Feng Xi said the same thing earlier, but I beat him up pretty badly. Sect Master Feng, be careful you don’t follow in your son’s footsteps!”

Feng Xi said coldly, “You dare look down on me?”

Yang Kai drawled, “If Sect Master Feng were here in person, I’d admit I’m no match and run as far as I could. But alas… you’re only descending into your son’s body. How much of your true strength can you really use?”

“It’s more than enough to take your life!”

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “So stubborn! Sect Master Feng, be careful not to ruin your reputation in your old age!”

“Enough nonsense!” Feng Xi roared. “I’ll take your dog life now—Wenqing Finger!”

As he spoke, he pointed sharply at where Yang Kai stood.

An unimaginable force suddenly crashed down, formless and invisible, as if it would tear the very void apart. Wherever the wind passed, space collapsed layer by layer—utterly terrifying.

The power of this finger, though not quite as strong as the Emperor Extinction Pill Feng Xi had used before, was not far off.

The reason this attack wasn’t quite as powerful as before wasn’t because Feng Xuan’s strength had waned over the years. In fact, when he refined that Emperor Extinction Pill, he had only just broken through to the Third Stage Emperor Realm. So after all these years, his cultivation must have grown even deeper.

If he were here in person to unleash this secret art, its power would be even greater.

But now, in a soul-descended body, the strength he could display depended entirely on what Feng Xi’s body could withstand.

So the power of this Wenqing Finger was greatly reduced.

Even so, it wasn’t something Yang Kai could take head-on.

As his figure flickered, he tried to dodge, but the power of the finger seemed to seal space and suppress the world. Yang Kai’s body froze, and he was struck by the wind.

It was like being hit by a mountain. Yang Kai grunted, spitting blood as he staggered back, bones cracking all over his body—he didn’t know how many were broken. The part of his body that was grazed was a bloody mess.

With just one move, Yang Kai was already badly injured. Feng Xuan’s terrifying strength was clear to see.

Before he could steady himself, Feng Xi slashed out with a sword, shouting, “Wenqing Sword!”

Across more than a hundred zhang, the sword light swept out like a curtain, instantly crashing down in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had no way to dodge.

The yellow-faced youth and the scholarly man watched, their hearts filled with joy. They were thrilled by their Sect Master’s power. No matter how strong Yang Kai was, before the soul-descended Sect Master, he was as fragile as paper.

After unleashing the sword, Feng Xi’s aura dropped sharply. It seemed those two moves had cost him greatly, and he was slightly out of breath.

But it was enough. Feng Xuan believed that with Yang Kai’s strength, he couldn’t possibly withstand that attack. In the next moment, he would be torn apart by the sword light.

He sheathed his sword and stood coldly, staring ahead, waiting for the moment of Yang Kai’s death.
