## Chapter 1922 — Invitation

Yang Kai sat cross-legged in midair, motionless, releasing his Divine Sense and merging it with the surroundings to sense the power of the laws here.

From Yang Yan he had learned the importance of the power of the laws.

Only by comprehending the power of the laws could a martial artist transcend the Void King Realm and catch a glimpse of the mysteries of the next, higher realm.

This was also why Yang Yan said that those at the Star Lord level would find it easier to advance.

Because a Star Lord was the master of a Cultivation Star and had fused with the Stellar Origin, he could very easily perceive the heaven-and-earth laws of that Cultivation Star and thereby master their understanding.

Yang Kai had also sent Xiaoxiao to devour the remnant origin here for that very reason.

While he worked to grow stronger, he never gave up helping his two great aides. If Xiaoxiao were one day to comprehend the power of the laws, its combat strength would surely climb steadily; by then it would not only be able to disregard the Domain Field's might of the Void King Realm, but could even effortlessly suppress it.

Before long, Yang Kai slipped into a state of forgetting self and world, his whole being absorbed as he plunged deeply into the act of comprehension.

He could clearly sense a subtle, obscure power flowing beside him, a profundity so deep that even he could not fully fathom it.

This was the law!

He did not expect to comprehend very much, only to make as much contact as possible to prepare for the future.

Time passed in a flash — a month went by.

On that day Yang Kai opened his eyes; a clear light flickered within them as he looked around, and the previously obscure chaos seemed much clearer.

He had gained a trace of insight into the power of the laws.

"Indeed, it is a force mightier than the Domain Field. If one can truly comprehend the heaven-and-earth laws, then words become law," Yang Kai said thoughtfully. "What exactly is the next realm, that it can command such power?"

Whether it was the Shi of the Origin Returning Realm or the Domain of the Void King Realm, both were deployed outward from the wielder's own power, affecting the surroundings with their personal ability.

But the power of the laws was different — it controlled heaven-and-earth's might from the root; the stronger and weaker were clear at a glance.

Yang Kai stood quietly and pondered for three full days, yet remained somewhat bewildered.

He knew that considering these things now might be a bit premature for him.

For the moment he would not force it, and turned to fly back down.

Returning to the palace, Yang Kai sensed Ai Ou's presence inside; he had evidently already returned from outside. Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan were with him as well.

However, Xiaoxiao seemed to have fallen into slumber again, its breath steady with no ripples.

When Yang Kai entered the main hall, he found Ai Ou anxiously scrutinizing Liu Yan, wondering where she had come from; yet even Ai Ou's eyes could tell that Liu Yan had no physical body but was instead a condensation of an energy essence.

At that moment Liu Yan was quietly sitting to one side, holding the Stone Puppet and waiting for Yang Kai's arrival.

"Senior," Yang Kai approached and cupped his fist in greeting.

"You're back," Ai Ou nodded.

"What did you gain?" Yang Kai asked.

"I collected more than two thousand sets of remains. The rest... were simply nowhere to be found. But I found several warships still usable and many mined minerals. Once I return I will have people continue to extract them here," Ai Ou replied.

"Very good. If there is nothing else, let's return for now."

"Agreed." Ai Ou was not long-winded; with that he stepped onto the Space Array.

Yang Kai waved his hand and took both Liu Yan and Xiaoxiao into containment.

He did not ask Liu Yan what she had found, but from her expression he knew she had profited; an unrefined, burning force within her body was stirring to life.

Liu Yan had likely discovered some heaven-and-earth flame within the mining star.

Ai Ou opened his mouth as if about to ask about Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan's origins, but thought better of it and remained silent.

He had felt before that both Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan harbored forces he greatly feared; in other words, if he fought either alone, he would not be certain of victory.

This made Yang Kai seem all the more mysterious to him.

So young, only sixty, yet already at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, a Void King-Grade alchemist, able to lay a Great Space Array and with such powerful forces under him...

Could a single person really possess such talents and muster such overwhelming forces?

Was the Creator a little too partial?

Yet upon thinking that Xue Yue could capture such a man's heart, he was greatly delighted!

Such a person, if he turned against the Hengluo Commerce Guild, would be a disaster for the Guild; no wonder Master Kuang had been bested by Yang Kai, and no wonder Purple Star had suffered heavy losses.

Light flashed and the two returned to the secret chamber beneath Shuitian City.

After regaining his composure Ai Ou said, "Yang Kai, I have personally tested your ability. The Space Arrays between my Commerce Guild's eighteen stars will require your help to lay. If you need materials, tell Xue Yue and she will fully assist. I must next deal with the mining star affairs and will be unable to meet with you for some time."

"That is fine," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "But I have one impertinent request now — I wonder if you can grant it."

"No need for formalities." Having been through so much, Ai Ou already considered Yang Kai as one of his own; how could he refuse his request?

"I need your Commerce Guild's Star Emperor Token!" Yang Kai said softly.

Ai Ou's expression stiffened. "You know we have a Star Emperor Token?"

Then he showed a look of realization. "Xue Yue told you, didn't she?"

"Yes."

"Would you mind telling me what you want that Star Emperor Token for? Although it belonged to an emperor and bears a seal, its sealed divine art has long since been triggered and is of little use, serving mainly as a relic of inheritance. If you tell me the truth, I have no objection to giving it to you."

Yang Kai hesitated a moment, then produced a jade tablet, poured his Divine Sense into it, and handed it to Ai Ou. "Senior, look at this and you will understand."

Ai Ou took it with a puzzled look and examined it carefully.

The information on the jade tablet was identical to what Yang Kai had once given Lady Chi Yue, containing the secret of gathering nine Star Emperor Tokens to open the path to the Star Realm.

As expected, after reading it Ai Ou's face was stunned and he exclaimed, "Is this true?"

"Would I joke about such a thing?" Yang Kai said solemnly.

"No wonder you want that Star Emperor Token. If that's the case, giving it to you is naturally fine, but the six Void King experts at the Third Stage..."

"If you count them, I already have four candidates," Yang Kai replied.

Ai Ou stared at him in surprise, then smiled. "It seems you have prepared in advance."

"Then I wonder if you would be willing to go to the Star Realm to take a look," Yang Kai grinned.

Ai Ou fell silent, not as fervent as Lady Chi Yue had been; after pondering for a long while he finally said, "I cannot give you an answer right now, but I think that even if I do not go, Uncle Long would certainly be very interested."

"Senior Long?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up and he nodded. "He is indeed a very suitable candidate."

Long Tianshang was a top expert at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and fully met the requirements to open the Star Realm passage; with his aid Yang Kai would be greatly strengthened.

"Uncle Long has been researching deeper Martial Dao secrets these years; if told of this, he will be overjoyed and would certainly not refuse," Ai Ou said with a slight smile.

No one understood the Third Stage Void King expert's obsession with Martial Dao more than those who had reached that realm; only once a martial artist arrived at that stage could they comprehend it deeply.

So Yang Kai had anticipated early on that assembling the requisite people would not be a problem; he only needed to spread the information he held and the hidden old monsters would come forward to seek it.

He simply did not want to cooperate with too unfamiliar people, so he prioritized those he already knew.

"Rest assured, our Hengluo Commerce Guild will send one person — either I or Uncle Long," Ai Ou said seriously. "But how many Star Emperor Tokens have you gathered?"

"Including the Guild's piece, there are eight already."

Ai Ou's eyes narrowed. "And the last piece?"

"With the Sword Alliance!"

"The Sword Alliance?" Ai Ou raised his brows, suddenly grinned broadly, and patted Yang Kai's shoulder. "This is easy. I'll take care of it as a favor; wait for good news."

Seeing him take it upon himself, Yang Kai was pleased. He had intended to personally visit the Sword Alliance after handling the Hengluo Commerce Guild matters to negotiate with its master, but with Ai Ou stepping in that would save him effort — Ai Ou surely had full confidence.

"Many thanks then, Elder."

"No need for thanks, we're family," Ai Ou laughed and affectionately slung his arm around Yang Kai's shoulder.

The more he looked at Yang Kai, the more pleased he was; he felt such a son-in-law could not be found even by searching with a lantern.

For the following period Yang Kai unusually had some free time.

Ai Ou, as Chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, was busy leading people to the mining star to extract minerals, while Xue Yue gathered materials to arrange the Space Arrays.

Yang Kai found himself without a single companion.

Instead, the alchemists of the Medicine Master Hall were ever zealous; now and then they came in droves to call themselves his disciples — claiming to visit, but their true intent was well known.

Yang Kai had no choice but to go to the Medicine Master Hall in person, open his platform and lecture on pill refinement; he lectured for five days straight before those shameless alchemists were fully satisfied.

Five days later Xue Yue had everything prepared: all materials to arrange the Space Arrays had been collected, awaiting only Yang Kai to perform the installation.

He did not waste time, and immediately began laying the first Great Space Array as the central hub in the most hidden part of Shuitian City.

In no more than ten days the formation was completed.

Only then did Yang Kai, together with Xue Yue and a large group of martial artists, board a Void King-Grade warship and set off for the nearest Cultivation Star.
