## Chapter 302 — Arrogance and Oppression

Hearing Shan Qingluo's questioning, those people felt a deep sense of dread, cold sweat beading on their foreheads. They thought to themselves, how did we encounter this demoness here? Heaven truly has no eyes!

"I dare not!" Guo Yuanming could not help but swallow hard. "To let you know, we were merely tracking a group of martial artists who intruded into the Holy Land. We did not wish to offend your esteemed presence. I deserve to die a thousand deaths!"

"Oh, is that so..." Shan Qingluo replied lightly, her voice sultry and enchanting. Those present did not find her words charming; instead, they felt pricked by needles, each one drenched in cold sweat, not daring to speak.

Shan Qingluo leisurely raised a delicate finger, gently stroking her own nail, and with an indifferent expression, said, "Since you know you deserve to die a thousand deaths, why are you not acting? Do you want me to send you on your way?"

Guo Yuanming's body trembled violently, and with a thud, he knelt on the ground, banging his head against the earth, a chill washing over him from head to toe.

The few people behind him were equally drenched in cold sweat, large beads of perspiration sliding down from their heads, flowing down their necks into their chests.

Yang Kai stood silently behind Shan Qingluo, his gaze flickering. This was the first time he had witnessed the demoness's methods; she truly exuded an awe-inspiring presence!

So this is the true Enchantress Queen?

Though he did not fully understand the situation before him, Yang Kai guessed that Shan Qingluo had some grievances with the master of these experts, which was why she was bullying them without reason.

Moreover, given that Shan Qingluo's strength had significantly declined, she likely intended to use this preemptive tactic to scare them off.

"Hehe..." Shan Qingluo suddenly giggled, turning to them and saying, "Get up, I was just joking with you. Why take it so seriously? How boring..."

Guo Yuanming dared not move an inch; he would not believe a woman like Shan Qingluo. If he stood up, she might just kill him directly...

He could only repeatedly bow his head in gratitude, saying, "Thank you for your mercy, my lord! Thank you for your mercy!"

With a cold glance in their direction, Shan Qingluo's voice turned icy as she huffed, "Go back and tell your master this: I will discuss the events from a month ago with him sooner or later. Now roll away!"

Only then did Guo Yuanming feel as if he had been granted a reprieve from a nightmare. He hurriedly got up, bowing his head as he retreated, saying, "Rest assured, my lord. I will deliver your message!"

"Within ten breaths, if you do not leave my sight, you will remain here forever!"

Swish, swish, swish...

The six or seven people fled with all their might, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

"Hmph!" Shan Qingluo snorted coldly, turning to leave. 

Yang Kai followed closely behind, greatly admiring the demoness's methods and the authority she had just displayed.

Shan Qingluo grew faster and faster, and after a moment, she soared into the air like the wind.

"Why the rush? Didn't you already scare them off?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled as he chased after her.

"It’s only temporary. Guo Yuanming is cunning and may see through the ruse at any moment. My relationship with the Thunder Beast King isn't that great, and I was injured earlier because he ambushed me. Those people are his subordinates; if they catch me, it will be over!" Shan Qingluo explained hurriedly, her feet never stopping, covering dozens of zhang in an instant.

"Tsk, tsk..." Yang Kai's expression was strange. "You are also an Evil King; how could the Thunder Beast King dare to ambush you? Unless there is a serious conflict of interest, he must be coveting your beauty. The allure of a beautiful woman is indeed powerful!"

"Shut up!" Shan Qingluo shot him a glare, her expression turning icy.

Yang Kai shrugged and fell silent.

...

Guo Yuanming and the others had fled for over ten li before suddenly stopping.

"What’s wrong, Guo brother?" asked a Second Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, looking at him.

Guo Yuanming frowned, glancing back at the direction where Shan Qingluo had been. Seemingly recalling something, he said, "Did you all feel that the demoness was a bit off today?"

"What's off about her?"

"Would she let us go so easily?" Guo Yuanming's suspicion grew stronger. "A month ago, she was ambushed by our lord. Not to mention her past grievances with him, just considering that battle, we surely wouldn’t have met her without consequences today."

"Then why did she let us go?"

Guo Yuanming frowned in thought, hesitating as he said, "I heard that although she wasn't captured in that battle, she was hit by our lord's attack."

"Indeed, I noticed she seemed a bit unstable earlier. Could it be she was severely injured in that battle and has yet to recover?" 

"The power of our lord's techniques is not so easily resolved." Guo Yuanming's eyes brightened. "She must be heavily injured; otherwise, she wouldn't have let us leave so easily! I still remember half a year ago, your brother was killed on the spot just for glancing at that demoness... The Enchantress Queen is ruthless; how could she be so easy to deal with?"

Upon hearing this, Yuan Shi's sinister face flashed with a hint of resentment as he coldly snorted, "If it weren't for the special cultivation method of her lineage, allowing the previous generation's queen to pass down most of her cultivation, how could she possess such strength? A little girl, I would have killed her long ago!"

Guo Yuanming's eyes twinkled as he grinned, "Yuan brother, if you want to avenge your brother, this might be the opportunity!"

The others sensed the implication in his words and couldn't help but shudder.

Targeting the Enchantress Queen was not something just anyone dared to consider.

"Are you all afraid?" Guo Yuanming sneered. "She let us go because she has her concerns. What is she concerned about? Concerned that she can't defeat us!"

Yuan Shi nodded, "What Guo brother says makes sense, but this is merely speculation. What if she isn't injured, or her injuries have already healed?"

"Let’s give it a try!" Guo Yuanming chuckled. "It all depends on whether you all have the guts!"

The others fell silent, exchanging glances, their expressions hesitant. It was undeniable that Guo Yuanming made a lot of sense, but one could never be too careful.

Seeing their wavering expressions, Guo Yuanming seized the opportunity, saying, "Brothers, she is the renowned Enchantress Queen! Don't you want to experience what that feels like? To be with such a woman, even dying would be worth it!"

Imagining Shan Qingluo's delicate figure and sultry voice, recalling her cries of pleasure, their breaths grew heavy.

Guo Yuanming continued, "Moreover, if her lineage can pass down their cultivation, it’s possible they could pass it to us! The strength of a Ninth Stage Divine Roaming Realm! Even if we split it, each of us could at least improve one or two realms!"

Finally, the others' hearts raced with excitement!

Yuan Shi's sinister gaze flickered as he said solemnly, "Guo brother is right; not only can we taste her beauty, but we might also gain her cultivation... It’s indeed worth risking our lives for!"

After careful consideration, the others gritted their teeth and agreed.

Guo Yuanming laughed heartily, "Brothers, you are all so loyal! There’s no time to waste; let’s hurry and catch up!"

...

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo flew through the misty forest, their direction uncertain.

Half a day later, hurried footsteps suddenly echoed behind them.

Shan Qingluo's expression darkened. "It seems we’ve been discovered."

As she spoke, she quickly stopped, taking a deep breath to steady her turbulent Qi. She and Yang Kai stood poised, waiting.

"It’s them!" Yang Kai slightly released his Divine Sense, sensing the number of incoming people, and his expression darkened.

Shan Qingluo's concerns were indeed valid. Although she had frightened off that group with her imposing demeanor, and her words and actions had few flaws, those with a keen mind could still catch onto the subtle clues.

It was like a drop of blood in the ocean; fierce sharks would always be able to smell it.

"My lord!" Moments later, Guo Yuanming and the others suddenly appeared not far away, their expressions tense. However, they were no longer as restrained as before; their eyes exchanged glances filled with deep meaning, daring to secretly appraise Shan Qingluo, with lustful glints occasionally flashing in their eyes.

"What is it?" Shan Qingluo asked coldly, her face expressionless.

"Hehe... Your speed is impressive, my lord. We’ve chased for half a day to catch up!" Guo Yuanming's attitude was evidently more brazen than before, clearly testing the waters. However, he was already about eighty percent certain of his suspicions.

Having separated for just a moment, they had chased for half a day to catch up. If they weren't feeling guilty, why would they run so fast?

"Enough with the nonsense; what is it?" Shan Qingluo's impatience showed as she coldly demanded.

"It’s like this; I forgot to mention something earlier. My lord had instructed that if we encountered you, we should bring a small gift. My lord asks you not to hold the events of a month ago against him!" As he spoke, Guo Yuanming casually tossed an object towards Shan Qingluo.

It was a chess piece, made of a special material, clearly a fine treasure.

At that moment, this treasure had been infused with True Yuan by Guo Yuanming. Though it seemed casually thrown, it was filled with malicious intent.

Shan Qingluo caught it effortlessly, and although she was prepared, she was still shaken by the chess piece, her delicate body trembling, her arm slightly numb.

Seeing this, the others' eyes lit up.

"Guo Yuanming, you are courting death!" Shan Qingluo shouted angrily.

Guo Yuanming laughed heartily, "Oh, my lord, forgive me! I accidentally used a bit too much strength. But with your power, how could you not catch it? Could it be that your strength is... greatly diminished now?"

As he spoke, his voice grew low, his eyes gleaming with lustful light, unabashedly roaming over Shan Qingluo's figure.

Shan Qingluo's expression changed slightly, realizing that the other party had seen through her weakness. She no longer concealed her intentions and laughed lightly, "Indeed, I am greatly diminished, but killing you few scraps is still as easy as pie!"

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes suddenly shimmered with a misty glow, seemingly containing boundless charm, drawing in all their souls, attempting to pull them into her allure.

At the same time, a strange fragrance wafted through the air, intoxicating every man, causing their hearts to race and blood to boil.

Yang Kai's gaze momentarily blurred before he regained his clarity. His True Yuan quickly retreated back into his Dantian, and the Shura Sword appeared in his hand, the Unyielding Will Golden Body's evil energy surging forth.

Wrapped in a mass of black aura, he charged towards Guo Yuanming.
