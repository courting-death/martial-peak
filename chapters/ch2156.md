## Chapter 2156 — Puppet

Flames soared to the sky, ice and snow churned, and when the dust settled, Gong Wenshan stood in place without a single hair out of place. The layer of golden light covering his body showed not the slightest sign of damage.

He looked at Wuchang with mockery and said, "I told you, this restriction is under my control now. Don’t you understand yet? Truly ignorant!"

Wuchang’s expression shifted several times, looking extremely unsightly.

Meanwhile, the martial artists outside who had not yet entered the Time Temple were all shocked by this bizarre scene. On one hand, they admired Gong Wenshan’s courage for daring to offend a monster like Wuchang; on the other, they were stunned by Wuchang’s strength.

If that terrifying strike had hit the crowd, few would have survived.

When two powerhouses clash, bystanders inevitably suffer. So, after regaining their senses, everyone quickly used their movement techniques and rushed through the crack toward the Time Temple.

"If I can’t enter, none of you should even think about it!" Wuchang suddenly shouted, acting out of spite, and unleashed a deadly move.

He reached out with both hands, drawing two Secret Treasures from the void: a saber and a sword, both Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level. The saber’s blade was crimson like fire, the sword’s blade pure white and flawless. With Origin Qi surging, both weapons slashed downward, sending out a cross-shaped burst of energy.

"Ah... dodge quickly!"

"Not good, Wuchang’s gone mad!"

"What... what’s going on!"

Everyone was shocked and hurriedly scattered in all directions.

But Wuchang’s attack came without warning, and with his astonishing strength, even though people tried to dodge, some were still caught head-on by the cross-shaped energy.

Boom—

The ground before the hall was blasted into a huge pit. Blood and broken limbs flew everywhere, and a large number were killed or wounded on the spot. Five or six died instantly, and more than ten were injured.

Yang Kai dodged quickly and was unharmed, but Bian Yuqing and Kou Wu suffered minor injuries. At this moment, their faces were still pale with lingering fear and shock.

Facing all this, Gong Wenshan simply stood calmly in place, neither using the restriction’s power to protect the crowd nor to block Wuchang’s attack. Yet after Wuchang unleashed that strike, Gong Wenshan couldn’t help but grin, looking as if his scheme had succeeded.

"Wuchang, what’s wrong with you! We didn’t provoke you—what’s the meaning of this?"

"That’s right, Wuchang, you’re from a great sect like Tianwu Sacred Land. You should know that grudges have their owners and debts their collectors. It’s not us stopping you from entering, so why cause us trouble?"

"Yeah, Wuchang, don’t go too far. If someone’s stopping you, go after them. Attacking us doesn’t make you a hero!"

Among the martial artists who survived, several began to shout in indignation.

"Enough. You two aren’t going in either." Gong Wenshan suddenly pointed at the two who had just shouted about debts and grudges, speaking indifferently.

The faces of those two immediately fell, looking as ugly as could be.

"Brother Gong, I didn’t mean it that way... Brother Gong, please be magnanimous, don’t hold it against me..."

"Yeah, Eldest Brother Gong, Master Gong, let me in, please."

The two immediately softened and began to beg for mercy.

Gong Wenshan ignored them completely.

"Brother Wuchang..." The martial artist named Jing Li suddenly cupped his fists toward the sky and said, "My Renwu Sect is an affiliated sect of Tianwu Sacred Land. Others may not enter, but I should be fine, right?"

Wuchang said nothing.

Jing Li nodded, "Thank you!"

With that, he charged straight toward the Time Temple. But just as he was about to step through the entrance, Wuchang struck again—a sword light crashed down in front of Jing Li, nearly splitting him in two.

"Brother Wuchang, what’s the meaning of this?" Jing Li, sweating profusely, couldn’t help but look up and ask.

Before Wuchang could answer, his expression suddenly turned cold as he shouted down, "I said, if I can’t enter, none of you should even think about it!"

As he spoke, he crossed his saber and sword again, surged his Origin Qi, and thrust downward.

A terrifying burst of energy slashed out, like a cross-shaped soul-reaping chain cutting through space, targeting a figure rapidly approaching the entrance below.

After unleashing this strike, Wuchang stood calmly in place and said indifferently, "Those who ignore warnings have only death awaiting them!"

Just as he spoke these domineering words, his expression suddenly changed, and he looked down in astonishment.

At the entrance below, Yang Kai had to stop his advance, as Wuchang’s attack was both swift and fierce. If he didn’t stop, he would surely be hit.

With no other choice, he spun around, clenched his fist, activated the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, and wrapped his fist in Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, smashing it fiercely into the void.

Rumble—

The cross-shaped energy burst with dazzling light, colliding with the powerful fist force and scattering through the void.

Using the recoil, Yang Kai leapt and easily slipped into the Time Temple. Before leaving, he didn’t forget to call out to Gong Wenshan, "Thanks!"

Gong Wenshan stared strangely at the spot where Yang Kai disappeared, muttering to himself, "That guy... something’s off about him!"

He clearly sensed that Yang Kai’s cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet he had taken Wuchang’s attack head-on right under his nose and was completely unharmed.

That’s not something an ordinary martial artist could do.

Wuchang was clearly stunned as well.

The moment Yang Kai turned, Wuchang recognized him as the one who had obtained the Diamond-shaped Star Seal. Back then, Yang Kai had used a strange secret technique to dissolve a fatal blow from both Wuchang and Luo Yuan.

That secret technique was incredibly mysterious and unfathomable, and Wuchang hadn’t seen clearly what it was.

But now, this guy had actually taken his attack head-on...

Playing the pig to eat the tiger? The thought surfaced in Wuchang’s mind involuntarily.

And in that instant of distraction, the martial artists below had already rushed toward the entrance at great speed. In the blink of an eye, more than half had disappeared. By the time Wuchang reacted and tried to stop them, it was already too late.

He could only watch as everyone poured into the Time Temple, leaving only himself and the two martial artists Gong Wenshan had excluded.

"Wuchang... Wuchang..." Gong Wenshan chuckled, repeating Wuchang’s name, his eyes full of mockery and ridicule. "Now that they’ve all gone in, what will you do?"

Wuchang said nothing, only stared coldly at Gong Wenshan.

"Trying to threaten me with your eyes?" Gong Wenshan grinned. "You should know what the price of threatening me is! It’s fine for young people to be hot-blooded, but if you’re too arrogant..."

He spoke with the tone of someone who’d been through it all, looking completely at ease. Before he could finish, Wuchang turned around and strode away, disappearing from sight in a few steps.

"...Not giving me a chance to show off at all. Decisive enough, to actually give up such a great opportunity. But then again... staying here doesn’t seem to mean much either." Gong Wenshan laughed at himself, then turned and walked into the Time Temple as well.

Just as he said, there was no point in Wuchang staying. Gong Wenshan would never let him in, and rather than stay and be humiliated by Gong Wenshan’s smug retaliation, it was better to leave and seek his own fortune.

Of course, this grudge was now set. If the two met again, Wuchang would surely not let Gong Wenshan off.

"Master Gong... come back, come back!"

"Brother Gong, don’t ignore us! There are still people here!"

The two martial artists excluded by Gong Wenshan shouted anxiously, but got no response. After waiting outside the hall for a long time, they could only leave in frustration.

...

"What’s going on?" As soon as Yang Kai entered the Time Temple, he was stunned by the scene before him.

This was a vast hall, covering at least several mu. In front of him, those who had entered first—Xiao Chen, Lan Xun, Luo Yuan, Xiao Baiyi, and Murong Xiaoxiao—were surrounded by countless puppets, fighting desperately. The ground was littered with metal fragments and puppet parts, showing that many had already been destroyed before Yang Kai arrived.

Yang Kai had seen puppets like these before on Dark Star, where a family specialized in puppet arts and could create lifelike, realistic puppets.

The Star Realm naturally had puppets as well, but Yang Kai had never encountered them until now.

He hadn’t expected there to be so many puppets in the Time Temple.

These puppets came in various forms, but could generally be divided into three types. The first were humanoid, all towering and imposing, wielding different weapons and exuding an overwhelming presence. The second were beast-shaped—tigers, leopards, wolves, even snakes, insects, ants, and butterflies—of all kinds, dazzling to behold. These demonic beast-like puppets often used techniques similar to real demonic beasts and were quite lethal. The third type was hard to categorize, with bizarre appearances that made it impossible to tell what they were modeled after. These were the fewest in number, but seemed to be the strongest.

There were at least a hundred puppets in the grand hall, each exuding the spiritual pressure of the Dao Origin Realm. Even with talents like Xiao Chen and the rest, two fists could not match four hands. By the time Yang Kai entered, everyone was pinned on the defensive, unable to spare even a moment to counterattack.

"If only I’d waited outside a bit longer!" Yang Kai was filled with regret. He’d been afraid someone else would seize the opportunity in the Time Temple, so he’d rushed in, only to run into this mess. If he’d known, he would have waited for the others to finish off the puppets before coming in.

"Junior Brother Yang, be careful! These puppets are tough to deal with!" Murong Xiaoxiao’s voice suddenly reached his ears, clearly a warning given out of concern as she noticed Yang Kai entering amid the chaos.

"I’d love to thank you for your concern, but... you just exposed me!" Yang Kai smiled bitterly to himself. Sure enough, as soon as Murong Xiaoxiao finished speaking, a puppet closest to him suddenly turned, its eyes glowing with a strange red light, locking onto Yang Kai.
