## Chapter 347 — Chimeras and Demons

The old man in a green robe quickly dashed into the depths of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, dragging Yang Kai along, with the other three following closely behind.

The old man in a green robe looked back with a smile, his eyes filled with interest. Suddenly, he flicked his hand, sending two emerald rays of light flying back like spirits emerging from the cave.

Before the cries of the Hu sisters had dissipated, their delicate bodies were struck by the emerald beams.

Immediately, the two sisters turned a sickly green, leaving them stunned. They hurriedly checked themselves, only to find they had not sustained any injuries, and their True Yuan circulated without any hindrance.

However, Leng Shan's expression changed drastically as she exclaimed, “Clinging Bone Shadow!”

The members of Ghost King Valley looked at the Hu sisters with eyes brimming with sympathy.

“What does this mean? What is happening?” Hu Jiao’er asked in a deep voice.

Leng Shan’s face was extremely grim, worry etched on her features. After a moment of hesitation, she explained, “Chimeras and demons; one of them wears a green robe and has a penchant for women. You may have caught his attention. The Clinging Bone Shadow is his unique technique. Once hit, he can sense your location at all times and can affect your mind, rendering you helpless and obedient.”

The faces of the Hu sisters drained of color.

“Moreover, the color on you both is a mark of this technique. Once you go outside, anyone who sees this color will know you are afflicted by the Clinging Bone Shadow.” After a pause, Leng Shan continued, “Right now he’s going inside to investigate. He has his hands full, which is why he left the Clinging Bone Shadow on you. Once he’s done inside, he’ll definitely come looking for you.”

“Even if he doesn't go himself, someone will capture you and deliver you to him to gain his favor. You’re in big trouble!” Shen Yi’s expression was also grave.

“Is there any way to break this?” Hu Jiao’er’s face was cold as she asked.

“Even someone at the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm might not be able to break it. Unless he’s killed, or you find someone of greater strength!” Leng Shan bit her lip.

Hearing this, the hearts of the Hu sisters sank.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, was unaware of the Hu sisters’ situation. However, he clearly saw the two green beams shot by the old man in a green robe and the lascivious light in his eyes.

Yang Kai’s gaze turned icy.

The other three seemed to have grown accustomed to this little act by the old man in a green robe; their expressions remained unchanged, let alone discussing it.

The group flew steadily deeper into the cave.

The speed of experts in the Divine Roaming Realm was incredibly fast, and though it took Yang Kai and the others a long time to reach the entrance of the cave, they were soon brought back.

Once returned to the vicinity of the two high platforms, the chimeras and demons squinted their eyes, looking ahead with solemn expressions.

At that moment, the Corrupted Fountain Water had completely receded, and where the Evil Spirit Spring Source had been, a pitch-black cocoon-like object had emerged.

On the cocoon, intricate patterns resembling human blood vessels crisscrossed, flowing with an inexplicable massive energy.

The entire cocoon was about four or five zhang in height. It was colossal, emanating a chilling and sinister aura, with tentacle-like strands of demonic energy appearing to drift and swirl around it, creating a terrifying sight.

Thump, thump…

Inside the cocoon came the strong beating sounds of what seemed like a heart, and with each beat, a ripple of power capable of affecting the heart and Divine Sense swept through the area where the chimeras, demons, and Yang Kai were located.

The old man in the green robe’s facial expression slightly shifted; he executed several hand seals and waved his hand in front to block the incoming attack.

“What is this?” The old man in the yellow robe asked, his expression extremely grave, staring intently at the large cocoon, his face filled with confusion.

These few individuals, possessing profound strength and considerable age, had extensive knowledge. Although they felt the immense pressure emanating from the large cocoon and knew the item inside was certainly not to be trifled with, none could identify what it was.

Such dense demonic energy made it seem almost palpable to the naked eye.

Throughout their lives, they had only seen this once before.

It was from the recently emerged Evil Lord!

Months ago, the four had accompanied the Yinming Ghost King to meet the Evil Lord, where they had the fortunate experience of witnessing the Evil Lord's prowess.

The evil of the Evil Lord had surpassed the realm of mere evil; the Yinming Ghost King had said it was true demonic energy!

All evil was but child's play before true demonic energy.

“Kid, I’ll ask you one last time, do you know what happened here? If you dare say you don’t, I’ll confine you here, leaving you to fend for yourself. If you tell me, I’ll let you go free,” the old man in the green robe said, releasing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression was calm as he glanced at him before furrowing his brows and saying, “This is what was contained within the Evil Spirit Spring Source.”

“The Evil Spirit Spring Source?” The chimeras and demons changed their expressions dramatically, and the voice of the old man in the green robe rose several notches.

The words “Evil Spirit Spring Source” undoubtedly held a considerable allure for them.

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded, not concealing anything, and briefly recounted what had happened earlier.

The four elders grew increasingly agitated, their eyes shining brightly, and the original apprehension about the large cocoon was gradually replaced by greed, each of them gazing at the cocoon with glistening eyes.

Once Yang Kai finished speaking, their breaths had undoubtedly become somewhat disordered.

“What should we do?” The other three looked at the old man in the green robe, nervous yet expectant, awaiting his decision.

The old man in the green robe’s heart was also turbulent; the Evil Spirit Spring Source rarely appeared, but each time it did, it brought forth precious items sought after desperately by many experts in the Divine Roaming Realm.

But this time, the Evil Spirit Spring Source had birthed something so extraordinary it was beyond their comprehension.

The old man in the green robe was unsure whether to gamble his life and fortune here.

“We are close to breaking through to the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, but we haven’t found a suitable energy source. If we miss this chance, who knows when the next will come,” the old man in the purple robe appeared eager to take a risk, excitement in his demeanor.

“Indeed,” the old man in the green robe and the old man in the yellow robe nodded in agreement, recognizing the validity of his words.

With three of them inclined toward this intention, the old man in the green robe found it hard to make a unilateral decision. Moreover, he himself was also leaning toward taking a gamble, albeit with some trepidation in his heart.

After a moment of silence, a flash of determination lit up the old man in the green robe’s eyes, and he firmly said, “Let’s do it!”

As he spoke, he casually tossed Yang Kai away, sending him flying about a hundred zhang or so.

Before landing, Yang Kai felt a violent force suddenly erupt within him, filled with various ominous and venomous sensations; his True Yang Yuan Qi attempted to counteract this force but was unable to neutralize it.

With a crack, several bones shattered, and in mid-air, Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood. As he landed, he lay immobile, his complexion pale as a sheet.

The old man in the green robe's wicked laughter echoed, “Hehe, I keep my word and let you go free!”

Yang Kai glared at him with deep animosity, hatred and coldness filling his eyes.

The old man in the green robe had not truly let him go; had it not been for the purity and potency of his True Yang Yuan Qi, that earlier sneak attack would have crushed Yang Kai's Dantian, rendering him utterly powerless and turning him into an ordinary person.

An ordinary person with no strength remaining here would only meet a dead end.

Luckily, they were now far enough away that the old man in the green robe did not know Yang Kai had not been incapacitated. If he knew, with that old bastard's treacherous nature, he would likely strike to kill immediately.

Not daring to slow down for even a moment, Yang Kai quickly supported himself, crossing his legs to meditate and recuperate, while he took out a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye and put it into his mouth to dissolve the drug's effects.

Before long, fierce sounds of battle echoed from over there.

The chimeras and demons, powerful as they were, combined their strengths and were virtually unbeatable within the Divine Roaming Realm. They fiercely attacked the large cocoon.

A roar erupted from within the cocoon, as if something had broken free from its restraints.

Then came the terrified yet excited voice of the old man in the green robe: “It really is true demonic energy, a Demonic Spirit!”

With that shout, the battle intensified. It seemed the creature inside the large cocoon had been forcibly expelled and was now engaged in a fierce struggle against them.

For a time, the entire Bloodthirsty Evil Cave was filled with ominous winds and surging demonic energy, the already dimly lit underground cavern plunged further into darkness, as if they had descended into the underworld.

Yang Kai remained focused, tending to his wounds.

Yet drawn by the rolling demonic energy, Yang Kai could distinctly feel something within him, pulsing incessantly, along with his True Yuan roiling.

Taken aback, Yang Kai hurriedly probed, and after understanding what it was that the demonic energy had stirred, his expression turned peculiar.

After deep contemplation, Yang Kai slowly divided his attention, keeping an eye on the situation over there.

The battle scene was exceptionally intense; although Yang Kai could not see what was happening, from the sounds coming from the chimeras and demons, it was evident that even having rushed the Demonic Spirit out before it had fully matured, the four of them were not gaining any advantage and were instead being steadily pushed back.

The strength of the Demonic Spirit exceeded their expectations.

However, even when the masters sensed something was amiss, they could not withdraw easily, only gritting their teeth and pressing on, each striving to exert their full capabilities.

As time passed, Yang Kai's injuries rapidly healed.

Suddenly, a thunderous roar came from that side, as if the Demonic Spirit had suffered a major setback; simultaneously, the chimeras and demons screamed in shock, two of their voices cutting off abruptly, indicating a short, frantic gasp.

Dead!

Yang Kai's eyes brightened, joy swelling within him.

“Retreat!” The old man in the green robe's voice called out, revealing panic and weariness.

Following this, two figures clothed in flowing garments could be heard swiftly fleeing, clearly those still alive.

The Demonic Spirit did not pursue them, remaining in place, emitting a reluctant roar.

Yang Kai sprang to his feet, his eyes alight with sharp brilliance, his emotions stirring.

The thing inside him continued to throb more violently than before, seeming to urge him on.

With just a moment's hesitation, Yang Kai took his strides toward the direction of the Demonic Spirit.
