## Chapter 448 — He Won

At Yang Zhao’s command, numerous powerful warriors surged toward the gathering place of the disciples from Yao Wang Valley.

The people in Yao Wang Valley were unparalleled in alchemy skills, yet their own cultivation was mediocre at best. To these formidable fighters, they were nothing more than lambs awaiting capture.

Without employing any overly strong techniques, many Divine Roaming Realm masters simply flew straight toward them in broad daylight. Stretching out massive hands midair, they casually grabbed at the alchemists.

Qin Ze stood motionless, expression cold and indifferent, seemingly unconcerned whether any of the valley’s disciples would be seized. The thirty alchemists dressed in white also remained astonishingly calm and composed, unaffected by the sudden assault.

Yang Zhao suddenly sensed no unease at all.

Normally, even the proudest alchemist would exhibit some instinctive panic when faced with danger—but these people showed no such sign.

Why?

Just as the attackers were about to close in on the alchemists, the gem that adorned Xia Ningshang’s forehead suddenly burst forth with dazzling radiance. Immediately, a faint blue light veil spread in a semicircle, enveloping all the disciples of Yao Wang Valley.

The numerous strong warriors crashed headlong into this First Stage light veil, each feeling an incredible elasticity that forced them back in unison, frowning and assessing.

“As expected, there is a defense!” Yang Zhao had long known Yao Wang Valley’s people would not be easily subdued. Seeing this light veil, he showed no great surprise, only growing more resolute. He waved his hand, commanding, “Break it!”

If these people merely hoped to hold back the attackers with a high-grade defensive treasure, they had clearly miscalculated.

The treasure was indeed formidable. Yet these martial artists were no fools.

The brilliance of the martial skills and the treasure flared again. Xia Ningshang’s light veil soon appeared on the verge of collapse.

Yet not a single disciple from Yao Wang Valley showed panic.

Yang Zhao’s gaze deepened as he fixed on the group, a growing sense of unease pressing down on him. Suddenly, he felt an impulse to flee immediately.

Just as a crack formed in the light veil and it seemed about to shatter, the air above twinkled with countless star-like points. Among the starlight, numerous light spheres flew out at unfathomable speeds, transforming into razor-sharp weapons.

These weapons, purely composed of True Yuan, gleamed brilliantly, radiating powerful fluctuations.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The weapons were hurled with tremendous force. Piercing whooshes filled the air as starlight dazzled all eyes.

Like the sharpest knives imaginable, they swept forward, cleaving through metal and stone, unstoppable.

Everyone’s expression suddenly changed, and they hurriedly dodged aside to avoid the attacks emanating such overwhelming energy waves.

Boom, boom, boom...

One by one, the True Yuan weapons were blocked by the defenders, but the unleashed power forced all to retreat further. Those at the lower levels of the Divine Roaming Realm coughed up blood on the spot, faces pale as death.

Only those above the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm remained completely unharmed.

Yang Zhao’s gaze immediately locked onto the sole elder among the Yao Wang Valley disciples.

That old man gave no indication of his origin or intention and had not acted, yet Yang Zhao instinctively stared at him, sensing that the strike had come from this harmless-looking individual.

A single move—without even full exertion—sent seven or eight Divine Roaming Realm practitioners reeling back. How incredibly strong must this old man be?

Could he perhaps be beyond the Divine Roaming Realm? It was unthinkable that Yao Wang Valley had such an expert.

The stunned attackers exchanged fearful glances, utterly clueless as to their assailant’s identity.

Doubt and suspicion filled their hearts.

The twinkling stars above rapidly converged into a tiny stellar ring no larger than a baby’s palm, which the masked woman collected in her hand.

“A treasure!” Yang Zhao’s eyes trembled in disbelief as he witnessed the transformation.

He had assumed a peerless expert hid among Yao Wang Valley’s ranks, yet that strike was in fact the effect of a treasure.

It must be at least a Middle-Level Mystery-Grade treasure to wield such potent power!

Looking again at the masked woman, Yang Zhao felt a wave of defeat wash over him.

As the second eldest of the Yang Family, he had no such foundation. What was this woman’s background?

The two treasures she had unleashed were extraordinary. Who knew how many more she possessed?

Yang Zhao’s eyes flickered with hesitation and struggle. After a long moment, he gritted his teeth and said to the Blood Servants and Ye Xinrou following him, “Let’s go!”

“Go?” Ye Xinrou had been observing Xia Ningshang, comparing herself with her but seeing no clues. Hearing this, she was momentarily stunned.

By the time she reacted, Yang Zhao had silently slipped away with the Blood Servants.

Ye Xinrou hurried after him, her face filled with confusion. “Second Young Master, why give up so easily? This is not like you.”

Before Yang Zhao could answer, someone suddenly appeared ahead, speaking urgently, “Second Young Master, there’s a commotion at Yang Kai’s manor. Nine troops have fully mobilized. It seems only Qu Gaoyi remains to guard the central hall.”

“I know.” Yang Zhao quickened his pace, a bitter smile and resentment flashing across his face. “Ninth Brother really has guts—he left only one Blood Servant to defend the manor. He’s won!”

Ye Xinrou’s expression paled, finally understanding why Yang Zhao left so decisively. It was not surrender but necessity. Even with the combined strength of the four brothers, Yang Kai could not protect all the alchemists.

If the fight dragged on, the entire group in Yao Wang Valley would be captured.

But that would take time. Where would those nine troops go during that time?

If they headed to Yang Zhao’s manor, could its defenders hold the command flag?

To save a friend in battle, Yang Kai could easily resolve the immediate crisis. Yang Zhao had to leave. Not only him, but Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying also needed to swiftly return for defense.

None could be certain if those nine troops might seize the opportunity to pay a visit to their manor in their absence.

One must never underestimate the strength of those nine troops.

Moreover, the masked woman possessed a Middle-Level Mystery-Grade treasure. Her identity was undoubtedly extraordinary. Yang Zhao dared not provoke her until that was clear.

Almost at the same time Yang Zhao received this news, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying also got intelligence from their subordinates. They all snorted lowly, casting wary glances toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled slyly and proudly at them.

“Where is Second Brother?” Yang Kang’s gaze swept around but found no sign of Yang Zhao. He froze briefly, then his face darkened coldly, feeling abandoned by Second Brother. A wave of frustration welled up within.

“Ninth Brother, you’re formidable. Today’s matter ends here. Next time, Fifth Brother will teach you a lesson!” Yang Kang snorted coldly, waving his hand as he rushed his men away.

“Ninth Brother, I concede!” Yang Shen also frowned, abruptly retreating as well.

In the next moment, Yang Ying’s forces scattered like birds and beasts. Instantly, the original battle calmed, leaving onlookers bewildered. None understood why the Yang Family’s four brothers, holding absolute advantage, chose to withdraw.

Not only they were confused; neither did Yao Wang Valley’s people comprehend. Only Meng Wuya looked on thoughtfully, meeting Yang Kai’s eyes and noticing how much the young man had grown these recent years—both in wisdom and strength, making a leap forward.

Yang Kai did not stop his brothers from leaving. He brought few people. Fighting seriously would benefit no one. Meng Wuya had no intention of intervening either, so Yang Kai also refrained from provoking trouble, letting them leave freely.

“You have all been startled.” Yang Kai walked gravely before the Yao Wang Valley people, cupping his fists respectfully.

“No matter.” Qin Ze waved his hand. “No disciples have been harmed.”

Yang Kai nodded and then turned his gaze to Xia Ningshang with serene composure and an astonishing declaration: “Little Senior Sister, I missed you.”

His words were sincere and spontaneous, as if simply voicing what was in his heart.

Xia Ningshang stared in a daze, her watery eyes immediately replaced by delight and bashfulness. She dared not reply, her long lashes fluttering unceasingly.

“Hey, don’t flirt with my disciple in front of me, that’s not right,” Meng Wuya’s forehead veins throbbed angrily, dissatisfied though he knew Yang Kai’s future was boundless. Seeing his cherished disciple’s attitude toward Yang Kai, he felt a deep frustration.

“Cousin, did you miss me?” Dong Qingyan jumped out, teasingly asking.

“No.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Dong Qingyan instantly pouted, glaring at him bitterly, murmuring, “Stinky cousin, lousy cousin, I hate you so much.”

Yang Kai remained unfazed, smiling warmly at everyone. “Let’s return to my manor first.”

With the four elder brothers rushing to defend, Yang Kai also needed to quickly return. At the manor, only Qu Gaoyi remained; any carelessness would be fatal.

These people of Yao Wang Valley had come with Xia Ningshang to join Yang Kai, naturally agreeing to follow his lead. The group surged back in high spirits.

Watching Xia Ningshang and Yang Kai flying ahead, laughing and chatting closely, Lan Chudie let out a bitter smile.

She seemed to have once had the chance to build a close relationship with this junior brother.

But at that time, she had failed to seize it. When he was most vulnerable, she chose to abandon him.

When she turned back, the opportunity was gone.

After leaving Lingxiao Pavilion and joining the Dong Family, Lan Chudie no longer thought of Lingxiao Pavilion. But as news of the Yang Family’s succession war spread, she heard Yang Kai’s name once more.

Only then did she understand that what she had cast aside back then was a precious piece of jade — yet laughably, at the time, she had thought it nothing more than a grain of dust.

“Miss Lan,” Dong Qinghan spoke low beside her, “my cousin may be young, but these past years have let him see the depths of life. With his origin and strength, he is somewhat forceful and quite vengeful. However, if your sincerity is sufficient, I believe you can move him. After all, he is only human.”
