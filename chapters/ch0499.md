## Chapter 499 — Just How Old Are You?

That night, at Yang Kai’s residence!

Torches burned everywhere, illuminating the entire estate brightly. The moon was clear in the sky, and stars were few and far between. The night in War City was eerily quiet.

“Are you here?” Yang Kai, who was sitting in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes. They gleamed in the darkness, and a playful smile curled at the corner of his mouth.

The Earth Demon standing guard beside him chuckled in a sinister manner, adding an air of grim eeriness to the peaceful night.

“Since you’re here, why not show yourself openly?” Yang Kai called out loudly.

Suddenly, the door was flung open. Yang Kai’s gaze sharpened as he looked toward the entrance. Under the brilliant moonlight was a nearly transparent figure standing at the doorway, clear as flowing water even by daylight. The person stepped inside and came to a stop about ten zhang away from Yang Kai.

The Earth Demon quietly flexed its power, while Ying Jiu, hidden in the darkness, focused all his attention on this mysterious expert, unwilling to let down his guard even for a moment.

“Cowardly as a mouse!” A disdainful voice rang from the nearly transparent figure’s location. It was the same crisp, melodious, youthful female voice, clearly looking down on Yang Kai for having two powerful bodyguards upon their meeting.

“Show your true face!” Yang Kai replied indifferently.

“Vermin like you have no right to see this lady!” The woman snorted coldly, then added, “Unless you command these two beside you to leave!”

Yang Kai chuckled teasingly, playing with the small doll made from light blue hair that he held in his hand, remaining silent.

It was obvious the woman’s gaze was locked onto the small doll. Her beautiful eyes seemed filled with apprehension and anger, as if she longed to seize and destroy the doll immediately.

After a while, Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Young Master!” The Earth Demon’s expression shifted slightly, calling out in a low voice.

“No matter,” Yang Kai shook his head.

The Earth Demon frowned but nodded. “Then old servant and Ying Jiu will stay outside the door. If you need anything, just call!”

After speaking, he stepped outside. Passing by the mysterious woman, the Earth Demon let out a strange chuckle, warning, “Don’t provoke my Young Master, or you’ll never have good days ahead.”

The mysterious woman sneered.

Once the Earth Demon and Ying Jiu had exited, the woman relaxed somewhat; having two experts guarding inside clearly made her nervous.

Yang Kai noticed her subtle change. He smiled lightly. “It seems you’re not very formidable.”

Her wariness of Ying Jiu and the Earth Demon clearly proved she wasn’t a top-tier expert.

“I only need to be stronger than you.” The woman snorted coldly, showing no sign of weakness.

Yang Kai frowned. This woman actually dared to spar verbally with him; her temperament clearly immature. Just how old was she? That question piqued Yang Kai’s curiosity.

“Now you have your wish, my two men have stepped outside. Reveal your true face!”

The woman giggled coquettishly. Her nearly transparent body flickered like a shimmering stream. She suppressed her laughter, speaking sweetly, “You just want to see me that badly?”

“Indeed.” Yang Kai slowly rose and took measured steps toward her.

The mysterious woman’s aura suddenly stiffened. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so brazen, approaching her recklessly without any disciples or guards.

As he came closer, the woman, who had been confident before, involuntarily developed a sense of crisis.

She shook her head slowly to dispel the unease, then her aura shifted to something dangerous and cold. “I’ll give you one last chance: hand over what you have.”

“What if I refuse?”

“Those who anger this lady never have a good fate!” The woman shouted coldly. Suddenly, her supple figure exploded into mist, the water vapor quickly filling the room. Within the mist, strange energies drifted around from all directions, swirling toward Yang Kai to envelop him.

Sensing the commotion inside, Ying Jiu at the door moved to charge in, but the Earth Demon grabbed him sharply.

The Earth Demon slowly shook his head, calmly saying, “The Young Master will be fine.”

“If anything happens to him, you’ll die!” Ying Jiu said coldly.

The Earth Demon chuckled darkly. “My loyalty is no less than yours. Rest assured, that woman is in for trouble. Daring to provoke the Young Master, she’s doomed.”

Just then, a sharp, chilling scream echoed from within—the woman’s voice—full of gruesome torment.

Among it was the low, lecherous sinister laughter of Yang Kai.

Ying Jiu’s expression grew strange. He involuntarily pictured a burly, brutish bully torturing a delicate, helpless girl.

For a moment, his blood boiled.

Inside, Yang Kai stood his ground, twiddling the doll between his fingers. Each snap caused the woman’s scream to grow more agonizing.

After a while, a figure appeared before his eyes in the dense mist. The form was hard to discern clearly, but in the throes of pain, the woman curled on the floor like a quail in winter, trembling violently. Her long, light blue hair spilled about her like a waterfall, making her appear delicate and helpless, evoking pity.

Yang Kai remained unmoved. A warm True Yang Yuan Qi radiated from him, instantly evaporating all the mist in the room. Only then did he leisurely approach the woman, looking down on her from above.

His gaze wandered over the light blue hair, clear and tranquil like a pure lake, causing him to marvel quietly.

It was the first time he had seen such hair—soft, flowing, exquisite. Anyone would be captivated upon their first encounter.

The mysterious woman was petite. Her long hair even covered half of her hips. Her legs bent, her hands covering her forehead, lying motionless, only heavy, labored breaths filling the room.

Through her fingers and strands of hair, Yang Kai caught the bright, hate-filled gaze directed at him. Though she looked pitiful and battered, she was definitely adopting a perfect defensive stance.

If Yang Kai moved another step closer, she could launch a thunderous counterattack.

He smiled faintly and halted.

The beautiful eyes beneath her fingers suddenly displayed disappointment.

“Get up!” Yang Kai said, his head held high, his tone indifferent.

The woman shook her head slowly, firmly refusing.

“Cut the act of being assaulted; I have no interest in old women!” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

“Who are you calling an old woman?” The woman, as if having her tail stepped on, jumped up angrily. Her eyes blazed at Yang Kai, teeth clenched. Her ample chest heaved, and her flowing blue hair swirled about, concealing her shapely hips.

After speaking, realizing Yang Kai’s triumphant smile, the woman understood she had fallen into a trap. She pouted, sulking.

Yang Kai’s gaze grew strange, staring intently at her with suspicion.

He noticed her face was as youthful as her voice.

Time seemed to have left no significant marks upon her.

No matter how well a woman cared for her appearance, one could not completely fool time’s passage—unless some rare heaven-and-earth treasure had been consumed.

Like Dong Suzhu and Tang Yuxian, both of whom appeared young and were even mistaken by many as Fourth Master Yang’s daughters, careful observation still revealed they were no longer girls.

But this woman was different. Yang Kai believed either she had taken some anti-aging treasure, or she truly was a maiden just stepping into her twenties.

And her cultivation level… Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept over her and was moved.

Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage!

This was the first time Yang Kai had a clear grasp of her cultivation. In previous encounters, Divine Sense could not detect her level at all. Not even Meng Wuya could penetrate the mysterious power cloaking her.

“What exactly do you want?” The woman’s delicate face twitched under Yang Kai’s aggressive gaze, shrinking back slightly.

“I want to ask you, what exactly do you want?” Yang Kai fixed his eyes on her.

“What did I do? Why are you torturing me like this?” The woman suddenly turned plaintive, tears welling in her beautiful eyes.

She had never suffered like this before. This ghostlike man held a doll made of her own hair, using it to control her life and death!

“I just came here to find someone and haven’t done anything wrong, so why are you treating me like this?” The woman grew emotional.

“Who are you looking for?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I won’t tell you!”

“How old are you, really?” Yang Kai suddenly felt a headache coming. Based on her strength, she could not be as young as she looked. But judging by her tone, demeanor, and temperament, she seemed genuinely like a young girl.

Was there truly such a powerful young girl in the world? Even Su Yan at this moment was only probably at the Second or Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

“That’s a secret. A woman’s age is her greatest secret.” She pouted her rosy lips, seeming to think Yang Kai wasn’t as cruel as he seemed, visibly relaxing.

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai suddenly called outside.

The Earth Demon responded promptly, “Old servant here.”

“Imprison this woman’s True Essence, strip her naked, and bind her outside the estate!”

“Yes!” The Earth Demon replied swiftly, without hesitation.

The woman went pale in an instant, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. She had never imagined this man could be so cruel and shameless.

Her mind filled with the image of being stripped and bound outside, sending a chill down her spine, her whole body trembling.

Just as the Earth Demon grinned viciously and reached for her, she disappeared without a trace, her aura vanishing as well.

“Think you can run?” Yang Kai sneered, snapping his fingers on the doll again.

A miserable cry followed, and the woman who had vanished reappeared at the door, landing face-first on the ground, motionless and miserable.
