## Chapter 1359 — Advantage of Proximity?

Hearing that, Du Sisi looked at Cai He with gratitude.

If not for Cai He's sharp eyes and swift hands pulling her back, she would have gone through that white Spatial Array Gate with Ning Xiangchen and the others; at her cultivation level, going there would almost certainly have ended in disaster.

Although Lian Guang had returned safely, that was only because he was skilled in controlling puppets—at critical moments, he could have them take the brunt of a fatal blow for him. Du Sisi, however, possessed no such ability.

Although they had also encountered a puppet on the black side of the Spatial Array Gate, it had been a narrow escape rather than a true disaster—and in the end, they had only gone through a single battle.

After fighting several great battles, Fei Zhi Tu and the others entered an unnaturally cold chamber, where they found an ice crystal jade coffin; faintly, they could make out someone lying inside, but before they could confirm who it was they accidentally triggered the ward.

What followed is clear to Yang Kai and the others: the Imperial Garden's laws of heaven and earth activated and expelled everyone, teleporting them tens of thousands of li away from the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

It now seems that the jade coffin was the root cause of this anomaly; Fei Zhi Tu and the others tripped the ward near the coffin, which expelled them, and then the Imperial Garden suddenly manifested.

As for who lay inside that coffin, Ning Xiangchen couldn't say for certain—only that the occupant appeared to be a woman.

Hearing this, Yang Kai's brow lifted and he fell into thought.

He had twice been expelled by the laws and both times had seen a delicate jade palm—an evidently female palm—and the ice crystal jade coffin in the Imperial Garden also contained a woman bereft of life; whether these were related, Yang Kai had no idea.

Nor did he understand what connection there could be between the Flowing Flame Sandland and the Imperial Garden; it left him baffled.

Unable to figure it out, Yang Kai shook his head inwardly.

Moreover, many things about Dark Star seemed uncanny: there were no Void King Realm experts here, and even the highest ranks of alchemists and artificers were only Origin-Grade Lower-Level—apparently suppressed by some force that kept those at a bottleneck from breaking through. Yang Kai felt, faintly, that this star was not simple.

After a safe journey of only a few days, the party returned to the vicinity of Tianyun City; Cai He, Du Sisi, and Lian Guang all took their leave, while Ning Xiangchen chatted a few pleasant words with Yang Kai before departing.

Knowing what he was thinking, and having been considerate to him on the trip, Yang Kai did not hold back—he told Ning Xiangchen that he was welcome to visit Dragon Lair Mountain when he had time, and if he needed any repairs to Secret Treasures he should simply ask.

Having received that promise, Ning Xiangchen's face lit with joy and gratitude; he left in haste, apparently to prepare, for repairing Secret Treasures required gathering materials, and he could not expect Yang Kai to provide everything.

Standing outside Tianyun City, Yang Kai lifted his head to study the sky.

At this moment the Imperial Garden seemed to have stabilized, hovering at some point above Dark Star; its size appeared unchanged, yet the Imperial Might it possessed had vanished—clearly because it hung too far from the surface.

He didn't know exactly how Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong's investigations were going, but Yang Kai expected the major factions on Dark Star would be restless for a long time to come.

After all, the Imperial Garden's appearance was a momentous event; every faction would covet a share, and friction and conflict were inevitable.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai's expression suddenly darkened into one of displeasure.

He hadn't paid much attention before, but now, observing the Imperial Garden again, he saw to his astonishment that it hovered directly above Tianyun City—indeed, directly above Dragon Lair Mountain.

This...

Yang Kai nearly couldn’t hold back from cursing aloud. With the Imperial Garden anchored here, Dragon Lair Mountain might indeed benefit from being close to the source—but it would also undoubtedly attract unwanted trouble. Experts from all the great forces across Dark Star were bound to come and investigate. They might not dare provoke Yingyue Hall, but Dragon Lair Mountain was another matter entirely. Even with Qian Tong’s protection, there was no way things would remain peaceful.

His face overcast, Yang Kai pondered for a moment, stamped his foot, and in a flash flew toward Dragon Lair Mountain.

Worrying about this now was pointless—he had no way to move the Imperial Garden—so the priority was to strengthen Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses, lest a mixed crowd bring trouble and petty scoundrels take notice.

Muttering curses at the Starry Sky Emperor under his breath, Yang Kai sped back.

Before long he arrived at the mountain's protective formation, withdrew the token Yang Yan had given him, poured Saint Yuan into it, and the next moment a stream of light shot from the token into the formation.

The previously hazy front suddenly opened into a straight passage; Yang Kai's face indifferent, he pocketed the token and stepped inside. Once he entered, the passage vanished, and Dragon Lair Mountain was once more shrouded in cloud and mist, its reality indistinguishable from outside.

No sooner had he entered than several figures flew to meet him; upon recognizing Yang Kai they all brightened and greeted him with clasped fists.

Yang Kai couldn't recall their names, only that they had been disciples of the Haike Family who, following Wu Yi's departure from the clan and her joining Dragon Lair Mountain, had come here with uneven strength and low realms.

But with the mountain's astonishing wealth to support them, each had made great cultivation gains; the leader had reached the Saint King Realm and the rest were all at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Such cultivation might be nothing on the open market, but it was not something the small Haike Family could have produced in so short a time.

"Sect Master, you're finally back," the Saint King Realm leader cried in delight, though a trace of anxiety lingered on his face.

Yang Kai knitted his brow and asked in surprise, "What do you mean, ‘Sect Master'?"

The leader chuckled and said, “The young lady told us that from now on, whenever we see you, we should address you as Sect Master. She said since you’ll be founding your own sect sooner or later anyway, it doesn’t hurt to start calling you that early.”

Yang Kai was speechless.

He did indeed intend to found a sect, not to aggrandize his own power but to provide a foothold for the friends and family from Tongxuan Continent should he ever bring them into the Star Domain; by their numbers they could form a Sect.

He had never mentioned this, but Wu Yi, being perceptive, had noticed.

Yang Kai had no wish to probe further and instead asked, "Has anything happened while I was away? Why do you all look so worried? Did the Xie Family do something again?"

He assumed as much—before he left the Xie Family had been testing Dragon Lair Mountain, and Yang Kai imagined they had suffered some loss while he was gone, which made him somewhat angry.

On hearing this the leader hurriedly replied, "No, no—the mere Xie Family is not a threat to us. They did probe a few times after you left, but every person who came perished without a grave; after a few tries they learned their lesson and no longer dare to intrude on our formation."

"Then why the anxious look?"

"It's... it's..." the leader stammered, looking at Yang Kai as if ashamed to speak.

"Speak plainly—no need to hem and haw!" Yang Kai's face grew stern.

"It's Miss Yang Yan!" the man blurted out.

"Yang Yan?" Yang Kai's expression changed. "What's happened to Yang Yan?"

“I’m not sure myself. The young lady only said that Miss Yang Yan suddenly fell unconscious a few days ago, and no one knows what happened. The young lady and Miss Qian Yue are trying to find a solution… huh?” The leading cultivator was still answering Yang Kai’s question when, before he could finish, Yang Kai’s figure vanished. With his own cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, he hadn’t even caught how Yang Kai disappeared. His heart trembled slightly, and a trace of admiration and envy appeared on his face.

Hearing Yang Yan was in trouble, Yang Kai had no time for idle chatter.

Since arriving on Dark Star he had only a handful of friends, and even fewer he could confide in.

Yang Yan was one of those few, and in Yang Kai's heart she ranked at the top—without her Dragon Lair Mountain would not have reached its present scale, and without her Yang Kai would not possess so many Secret Treasures.

Yang Yan had contributed greatly to Dragon Lair Mountain's development, and Yang Kai's ability to cultivate with no worries owed entirely to her.

Back when Yang Yan worked in Tianyun City's forging hall producing Saint-Grade Secret Treasures to earn Saint Crystals, Yang Kai had brought her back by chance; absent that, they might have passed like ships in the night.

As time passed Yang Kai came to realize how indispensable Yang Yan was, and upon hearing she had fallen ill he was naturally frantic with worry.

He released his Divine Sense and quickly located her in the loft where she lived.

At this moment Qian Yue and Wu Yi were there—one offering a bowl of some medicine to Yang Yan's lips, the other sitting cross-legged by the bed, constantly pouring Saint Yuan into Yang Yan's body trying to rouse her.

Both women wore worried expressions and were anxiously distressed.

While they were at a loss, a figure suddenly appeared; Qian Yue and Wu Yi's faces changed and they prepared to strike, but seeing it was Yang Kai they brightened and looked toward him.

Yang Kai had no time for pleasantries; seeing Yang Yan he found her pale and unconscious—her face, even in sleep, twisted with the terror and panic of a nightmare.

Her Saint Yuan surged and ebbed in turmoil, as if she were suffering a Qi Deviation, which was deeply worrying.

Yang Kai quickly went to the bedside, took her hand, placed his fingers on her wrist, and probed carefully with his Divine Sense.

After a moment his brows knit tightly; he released Yang Yan's white wrist and asked, "What happened? When did this start?"

Qian Yue and Wu Yi exchanged a glance, and Wu Yi answered, "Four days ago she was fine. I was assisting her in refining some items when she suddenly looked unwell, muttered something, and collapsed. We brought her back and she hasn't woken since. The Healing Pills and the Pills for restoring Divine Sense you left have been taken in quantity but with no improvement."
