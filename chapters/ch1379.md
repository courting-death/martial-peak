## Chapter 1379 — Farewell Star Emperor Token

As the final few items were auctioned off, Yang Kai naturally remained a bystander; all the Saint Crystals he had taken from Wu Yi had already been used to purchase Xuan Gold, leaving him with no means to contest anything else.

That said, although these last auctioned items were quite good, Yang Kai was not the least bit tempted.

After the burning of one incense stick, Qing'er returned, bringing back a jade box which she respectfully handed to Yang Kai, offering, "Congratulations, Senior, on achieving your wish and winning this item."

Yang Kai smiled as he took it, opened the jade box and peered inside; indeed it contained the Xuan Gold he had seen before, about the size of a goose egg, an all-red gold hue. It had been sealed by a high expert with a sealing array, yet that could not stop the pure metal-attributed Spiritual Qi from overflowing. Those currents of Spiritual Qi struck like blades and could not be underestimated.

To describe this Xuan Gold as bristling with a deadly edge would be nothing short of perfect.

Yang Kai toyed with it delightedly for a while, then casually tossed it into his Black Book Space.

He would need this Xuan Gold, naturally to prepare for cultivating the Body-Tempering Cultivation Method and the Undying Five Elements Sword; to practice that Body-Tempering Cultivation Method one must gather the Five Elemental Treasures!

Among the Five Elements, he already possessed Thundertree, Profound Yin Moon Water, and Sun's True Essence. Having now obtained Xuan Gold, only the earth-attributed treasure remained unaccounted for. Once he had them all, he could begin cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Or he could have the Jubao Tower keep watch for it—after all, that faction specialized in precisely such matters. With that thought, Yang Kai quietly decided to visit Old Yan Pei after the auction concluded.

He imagined the other party would not refuse, so long as he could offer the required price.

In high spirits, Yang Kai naturally would not be stingy. With a wave of his hand he rewarded Qing'er with several bottles of pills, a Secret Treasure, and many Saint Crystals.

The pills were refined by himself, so their quality went without saying; the Secret Treasure was produced by Yang Yan and was likewise a fine treasure, just right for a young woman's current use. Though the Saint Crystals were not numerous—only tens of thousands—for a cultivator of Qing'er's level that was a substantial gain, enough to support her cultivation for a long time.

She was naturally moved to tears with gratitude.

From below came Ren Tianrui's slightly excited voice: "Everyone, this auction concludes here, a complete success. Thank you for coming from afar to show your support. Now please remain calm; although the auction has ended, our Jubao Tower has been entrusted by a reclusive high expert to ask the honored elders here for a favor."

"Ren, what does this mean?" Immediately a powerful expert from a major faction spoke up to ask.

Ren Tianrui smiled faintly, signaled to the rear, and bowed slightly. The crowd followed his gaze and couldn't help but twitch the corners of their mouths. The reason was nothing more than this: Old Yan Pei, that black-faced elder, was strolling up onto the stage.

"Heh, you need not be nervous. Since the auction is over there will be no more items to bid on. I am only here, at an old friend's request, to discuss a matter with you," Yan Pei said without hurry.

"Discuss what? Speak up if you have something to say, or fart it out. We don't have time for you to beat around the bush," someone retorted. Clearly not everyone trusted Yan Pei; many remained privately wary.

"My old friend wishes to exchange one item with you!" Yan Pei did not dally; with a slight smile his Spatial Ring flashed and he withdrew an object, holding it high before them.

The experts in the various private chambers all extended their Divine Sense and examined it carefully.

After a moment, a chorus of exclamations arose.

"This is..."

"No way, there really is such a thing?"

"It still retains some traces of Imperial Might; it looks unmistakable—who would have thought the legend was true!"

In room B-13, Yang Kai also stared fixedly at the object in Yan Pei's hand, his expression strange. As he pondered, he seemed to sense something and turned to Yang Yan. He found her face showing a mix of suspicion and surprise, and in those beautiful eyes there was even a flicker of excitement and hesitation; her delicate fists were clenched so tightly her nails had bitten into the flesh and she had not noticed.

"Star Emperor Token!" Mo Xiaosheng exclaimed. "Brother Yan, forgive my poor eyes, but is that the legendary Star Emperor Token in your hand?"

Yan Pei smiled faintly. "Brother Mo, since you've recognized it, why ask me? I suppose most present have already come to their own conclusions, right?"

"Is it really the Star Emperor Token? Not a fake?"

"If it were fake, why would I produce it?" Yan Pei snorted lightly. "Several friends of mine from the Jubao Tower personally authenticated it—there is no doubt this is the Star Emperor Token. After all, the remaining traces of Imperial Might inside cannot be forged!"

"Rumor says the Starry Sky Emperor originally forged ten Star Emperor Tokens, each sealing one of his tremendous divine arts; their power could destroy heaven and earth, move mountains and fill seas—could this be one of them?" Cheng Pengxuan's voice wavered with excitement.

If this truly was one of the ten Star Emperor Tokens forged by the Starry Sky Emperor, whoever possessed it would be an invincible existence.

The Starry Sky Emperor—he was an existence who had surpassed the Void King Realm! There wasn't even a Void King Realm on Dark Star; who could contend with the divine art sealed within a Star Emperor Token?

All the powerhouses present thought the same, and in an instant their gazes upon the Star Emperor Token burned with heat; the atmosphere in the Jubao Tower auction hall turned strangely intense.

Yan Pei read the room and, knowing countless hearts had been stirred by greed, remained unhurried and explained, "It is indeed a Star Emperor Token, but the divine art sealed within has already been activated—do not get your hopes up."

His words carried a faint warning.

Upon hearing this, many of the experts felt as if doused with cold water and instantly sobered. Thinking it over, it made sense—if the Star Emperor Token were intact, only a fool would have produced it in public; Yan Pei would not have exposed such an item.

"It's already been activated—what a pity, truly a pity," Mo Xiaosheng said in tones of deep melancholy, sighing for a long while.

"Hmph, Old Mo, you still dream of getting an unactivated Star Emperor Token? Aren't you thinking a bit too much?" Cheng Pengxuan sneered.

"Didn't you think the same, Brother Cheng?" Mo Xiaosheng admitted readily and took it in stride.

"But Brother Yan, what do you intend to do with a Star Emperor Token that's already useless?" someone asked.

Yan Pei's composure never wavered. "Though it has been activated, it is not useless. This is, after all, a treasure personally forged by the Starry Sky Emperor. Leaving aside the residual Imperial Might within that might grant you insights, there may be other gains. Even the material of this token is something our Jubao Tower cannot identify—perhaps someone here knows other uses for it."

"That may be, but such a Star Emperor Token wouldn't be worth an exorbitant price. I wonder what Brother Yan intends to trade it for?" Mo Xiaosheng pondered before asking. Even an activated Star Emperor Token retained enormous research value; he certainly did not want to miss out.

Many shared his sentiment, and a powerful expert chimed in, "Indeed, Brother Yan, all the sects that carry weight on Dark Star are gathered here. You should find what you need—say what it is and we'll see if anyone carries it; if not, perhaps a sect repository has it in storage!"

Yan Pei said calmly, "What my old friend seeks in exchange is not easy to find."

If it were truly easy to obtain, the Jubao Tower would have exchanged for the Star Emperor Token long ago—there would be no need to bring it to an auction. So despite the many people present, Yan Pei did not have much confidence in securing the item for his secluded old friend.

"Exactly what is it? Tell us!" Cheng Pengxuan demanded impatiently.

"Flowing Flame Fireblaze!" Yan Pei revealed.

"Flowing Flame Fireblaze?"

"Where would one find such a thing?"

"The last opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland was four hundred years ago. This recent opening was a few years back, but no reports said that any sect disciple had been so lucky as to obtain one."

...

Conversations buzzed, noisy beyond measure.

Another expert asked about offering other precious materials for the Star Emperor Token; some even suggested purchasing it with Saint Crystals. Yan Pei shook his head vigorously like a rattle and repeated patiently, "My apologies, everyone, this Star Emperor Token is not the property of our Jubao Tower. I was only entrusted to exchange it. The other party declared they want nothing but Flowing Flame Fireblazes—though if someone could point us to where Soul Cleansing Divine Water is found, that would also suffice!"

"Soul Cleansing Divine Water—Brother Yan, you must be joking. If such a thing existed, we'd keep it for ourselves and not trade it for a single used Star Emperor Token," someone snapped.

Many experts were privately annoyed, feeling the owner of the Star Emperor Token was making an outrageous demand. If there truly were Flowing Flame Fireblazes, trading for them might not be a loss, but Soul Cleansing Divine Water is said to be one of the Star Domain's Three Divine Waters, its value incalculable—only a fool would exchange it for a used Star Emperor Token.

In room B-13, Yang Kai and Yang Yan exchanged a glance, both wearing odd expressions.

Others did not possess Flowing Flame Fireblazes—Yang Kai did!

During the last foray into the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had obtained nine Flowing Flame Fireblazes. Apart from using a few himself and giving two to Yang Yan, he still had three left. He had planned to find time to refine them to strengthen his Divine Sense Fire, but other matters had kept delaying him.

He had not expected the Flowing Flame Fireblazes to prove useful at this very moment.

As for the Star Emperor Token, Yang Kai was by no means unfamiliar; he had two. One had been given to him by the Void King Realm expert Ghost Ancestor, and the other came from the Flowing Flame Sandland. The one from Ghost Ancestor was intact and unactivated; the piece from the Flowing Flame Sandland, however, was the same as Yan Pei's—the divine art of the Starry Sky Emperor sealed within it was no longer present.

"Should I trade for it?" Yang Kai murmured, his expression hesitant. He was qualified to make the exchange, but swapping for a single useless Star Emperor Token felt somewhat unprofitable.

"Trade!" Yang Yan interjected decisively.

"Oh? Why?" Yang Kai asked, looking at her with suspicion.

"I don't know, but I have a feeling the Star Emperor Token contains far more than the Emperor's sealed divine art. There must be other secrets."

As for other secrets, that was indeed a possibility. Yet even if it came to an exchange, he did not necessarily have to use the Flowing Flame Fireblaze. From the other party’s request, Yang Kai had a faint sense of speculation and judgment, though he was not yet entirely certain. After all, the Flowing Flame Fireblaze was greatly beneficial in strengthening his Divine Sense Fire—if it could be spared, it was best to save it.

Thinking this, Yang Kai lightly nodded, plans already forming in his heart.
