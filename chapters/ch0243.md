## Chapter 243 — Zi Mo’s Background

“I want to ask you some things,” Yang Kai said, looking at Zi Mo.

“Sure,” Zi Mo replied with a light laugh, slowly walking to Yang Kai's side, bringing with her a fragrant breeze. She sat down without a care, showing no sign of resentment for the punishment Yang Kai had given her earlier.

To Yang Kai's surprise, Leng Shan also came over and sat on his other side, though she was not as relaxed as Zi Mo, her body a bit stiff.

When Yang Kai looked at her, she managed to force a smile that was even more pitiful than crying.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai sensed that these two cunning women were up to some tricks. However, he did not detect any hostility between them, so he chose not to dwell on it, assuming they had recognized the situation and dared not act recklessly.

“Master, what do you want to ask?” Zi Mo nestled against Yang Kai, deliberately pressing her soft chest against his elbow, her breath fragrant.

“Ahem... what did you just call me?” Yang Kai asked, his expression strange.

“Master, of course...” Zi Mo giggled, her impressive bosom bouncing with an astonishing elasticity, her voice sweet and soft.

This title was unbearable for Yang Kai, and even Leng Shan sitting on the other side couldn't help but shiver, goosebumps rising on her arms. She felt a genuine admiration for Zi Mo's shamelessness!

“I could never do what she does,” Leng Shan thought to herself.

Zi Mo smiled like a blooming flower. “I don’t know your name, and my life and death are now in your hands. How am I different from a servant sold by a wealthy family? You point east, and I dare not go west; you tell me to lie down, and I wouldn’t dare to stand up…” She glanced at Yang Kai shyly, her voice lowering, “If you want me to strip, then I will have to strip… you are naturally my master.”

“Stop with that nonsense!” Yang Kai frowned. “You calling me master isn’t sincere, and it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve said before, controlling you is just for self-preservation. As long as you don’t have any ulterior motives, I won’t make things difficult for you.”

Zi Mo was taken aback, pouting, “I was just joking. So, what is your name?”

“Yang Kai. And you two?”

The two women introduced themselves.

Yang Kai knew Leng Shan's background, so there was no need to pry further; his interest lay with Zi Mo.

“Tell me about your sect. Don’t lie to me; I can sense different fluctuations in your soul when you do,” Yang Kai warned.

“Who would dare?” Zi Mo shot Yang Kai a glance, contemplating for a moment before saying, “I come from the Senluo Palace of the Tianlang Kingdom. I wonder if you’ve heard of it.”

Yang Kai shook his head slightly. His knowledge was limited to the Great Han territory, and he was not well-informed about matters outside. However, Leng Shan, upon hearing this, couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

“It seems Leng Mei has heard of it,” Zi Mo chuckled lightly.

Leng Shan nodded slightly. “The superpower of the Tianlang Kingdom. Naturally, I’ve heard of it.”

“A superpower, on par with the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu?” Yang Kai was astonished, never expecting Zi Mo's sect to have such a formidable reputation.

“Pretty much,” Zi Mo smiled lightly, subtly linking her arm with Yang Kai’s. “Moreover, I am a princess of the Tianlang Kingdom, so you’d better not let me die. If you take me to Tianlang, you might just become a consort, enjoying wealth and honor for generations to come, hee hee…”

Yang Kai shot her a glare. He clearly wouldn’t believe such nonsense. This woman was quirky and cunning, making her difficult to deal with. In contrast, Leng Shan wore her thoughts on her face, revealing much less pressure compared to what Zi Mo exerted on Yang Kai.

“Although my fellow disciples and I come from the Senluo Palace, we do not represent the entire sect. If you think that means you can underestimate the superpower of Tianlang, you are being shortsighted,” Zi Mo continued. “We are merely disciples of a branch of the Senluo Palace, primarily studying insects, as you two have already experienced.”

“Those Control Soul Insects of yours?” Yang Kai sneered.

Hearing Yang Kai’s disdain, Zi Mo retorted angrily, “My strength is too low, so the insects I raise are naturally no match for you. If they were good Control Soul Insects, they wouldn’t be afraid of heat!”

“So those insects are afraid of heat!” Yang Kai inadvertently uncovered a piece of information.

Zi Mo realized she had let something slip and decided to come clean. “Yes, their nemesis is heat, so any martial artist who cultivates Yang attribute or fire attribute cannot be controlled by them.”

This also explained why, a few days ago, when Leng Shan informed Zi Mo that Yang Kai cultivated Yang attribute techniques, Zi Mo immediately wanted to kill him.

“However, these insects do have their merits. At least you Tianlang people have relied on them to dominate this area,” Yang Kai recalled how Wu Chengyi and his thirty-plus men were chased to the ends of the earth, feeling a pang of sympathy.

He had only discovered the secret of the Control Soul Insects by sheer luck. If he had fought Zi Mo without understanding, relying solely on those dozens of Demonic Beasts, she would have held an absolute advantage.

“There are indeed many benefits. We can use these insects to control Demonic Beasts, growing stronger like a snowball. When encountering Demonic Beasts and your Great Han martial artists, we might not even need to lift a finger to kill them. But the downsides are equally obvious; for example, when facing someone like you, we must guard against our insects being burned and harming our souls,” Zi Mo said, looking at Yang Kai with frustration.

“So those who cultivate Yang attribute and fire attribute techniques are your primary targets for elimination!” Yang Kai deduced.

“Of course! Without those two types of people, our Control Soul Insects can exert their maximum effectiveness!” Zi Mo said proudly. “But actually, there’s no need to worry too much. Control Soul Insects are too small; generally speaking, even if your Great Han martial artists kill the Demonic Beasts we control, they won’t discover the existence of the Control Soul Insects. We just need to find the right opportunity to retrieve them. I really can’t understand how you managed to uncover this secret.” Zi Mo looked at Yang Kai with curiosity.

Yang Kai grinned, “Guess for yourself.”

Zi Mo was exasperated, her soft chest rising and falling, yet she dared not be too reckless.

In this foreign land, aside from a few martial artists from the Tianlang Kingdom, perhaps only Yang Kai, having discerned the existence of the Control Soul Insects, understood that others merely thought the Tianlang martial artists could control and enslave Demonic Beasts in battle, completely unaware of the intermediary role of the Control Soul Insects.

“By the way, I saw four people from your Senluo Palace by the lake that day. Why is it that only you are left?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

Upon hearing this, a flash of humiliation and anger crossed Zi Mo's eyes, while Leng Shan on the other side even chuckled lightly.

“Can’t say?” Yang Kai’s voice turned low, his expression darkening.

“It’s not that I can’t say,” Zi Mo took a deep breath. “Leng Shan knows the situation; let her tell you.”

Yang Kai was taken aback and turned to look at Leng Shan.

“Yeah, I know,” Leng Shan nodded.

“Then tell me.”

Leng Shan pondered for a moment, seemingly organizing her thoughts, before saying, “In the past half year, the arrogance and encirclement of Zi Mo and the other Tianlang martial artists have made it difficult for me and my master, Jin Hao. Most of the time, we were hiding, but the sense of smell of Demonic Beasts is too keen, and we were often discovered. This hiding continued until a month ago.”

“A little over a month ago, we encountered a group of martial artists, Great Han martial artists, about thirty or so.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; he naturally knew who those people were.

“Although our Ghost King Valley has a bad reputation and is considered an evil sect, we are still from the Great Han, so Jin Hao and I blended into that group, thinking we had found a backer, heh…” Leng Shan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “But unexpectedly, just two days later, we were surrounded by Demonic Beasts all over the mountain.”

Looking back, if she and Jin Hao hadn’t integrated into that group, they probably wouldn’t have fallen into enemy hands so quickly. Thirty or more people seemed powerful, but they were also a large target, far less convenient than moving alone.

“And then?” Yang Kai pressed.

“After a fierce battle, many died, and most of the survivors were captured.”

“Captured?” Yang Kai was astonished. “How could you be captured? Aren’t you all in the True Yuan Realm? If things went south, you could always fly away, right?”

“Couldn’t escape,” Leng Shan said helplessly.

“It’s not that they were incompetent!” Zi Mo interjected, taking a deep breath.

“Then what was the reason?”

“It was my Senior Brother, Chi Xue, who was too powerful!” Zi Mo looked at Yang Kai.

“What level of strength does he have?”

“Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm, but he’s not strong by himself,” Zi Mo shook her head.

“Then it must be the Demonic Beasts he controls? How many does he have?” Yang Kai’s brows furrowed.

Zi Mo raised a finger.

“One hundred?”

Zi Mo shook her head.

“Not a thousand, right?” Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically.

Zi Mo smiled bitterly, “Where are you getting that from? He only has one Demonic Beast!”

“But that Demonic Beast… is a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.”

A hint of shock flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Indeed, it is a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast. Although it’s not particularly strong for a Sixth-Tier, it is more than enough to deal with True Yuan Realm martial artists. All the Great Han martial artists who attempted to escape died at the hands of my Senior Brother Chi Xue and that Demonic Beast.”

“There’s a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast here?” Yang Kai’s mind began to race. Throughout his training, the strongest Demonic Beast he had encountered was only Fifth-Tier. If Zi Mo’s Senior Brother Chi Xue could control a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast with Control Soul Insects, and he could control it with a Slave Beast Seal, if he could find another Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, he could run rampant.

“Probably only this one!” Zi Mo said, a hint of envy flashing in her eyes. “Moreover, my Senior Brother spent a lot of effort to subdue that Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast. He gave up all the Demonic Beasts he controlled, took out the Control Soul Insects, and let them devour and fuse. This was a very risky move; if he wasn’t careful, all the Control Soul Insects would die. But my Senior Brother was very lucky; after nearly a hundred Control Soul Insects fused, they evolved by one tier, allowing him to control a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.”

Though Zi Mo’s explanation was simple, Yang Kai couldn’t help but admire her Senior Brother Chi Xue.

Taking such a huge risk just to evolve a Control Soul Insect showed that this person was decisively ruthless, definitely not an easy character to deal with!
