## Chapter 207 — What Benefits Can You Offer?

As Dong Qinghan spoke, he cast a meaningful glance at Yang Kai, seemingly observing his reaction, as if he had heard some rumors.

"That is your sister-in-law!" Yang Kai did not engage in banter with him and spoke directly.

Dong Qinghan's mouth fell open in surprise as he stared blankly at Yang Kai. He clearly did not expect the rumors to be true; his little cousin had actually captured the attention of the proud daughter of their sect.

The Yang family, indeed, were all like wolves and tigers, not to be underestimated.

"Fortunately, you didn't team up with those two idiots from the Bai family and Ziwei Valley, or else wouldn't that be digging your own wall?" Dong Qinghan forced a bitter smile. As a young master of the Dong family, he held a high status, was handsome, and naturally charming. He had left a trail of affection wherever he went, not knowing how many beautiful women he had shared intimate moments with.

However, because he had heard snippets of information about Yang Kai and Su Yan during his inquiries, he had prudently refrained from associating with the Bai family and Ziwei Valley.

His earlier probing was merely to confirm the rumors, and he was relieved to find out they were true. It was fortunate he hadn’t stirred up trouble; otherwise, wouldn’t his cousin be at odds with him now?

Yang Kai naturally understood the temperament and personality of young masters from prominent families, so he candidly admitted this was not boasting but rather a declaration of his stance.

He clearly conveyed that she is his woman! Anyone who has designs on her will have to deal with me.

"You little brat, you have quite the fortune." Dong Qinghan chuckled lightly. Although Lingxiao Pavilion was a small sect, he had heard that the girl named Su Yan had reached the fourth or fifth level of the True Essence Realm. Such talent was among the best in the world, and moreover, she was likely to have obtained a powerful inheritance.

Such a talent would be coveted even by the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, treated like a treasure to be nurtured.

"Since she is my sister-in-law, it seems my Dong family has no chance of recruiting her." Dong Qinghan sighed again.

"You should have gained quite a bit, right?" Yang Kai glanced at him casually.

Dong Qinghan nodded slightly. "Some, but it’s far from what we expected. You’ve been to that Inheritance Celestial Cave; tell me, what is it really like inside?"

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and briefly recounted the events he encountered in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, but he did not reveal who had obtained the inheritance.

These were harmless pieces of information, yet Dong Qinghan listened with great interest.

"Ah, it’s surprising that the Inheritance Celestial Cave would appear in such a place. It has really benefited the disciples of your three sects. Why didn’t it show up on my Dong family's territory?" Dong Qinghan sighed deeply, lamenting the unfairness of heaven. In the two or three months after the Inheritance Celestial Cave appeared, the three sects had kept the secret tightly guarded until later when the news gradually spread. Only then did the major powers and sects send people to search for the inheritors. Unfortunately, up until now, none had found the inheritor, but each had acquired some treasures and martial techniques from the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Those treasures were severely damaged and could no longer be used, but they were crafted by powerful warriors from countless years ago, making them valuable for research.

Moreover, the martial techniques were not of low grade, at least Earth-Grade, and even included some Heaven-Grade techniques.

It could be said that the appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave had allowed Lingxiao Pavilion, Blood Battle Gang, and Fengyu Tower to prosper in a short time. All the major powers that came here were eagerly acquiring from these three sects, and each had made a fortune.

The only regret was that some disciples could not resist temptation, leaving their own sects to join these major powers. There were quite a few in Lingxiao Pavilion as well.

The five elders had no way to stop this. After all, those major powers were strong; what was it to them to poach a few disciples? Wei Xitong and Su Xuanwu could only turn a blind eye, praying that the young masters and experts from those major powers would leave soon, allowing Lingxiao Pavilion some peace.

While the two cousins were talking, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians outside suddenly called out: "Young Master, Young Master Yang, people from the Bai family and Ziwei Valley have arrived."

Yang Kai and Dong Qinghan exchanged glances. The latter chuckled lightly, "They came quickly; it seems they are here for the martial technique in your hands."

Yang Kai secretly nodded. Previously, Meng Wuya had informed him that the Star Mark technique he displayed in the Inheritance Celestial Cave had attracted attention. A technique capable of severely injuring a sixth-tier demon beast—how could it be anything less? The people from the Bai family and Ziwei Valley were clearly here for the Star Mark.

"What do you plan to do?" Dong Qinghan looked at Yang Kai leisurely, knowing that those two idiots had been bothering his sister-in-law lately. Yang Kai must be holding back a lot of anger, and a good show was likely to unfold.

If Yang Kai revealed his true identity, the Bai family and Ziwei Valley would certainly not dare to provoke him; they would probably apologize and leave in a hurry. But the problem was that Yang Kai could not expose himself, and Dong Qinghan was quite curious about how his cousin would resolve the current predicament, a joyful smile spreading across his slightly plump face.

"We'll see their attitude," Yang Kai said indifferently. "If their attitude is good, we can sit down and talk."

The Star Mark technique would shine brightly in his hands, but that did not mean it would do the same in others'. So even if he sold it, it was no big deal.

"And if their attitude is poor?" Dong Qinghan narrowed his eyes.

Yang Kai glanced at him and let out a cold chuckle.

Dong Qinghan laughed as well, his spirits lifted, adopting a look of anticipation for the show to come.

It was clearly impossible to expect the two arrogant fools from the Bai family and Ziwei Valley to have a good attitude.

Before long, two loud laughs echoed from outside, and two young men, one dressed in white like snow and the other in luxurious purple, entered through the main door.

The white-clad youth was Bai Yunfeng, the young master of the Bai family, while the purple-clad youth was Fan Hong, a disciple of Ziwei Valley.

Following closely behind them were two disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion. One of them looked somewhat familiar to Yang Kai, but he could not recall his name, while the other was Cao Zhengwen, a disciple from the Law Enforcement Hall.

Yang Kai had crossed paths with Cao Zhengwen twice; the last time before leaving Lingxiao Pavilion, this person had delivered the promotion order from the Elder Council to Yang Kai, but it had been rejected, causing him to lose face. Afterward, he was reprimanded by the Grand Elder, which made him resent Yang Kai deeply.

Both disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion had previously entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave, but now they were following Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong closely, clearly having been lured by benefits and having defected to them. At this moment, they were no longer disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion but rather disciples of the Bai family and Ziwei Valley.

"Dong brother, you have such elegance, drinking alone here without inviting me and Fan brother. How rude!" Bai Yunfeng laughed heartily, casually glancing at Yang Kai before putting away a folding fan in his hand, his demeanor arrogant.

Fan Hong also chuckled, "Dong brother, you are not swayed by beauty, which greatly impresses me and Bai brother. It’s laughable that Bai brother and I searched that small loft for over half a month without seeing the jade beauty even once. It’s much more enjoyable for you to drink and have fun here."

A faint cold smile appeared on Yang Kai's lips. The "small loft" they referred to must be Su Yan's residence.

Dong Qinghan smiled, gesturing for the two to sit down. He cast a casual glance at Yang Kai and said, "A few days ago, my father arranged a marriage for me, so I dare not provoke other women. I, Dong, cannot be as free as you two brothers."

Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong took their seats, while Cao Zhengwen and the other Lingxiao Pavilion disciple stood behind them.

Bai Yunfeng said, "Dong brother is joking. I have heard that you recently recruited a female disciple in Lingxiao Pavilion. How do you plan to arrange for her? Will you keep her in a golden house or take her as a concubine?"

Dong Qinghan shook his head with a bitter smile. "Bai brother, don’t joke. I did recruit a female disciple, but it was for the family. That girl has also entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave and gained a good opportunity. Her aptitude is quite good; as long as she has the right resources, she will surely develop in the future."

Bai Yunfeng laughed heartily and did not pursue the matter further. He turned to Yang Kai, his eyes filled with disdain and a condescending attitude, and said, "This must be the Yang Kai disciple from Lingxiao Pavilion, right? I wonder how your discussion with Dong brother is going?"

His words were casual, and although he spoke in front of Yang Kai, he did not regard him at all, instead inquiring about Dong Qinghan.

"We are in the midst of a discussion!" Dong Qinghan nodded slightly. "No results yet; you two have arrived."

Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong's eyes lit up. "It seems that Fan brother and I still have a chance."

Fan Hong looked directly at Yang Kai and said, "I heard that you obtained a powerful martial technique in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. Is that true?"

Yang Kai smiled and replied, "Indeed."

Fan Hong's spirit was lifted, and he said, "Let’s not beat around the bush. I’m interested in that martial technique in your hands. What conditions would you require to part with it?"

"What benefits can you offer?" Yang Kai looked at him calmly.

Fan Hong chuckled lightly, reached into his bosom, and took out a stack of silver notes, pushing them in front of Yang Kai, and said nonchalantly, "Here are one hundred thousand taels in silver! If you are willing to write down the cultivation method of that martial technique for me, all of this silver is yours."

When Fan Hong said this, his demeanor was confident, as if he held all the cards. He clearly believed that one hundred thousand taels would be an irresistible temptation for a disciple of such a small sect.

And indeed, when the stack of one hundred thousand taels was placed on the table, both Cao Zhengwen and the other Lingxiao Pavilion disciple's breaths quickened, their eyes fixated on the silver notes with fervor.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Fan Hong's expression remained unchanged as he took out more silver notes and pushed them toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained unmoved.

Bai Yunfeng laughed heartily, "Fan brother, you are being too stingy. Yang Kai, right? I am willing to offer you two hundred thousand taels in silver for your martial technique. What do you say? Such wealth is not something you can easily earn; it will be enough for you to live several lifetimes without worry, and you can even take three or four wives and enjoy a life of luxury."

Bai Yunfeng's offer was much more generous than Fan Hong's, causing the latter to glare at him fiercely, but Bai Yunfeng paid no mind, merely smiling at Yang Kai.

Dong Qinghan was also smiling, but there was a deeper meaning behind it.

To think that they would try to use two hundred thousand taels to sway a direct descendant of the Yang family—these two fools truly had creativity. Dong Qinghan wanted to laugh out loud but had to suppress it, his shoulders trembling slightly, struggling to contain his amusement.

This show was truly interesting.
