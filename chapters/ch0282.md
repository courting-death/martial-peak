## Chapter 282 — Wan Yao Pool

A dark cloud slowly drifted in, obscuring the moonlight's cascade.

Taking advantage of this moment, Yang Kai advanced another fifty zhang!

Still undetected, Yang Kai let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Fortunately, Dong Qingyan possessed this miraculous ancient jade; otherwise, he truly would not have known how to approach this place.

“Di Mo, it’s your turn to act,” Yang Kai communicated.

“Understood, Master!” Di Mo quickly replied.

With the Soul-Breaking Spike in hand, Di Mo swiftly flew out, moving with utmost caution.

After waiting for less than a dozen breaths, a furious shout suddenly came from the peak of Dan Sheng: “Who goes there!”

As the voice rang out, figures darted in all directions, and soon over ten people rushed out.

A series of eerie, cackling laughter echoed from afar, sounding like ghostly wails, sending chills down one’s spine.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts stationed by the Wan Yao Pool initially did not pursue, but upon hearing that voice, their expressions changed. One of them shouted, “Evil Demon!”

Both leaped into the air, chasing after the direction Di Mo had fled. In mid-air, their eyes met, and one of the Divine Roaming Realm experts hurriedly returned, landing beside the Wan Yao Pool, leaving the other to chase after.

In this brief moment, Yang Kai seized the opportunity to advance another twenty zhang.

With no time to catch his breath, Yang Kai quickly took out what he had concealed in his arms.

It was a gray rabbit. Although there were no demonic beasts in Yao Wang Valley, small animals like rabbits were plentiful, making them easy to catch.

Under the influence of the Slave Beast Seal, this little creature had no choice but to obey Yang Kai’s commands.

With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the rabbit thirty zhang away. After landing steadily, the little creature crawled slowly at first, but upon Yang Kai’s command, it dashed away like the wind after covering another ten zhang.

The commotion quickly attracted attention.

The remaining Divine Roaming Realm expert's eyes flashed with cold light as he struck towards the source of the noise, unleashing a palm strike. His entire body soared like a great bird, flying towards that direction.

At that moment.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and activated his self-created footwork. His figure swayed twice before he directly arrived at the edge of the Wan Yao Pool, not even pausing to observe what this forbidden ground truly looked like. He plunged into the Wan Yao Pool without causing a single splash.

The Divine Roaming Realm expert who had remained behind chased for about a hundred zhang before capturing the fleeing gray rabbit. Gripping the struggling little creature, he shook his head inwardly, thinking he had been overly jumpy.

He casually tossed the rabbit to the ground.

Swish, swish, swish, the sound of fluttering garments came as the group of over ten people returned.

“What happened?”

“Lost the chase. That evil demon is incredibly fast, and… it felt strange. There was no vitality!” the expert who had pursued replied, frowning. “What are you doing here?”

“I heard the commotion and came to check, but it turned out to be just a rabbit.”

The two exchanged glances, their expressions suddenly changing: “A diversion!”

Hastily returning, they carefully examined the area around the Wan Yao Pool.

The Wan Yao Pool was unharmed. The image of Dan Sheng was also intact; everything was calm.

The group looked at each other, unsure of what the evil demon had intended. Fortunately, nothing had happened; this was the foundation of Yao Wang Valley. If something had truly gone wrong, it would not only be a loss for Yao Wang Valley but also for all alchemists in the world. Such a sin was not something the two Divine Roaming Realm experts could bear.

…

The Wan Yao Pool was not deep, measuring only about a dozen zhang.

Yang Kai fell into the water and quickly dove down. During his descent, the Wordless Black Book was already in his hand, and he flipped to the fifth page. By the time he reached the bottom of the pool, a brilliant light suddenly enveloped him.

At the bottom of the pool, concealed patterns emerged, and Yang Kai’s body directly passed through the bottom, landing in a deeper area.

As his vision cleared, he found himself in a closed space. Though enclosed, it was not stifling, and the energy was rich, filled with a fragrant aroma.

The radiant light surrounding him quickly merged into his body. In that moment, Yang Kai’s mind filled with new knowledge.

Instead of immediately investigating, he surveyed his surroundings.

This should be beneath the Wan Yao Pool. Due to the mysterious formation at the bottom, he was able to enter. Even the strongest individuals would not be able to discover this place.

No wonder Yao Wang Valley had been unable to uncover the secrets of the Wan Yao Pool for thousands of years; the mystery was hidden here.

What he saw made Yang Kai’s eyes shine brightly with excitement.

He noticed not far away a well-like structure, its opening roughly the size of a basin. Approaching it, he saw that it contained a translucent, milky-white liquid.

Surrounding the well were intricate and mysterious patterns and characters, indicating it was part of a profound formation.

Under the influence of this formation, a visible cylindrical stream of energy continuously poured into the well, resembling the moonlight cascading down.

The source of this energy was the bottom of the Wan Yao Pool, while the endpoint was this well.

Leaning closer to the well, he inhaled the fragrance; the aroma was emanating from the liquid within.

Cautiously, he extended a finger, dipped it into the liquid, and placed it in his mouth. A sweet flavor spread across his tongue, and the liquid instantly transformed into a warm energy, flooding through his limbs.

Yang Kai’s body trembled as he felt the bottleneck of the True Yuan Realm’s second layer shatter in an instant, allowing him to step into the third layer.

An invisible aura spread out, and Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly, fearing he might disturb the guards above the Wan Yao Pool.

To his surprise, the closed space completely blocked the commotion from his breakthrough, preventing it from spreading outside.

Letting out a quiet sigh of relief, he thought to himself how fortunate he was.

“What a treasure!” Yang Kai exclaimed in delight. What exactly was this liquid in the well? Its effects were astonishing.

Although he had sensed he was nearing the peak of the second layer of the True Yuan Realm half a month ago and had been cultivating for a long time, this breakthrough was still thanks to the liquid he had just encountered.

Yang Kai believed that the information that had appeared in his mind would help him resolve his doubts.

Immersing himself in thought, he carefully examined the newfound knowledge.

Not long after, Yang Kai opened his eyes in astonishment.

In that brief moment, he had obtained the answers he sought.

The milky-white liquid in the well was something called Wan Yao Ling Ye!

Every year, hundreds or even thousands of pills were thrown into the Wan Yao Pool. The energy contained within these pills did not disappear; instead, under the influence of the formation at the bottom, it all converged into this well.

Then, under the effect of the spiritual formation within this well, it transformed into Wan Yao Ling Ye.

This was not something that could be formed overnight but required years of consistent investment of pills to accumulate.

Yao Wang Valley had inherited its legacy for over five or six thousand years, with hundreds or even thousands of pills being thrown into the Wan Yao Pool each year. Accumulating over the years, the number of pills gathered in the Wan Yao Pool was at least several million.

Several million! This was a number that could send shivers down the spine of anyone in the world.

Even if these pills were of the lowest grade and of poor quality, such a massive quantity would still amount to a destructive force capable of changing the heavens and the earth. Moreover, many times, in order to sustain the image of Dan Sheng for a longer period, Yao Wang Valley had thrown in many Heaven-Grade and Earth-Grade pills.

During ancestor worship each year, even Mystery-Grade pills were offered.

Now, all this energy had converged into this well, transformed into Wan Yao Ling Ye.

One could only imagine how precious and rare Wan Yao Ling Ye was.

This was a miraculous liquid formed from the accumulation of several million pills over thousands of years!

Its effects were numerous; not only could it enhance cultivation, but long-term use could also allow one to undergo a transformation, cleansing the marrow and reshaping the body. Even a mediocre talent could become a genius with continuous consumption of Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Moreover, it could assist in alchemy. Adding just a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye while refining any pill could elevate the quality by half a grade.

One should not underestimate half a grade; if a top-tier Mystery-Grade spiritual pill were to be elevated by half a grade, it would reach the threshold of a Spirit Realm pill. This was something Xiao Fusheng had pursued his entire life but never attained.

It could also heal injuries and extend lifespan… the benefits were countless.

Although Wan Yao Ling Ye was derived from various pills, its efficacy far surpassed that of those pills. It had undergone a qualitative change due to quantitative accumulation.

Furthermore, the peculiar formation by the well was constantly devouring the energy of heaven and earth. After thousands of years of operation, no one could say what changes had occurred to this well’s medicinal liquid.

This well was truly the most precious treasure in the world! Anyone who obtained such a well could achieve great feats, even establishing a powerful force that could dominate the world and sweep through the universe.

Yao Wang Valley possessed this treasure yet only used it to enhance the image of Dan Sheng, failing to utilize even a fraction of its potential.

However, it was precisely because of the existence of the image of Dan Sheng that Yao Wang Valley and the alchemists of the world had continuously poured pills into the Wan Yao Pool over the millennia, resulting in the current Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Without the image of Dan Sheng, there would be no medicinal liquid in this well.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming the excitement in his heart.

He could only imagine the expression of Yao Wang Valley if they knew that their sect had spent thousands of years merely to create a treasure for others.

Yang Kai had no grievances with Yao Wang Valley; he had come here following the guidance of the black book, not intending to seize anyone's treasures.

Feeling a twinge of guilt, Yang Kai held the Wordless Black Book and quickly sat cross-legged.

Without a suitable container, it would be impossible to take away the Wan Yao Ling Ye from this vast well. Even the Spatial Pouch granted by Ling Taixu could not hold it.

However, he had already devised a plan.

Flipping to the next page, he turned to the sixth page of the black book.

Long before advancing to the True Yuan Realm, Yang Kai had discovered that the sixth page could be activated. However, although he knew the secrets contained within the sixth page, he had not acted immediately.

Because the formation patterns on the fifth page might still be useful, reflecting back on it, his earlier caution had proven correct.
