## Chapter 769 — Aid Its Evolution

Inside the side chamber, after Yang Kai’s explanation, An Ling'er finally understood what he had been scheming.

If his guess was correct, then once they left this Small Xuan Realm, the place they would arrive at was the Demon Domain!

The Demon Domain was the territory of the demonic races; since ancient times, humans and demons could not coexist. On the Tongxuan Continent, outside neutral zones, whenever different races met, battle was inevitable.

If Yang Kai and An Ling'er, two humans, suddenly appeared in the Demon Domain, they would certainly be hunted by demons, and even if they possessed transcendent abilities, escape would likely be impossible.

But with Gou Chi it would be a different story.

That fellow’s father is the demon general Gou Qiong, a figure who can cover the sky with one hand—if he could shelter Yang Kai and An Ling'er, they would have no need to worry.

That was why Yang Kai had casually pulled him along and won his gratitude.

Upon hearing this, An Ling'er cast Yang Kai a contemptuous glance. “So this is repaying a favor with coercion — why are you so full of tricks?”

Yang Kai snorted lightly. “I’m just thinking further ahead than you. Of course, all this depends on whether we can leave here; if we can’t, even if I become sworn brothers with that scoundrel Gou Chi, it won’t help.”

“Can we leave?” An Ling'er pursed her red lips, unease knitting her brows.

“I don’t know—people make their own fate, I suppose.” Yang Kai shook his head helplessly; he wouldn’t make any guarantees, only do his utmost to carve out a way.

“I wonder what has become of the Sacred Land.” An Ling'er sighed softly.

With Saintess Nan having suddenly turned into that state, the Old Sacred Lord might already have perished; the Sacred Land could now be in utter chaos.

“I don’t know the details of your Sacred Land, but I think your three sisters—who are also Saintesses—are probably in grave danger!”

“Ah…” An Ling'er’s face drained of color and she cried out; thinking it over carefully, she suddenly felt Yang Kai might indeed be right.

Because they practiced the same technique, Saintess Nan could easily locate the other Saintesses’ positions, and An Ling'er had escaped an earlier catastrophe on those isles. But her three sisters might not have been so lucky. In the Saintesses’ procession there was no Saint Realm expert to hold the line; no one could stand against a previous-generation Saintess at Saint Realm, two Stages.

It was highly likely that Saintess Nan had already slain one or more of those three before she turned to pursue An Ling'er.

Yang Kai’s words instantly plunged An Ling'er's elation at having narrowly escaped death into an abyss, and her delicate face grew faintly pale.

“Forget I said it—maybe the situation isn’t that bleak!” Yang Kai inwardly regretted it; these thoughts had long been in his head and he had spoken them carelessly, not expecting to sadden An Ling'er so.

“It’s your fault; I was in such a good mood…” An Ling'er glared at Yang Kai with reddened eyes, covered her cheek, and ran off.

Yang Kai shook his head helplessly, feeling he had indeed invited trouble with his mouth.

The Yang Clan turned out to be fairly honorable; shortly after Yang Kai and the others settled in, they sent over a large supply of Spirit-Grade Pills—all of the Yang attribute.

This place’s Yang attribute energy was extremely dense, naturally favoring the growth of Yang-type medicinal ingredients. The Yang Clan must have alchemists skilled in refining pills, and these materials had been made into pills.

There were ten bottles in total, each containing ten pills—all lower-grade Spirit-Grade.

Not top-tier, but not too poor either.

In less than half an hour, Yang Kai had swallowed all one hundred of the lower-grade Spirit-Grade pills. The Yang Liquid he had lost was basically replenished.

Yet Yang Kai was not satisfied; he planned to take advantage of the situation and squeeze a bit more out of the Yang Clan.

After all, he might need to replenish the Divine Tree with Yang Liquid many times in the future; ten bottles of spiritual medicine wouldn’t suffice.

After three days of stability, Yang Kai once again requested more pills from the Yang Clan, and the man responsible nearly popped his eyes out.

Ten bottles meant a hundred pills; if given to any one member of their clan, it could sustain months of cultivation. Yet Yang Kai had used them all in just three days.

Under their watch he had remained meditating in his room and hadn’t stepped out; he also had no secret treasures stored in a Spatial Pouch, so it was impossible to hide pills away.

Following an angry scolding, they nonetheless brought him another ten bottles and warned him to use them sparingly—after all, the Yang Clan themselves would find it difficult to refine such pills.

Yang Kai nodded to their faces and snorted behind their backs, continuing to swallow the pills like beans.

If he were to refine those lower-grade Spirit-Grade pills now, he could do it casually; ten bottles would probably take less than two days.

In short, the Yang Clan’s alchemists were simply incompetent.

Days passed, and everyone in the Yang Clan assumed that after this appeasement the Divine Tree would stay stable for a while; yet five days later the tree sent out unstable energy fluctuations once more.

By the time they sensed it, Yang Kai was already prepared.

Sure enough, before long someone came to fetch him and led him to the Divine Tree.

This time An Ling'er and the others did not follow; they remained in the palace.

Beneath the Divine Tree, the Yang Clan’s experts, led by their chief, all waited. When Yang Kai appeared, each fixed their Divine Sense tightly upon him, eyes burning, as if determined to use this chance to see what trick he had employed and how he had soothed the Divine Tree.

Yang Kai’s face was calm and showed no trace of nervousness.

Even if they scrutinized his method, there would be no issue—apart from him, there was likely no one else in the world capable of doing what he had done.

So he felt no concern whatsoever.

Without wasting words, he leapt up onto the trunk and sought out the crack he had opened before, then condensed a drop of Yang Liquid at his fingertip and let it fall.

Each drop of Yang Liquid gathered Yang Kai’s True Yuan energy; given his current cultivation and the toughness of his meridians, the energy contained in the Yang Liquid was already immense.

Even so, the drop sank into the Divine Tree and vanished at once, entirely absorbed.

Urgent fluctuations radiated from within the Divine Tree, even more unstable than before, plainly in a state of craving.

Yang Kai remained unhurried, dripping Yang Liquid into the Divine Tree drop by drop, calming its unconscious tremors.

The Yang Clan folk watched closely below but could not make sense of it; although they sensed surges of tremendous energy emerging and quickly dissipating, they could not fathom the secrets within.

One after another, they frowned.

They wanted to step forward to inspect more closely but hesitated, fearing Yang Kai might turn hostile.

After about half an hour, the Divine Tree’s aura stabilized.

Yang Kai’s spirit body entered the Divine Tree to inspect and discovered that this strange mass of energy had shifted somewhat from last time; it seemed more condensed and solid.

Nodding inwardly, Yang Kai felt it would not be long before this energy formed its own consciousness.

When Yang Kai leapt down again, the Yang Clan folk saw his face was as pale as before and that his True Yuan had been utterly spent.

They exchanged glances and were greatly satisfied.

No matter what means Yang Kai had used to pacify the Divine Tree, his performance showed he had indeed given his all, which was what the Yang Clan had wanted to see.

After he recovered a bit, they approached.

The Yang Clan chief said, “Kid, I hear you consumed pills very rapidly—do you take our clan for fools?”

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, wet his dry lips, and weakly said, “Although I consumed so many pills and gained something, the ultimate beneficiary is your Divine Tree. Let me say it plainly: nine out of ten of the energies I drew from those pills fed back into the Divine Tree. You saw that for yourselves. What I got was only a tiny, subtle gain—are you going to quarrel with me over that?”

The chief frowned tightly; though he found Yang Kai’s words somewhat unbelievable, he had no good retort.

“Since you brought this up, I must make something clear: supply me with large quantities of pills—large quantities, do you understand? Otherwise if your Divine Tree has problems again, I can’t promise I’ll have sufficient True Yuan to deal with it!”

Faces darkened at Yang Kai’s arrogant tone; they felt uneasy at his brazenness.

“If it’s truly for the Divine Tree, we can provide—but your consumption is simply too fast. Over time we fear we won’t be able to supply!” the chief said solemnly.

“If you can’t give me pills, give me medicinal materials—I’ll refine them myself!” Yang Kai stepped back.

“You know how to refine pills?” the Yang Clan chief asked, slightly astonished.

“That’s none of your concern!” Yang Kai snorted.

“Fine, I’ll have people prepare them,” the chief nodded. “By the way, why did this bout of the Divine Tree’s unrest come so quickly? Shouldn’t you explain that?”

“Explain what? You don’t expect that after my soothing, the Divine Tree will never act up again, do you?”

“We didn’t think that, only that the interval should be longer.”

“Foolish,” Yang Kai sneered, “the faster its frequency, the better. Once it reaches a certain speed, it will cease to rebel. If possible, I hope to soothe it here every day—no need to wait for crises.”

“Every day?” They all showed astonishment and confusion.

“Mm.”

“That request can be met. Rest assured, as long as you truly dedicate yourself to the Divine Tree and the Yang Clan, we will not treat you unfairly. We might even grant you many benefits. Since you cultivate a Yang-attribute technique, the Yang Clan has martial skill manuals especially suited to you!” Feeling Yang Kai’s apparent sincerity, the chief’s expression softened considerably and he promised handsome rewards.

Yang Kai outwardly looked pleased but inwardly sneered; from their attitude they merely regarded him as diligent labor, and even if they opened martial manuals to him, they would be low-end techniques.

He truly had no use for those things.
