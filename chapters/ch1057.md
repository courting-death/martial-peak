## Chapter 1057 — Unconscious

In the ancient ruins, Yang Kai stood not far from Xue Yue, silently staring at her, his emotions tangled.

He and this woman should have been enemies locked in mortal hatred, but because of the Soul Chain their lives were bound together; now Xue Yue hung by a thread, and whether Yang Kai wanted to or not, he had to find a way to save her.

Only if Xue Yue lived could he remain alive.

Yang Kai didn’t rush to act. Around Xue Yue hovered drop after drop of gem-like, exquisitely clear liquid, and from each droplet emanated a terrifying power that made Yang Kai’s heart pound; when his Divine Sense approached, even the threads of his Divine Sense could be frozen.

Profound Yin Moon Water!

Yang Kai immediately understood this liquid was the Profound Yin Moon Water Halika had spoken of; he had simply not expected it to be so strange.

Yang Kai quietly counted; roughly fifty droplets hovered in the air, spaced yet forming an impenetrable ring around Xue Yue.

Pulling Xue Yue out from among those Profound Yin Moon Water droplets would be extremely difficult.

Yang Kai waved his hand and raised a fierce gust to try to push the drops aside, but to his surprise the droplets did not budge when the wind struck them.

They seemed to weigh over a thousand jun!

Yang Kai's expression turned grave and he increased his force; only then did the Profound Yin Moon Water shift a little, exposing Xue Yue safely.

Standing before Xue Yue, Yang Kai looked at her with helplessness.

He did not know how to get her out; he still vividly remembered the scene of the Hengluo Commerce Guild warrior who had gone to rescue a companion—an ice so bitter spread that even a Saint King Realm warrior could not withstand it, being frozen into an ice sculpture that shattered on the ground.

Yang Kai dared not lightly touch Xue Yue's body.

He circulated his power and a pitch-black Demonic Flame appeared on his hand. Slowly approaching Xue Yue, he wanted to see whether his Demonic Flame could block the transmission of that cold.

Strange, contradictory energy fluctuations came from the Demonic Flame; as it drew near, the burning flame seemed to meet its nemesis—its height shrank and its potency instantly diminished.

Yang Kai's face tightened and he had to increase his Saint Yuan output; the weakened Demonic Flame swelled again, and Yang Kai pressed the Demonic Flame onto Xue Yue's snow-white arm.

In an instant, a violent clash of energies erupted. The cold on Xue Yue surged rapidly toward them, and the burning Demonic Flame was frozen in a flash.

The chill traveled along the Demonic Flame straight toward Yang Kai, making his color change; he frantically pushed his Saint Yuan.

The frozen Demonic Flame hissed and once more flared into a roaring blaze, contending with the all-enveloping cold.

Yang Kai's body trembled; he had hardly ever suffered such hardship. For the first time he gave his all to resist an icy power.

Time passed; the Profound Yin Moon Water's chill was sometimes suppressed by the Demonic Flame, sometimes creeping into Yang Kai's arm—the two forces fought on equal footing, neither yielding.

Although Yang Kai's strength was low, the Demonic Flame was born of his fusion of two utterly different energies. The other form of power that emerged with it was mysterious and unfathomable; once Yang Kai's realm was high enough, it could burn all things.

It had tremendous potential for growth!

But for now the Demonic Flame seemed no match for the Profound Yin Moon Water; after a short while Yang Kai was overwhelmed, the icy intent spreading through his body and freezing both his limbs and thoughts.

Yang Kai swiftly sank into his spirit and called within the Demon God's Secret Codex, "Help me!"

He had to seek aid from the Divine Tree!

The Divine Tree was a Yang attribute Divine Tree. It was the bane of cold.

"Very well!" the Divine Tree replied immediately.

The next moment, an immense Yang attribute energy suddenly burst from the Demon God's Secret Codex and, together with Yang Kai's Demonic Flame, drove away the cold clinging to him.

The chill from the Profound Yin Moon Water was rapidly suppressed.

Yang Kai's Demonic Flame wrapped Xue Yue's delicate form, and at the same time the Yang attribute energy surging from the Divine Tree also enveloped her.

With both forces at work, the frost on Xue Yue quickly melted; her ghastly pallor gradually returned to flushed color, her cold body warmed, and a faint heartbeat sounded from her full chest.

Yang Kai brightened and spared no effort in working with the Divine Tree.

Half an hour later the frost on Xue Yue had completely disappeared, and only then did the seven-colored radiance that had bloomed within her begin to dim—she herself seemed at the very end of her reserves.

Yang Kai probed her with his Divine Sense and found her condition somewhat peculiar.

Although the danger of the Profound Yin Moon Water had been removed, she still hovered between life and death, unconscious.

Yang Kai rudely entered her Sea of Consciousness and found it cold as a Glacier World; the waters were frozen, Xue Yue's Spirit Body nowhere to be seen—only a faint breath remained, and no matter how Yang Kai called, there was no response.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed; not knowing where the problem lay, he temporarily withdrew from her Sea of Consciousness.

"I must rest for a while; I cannot help you for the moment," the Divine Tree said, then fell silent—this time its contribution had been great, forcing it into slumber.

Not only had the Divine Tree suffered great expenditure, Yang Kai's Saint Yuan had also been heavily consumed; if not for his unusual body and inexhaustible Saint Yuan reserves, he could not have dispelled the Profound Yin Moon Water.

He crouched, lifted her at the waist, tore open space with an outstretched hand, and dove in headfirst.

He had no concern for the floating Profound Yin Moon Water; though extremely rare treasures, Yang Kai was in no mood to collect them and did not know how.

Above the mine, Halika had recovered somewhat after half a day's rest and finally looked much better.

The guild warriors who had escaped with him had barely kept their lives, all of them missing arms or legs.

The most tragic among them had both arms severed!

He had been a Saint King Realm warrior, but without hands he would have no path to further progress in martial cultivation; thinking of this, his eyes darkened with despair.

The others from the Hengluo Commerce Guild looked ashen and worried, brows tightly knit.

One expedition into an ancient ruin had cost the branch dearly; Third Young Master's woman had died inside—this responsibility would not be small, and Halika, as branch leader, would inevitably be punished.

"Old Ha, head back first; once we return we'll figure out how to report this to the home star," Lin Mufeng said as he walked over and helped Halika to his feet.

Halika replied dejectedly, his spirit low.

"What about the Profound Yin Moon Water?" the middle-aged woman asked.

Lin Mufeng pondered: "Seal this place for now. After we consult the records we'll bring people to collect it."

Lin Mufeng himself did not know how to harvest such a thing.

"There is no other choice!" the middle-aged woman sighed.

Lin Mufeng immediately began issuing orders, leaving two Origin Returning Realm experts and a dozen Saint King Realm warriors to seal and guard the place, and in no time everything was arranged.

As the group prepared to depart, the middle-aged woman suddenly turned her head toward the pit and made a soft exclamation.

In the next moment everyone turned, surprised and suspicious, looking that way.

A figure suddenly burst out—none other than the little guard who had only reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm!

At this moment he carried the Lady and descended lightly from midair; his face was somber, yet his whole body bore not a single wound or sign of distress!

Halika, Lin Mufeng and the others' eyes widened, expressions of incredulity showing on their faces.

When Yang Kai had insisted on going down earlier they had all thought the youth surely would not return—after all, his strength was too low and the ruin's seals could easily cost him his life; those seals were not something a Saint Realm warrior could break or evade.

But the reality far exceeded their expectations: Yang Kai not only survived and returned, he even rescued the Lord.

How had he done it? The three were stunned.

"How is the Lady?" Halika immediately composed himself and asked anxiously.

"Not dead!" Yang Kai shook his head.

Hearing this, each of the three experienced an audible relief, a weight lifting from their hearts.

They had fretted endlessly; their greatest fear had been that the Third Young Master would rage and punish them for this, perhaps to the death. Now that she was not dead, their worst worry vanished.

For a moment they looked at Yang Kai with gratitude.

This little guard had not only saved the Third Young Master's woman, he had in effect saved the three of them as well!

"But she's unconscious and won't wake; something's wrong," Yang Kai added.

The relief on Halika and the others' faces stiffened; they leaned in, sweeping their Divine Sense over Xue Yue's body, their expressions grave.

They too detected Xue Yue's abnormality and were at a loss.

"Return, return!" Lin Mufeng shouted. "No one is to disclose what happened here today—violators will be killed!"

After saying this he looked toward Yang Kai and, choosing his words carefully with rare politeness, said: "Young Brother, about the Lady's injury—could you refrain from notifying the home star for now? We'll try to wake her ourselves."

He truly feared Yang Kai might report the matter to the home star; if Xue Yue learned of it, they would not escape punishment.

They did not know that this Lady was in fact Xue Yue herself.

Had they known, they would likely have despaired entirely.

Yang Kai would not expose it; he nodded lightly, "As long as she can be saved, I can keep this quiet for now!"

He also understood what they were worrying about.

Lin Mufeng's face brightened and he clasped his hands repeatedly: "You're reasonable, Young Brother. Thank you."

Halika and the middle-aged woman also looked at Yang Kai with gratitude; everything was unspoken yet understood.

"Go back; I'll summon Rainfall Star's best alchemists to examine the Lord," Lin Mufeng called to the group and flew toward the branch's location.
