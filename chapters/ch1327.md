## Chapter 1327 — Yu Feng Detained

Just as everyone sat there in puzzlement, the bamboo pavilion's front door was pushed open and a figure stepped in from outside.

At first everyone was startled; when they saw the newcomer's face they couldn't help but rise to their feet. Wu Yi cried out with delight, "Yang Kai, you've come out of seclusion?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, cast a sweep of his gaze around the room, and then rested his eyes on Qian Yue. Her complexion was far better than when he'd seen her at Hehuan House, and he immediately relaxed, knowing she was living here reasonably well.

At the side, Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged glances, a trace of astonishment flashing in their eyes. They cupped their fists together and said, “Congratulations, Nephew Yang, on advancing to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Your cultivation speed is truly unmatched across the entire Dark Star!”

The last time they had been to Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had only been at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm; after leaving Flowing Flame Sandland he advanced to the Second Stage, and now he had reached the Third — all in scarcely two or three years. The two men were both shocked and ashamed; compared with Yang Kai's rate of advancement, their own talents seemed utterly mediocre.

"You two Guest Elders flatter me," Yang Kai said with a modest smile. He shifted the topic, "That's not the point. I just heard you mention Yingyue Hall and that Yu Feng has been detained — what's going on? Tell me the details."

At Yang Kai's question, they exchanged glances, and Wu Yi stepped forward to explain.

After hearing her explanation, Yang Kai realized that something really had gone wrong in Tianyun City. A month ago Dragon Lair Mountain had ordered a shipment of goods from Yingyue Hall.

A few days prior, Yu Feng had taken several Haike Family warriors to Tianyun City to pick up the goods, but to his surprise the other side not only failed to honor the previous agreement, they even raised the price — by a full thirty percent or more.

Such a price Yu Feng naturally refused to accept. He argued with the person in charge of Yingyue Hall's Tianyun City branch, but the other party would not yield, so Yu Feng demanded they at least return the deposit. After all, they had broken the contract first; even if he didn't buy the goods he wasn't going to swallow such a blatant loss.

Unknown to them, the other side flat-out refused to return it; not only that, they came to blows. The five disciples Yu Feng had brought were all beaten and injured.

In the fight Yu Feng and his men did not simply give in; they resisted and damaged several of the shop's shelves. They were then subdued by an Origin Returning Realm expert. Not only were they detained, but the Saint Crystals they had brought for the transaction were all confiscated.

Only a single disciple was released and sent back to report to Dragon Lair Mountain, so that they could prepare a large sum of Saint Crystals to ransom the captives.

If not for that, Wu Yi and the others would not have known such detailed information.

After hearing everything, Yang Kai's face remained expressionless and calm. He pondered for a moment, then asked, "They're not in mortal danger, are they?"

"The disciple who returned said their injuries, while not minor, are not fatal. With some time to recuperate they'll recover."

"Good," Yang Kai nodded lightly, then looked up at the group and asked, "Where do you think this went wrong?"

"Where did it go wrong?" Wu Yi was taken aback and cried, "Everywhere! We've cooperated with Yingyue Hall for so long without trouble. We pay Saint Crystals for materials and they profit handsomely; over the past two years we've become almost their largest client. They should be courting us, not doing this. Why would they pull such a spiteful stunt? And their subordinates wouldn't have the nerve to do this on their own — I suspect someone's ordering it from above!"

"I think so too!" Chang Qi agreed from the side. "Dragon Lair Mountain's foundation is still shallow. Though we have abundant resources, possession of treasure invites trouble. Perhaps Yingyue Hall has grown tired of trading with us and intends to swallow us whole."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, "You suspect Qian Tong?"

"Not impossible," Wu Yi nodded.

"Possible, but I don't think Qian Tong is involved," Yang Kai said slowly. Among those present he had the most dealings with Qian Tong; putting aside Qian Tong's nature, his friendship with Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er, and the debt of gratitude from having been rescued in Flowing Flame Sandland, all suggested Qian Tong would not betray them like that.

"You mentioned just now that three months ago the manager and servants of Yingyue Hall's Tianyun City shop were all replaced — is that true?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes, that's true," Wu Yi hurriedly nodded. "I frequent Tianyun City often, so I'm certain of that."

"Has Yingyue Hall had any strange or major incidents in the last half year?" Yang Kai frowned.

"As for Yingyue Hall itself, nothing abnormal has been seen. But on our side there have been some things in recent months: many unfamiliar faces came around Dragon Lair Mountain. At first they hovered outside, later a few actually broke in and were trapped by our formations. When we captured them they only claimed to have trespassed by mistake, and because their strength was low we didn't press them hard — we warned them and let them go. As for a major matter... there is indeed one."

Yang Kai's expression hardened, "What is it?"

"Master Gelin has died!" Wu Yi said in a grave tone.

"Master Gelin?" Yang Kai frowned and thought for a moment, then brightened, "The Origin-Grade Lower-Level artificer of Yingyue Hall?"

“That’s right — it happened about half a year ago. Rumor has it that after Master Gelin repaired a Secret Treasure for Yingyue Hall, his Qi and blood were greatly depleted, and his lifespan was running short. In the past few years, he hasn’t refined a single Secret Treasure. But what does that have to do with us?”

"I don't know the specifics, but it might be related," Yang Kai said, a thoughtful look passing his face. "I once heard Qian Tong say he had a close private friendship with Master Gelin."

Wu Yi pondered, then asked in surprise, "You mean Master Gelin's death affected Elder Qian Tong, and because Elder Qian Tong had sheltered us, we were affected as well?"

Yang Kai grinned, "I'm only speculating. Perhaps that old Qian Tong turned on us — but if this is truly an internal struggle within Yingyue Hall, it's best we keep our distance."

"Indeed, we must not meddle in Yingyue Hall's affairs," Wu Yi said, suddenly wary. She hadn't thought that deeply before, but Yang Kai's few words had awakened her to the essence of the situation.

"Any news of Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er?" Yang Kai asked again.

Wu Yi shook her head. "Yingyue Hall claims the two are in seclusion attempting to break into the Origin Returning Realm; the specifics are unclear."

"Understood. Relying on others is worse than relying on oneself. Since Yu Feng has been detained, I'll go fetch him myself. If the Saint Crystals are lost, so be it — but the men must not be harmed."

"That's twenty million Saint Crystals!" Wu Yi's face showed pain. "And how do you intend to do it?"

"If they have no shame, then we won't give them any face," Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Otherwise they'll truly think Dragon Lair Mountain is easy to bully."

Wu Yi was left speechless.

Yang Kai smiled and waved his hand, "If this is caused by internal strife within Yingyue Hall and we're being caught up in it, there's no need to be overly afraid. They're divided and stretched thin, so there likely aren't great experts stationed there. Besides, I want to know who exactly wants to move against Dragon Lair Mountain. If I don't go in person, how will I find out?"

"I'll accompany you!" Chang Qi stood up.

Hao An also said, "I'll go too! Although our cultivation isn't remarkable, we've reached the Origin Returning Realm. Since we advanced we haven't had the chance to test ourselves — this will be a good trial."

The two elders exchanged a glance and smiled at one another.

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then nodded, "Alright, I'll trouble the two Guest Elders. The rest of you should not follow; stay here."

"Be careful," Wu Yi warned.

After their plans were settled, Yang Kai immediately left the bamboo pavilion with Chang Qi and Hao An, produced the Star Shuttle, and set off straight for Tianyun City.

In Tianyun City, inside a shop called Juyuan Hall, within an inner chamber Yu Feng and the others were bound and gagged, each with faces bruised and swollen. Their Saint Yuan seemed to have vanished without a trace — clearly they had been subjected to a very powerful sealing formation.

The men were lined up in a row, kneeling on the floor.

Facing them sat a sinister-looking old man on a sandalwood chair. His hair was white, and he cradled a purple teapot in his hands. His eyes were half-closed as if asleep, yet the occasional flash of sharp light and malice showed he was more alert than he appeared.

“Speak. What is the safe route in and out of your Dragon Lair Mountain? Tell me, and I’ll let you go — save you from more pain and suffering.” Beside the old man, a burly, fierce-looking man held a whip as thick as three fingers, toying with it while he asked coldly.

"Pah!" Yu Feng spat a mouthful, mixed with blood, which landed squarely on the brute's cheek. "You think you'll get Dragon Lair Mountain's routes out of me? Dream on! I'd sooner die than tell you despicable scoundrels anything."

The hulking man did not flinch, letting the spit run down his cheek as he sneered. With a hiss the whip coiled and sang through the air before lashing down across Yu Feng's face.

With a crisp smack, Yu Feng's right cheek split open and a chunk of flesh flew free, blood spouting. He nearly slumped to the ground, but he quickly braced himself upright, bared his neck, and snarled, "Keep going — even if you beat me to death today you won't force a word from me. When you storm Dragon Lair Mountain, prepare to taste the might of its myriad formations, hahahaha!"

Yu Feng's arrogant laughter soured the hulking man's face, and the old man on the sandalwood chair grew impatient.
