## Chapter 1143 — Qian Tong Arrives

But no one paid any attention to his words. Xie Hongwen even rudely kicked him—"Get lost!"

Xie Hongwen's strength wasn't high, yet Luo Qing didn't dare evade that kick. He was shoved back several paces before regaining his footing and shouted urgently, "Young Master Xie, Elder Qian will be here soon. Please wait a moment—if the Elder takes offense, I cannot bear the blame."

"How presumptuous!" Xie Hongwen was fully enraged by Luo Qing, his face radiating violent aura as he glared at him, "What this Young Master intends to do is none of your business. Keep yammering and I'll have you killed!"

Luo Qing's face chilled; he dared not speak further. Although he was an Origin Returning Realm expert of Yingyue Hall, he had no powerful backing and couldn't contend with Xie Hongwen.

He could only turn and call toward Yang Kai, "Friend, hold on a little longer—everything will be fine soon. Just hold on a bit more."

Yang Kai frowned at him, thoroughly puzzled, and called back loudly, "Do we know each other?"

Luo Qing shook his head. "We don't."

Yang Kai sneered coldly, "If we don't know each other, then why help me?"

Luo Qing's face grew awkward; realizing his actions had aroused Yang Kai's suspicion, he thought for a moment and explained, "You may not have met me, but I've seen your image. Elder Qian circulated your likeness throughout Tianyun City's properties belonging to Yingyue Hall and instructed us to treat any encounter with you well. I, Luo Qing, am a guard of Jubao Tower, so I've seen the image."

"Qian Tong?" Yang Kai paused, then quickly understood. His previous deals with Qian Tong must have caught the man's attention—those transactions had been large, and Yang Kai had sold quite a number of Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures to him. It made sense that Qian Tong would consider him a valuable client.

After all, on Dark Star the strongest artificers only reached Lower-Level Origin-Grade; the Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures Yang Kai had sold were immensely valuable and easy to move, enough to raise several fighters' strength significantly.

But even so, Qian Tong needn't be so cautious. Yang Kai even felt a trace of flattery in it—yes, flattery! He had gone so far as to spread Yang Kai's image across all Yingyue Hall enterprises in Tianyun City and told those under him to treat Yang Kai well. If that isn't currying favor, what is?

He was a lone man—why would Qian Tong flatter him just because when he traded with him he had only just reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm?

Yang Kai wasn't a fool. His thoughts weren't overly meticulous, but he was sharp enough. A single turn of thought made him see the truth: Qian Tong wasn't currying favor with him. He was currying favor with the artificer who crafted those treasures.

In other words, the one Qian Tong sought to flatter was Yang Flame.

Qian Tong probably didn't even know Yang Flame existed; he might believe there's a highly skilled artificer behind Yang Kai.

Thinking of that, Yang Kai nodded slightly and cupped his fist to Luo Qing. "I appreciate your kindness, friend, but there's no need to trouble Elder Qian over this. We can handle it ourselves."

He disliked owing others favors. Even if Qian Tong had no ill intent, he wouldn't accept the debt; owing a favor made future refusals awkward, especially since Qian Tong clearly had ulterior motives regarding him.

Their conversation reached others' ears; Xu Zhibing's body went limp and he collapsed, while members of the Xu Family looked ashen and trembled.

Xu Zhibing hadn't expected that a little past kindness would backfire like this. He had gone to great trouble to bring Luo Qing, only to have it turn out like this. Yang Kai had connections to Elder Qian—why would he care about the trivial Xu Family? Had he known, he would never have invited Luo Qing. Even if the Family Head and the Guest Elders died, the Xu Family still had remaining bloodlines and a chance to rise again, but now even that slender hope had been cut off by his own hand.

How laughable—Yang Kai hadn’t even planned to wipe out his clan, yet he’d gone out of his way to seek revenge against him! The sheer irony of it made Xu Zhibing want to smash his head to death right there on Dragon Lair Mountain.

Once it was known Yang Kai and Elder Qian were acquainted, not only did the Xu Family panic as if bereft of parents, the Haike Family members broke into cold sweats. Ba Qingyan produced a handkerchief to continually wipe his brow; Ian's face turned ashen, his features twitching, emotions roiling.

He finally understood why he'd been feeling so uneasy—this was the reason.

He'd thought that by hitching his fortunes to Xie Hongwen, the Haike Family would prosper, but what was Xie Hongwen beside Qian Tong?

The former was nothing more than a profligate son who acted up because his father was an officer in Yingyue Hall. But Qian Tong was an Elder of Yingyue Hall! Even Xie Hongwen's father wouldn't dare speak loudly in front of Elder Qian, much less Xie Hongwen himself.

It's over—completely over! Ian's eyes dulled as if covered by a veil; his former spirit was gone and his lips grew pale.

Had he known things would turn out like this, how could he ever have offended Yang Kai so ruthlessly, even harboring thoughts of killing him as soon as possible? The Haike Family had countless chances to befriend Yang Kai, yet not a single person had seized them—not one had seen the situation clearly. Only Wu Yi, Yu Feng, and a few others had made the right choice.

But they had already left the family and were no longer considered Haike Family members!

"All of you putting on faces like you've lost your parents—what are you trying to do?" Xie Hongwen strode forward wrathfully and kicked Ian, then kicked the fallen Xu Zhibing again, crushing him until he curled up on the ground like a roasted shrimp.

"Crunch..." At that moment, the formation outside the cave suddenly faltered.

Xie Hongwen's face lit up. He shouted, "No matter the cost—kill that brat!"

Senior brothers Hong Zhen and his junior froze for a beat, then quickly realized Xie Hongwen's intent: to finish Yang Kai off before Elder Qian arrived.

If Yang Kai lived, they'd surely be punished by Elder Qian or even expelled from Yingyue Hall. But if Yang Kai died, even if they were chastised, the consequences would not be terrible.

After all, the dead had no value. Elder Qian wouldn't go so far as to kill two Origin Returning Realm men over a corpse. Besides, they could claim they were merely following orders from Xie Hongwen and his father.

With that thought, Hong Zhen and his junior no longer hesitated; they leapt forward toward the cave, murderous intent blazing, their gaze as if looking upon corpses.

"You dare!" Luo Qing cried in alarm, utterly unprepared for Xie Hongwen's ruthlessness. By the time he realized and tried to stop them, it was too late—Hong Zhen and his junior had already charged out.

A cold sneer formed on Xie Hongwen's face as he snorted, "You're still green if you want to fight me!"

Ian, as if revived, showed a delighted expression. Xie Hongwen's move was exactly what he wanted to see—he shared Xie Hongwen's concerns.

Hong Zhen and his junior moved like lightning. Even before they reached the cave, a crushing momentum swept over the entrance—their intention was to kill Yang Kai outright!

Yang Kai gave them a cold, meaningful smile that made Hong Zhen's two hearts beat unevenly.

"Not good—there's a formation!" Hong Zhen suddenly noticed the black-robed woman forming hand seals and realized something was wrong. He and his senior began to retreat, when a voice rent their innards.

"Open!" Yang Flame commanded in a low shout. The scene in front of the cave changed as if the world had been overturned; a thick mist surging up blocked vision, swallowing Hong Zhen and his junior until they vanished.

Yang Flame swiftly changed her hand seals, sending out several streams of Saint Yuan.
At once, shouts and cries echoed from within the mist, accompanied by violent bursts of energy.

The last time the Xu Family sent people here, Yang Flame's formation had been merely defensive. These past days, however, she had added killing arrays.

These formations alone could not slay two Origin Returning Realm experts, but if Yang Kai entered, Hong Zhen and his companion would likely meet a bad end.

Luo Qing stood dumbfounded; only now did he understand why Yang Kai had said what he did. The wondrous formation could trap Hong Zhen and the others, and even wound them.

As for killing two Origin Returning Realm experts, Luo Qing didn't believe Yang Kai could manage that. The Origin Returning Realm and the Saint King Realm were entirely different levels—no matter how talented, a Saint King Realm fighter could not realistically defeat an Origin Returning Realm opponent by leaping ranks.

"Begin." Yang Flame said calmly.

Yang Kai nodded. The long sword wreathed in Demonic Flame coalesced once more in his hand.

Before he could plunge into the formation, a roar echoed from afar: "Stop right there!"

Hearing that voice, Xie Hongwen trembled and terror showed across his face.

Qian Tong had arrived!

Yang Kai frowned—he hadn't expected Qian Tong to come so fast. Without hesitation he dashed into the formation.

The moment his body plunged into the mist he dissolved the Demonic Flame sword and instead forced out a drop of Golden Blood, which radiated soaring vitality and energy fluctuations. Even with the formation concealing it, a faint trace still leaked out.

He had to finish quickly before Qian Tong arrived. Qian Tong wasn't planning to interfere, but the Origin Returning Realm experts' concept of "Shi" piqued his curiosity. With two Origin Returning Realm men fallen within the formation, killing them would allow him to absorb their insights into the Heavenly and Martial Dao; perhaps he could comprehend what was called Shi.

If he could grasp that, he'd be exponentially stronger. He wouldn't miss such a rare chance.

As for Qian Tong, Yang Kai wasn't worried—as long as Qian Tong still wished to court the artificer behind him, he wouldn't make an enemy of Yang Kai. Besides, Yang Kai was being forced to fight back; it wasn't wanton murder.

So he didn't hesitate to use a drop of Golden Blood, transforming it into myriad golden lights that shot toward where Hong Zhen and his companion had entered the fog.

The golden rays began with blinding speed, but in the next instant they seemed to fall into quagmire and their velocity faltered.

Yang Kai understood—this was being affected by their Shi.
