## Chapter 1362 — Heaven-Shaking Pillar

Seeing this, Yang Kai was greatly satisfied. Qian Tong truly knew how to handle matters. His risking his life to rescue the man had finally yielded a return. Setting aside his personal feud with the Xie Family, the mere fact that Yingyue Hall had conceded a full ten percent discount on materials already represented a considerable benefit. Given Dragon Lair Mountain’s massive purchasing speed and demand, that would save an enormous amount of Saint Crystals over the course of a year.

The second matter concerned the Imperial Garden.

That day, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu joined forces to investigate the truth of the Imperial Garden. Though they were forced back by Imperial Might before they could approach, they were able to confirm one thing.

The Imperial Garden had truly manifested in the world; it was not a fleeting apparition like before. This time it had appeared in the sight of Dark Star’s cultivators in an utterly shocking form.

Moreover, over these many days numerous Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts rushed to probe it, yet none could get close to the Imperial Garden. How to enter it remained unknown. As the host here, Yingyue Hall had already widely issued invitations, summoning the leaders of many Dark Star factions to the main hall to discuss how to enter the Imperial Garden.

Qian Tong told Yang Kai that in the near future many powerful figures from all directions would be heading to Tianyun City, and quite a number of them were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

Although it was only one piece of news, Qian Tong’s meaning was clear: Yang Kai should keep a low profile for now and avoid causing trouble. Implicitly, even his feud with the Xie Family should be put on hold so he would not accidentally provoke someone.

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and displayed a faint, half-amused expression.

In truth, he would have stayed disciplined even without Qian Tong’s reminder. This was not a time for action, and Yang Kai had many matters to attend to. He might as well take this chance to fully seal off Dragon Lair Mountain and cultivate in peace.

Once the situation with the Imperial Garden became clearer, it wouldn’t be too late to make other plans. When the gathered experts eventually discovered a way to enter the Imperial Garden, Yang Kai would naturally claim a share of the spoils. Above all else, the Life Jade Nectar hidden somewhere within was something he was determined to obtain. Moreover, there was that ice-attributed Heaven and Earth Spirit—if the Phoenix Empress inheritance could devour it, the Ice Phoenix’s remnant soul would surely grow stronger. When the time came to find Su Yan and pass that inheritance on to her, the benefits she would gain would be even greater.

With plans formed, Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame rolled across his palm as he burned the letter Qian Tong had sent to ashes. He then told Wu Yi and Qian Yue to take good care of Yang Yan, handed his damaged Purple Shield to the two women and asked them to tell Yang Yan to repair it, and then he returned alone to his stone residence.

Yang Kai first inspected the Red Candle Fruit he had been cultivating there and found that, after these years under the Red Candle Base’s nourishment and abundant Spiritual Qi, the flesh of that single Red Candle Fruit showed no signs of withering nor any loss of efficacy, which made him very satisfied.

Back when he reclaimed the Red Candle Base in the Flowing Flame Sandland, that decision had truly been the right one. He did not know how the other factions preserved Red Candle Fruit flesh, but with their methods even if they had stored it well, the medicinal potency would likely have diminished by now. His, however, remained intact.

This was a fine treasure. Refined into a pill, it could help a cultivator break through the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm bottleneck and ascend to the Void King Realm! Although Yang Kai had no immediate need, there would come a day when it would be used.

The faint fragrance of the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense drifted through the stone residence, subtle yet possessing a wondrous ability to clear the mind and calm the spirit. Meanwhile, the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree constantly exuded an indescribable aura, aiding one in cultivating and comprehending profound martial arts and secret techniques.

The little stone residence concealed countless treasures that would make others envious.

After inspecting these treasures, Yang Kai returned to his usual secluded cultivation spot, sat cross-legged, and sorted his thoughts.

No matter what, strengthening his own power was the true priority now. If those experts truly managed to discover a way to enter the Imperial Garden, he would need a strong enough foundation to back him up—only then could he contend with the various great powers of Dark Star within it.

There was no hope for a rapid breakthrough into the Origin Returning Realm in the short term, but increasing strength was not only achieved through realm advancement; many other methods existed.

With that in mind, Yang Kai’s expression grew resolute. With a wave of his hand he produced the spoils from this outing.

The gains were few but each priceless. Not only the long-lost Life Jade Nectar, but even the Formation Talisman of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation was a mighty killing tool. Two of Yang Kai’s Secret Treasures had been lost in this action — one self-destructed, another was damaged — so he was short on replacements. This Formation Talisman’s appearance was perfectly timed.

As long as he refined it properly, it wouldn’t take much time for his strength to increase greatly.

There was also that pitch-black, impossibly heavy staff. Yang Kai had never been able to discern what material it was forged from, but its weight was utterly beyond imagination. It didn’t even need to possess any special power—by sheer mass alone, if someone could wield it, a single swing would be unstoppable.

This was precisely the principle of overwhelming skill with sheer strength.

But Yang Kai ruefully discovered that even with his strength, he could not employ the staff as a weapon, and he sighed in regret.

Three items—no more, no less.

Yet Yang Kai had far more to deal with than merely these three.

After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai touched his hand and the Void King-Grade refining furnace appeared. The artifact spirit’s birdcall sounded, and a strange bird three zhang tall immediately appeared in the stone residence.

The Artifact Spirit shifted and alighted on Yang Kai’s shoulder, using its long beak to preen its feathers.

Yang Kai glanced at it and smiled, then communicated with it by Divine Sense. After a moment, the Fire Bird cocked its head at the specially made ring in Yang Kai’s hand, its eyes flickering with seriousness and excitement.

There was also some hesitation and lingering fear — very human traits.

“If you don’t want it, then go back and continue helping me refine Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

No sooner had he spoken than the Artifact Spirit transformed into a ball of fire and dashed for the ring. Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and, driving it with Divine Sense, the ring emitted a suction that drew the Artifact Spirit inside.

The Artifact Spirit could not resist the temptation Yang Kai had offered, and Yang Kai was very pleased.

Moments later the ring flashed and Yang Kai released the Artifact Spirit. Its form was somewhat different from before: within its blazing body there now swam a scarlet light, writhing like a spiritual serpent.

The Artifact Spirit shrieked as flames surged across its body, seemingly struggling to assimilate that scarlet light.

Sun's True Fire!

Inside Yang Kai’s ring were only two things: the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Platform and the Sun’s True Essence.

The last time, the Artifact Spirit had devoured and refined a wisp of the Sun’s True Fire, gaining immense benefit and growth from it. Yet within the Imperial Garden, when it fought against that ice-attribute Heaven and Earth Spirit, it had still seemed to be at a disadvantage—showing just how fierce and troublesome that icy Spirit truly was.

Since Yang Kai intended to take aim at that ice-aspect Heaven and Earth Spirit, he deliberately sought to raise the Artifact Spirit’s strength and potency, and devouring the Sun's True Fire was the most effective and rapid method.

Of course there was danger, so he inquired of the Artifact Spirit’s willingness. It did not disappoint him; its craving for the Sun's True Fire overcame its fear, and it willingly dove into the ring to absorb a trace of Sun's True Fire.

Having prior experience, the Artifact Spirit performed much better this time than it had in the Corpse Den. Though under the assault of that Sun's True Fire it became somewhat unstable and its fire-aspect spiritual power fluctuated chaotically, it did not fall into unconsciousness.

Yang Kai smiled and touched the refining furnace again; the Artifact Spirit returned to it and began to assimilate the Sun's True Fire’s energy.

He believed that before long, when the Artifact Spirit next appeared, it would be far stronger than before.

After dealing with the Artifact Spirit, Yang Kai put away the refining furnace and picked up the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation’s Formation Talisman to study it closely.

When he obtained the talisman he had not had time to examine it. He had only heard from Cai He and Du Sisi that it was valuable and long lost. Now inspecting it, he found the material was neither metal nor wood. Though resembling a wooden plate and palm-sized, it had weight. Its back bore many white cloud patterns that, if stared at, could give one the illusion of sinking into an inescapable sea of clouds. Yang Kai’s heart tightened; he hastily withdrew his gaze, gripped it in his palm, closed his eyes, and used Saint Yuan and Divine Sense to begin refining it.

The Formation Talisman had been crafted by a Formation Artificer, akin to a Secret Treasure. Refining it was like refining a Secret Treasure, yet required little effort to fully assimilate — extremely convenient.

A month passed in the blink of an eye. During that period Yang Kai had been refining the talisman, and now he had successfully absorbed it into his body. With a bit more comprehension of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation’s mysteries, he could deploy the great formation anywhere at will.

Receiving this wondrous treasure, Yang Kai was ecstatic; it made up for the gap left after the Hundred Mountains Painting’s self-destruction, and the talisman’s power would certainly surpass that of the Hundred Mountains Painting.

Just then Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes to find Yang Yan sitting before him, staring at the one-foot-long jet-black staff on the ground in a daze.

Though still shrouded in a black robe, Yang Kai noticed a strange expression on her face, as if she were recalling something.

“When did you arrive?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Yang Yan actually had the stone residence’s restriction token, yet Yang Kai had sensed no sign of her arrival, which was somewhat strange.

“A few days. I didn’t disturb you because I saw you refining the talisman,” Yang Yan replied cheerfully, pointing at the black staff on the ground. “Is this Heaven-Shaking Pillar something you brought back from the Imperial Garden?”

“Heaven-Shaking Pillar?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, as if remembering something, then looked at her in surprise. “You recognize the characters on it?”
