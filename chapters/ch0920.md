## Chapter 920 — No Pill Furnace?

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land. After Yang Kai returned, he immediately summoned Xu Hui and ordered him to send people out to scout for news.

Yang Kai didn’t tell him exactly what to look for; he only commanded him to dispatch many disciples in every direction, instructing them to keep an eye out for any major events along their routes and to return to the Nine Peaks within a month.

Xu Hui complied without asking questions.

From Yang Kai’s grave expression, Xu Hui sensed an unusual air; the Saint Lord must have discovered something, otherwise he would not act this way.

A few days later.

At dawn, Yang Kai entered his room and tiptoed to the edge of the bed.

On the bed, Xia Ningshang still had her eyes closed in meditation; her delicate body lay motionless, evidently still digesting and absorbing the teachings of the True Alchemy Formula.

Yang Kai waited quietly for a moment; when she didn’t respond, he slipped into her Sea of Consciousness.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai’s arrival, the little senior sister slowly opened her eyes, her beautiful gaze curving into a crescent—exquisitely lovely.

"Any gains?" Yang Kai asked.

"Almost—just need to get familiar through practice," Xia Ningshang nodded lightly.

Yang Kai nodded. He had wrapped the True Alchemy Formula’s information in a Divine Sense and transmitted it directly into her spirit body; with her aptitude and insight for alchemy, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to absorb the technique thoroughly over a few days.

"Let’s go—let’s start refining pills now. I’ll introduce you to a few masters along the way." Yang Kai grinned and withdrew his spirit body.

In the next moment, both of them awoke.

They entered the alchemy chamber together.

The five masters were already arrayed in strict formation. Each had a compact, exquisite alchemy furnace before them, its surface traced with glittering luminous patterns—none were common pieces, all were Saint-Grade furnaces, each a most treasured Secret Treasure of its owner.

After ten days of rest, the five were now full of vigor, spirits high, faces expectant.

Seeing Yang Kai appear, the five masters’ expressions flickered; they smiled and inclined their heads.

Chang Bao leaned his plump frame against the wall and teased, "Not refining for ten days and I’m already missing the feel of it. Kid, let’s get started."

Yang Kai smiled, "That’s exactly my plan."

"But you’re refining and you bring along your beloved—can’t bear to be apart for a moment?" He Feng chuckled and shook his head. "Young people are full of ardor."

"Don’t go making out in front of us old geezers; we’re not young anymore—too exciting a scene and we might keel over." Hong Fang laughed.

Xia Ningshang was left flustered, utterly at a loss, her face flushed crimson as she kept casting embarrassed glances at Yang Kai.

"Come, little miss, sit over here with me—ignore these old men!" Kong Ruoyu beckoned to Xia Ningshang kindly.

Xia Ningshang looked to Yang Kai; when he nodded, she went to Kong Ruoyu and sat cross-legged.

"Such a gentle young lady, eyes pure and untainted by this world—Yang Kai, you mustn’t mistreat her in future," Kong Ruoyu said earnestly.

"Rest assured, senior; I only love my senior sister and would never mistreat her."

The five masters were momentarily taken aback; they hadn’t expected Yang Kai to speak so bluntly in front of everyone. But if it didn’t come from the heart, he couldn’t have said it so plainly.

Realizing the depth of his feeling for the masked girl, they all showed approving expressions.

A trace of happiness also surfaced in Xia Ningshang’s eyes.

"Enough small talk—let’s begin." Du Wan, who had been smiling quietly and not speaking, finally spoke.

Yang Kai called to the outside, "Elder!

Xu Hui pushed open the door and entered, his expression solemn. "I have been waiting."

As he spoke, he set down trays of prepared medicinal materials. "These are the materials for twenty pills today. Saint Lord and the masters, please take care of them; I’ll come back for the pills by evening."

"Elder, bring ten more sets of materials from outside." Yang Kai instructed.

Xu Hui was stunned, "Ten more?"

The five masters looked at Yang Kai in surprise. Chang Bao said, "Kid, pill refining also requires balance; if you force it when in poor condition, you risk failure or poor-quality pills. We’ve seen you refine ten in a day, but the five of us together can barely manage ten. What are we to do with ten more?"

"Yes—if they’re bad, it’s better not to refine at all." Du Wan advised earnestly. A top alchemist holds strict standards; poor pills would tarnish their reputation.

Excellent alchemists would never allow inferior pills to circulate; if they produced them, they would destroy them with their own hands.

Yang Kai glanced at them and smiled wryly. "I understand what you’re saying, but don’t worry—the extra ten sets won’t be refined by me or by you masters."

"Then who will refine them?" He Feng widened his eyes and looked toward Xu Hui with suspicion.

The elder hurriedly waved his hand and laughed awkwardly. "Don’t look at me—I only know how to take pills; alchemy baffles me completely."

He Feng nodded slightly. "You don’t seem like the refining type."

Xu Hui’s face darkened; he thought these masters spoke remarkably plainly.

"Yang Kai…" Kong Ruoyu pondered and glanced at Xia Ningshang, "You don’t mean to have your senior sister refine the extra ten, do you?"

At these words, everyone looked toward Xia Ningshang.

Yang Kai gave a chuckle, "That’s exactly what I mean."

"She can refine Saint Pills?" Chang Bao nearly popped his eyes out and exclaimed, "Impossible—she’s only a little older than you; even if she’d practiced from the cradle, she couldn’t possibly have the ability to refine Saint Pills."

Yang Kai forced a bitter laugh. "I didn’t practice from the cradle either…"

The masters stared at him, some indignant. "You’re different—you can’t be judged by ordinary standards."

"Can she truly refine Saint Pills?"

"I don’t believe it."

"Don’t joke with us, kid—don’t make the old men anxious."

This was their domain and authority; to be surpassed by a rising talent would be one thing, but to be eclipsed by his senior sister would be a blow they couldn’t foresee.

They would feel despondent, perhaps irreparably shaken…

"I can do it…" Xia Ningshang suddenly spoke.

Du Wan’s brow lifted; he recalled something and fixed his gaze on Yang Kai. "Is she the senior sister you once mentioned—who’s even better than you at alchemy?"

Back in Giant Stone City, Yang Kai had casually mentioned a senior sister whose alchemical skill surpassed his; Du Wan had been skeptical then, but now he suddenly remembered.

Yang Kai nodded.

Du Wan inhaled deeply and said gravely, "Seeing is believing—Elder, please bring ten more sets of materials."

Xu Hui said no more and hurried away.

Before long, ten more sets of materials were brought in.

The chamber was closed; seven people sat cross-legged in different spots.

The five masters didn’t immediately begin refining; instead they watched Xia Ningshang with brilliant eyes, wanting to see whether she truly could refine a Saint Pill.

Under the fivefold scrutiny, Xia Ningshang glanced shyly at Yang Kai.

He had already started grinding out pills in silence, which made her pout.

"Little miss, what furnace do you use? Can you show it to this old man?" Kong Ruoyu asked kindly, seeing she seemed nervous and hoping to ease her tension.

"I don’t have a furnace," Xia Ningshang answered softly.

"No furnace?" The five were stunned. Chang Bao snapped, "How can you refine without a furnace? This brat was just teasing us—how foolish I was to fall for it!"

"Silence!" Kong Ruoyu shot him a look, then smiled at Xia Ningshang. "You don’t use a furnace to refine?"

Xia Ningshang nodded.

Even Kong Ruoyu’s expression turned peculiar; though skeptical, he felt that a girl with such clear eyes and pure temperament was unlikely to lie.

"Then show us how you usually refine—perform one now for our observation. We’re not interested in much else; we’re alchemy-obsessed and want to see how a Saint Pill can be made without a furnace."

Xia Ningshang nodded again and slowly closed her lovely eyes, as if steadying herself.

After a moment, when she opened them, the masters found her temperament had changed utterly.

The formerly coy Xia Ningshang now radiated a confidence; her gaze was calm and her movements steady.

She brought a set of alchemical materials before her, inspecting each herb with meticulous care.

"Saint Pill ingredients…" Kong Ruoyu muttered, "She’s gone straight for the Saint Pill materials—could she really refine it?"

The five masters focused their attention on Xia Ningshang.

The little senior sister showed no more signs of nervousness; it seemed she had entered another world—before her existed only the Saint Pill materials and nothing else.

Soft power welled up within Xia Ningshang’s body.

At the instant the masters felt this power, all were dumbstruck.
