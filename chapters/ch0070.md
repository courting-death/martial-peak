## Chapter 70 — One Against Five

Meng Wuya’s words were filled with melancholy, as if spoken from the depths of his heart. Xia Ningshang could naturally sense the grief woven into his voice.

Had Master experienced such a thing before? Just as she was about to ask, Meng Wuya had already vanished.

At the same time, at the Black Wind Trade Market, in front of the wooden hut where Lingxiao Pavilion’s guarding disciples resided, a young man drenched in sweat hurried over. He lightly knocked on the door, calming his heavy breaths before softly calling out, “Senior Sister Su.”

“What is it?” came a cold, distant voice from inside. It was pleasant to hear but carried a chill that kept others at arm’s length.

The youth shivered as if the sweat on his body had turned to ice, then said, “Young Master Su Mu was knocked unconscious. His men were captured by the Law Enforcement Hall and locked up in the Forest Prison.”

Before he finished speaking, the door of the wooden hut suddenly opened. Su Yan, dressed in white, appeared before him.

The young man quickly took two steps back, lowering his head, unwilling to meet the gaze of Su Yan’s flawless and stunningly beautiful face.

“Explain clearly. What happened?” Su Yan asked calmly, but the entire hut radiated a palpable, chilling coldness. The floor creaked with the sound of ice forming.

The youth hurriedly recounted the entire incident in brief. After finishing, he waited for a long moment without any response. Unable to hold back, he softly called, “Senior Sister Su?”

Still no reply. Gathering his courage, he glanced up—and found no trace of Su Yan. She had left without anyone noticing.

“Oh my!” The Lingxiao Pavilion disciple nearly collapsed, dropping heavily to the ground.

This Senior Sister Su was far too cold! Whoever married her in the future would probably have to sleep under a quilt even in the hottest summer. But someone as pure and noble as Su Yan—surely no man in the world could be worthy of her.

No one had expected that a mere dispute among the younger disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion would stir such a storm, drawing the attention of many powerful forces.

Inside Lingxiao Pavilion’s Forest Prison, Yang Kai and Li Yuntian remained imprisoned. More than an hour had passed since their capture, yet outside, there was still no sign of movement.

Li Yuntian grew anxious, wondering why Su Mu had not taken action yet. But then he recalled that Su Mu had been knocked unconscious—he didn’t even know if Su Mu had woken up. If he hadn’t, there was naturally no hope for rescue.

Just as worry crept in, the heavy door of the Forest Prison suddenly opened. Footsteps echoed as a disciple of the Law Enforcement Hall approached the cell where Yang Kai and the others were held. Unlocking the door, he called out, “Who is Yang Kai?”

Yang Kai responded in a low voice, “I am.”

“Come with me!” The Law Enforcement disciple ordered curtly. “Someone wishes to see you.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. He let out a cold chuckle, showing no fear, and strode out.

“Senior Brother Yang, don’t go! Let Young Master Su come to rescue us!” Li Yuntian exclaimed, grabbing Yang Kai’s arm.

“Let go!” The Law Enforcement disciple shouted angrily. “Anyone who dares to obstruct us is an enemy of the Law Enforcement Hall. You know the consequences.”

Yang Kai turned to Li Yuntian. “I’m going to see. Don’t worry.”

Li Yuntian reluctantly released him, warning gravely, “Senior Brother Yang, be careful!”

“Hmph!” The Law Enforcement disciple sneered. “Overestimating yourself.”

Once outside the cell, the disciple locked the door again, then led Yang Kai down the corridor.

Soon, they arrived at a room. The disciple pushed open the door and sneered mockingly, “Please come in.”

Yang Kai glanced at him coldly, then stepped inside with a smirk.

The Law Enforcement disciple followed and slammed the door shut.

Almost the moment the door closed, Yang Kai spun around and struck the disciple who had brought him in with a palm infused with scorching True Yang Primordial Qi. The man screamed in pain as he was slammed against the wall.

He had never expected Yang Kai to dare attack him. The blow landed solidly, nearly knocking the breath out of him.

“What audacity!” An angry shout rang out from inside the room, followed by three or four figures moving in unison to attack Yang Kai.

Yang Kai managed to block one strike, but in the next moment, he was knocked to the ground and pummeled with fists and kicks.

Amid the chaos, Yang Kai roared fiercely, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. The metallic sweetness of blood stirred his spirit, igniting his entire body. His True Yang Primordial Qi surged through his meridians at an astonishing speed, the burning heat radiating from his bones turning his skin crimson.

This surge of energy from his bones seemed far greater than before.

With a furious roar, Yang Kai twisted wildly, leaping into the air. He kicked out with both feet, striking the heads of two Law Enforcement disciples. Their startled cries echoed as they staggered backward.

Before Yang Kai could land, another assailant lunged from the side, grabbing his kicking ankle with precision. With a powerful swing, he flung Yang Kai against the wall. Yang Kai grunted, his internal organs churning.

Struggling to rise, Yang Kai wiped the blood from his mouth and, by the dim light in the room, assessed the situation.

This was a sealed chamber with five Law Enforcement disciples inside. Judging by the energy fluctuations during the fight, Yang Kai estimated their strength to be around the early stages of the Open Origin Realm, while the one who had thrown him was clearly at the Qi Movement Realm.

One against five—and with such a disparity in realms—this battle was doomed from the start.

Yet Yang Kai smiled. In the face of adversity, a fierce fighting spirit surged within him.

“How dare you strike first!” The Qi Movement disciple sneered coldly. “Quite bold of you!”

The other four stood behind him, their faces cold as they glared at Yang Kai.

They had been ordered by Cao Zhengwen to teach Yang Kai a lesson—just not to kill him. They hadn’t expected Yang Kai to strike first, catching them off guard and losing face.

“Heh heh.” Yang Kai leaned against the wall, lowering his head slightly. His crimson eyes flicked over the five men as he said coldly, “You want to hit me—do you think I won’t resist?”

The Qi Movement disciple’s expression darkened, a sinister smile curling on his lips. “You’re clever. Since you know our intentions, don’t resist. Just let us beat you so Young Master Wei can vent his anger. If you dare resist, you might lose an arm or a leg!”

“You’re welcome to try,” Yang Kai said coldly.

“Stubborn fool! Attack!”

At the command, all five moved again with ruthless intent, showing no mercy. With their strength, any one of them could easily handle Yang Kai alone. Now, all five attacking together, teaching him a lesson would be effortless.
