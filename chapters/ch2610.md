## Chapter 2610 — Guaranteeing an Elder’s Seat

His gaze swept over the hundred or so people ahead, and Yang Kai grinned, saying, “Netherworld Sect, huh... truly like a lingering Yin-Soul that refuses to disperse.”

Among these hundred or so people, there were a dozen or so whose auras were extremely cold and sinister, including that old man surnamed Wu and the one who had previously attacked Qi Hai. It was obvious they all cultivated evil, yin-based arts.

The aura of these people gave Yang Kai the same feeling as when he had previously encountered Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen.

Thus, the identities of this dozen or so were clear.

In the Eastern Territory, beyond the Netherworld Sect, there were likely no comparable forces.

Excluding these dozen or so Netherworld Sect members, the rest varied in strength. At this moment, their gazes toward Qi Hai were filled with concern, so they were probably from the Qi Family Stronghold.

Very soon, Yang Kai’s gaze fixed on another old man, his brows furrowing slightly as he said, “Old Ban? Why are you here too?”

This old man was precisely the guide who had previously led him and Ruoxi into the Ancient Land—Old Ban.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Old Ban gave a bitter smile. “They want to enter the Ancient Land... I am the fish on the chopping block, powerless to resist...”

With a single sentence, he expressed all the helplessness in his heart.

“Shut up, old thing!” A Netherworld Sect disciple beside Old Ban immediately glared at him. Old Ban’s face changed, and he truly dared not speak further, but he secretly sent a voice transmission: “Young man, hurry and leave. These Netherworld Sect people seem to be here specifically for you.”

But before he finished speaking, that same Netherworld Sect disciple who had glared at him shouted harshly, “Old thing, you dare to secretly transmit your voice? Courting death!”

As soon as he finished, he struck at Old Ban with his palm.

Old Ban only had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Although his voice transmission was extremely covert, the Origin Qi fluctuations it caused could not escape the notice of this Netherworld Sect disciple at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Seeing this old fellow refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, the disciple immediately decided to teach him a lesson.

After all, the Vice Sect Master had already found the person he was looking for, so there was no need to enter the Ancient Land. Since they weren’t going in, there was no need for a guide. Killing him didn’t matter.

This palm strike was merciless. As the wind howled, Old Ban’s face turned deathly pale.

Just as the palm was about to land on Old Ban, another hand suddenly shot out from the front, meeting it in a bizarre fashion.

“Who is it?” The Netherworld Sect disciple who attacked was shocked. Before he could see who it was, their palms had already collided.

A surging, tsunami-like force crashed into him. The Netherworld Sect disciple only felt that this power tore through his defenses like rotten wood, rampaging through his body.

Pu...

A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out. The Netherworld Sect disciple was sent flying backward, tumbling across the ground several times.

When he finally got up and checked himself, his face instantly turned ashen as he cried out in despair, “My meridians... my meridians have been destroyed!”

He raised his head and howled hysterically. Only then did he see that the one who had struck him was actually that Yang Kai fellow. Gritting his teeth, he said, “You’re truly ruthless!”

Yang Kai rescued Old Ban, wrapped him up and brought him back, then looked indifferently at the Netherworld Sect disciple and said, “Kid, didn’t your elders teach you to respect the old and care for the young? If you lack even this bit of virtue, crippling your meridians is just a small punishment. Next time you see an elder, don’t be so rude.”

The Netherworld Sect disciple was already in utter despair. Now, hearing Yang Kai’s lecture, he couldn’t help but spit out another mouthful of blood and turned to the old man surnamed Wu, crying, “Vice Sect Master, my meridians have been destroyed! Please seek justice for me!”

The old man surnamed Wu snorted coldly, “Disgraceful. Get lost.”

The disciple was stunned. He never expected the Vice Sect Master to be so heartless—not only refusing to help, but even scolding him. He instantly lost the will to live, and in a fit of rage, his eyes rolled back and he fainted on the spot.

The old man surnamed Wu looked coldly at Yang Kai and snorted, “First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Not bad cultivation.”

Yang Kai grinned at him and shamelessly replied, “Just so-so...”

As he spoke, Yang Kai turned his head, the smile fading from his face. His gaze grew cold as he looked at Qi Hai and said, “Brother Qi, it seems you’ve done something to let me down. I must say, I’m truly disappointed.”

Qi Hai’s face grew uneasy, full of shame and embarrassment, but he still gritted his teeth and said, “Brother Yang, I had no choice. My wife’s life is hanging by a thread. It’s a pity you possess the True Phoenix Fire but refuse to lend a hand, so I could only rely on others.”

Yang Kai sighed and said indifferently, “Brother Qi, I truly admire your feelings for your wife. It’s just a pity... even though you betrayed me, it seems this Vice Sect Master doesn’t appreciate it.”

Qi Hai’s face turned even more bitter.

The reason the Netherworld Sect people approached the Qi Family Stronghold was simply because they were the local power and knew more about the Ancient Land than others. At the time, Qi Hai was furious at Yang Kai’s extreme stinginess, unwilling to help with even the slightest effort, so he agreed without hesitation to Vice Sect Master Wu’s request, bringing dozens of Qi Family Stronghold disciples to search for Yang Kai in the Ancient Land.

But before they could enter, Yang Kai actually came out on his own and ran into them.

“It all depends on people’s efforts,” Qi Hai said through gritted teeth. “I believe that with sincerity, even metal and stone can be split. As long as Vice Sect Master Wu is willing to lend me the True Phoenix Fire, I am willing to pay any price.”

As he spoke, Qi Hai turned to look at the old man surnamed Wu, whose expression remained indifferent, showing no reaction at all.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Brother Qi, you speak well, but... didn’t Qi Hefeng tell you that the True Phoenix Fire is no longer with me?”

Qi Hai gave a bitter smile, “Brother Yang, something as precious as the True Phoenix Fire—who would give it away if they obtained it? I only wanted you to do me a small favor. To you, it’s just a lift of your hand, but to me, it’s more important than my own life. Why are you so evasive?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. “Believe it or not, the True Phoenix Fire was given away long ago, and the person who has it isn’t here. Originally, I thought, since you once did me a favor, when she returns I’d bring her to the Qi Family Stronghold to help out—after all, it’s not a big deal. But now… as for your wife’s Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle poison, you’ll just have to leave it to fate.”

Qi Hai’s face changed dramatically, his voice trembling, “Brother Yang... is the True Phoenix Fire really not with you anymore?”

Yang Kai snorted and couldn’t be bothered to say more. In truth, he and Qi Hai didn’t have much of a relationship. Last time in the Shattered Star Sea, not killing him to silence him was already his good fortune. This time, Qi Hai had even spread the news that he possessed the True Phoenix Fire, which was truly infuriating.

Seeing Yang Kai’s expression, Qi Hai suddenly realized Yang Kai probably wasn’t lying. After all, when Qi Hefeng returned to Qi Family Stronghold, he had already mentioned this.

Now that Yang Kai had reiterated it, Qi Hai couldn’t help but believe it a bit more.

For a moment, he was filled with endless regret, the bitterness in his mouth worse than eating bitter herbs. He stood there, utterly lost, like a fool.

“You’re the Vice Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai turned to the burly old man, raising his brows.

“Insolence!” The old man who had attacked Qi Hai earlier shouted angrily. “How dare you not kneel before the Vice Sect Master!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Who does he think he is? He’s not qualified to make me kneel.”

The old man wanted to say more, but was stopped by the old man surnamed Wu.

The old man surnamed Wu looked at Yang Kai calmly and nodded, “You have a good temperament and strong cultivation. Boy, this Lord wishes to recruit you into the Netherworld Sect. What do you think?”

“Ah?” All the Netherworld Sect disciples were shocked. None of them expected the Vice Sect Master to value Yang Kai so highly. The Netherworld Sect was a top sect in the Eastern Territory, second only to the Soul Palace. Not just anyone could join.

But with the Vice Sect Master’s word, recruiting someone was naturally no problem.

The Netherworld Sect disciple whose meridians had been crippled happened to wake up at this moment. Hearing this, he was instantly stunned, staring wide-eyed at Yang Kai.

“Recruit me into the Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh.

The old man surnamed Wu nodded, “That’s right. This Lord is Wu Yuanzheng, Vice Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect. As long as you agree, this Lord is qualified to accept you as a disciple.”

Yang Kai scratched his face and said leisurely, “A Netherworld Sect disciple... I’m not really interested.”

Wu Yuanzheng said, “What if this Lord offers you an elder’s position?”

“What?” All the Netherworld Sect disciples were as if struck by lightning, frozen in place.

The disciple whose meridians had been crippled spat out another mouthful of blood and fainted again.

He had hoped the Vice Sect Master would avenge him and kill Yang Kai, but things had taken an unexpected turn. Not only did the Vice Sect Master have no intention of avenging him, he even wanted to recruit Yang Kai and offer him an elder’s seat.

If Yang Kai really became a Netherworld Sect elder, how could he ever get revenge? The matter of his crippled meridians would likely be left unsettled.

“Elder...” Yang Kai was dumbfounded, as if he couldn’t believe his ears. He turned to Ji Yao and said, “Yao’er, did your master mishear?”

Ji Yao replied expressionlessly, “Disciple heard it too.”

She couldn’t help but sneer. Her master was the founder of Ice Heart Valley, whose status was on par with the Netherworld Sect. This Wu Yuanzheng actually wanted her master to be an elder in the Netherworld Sect. Did he get kicked in the head by a donkey? Truly laughable.

Wu Yuanzheng said calmly, “Of course, the premise is that you must hand over the True Phoenix Fire to this Lord. As long as you do, all grudges between you and the Netherworld Sect will be wiped clean. This Lord will guarantee you an elder’s seat. What do you think?”

Yang Kai looked excited. “That does sound pretty good.”

Wu Yuanzheng smiled slightly. “Our sect is a top sect in the Eastern Territory. Even as an elder, your status would be no less than the sect master of a second-rate sect. You’re still young, with great prospects. In time, it’s not impossible for you to reach this Lord’s position.”
