## Chapter 1981 — Origin Condensing Pill

Once he stepped inside, Yang Kai immediately felt a scorching force rush toward him.

“Alchemist Yang should remain here and properly contemplate the mysteries of those pill formulas; do not rush the pill-refining—wait until you are ready.” Kang Siran, fearing Alchemist Yang was not fully prepared, added the admonition.

Yang Kai nodded, then turned and said, “By the way, Shopkeeper Kang, which type of Spiritual Pill is your workshop most short of right now?”

“Naturally it’s the Origin Condensing Pill. Fenglin City is filled with Void King Realm practitioners, and their demand for this kind of Spiritual Pill is enormous. Our Origin Condensing Pills often sell out as soon as they are produced,” Kang Siran replied with a proud expression.

“I understand.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, already turning the matter over in his mind.

……

There were countless Spiritual Pills and miraculous medicines in the world, and an uncountable number of pill formulas, but if one asked which pill martial artists demanded most, aside from those for healing and restoration, it was the Origin Condensing Pill!

The use of the Origin Condensing Pill accompanied a Void King Realm cultivator for many years; every Void King Realm practitioner had a tremendous need for this Spiritual Pill because it promoted the conversion of Origin Qi within the body.

Fenglin City was not large, and Dao Origin Realm experts were few, yet it had become a gathering place for many Void King Realm practitioners; the demand for Origin Condensing Pills there was predictably terrifying.

In Fenglin City, an alchemist’s shop without Origin Condensing Pills simply wouldn’t see any customers.

The Origin Condensing Pill formula at the Spiritual Pill Workshop conspicuously came from an Imperial-Grade Pillmaster and had been improved, making it roughly ten percent stronger than ordinary Origin Condensing Pills, earning it countless praises and followers.

Numerous martial artists tried to purchase Origin Condensing Pills from the workshop; every time a new batch of Origin Condensing Pills came off the furnace, they were bought out in a frenzy.

This was also the result of Kang Siran limiting how many each person could buy.

If purchases were not limited, they would likely seize them even more fiercely!

Now that the workshop’s Origin Condensing Pills had gone out of stock, many long-time customers were naturally upset.

Outside the refining room, Kang Siran paced back and forth, his mood anxious; his strength and position made him normally calm, yet now he was like an ant on a hot pan.

If he listened closely, he could even hear the impatient urging of Void King Realm practitioners at the workshop’s entrance.

Thump, thump, thump… a series of footsteps sounded from above.

Kang Siran did not need to look to know the assistants had hurried over.

He halted his steps and, before they could speak, snapped irritably, “Didn’t I tell you to go placate those customers? Why have you come back down?”

“It’s not good, shopkeeper. The scene is getting out of control. Our workshop should have produced new Origin Condensing Pills yesterday; many regular customers have been queued since yesterday to buy, but nothing has arrived—they’re already displeased.”

“Being displeased changes what? Do you expect me to pull them out of thin air? Tell them to wait!” Kang Siran answered impatiently.

“We’ve told them many times, but they won’t listen,” the assistant said with a distressed face, “and, and…”

“And what?” Kang Siran’s expression darkened.

“Rumors are being spread saying our Spiritual Pill Workshop will stop supplying Spiritual Pills in the future. Some customers, impatient, have already left,” the assistant replied quietly.

“Zhuo Ningsi! That wench!” Kang Siran ground his teeth.

Though he had not seen it with his own eyes, his shrewdness told him Zhuo Ningsi had ordered people to stir up trouble; that vicious woman would not miss a chance to kick a man when he was down—she longed for the workshop’s early collapse.

Despite his contempt, this was truly troublesome.

If they could not produce Origin Condensing Pills in a short time, those unaware customers might believe the rumor; at that point they would certainly lose a great many clients, which would be a devastating blow to the workshop’s future.

But in the face of this situation, what could Kang Siran do?

He turned his head and looked anxiously at the tightly closed refining room door, silently praying that Yang Kai would not disappoint him.

“Shopkeeper, can this Alchemist Yang really do it?” the assistant asked, lacking much confidence in Yang Kai. He had seen many alchemists, but none with such high cultivation as Yang Kai, and alchemists usually appeared dreadfully slovenly from years of handling herbs and carrying their scent; from earlier contact, Yang Kai did not seem like a conventional pillmaster at all.

“How should I know?” Kang Siran replied weakly.

It had already been ten days since Yang Kai entered the refining room. The first two days he used to contemplate those formulas; on the third day he requested a massive amount of materials to refine Origin Condensing Pills, then shut the refining room’s doors and had not come out until now.

Kang Siran truly wished to rush in and take a look—to see how many Origin Condensing Pills Yang Kai had produced and how much material he had wasted!

Every pillmaster suffered material loss during refining; it was unavoidable. Even the most seasoned pillmasters could not guarantee every refining would succeed.

But the loss rate varied according to each pillmaster’s skill.

Among the three pillmasters previously at the workshop, the best could keep material loss to about thirty percent, meaning that out of ten furnaces seven would succeed while three batches’ materials were ruined.

That was already impressive; Fan Hong’s loss rate was closer to fifty percent.

Even so, Kang Siran treated him as an honored guest, for he was a Void King-Grade pillmaster.

What would Yang Kai’s material loss rate be? Sixty percent? Seventy percent?

Even if it were eighty percent, Kang Siran thought he could accept it; as long as some Origin Condensing Pills were produced to tide things over.

What made him anxious was that Yang Kai had not yet produced a single Origin Condensing Pill! If it were not for the rule that pillmasters could not be disturbed while refining, Kang Siran would have broken in long ago.

The commotion outside seemed to grow more intense, driving Kang Siran to the edge of irritation.

“Click…”

At that moment, a faint sound came.

Kang Siran froze, then was overjoyed, widening his eyes as he looked forward; the tightly closed refining room door was now creaking open.

Before it had fully opened, Kang Siran rushed in.

The refining room was full of heat; Kang Siran paid it no mind and went straight to Yang Kai, sweeping his gaze and seeing a pile of spent herbs not far from him.

That was the residue left from failed pill refinings—blackened and smelling of scorch.

The herb dregs were not many—roughly ten portions’ worth of materials.

But seven days ago he had given Yang Kai a full one hundred portions of material for Origin Condensing Pills!

He did not know exactly how many portions Yang Kai had consumed; if he could know, he could estimate the loss rate, Kang Siran thought.

“Master Alchemist Yang…” Kang Siran forced a smile and cupped his fist, “Have the Spiritual Pills been refined?”

“Mm, they’re all here.” Yang Kai waved his hand and immediately over thirty jade bottles appeared before him.

“Hiss…” Seeing this, Kang Siran inhaled sharply, staring at the jade bottles on the floor, utterly dumbfounded.

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise and called, “Shopkeeper Kang?”

Kang Siran came to his senses, twisted his stiff neck, and asked Yang Kai, “Master Alchemist Yang, are all of these Origin Condensing Pills?”

“Exactly. Shopkeeper Kang can inspect them.”

Hearing this, Kang Siran no longer hesitated; he snatched up a few jade bottles, opened them one by one, and found inside round, glossy, fragrant Origin Condensing Pills.

Ten per bottle; with over thirty bottles, that meant over three hundred Origin Condensing Pills!

That figure struck Kang Siran like a heavy hammer, leaving him dazed and barely able to think.

How was it possible? How could this happen?

In only seven days one man had refined over three hundred Origin Condensing Pills—equivalent to the combined output of the workshop’s previous three pillmasters.

One man equaled three? Kang Siran collapsed into stunned disbelief, long unable to recover; everything before him overturned his understanding of common sense.

Seeing this, Yang Kai could not help but smile bitterly.

It seemed he had left too many; had he known, he would have withheld another one hundred.

Refining Origin Condensing Pills was not difficult for Yang Kai; after all, they were merely Void King-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pills, and he himself had long been able to refine Void King-Grade Upper-Level pills—he only lacked the formula and had never made them before.

After experiencing the initial failures, he quickly got the hang of it.

The pill yield per furnace gradually increased.

From the initial two or three pills to being able to produce four, then five; with one hundred portions of material, ten portions were wasted, and the remaining materials were all refined into pills, totaling over four hundred pills.

Yang Kai had privately withheld one hundred Spiritual Pills so as not to be too conspicuous.

But now it seemed he could have withheld two hundred without problem.

He himself needed a great many Origin Condensing Pills, and even if he could not use them all, he could sell them—Origin Condensing Pills would not have trouble finding buyers.

Kang Siran’s expression made him rueful.

Still… luckily those few Origin Condensing Pills that bore pill patterns had been kept by him, which was some consolation.

After a long while Kang Siran began to laugh, a touch neurotic.

Yang Kai seemed to somewhat understand Kang Siran’s feelings, so he did not say much.

After all, Kang Siran had not expected Yang Kai to be so capable—one person equaling the previous three pillmasters. He had only hoped Yang Kai would not waste too many materials, but the result had greatly pleased him.

The violent swings in his mood made it impossible to suppress the surge of delight; laughing out loud was only natural.
