## Chapter 2325 — Opening the Passage

"Sect Master Ye!" After returning the greeting, Yang Kai's attention was immediately drawn to the massive platform ahead. His eyes fixed on it, carefully observing as divine light flickered in his gaze.

"Young Master Yang..." Ye Qinghan was about to say something, but Ye Hen suddenly raised his hand to stop her, then made a gesture for silence.

Ye Qinghan also realized she was being a bit abrupt. She playfully stuck out her delicate tongue, then stood beside her father, waiting anxiously.

In front of the platform, the three remained silent for a long time. Ye Hen and his daughter kept watching Yang Kai's changing expression, while Yang Kai's entire focus was already immersed in the platform before him.

The platform before him was clearly a massive Formation Foundation.

Yang Kai did not know much about the Dao of Formations. The only formation he truly mastered was the Space Array, and that was thanks to Yang Yan. Back then, in order to set up Space Arrays on Dark Star and even in his home Star Domain, he had put in a lot of effort. Yang Yan had also taught him the method of arranging Space Arrays.

So Yang Kai's understanding of Space Arrays was extremely thorough.

With a sweep of his Divine Sense, he immediately sensed that countless profound formation diagrams were engraved within the Formation Foundation platform, all interconnected, forming the hub linking the Star Realm and the secret realm passage.

Each of those formation diagrams was exquisitely mysterious. Although many differed from what Yang Kai had mastered, after pondering them he understood them completely. Moreover, from those diagrams he even gleaned other insights, which gave him much to ponder.

The formation knowledge Yang Yan had imparted to him was undoubtedly the very best—superior even to what was inscribed in this Formation Foundation platform.

But as the saying goes, stones from other hills may polish jade—the formation diagrams inscribed within this Formation Foundation platform still allowed Yang Kai to gain some insights.

After more than half a day, Yang Kai finally took a deep breath, withdrew his Divine Sense, and his eyes shone brightly.

"Young Master Yang..." Seeing him finally return to himself, Ye Qinghan called out softly, her voice full of nervous anticipation.

Ye Hen also asked nervously, "Was Young Master Yang able to discover anything?"

Yang Kai nodded, "Your sect's ancestors were truly outstanding. The one who arranged this formation was definitely a formation grandmaster. Let me put it this way: this Formation Foundation here is completely fine. It's just that the energy has been exhausted. As long as some energy is replenished, it can operate again."

Hearing this, Ye Hen's eyes lit up and he exclaimed, "Can Young Master Yang be certain?" After a pause, he added awkwardly, "It's not that I don't trust you, but this concerns my Thousand Leaves Sect..."

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "I understand, Sect Master Ye, there's no need to explain. But I can assure you this Formation Foundation is undamaged. And even if it were damaged, as long as I have the materials, I could refine a new one."

Ye Hen trembled all over, looking at Yang Kai in disbelief. Only now did he realize he had underestimated Yang Kai's attainments in space divine abilities. He had thought that, given Yang Kai's age and cultivation, his comprehension of space power couldn't be too deep. But hearing these words, he knew he was wrong—Yang Kai's mastery of space power was likely among the very best in the entire Star Realm.

If not, he could never be so confident in refining a Formation Foundation platform.

Ye Qinghan asked, "If this Formation Foundation here is fine, then why is the secret realm entrance closed?"

Yang Kai replied, "A Space Array is a two-way connection. Just because this side is fine doesn't mean the other side is. Perhaps the Formation Foundation on the other side is damaged, so it can't be used."

"The other side..." Ye Hen frowned, startled. "Young Master Yang, do you mean the Formation Foundation inside the secret realm is damaged?"

"Most likely."

"What should we do?" Ye Qinghan's pretty face turned pale. "If the Formation Foundation on the other side is damaged, then it's impossible to teleport over. Even if there's a way to repair it, we can't use it."

Ye Hen looked at Yang Kai with hope. "Does Young Master Yang have a solution?"

Yang Kai grinned. "For ordinary people, if the Formation Foundation on the other side is damaged, naturally, they can't teleport. But if one possesses space power, it might be possible to follow the connection between the two Formation Foundations and directly open a passage to the other side. So... I should be able to give it a try."

He didn't make any absolute promises. Even if he was eighty percent confident, giving too much hope before things were settled only led to greater disappointment.

He had always been cautious.

Hearing this, Ye Hen couldn't help but get excited. He cupped his fists and said, "If Young Master Yang can truly repair this array, you will be the benefactor of my Thousand Leaves Sect. In the future, should you ever need anything, my Thousand Leaves Sect will obey without hesitation, even unto death!"

Yang Kai said calmly, "Sect Master Ye, that's too much. It's just... I can try, but it might take some time. My friends are still within Thousand Leaves Sect, so I'll have to trouble you to look after them."

"Of course." Ye Hen nodded, seeming to understand Yang Kai's concerns. He immediately said, "I will take good care of them. If they suffer even the slightest harm, you may hold me accountable."

"That's good." Yang Kai nodded, then asked, "Does Sect Master Ye have a map of the secret realm's interior? If I really teleport over, I might need to repair the Formation Foundation there and will have to look for some materials inside."

As for the materials to set up a Space Array, Yang Kai still had some left from his home Star Domain. Although they weren't of high grade, they would suffice for repairs. When he studied the formation diagrams of this Formation Foundation earlier, he had memorized them all.

The reason he said this was, of course, because he was also interested in the secret realm.

This secret realm was Thousand Leaves Sect's absolute secret. In every generation, only a few people knew about it; everyone else was kept in the dark. With such a secret realm, there should be some good things inside. Naturally, Yang Kai wanted to explore and see if there were any opportunities.

Moreover, Ye Qinghan had previously mentioned that there was a place inside the secret realm called Emperor Heaven Valley, an excellent place to comprehend Emperor Intent. If a Dao Origin Realm cultivator could comprehend there, it would greatly benefit their future advancement to the Emperor Realm.

How could Yang Kai miss such a wonderful place?

Searching for materials was just an excuse.

Ye Hen clearly understood as well, but he didn't refuse at all. Instead, he readily took out a piece of yellowed beast skin map and handed it to Yang Kai, saying, "Even if you hadn't asked, I was already planning to give you this map."

Yang Kai accepted it, and with just a glance, he knew the map was genuine. He immediately stored it in his Spatial Ring.

"I'll leave everything to you, Young Master Yang." Ye Hen said solemnly, cupping his fists.

Ye Qinghan also said from the side, "Young Master Yang, be careful. If it works out, that's great. If not... don't force it."

Yang Kai replied, "I'll do my best."

As he spoke, his figure flickered and he leapt onto the Formation Foundation platform, sitting cross-legged.

In the next moment, Spatial Laws surged out, swirling around his body. Instantly, the space within a ten zhang radius collapsed as countless tiny, pitch-black spatial cracks appeared, swimming around him like fish.

Ye Hen and his daughter both turned pale, feeling the danger from those spatial cracks. They quickly retreated, watching the scene ahead with alarm and uncertainty.

"Is these are the Laws of Space?" Ye Qinghan's beautiful eyes widened as she tried to sense them, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't grasp anything; she only felt the law power swirling around Yang Kai was unfathomably mysterious, beyond her comprehension.

Ye Hen sighed, "Cultivators who master space force are recognized as the most difficult to deal with in the Star Realm. I never expected Young Master Yang's mastery of Spatial Laws to have reached such a level. Given time, he might achieve the Great Dao through the power of Laws of Space."

Ye Qinghan's delicate body trembled, looking at her father in disbelief. She hadn't expected her father to give Yang Kai such high praise. But thinking about it, before meeting Yang Kai, when had she ever seen such an outstanding Dao Origin Realm cultivator?

She herself was at this realm and naturally knew what the strength of a Dao Origin Realm should be. But Yang Kai's strength was far beyond her estimation. Ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators were as weak as infants before him. Even those at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm were no match for Yang Kai, easily crushed by him.

It was said that all those world-shaking figures were brilliant and peerless in their youth, standing above the crowd. Wasn't Yang Kai just like that?

Perhaps... in the future, he really could, as her father said, reach the peak of the Great Dao and become famous throughout the Star Realm.

Thinking of this, Ye Qinghan couldn't help but tremble with excitement.

Because she had met Yang Kai in his youth and had the chance to witness the rise of a great figure. Even though her relationship with Yang Kai wasn't particularly close, she still felt proud.

Buzz...

As Ye Qinghan's thoughts wandered, a strange sound suddenly came from the void. As soon as it rang out, Ye Qinghan's pretty face turned pale, for she found that the surrounding space had completely solidified in that instant. It was as if she was wrapped in solid ice—not only was it hard to breathe, but even the Origin Qi in her body began to flow intermittently.

Turning her head, Ye Qinghan saw that her father was in the same state, struggling to resist the suppression of Spatial Laws.

At that very moment, as Ye Qinghan’s mind was thrown into chaos, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes. His expression was solemn as he extended both hands, reaching into the void before him.

Under Ye Qinghan's gaze, those two hands bizarrely disappeared, as if cut off from this space and sent elsewhere.

Yang Kai then made a strenuous gesture, spreading his hands apart, and shouted loudly.

Sss sss sss sss...

As Yang Kai moved, a pitch-black crack suddenly appeared before him. From within the crack came a terrifying, unsettling aura, as if even one's gaze could be swallowed up.

"A Void Rift!" Ye Hen cried out in astonishment, his gaze fixed unblinkingly on the pitch-black fissure, his heart filled with shock. It was his first time witnessing such a massive void rift, and he could clearly sense the terrifying danger it contained—so much so that he was momentarily transfixed, unable to look away.

As Yang Kai continued, the rift kept expanding until it was large enough for a person to pass through. Within the passage there was only nothingness, as if it stretched on endlessly.
