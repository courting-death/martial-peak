## Chapter 306 — Spider Mother’s Nest

He gently called out a few times, but Shan Qingluo showed no signs of waking.

With no other choice, Yang Kai could only flick his fingers, caressing Shan Qingluo's smooth waist. As he continued, his fingers involuntarily delved deeper, rubbing against her pert and rounded backside.

The sacred area was violated, and Shan Qingluo finally stirred awake.

Unconsciously twisting her delicate body, a bone-chilling sound escaped her throat.

Yang Kai felt his heart flutter and quickly halted his actions.

Once her pair of watery phoenix eyes opened, Yang Kai hurriedly reminded her, "Beauty, you mustn't get aroused by me!"

Shan Qingluo had a special constitution; once she became aroused, the consequences were unimaginable. Yang Kai certainly did not want to wake up only to be knocked out again.

After a moment of slight confusion, Shan Qingluo recalled everything. Seemingly aware of Yang Kai's earlier actions, this enchantress glared at him with her silver teeth gritted, spitting, "You little rascal, what were you doing just now?"

Yang Kai chuckled and shrugged, "I was just waking you up."

Before she could explode, Yang Kai quickly changed the topic, "What should we do now?"

Shan Qingluo furrowed her brows slightly, struggling a bit, only to find that both she and Yang Kai were tightly wrapped in a layer of First Stage spider silk, leaving them with little room to move. They were already pressed closely together, and with this movement, a hot and hard object quickly pressed against her flat abdomen.

Her eyelashes trembled slightly as Shan Qingluo smiled at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied seriously, "It's just a natural reaction, not something I intended. This can only mean that your charm is too great!"

Shan Qingluo seemed not to be angry, her face slightly flushed.

"This spider silk is tough; it's generally impossible to break free." Yang Kai frowned, speaking of serious matters, "However, my treasure can cut through it."

"Don't act recklessly!" Shan Qingluo quickly warned, her expression serious. "We are completely powerless right now. Even if we could cut through the spider silk, we wouldn't be able to escape. There are so many Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts outside; provoking them would only lead to a quicker death."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. It was precisely because of such concerns that he had not dared to easily cut through the spider silk. Although he had controlled one of the Sixth-Tier poison spiders before losing consciousness, it was of little use now. He could only have it guard outside to ensure the safety of himself and Shan Qingluo.

"You said you came here to find something. What exactly is this place?"

This underground area was clearly a spider's nest, and not just any ordinary spider nest. So many Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts lived here, along with countless Fifth-Tier and Fourth-Tier poison spiders. Anyone who came here would not dare to let their guard down.

"This is the Spider Mother’s Nest!" Shan Qingluo replied softly, her breath fragrant like orchids as it wafted over Yang Kai's neck, bringing a strange sensation. "My lineage's constitution comes from here. It is said that hundreds of years ago, one of my ancestors accidentally arrived here and was bitten by a poison spider. When she returned, her constitution changed, and it has been passed down through generations."

In this world, some people's constitutions were very special, unlike ordinary people.

So far, Yang Kai had only seen Xia Ningshang with the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body!

And now, he encountered Shan Qingluo with her poison widow constitution. However, compared to the two, Shan Qingluo's constitution seemed a bit more sinister.

Most special constitutions were innate, with only a few being hereditary.

The poison widow was undoubtedly a constitution that could be inherited!

"Every generation, once a person reaches a certain level of strength, they will come here to seek something. With that thing, we can fully unleash the potential of our constitution," Shan Qingluo continued explaining. "I have never been here before; I only heard my mother mention the route. I didn't expect to accidentally step into this place this time. I wonder if it is fate!"

With a soft sigh, Shan Qingluo was unsure whether she was lucky or unfortunate.

"Yang Kai?" While they were talking, a voice suddenly came from the side, belonging to Qiu Yimeng.

She was actually right beside them and had also woken up. Yang Kai turned to look in that direction, only to see a struggling white spider egg three feet to his left.

"Sister Qiu..." Luo Xiaoman's crying voice followed from the right.

What a coincidence; these two girls were actually right next to Yang Kai.

"Xiaoman, don't be afraid. Don't move around; don't attract the attention of those Demonic Beasts," Qiu Yimeng said calmly, comforting Luo Xiaoman.

"Okay." Luo Xiaoman obediently replied, indeed stopping her struggles.

"Yang Kai, I know you're nearby. I heard your voice!" Qiu Yimeng softly called, not daring to speak too loudly in this perilous situation.

"What do you want?" Yang Kai replied irritably. He had no good feelings toward this woman, who had come to Lingxiao Pavilion with an air of superiority and had caused everyone to fall into misfortune.

"Are you still angry?" Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, showing no signs of the predicament they were in. "We are all in the same boat now; why are you, a big man, still quarreling with a little girl like me?"

"A little girl?" Yang Kai chuckled, teasing, "Miss Qiu, the renowned heiress of the Qiu Family, not yet twenty-one, Ninth Stage True Yuan Realm, the hope of the Qiu Family, and the object of admiration for the young masters of the Eight Great Families in Zhongdu. How is that a little girl?"

Qiu Yimeng giggled, "I didn't expect you to care about me so much. What, do you like me?"

"Don't think you can use beauty tricks on me." Yang Kai scoffed, "I’m still holding the most enchanting woman in the world in my arms. Just a squeeze and she’s dripping; who do you think you are? Speak quickly, or just let it out!"

Shan Qingluo lightly pinched Yang Kai, but a hint of pride crossed her eyes.

Others might praise her beauty with ulterior motives, coveting her charm, but Yang Kai's compliment felt pleasant to her ears. However, the comment about her dripping was rather strange.

"Your words are really unpleasant!" Qiu Yimeng frowned.

"If you find it unpleasant, then don't talk to me. I don't want to waste my breath on you."

Qiu Yimeng chuckled, "But what you said is true. In front of Sister Shan, my appearance indeed pales in comparison."

Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes sparkled as she softly said to Yang Kai, "This little girl is quite interesting." 

Yang Kai replied in a low voice, "I fear she has ulterior motives."

As expected, Qiu Yimeng said, "Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family greets Sister Shan. A few days ago, I didn’t know that Sister Shan had descended with the Phoenix Body. I may have offended you; I hope Sister Shan will not take it to heart."

Naturally, Qiu Yimeng had heard of Shan Qingluo's great name. One of the six Evil Kings, although the weakest among them, she was also the youngest. Given time, she would surely be able to compete with the other five.

A month ago, it would have been fine not to know her identity, but now that she did, Qiu Yimeng naturally dared not act recklessly.

"Hehe..." Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Kai with a smile in her beautiful eyes, responding with laughter, "Little sister, your words are really sweet. But calling me sister makes me feel like I've aged a few years."

Qiu Yimeng chuckled awkwardly, softly saying, "Sister, how could you be old? You look even younger than me. If we went out together, others would think I’m older than you."

Shan Qingluo laughed even more joyfully, her flowers swaying.

A fairy! Yang Kai took a deep breath, not daring to stare into her eyes again, lest he fall into temptation. 

"Qiu sister really knows how to speak." Shan Qingluo had no intention of making things difficult for her, which allowed Qiu Yimeng to breathe a sigh of relief. Conversing with someone like the Enchantress Queen put even her, the heiress of the Qiu Family, under considerable pressure, keeping her nerves taut, fearing she might offend her.

"I wonder if Qiu sister has any advice?"

"Don't mention it!" Qiu Yimeng replied softly, "I just want to ask if Sister has a way to break free?"

Here, Shan Qingluo was the strongest. Although she was also bound, if there was any hope of escape, it could only be Shan Qingluo who could achieve it. Others, like Guo Yuanming, were not even in consideration.

"If Sister can break free, could you take me along?" Qiu Yimeng cautiously asked. "I promise it won't be for nothing. The Qiu Family has a Face Preserving Pearl, a naturally formed Heaven-Grade upper-level treasure. Wearing it for a long time can preserve one's youth. If Sister doesn't mind, I can have someone deliver it to your residence another day."

Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes flickered, seemingly tempted.

Qiu Yimeng, as the heiress of the Qiu Family, was indeed astute. Although she was young, she understood human nature well. Promising Shan Qingluo some extraordinary treasure or miraculous medicine might not sway her, but this treasure that could preserve beauty was something no woman could refuse.

Who wouldn't want to maintain their youth and beauty?

Especially for a captivating woman like Shan Qingluo, the thought of becoming wrinkled and haggard after a hundred years was even more frightening.

Seeing Shan Qingluo silent, Qiu Yimeng immediately calmed her heart, knowing she had piqued her interest, and quickly said, "If Sister has any other requests, just mention them. As long as I have it, I can agree."

"Really?" Shan Qingluo suddenly smiled slyly.

"Of course!"

"Then I want you and that girl named Xiaoman!"

Qiu Yimeng was taken aback, forcing a smile, "What do you mean by that, Sister?"

"I have a little rascal here who seems to like both of you quite a bit. If you can be his maids for a year, when I break free, I will take you both out!"

"Hey..." Yang Kai couldn't help but poke her, his face serious. "What does this have to do with me? I won't deny I have some wicked thoughts about them, but that's just a man's nature. I won't get involved with them."

"I was just saying it casually; I still can't break free." Shan Qingluo laughed.

"Is that his idea?" Qiu Yimeng's side emitted a faint grinding sound, though suppressed, it still revealed her anger.

"No, it's my idea!"

"Sister is really good to him." Qiu Yimeng sighed, utterly confused as to why the renowned Enchantress Queen would take a liking to a boy from Lingxiao Pavilion.

Moreover... it seemed they had only known each other for about a month. What had happened in that time?

"Please allow me to consider it!" Qiu Yimeng bit her red lip, replying solemnly.

"En." Shan Qingluo nodded lightly, not pressing her.
