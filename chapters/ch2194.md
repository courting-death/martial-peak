## Chapter 2194 — First Come, First Served

"So that was his plan!" Xia Sheng's face lit up with sudden realization.

Before this, he couldn't understand why Yang Kai was making things so difficult for himself, but now it was clear—Yang Kai wasn't causing himself trouble at all. He had planned everything from the start: stepping forward to refine the Supreme Mystic Pill, then keeping the Spiritual Pill for himself, using it as leverage to trade with the others.

All of this was part of his plan.

And the conditions for carrying out this plan were extremely demanding…

First, he needed absolute confidence in his alchemy skills—to be able to refine the Supreme Mystic Pill. Without that confidence, failure would make everything pointless.

Second, he needed absolute confidence in his own strength—not to defeat everyone here, but at least to have the ability to escape with his life.

Now it seemed Yang Kai possessed both, and reality proved his plan was flawless!

He could refine the Supreme Mystic Pill, and he could leave with ease even under the watchful eyes of so many experts…

All the initiative was in his hands. Those who had unrealistic hopes for the Supreme Mystic Pill had been played by Yang Kai from the very beginning.

While Yang Kai was focused on alchemy, probably no one expected things to turn out like this. If they could have foreseen it, no one would have waited for Yang Kai to finish refining pills—they would have rushed up to snatch the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

This guy… what he did was truly infuriating to both gods and men!

Yet, it was also deeply admirable—his courage and boldness were impressive.

Such actions were tantamount to making enemies of everyone. One misstep would mean utter ruin. Without courage and boldness, who could pull this off?

Thinking of this, Xia Sheng's expression changed again, secretly cursing Yang Kai for being so cunning.

After the Supreme Mystic Pill was completed, he first gave one to Lan Xun, ostensibly because she had provided an Azure-Blood Ganoderma and they had an agreement. But in reality… he probably just didn't want to make an enemy of Lan Xun.

After all, Lan Xun's status was very special. No one wanted to have a conflict with her.

Even if there hadn't been the Azure-Blood Ganoderma, Yang Kai would have found another way to make Lan Xun accept a Spiritual Pill—like saying, "Try out the quality and effects of this Supreme Mystic Pill." Once Lan Xun took the pill, she wouldn't trouble him anymore. In fact, after leaving the Four Seasons Land, she might even put in a good word for him if she could.

This was equivalent to giving himself an extra layer of security.

In a flash, the words "wily old fox" crossed Xia Sheng's mind…

"Enough idle talk!" Wuchang spoke again, his tone cold. "What exactly do you want in exchange? Name your terms."

"What do I want in exchange, hmm…" Yang Kai grinned without answering. That shameless look and tone made people want to beat him up just to vent their anger.

"I'm actually curious about something else…" Zhuang Bufan, who had already recovered from the aftereffects of competing with Yang Kai in Origin Qi, stood up with a healthy flush. Looking at Yang Kai, he asked, "Brother Yang, that Supreme Mystic Pill… how many are there?"

As soon as he spoke, Xiao Chen couldn't help but chime in, "That's right, I was about to ask the same. How many Supreme Mystic Pills are there?"

A single furnace of Spiritual Pills has an upper limit, even with the Star Realm's alchemy techniques and an Imperial-Grade alchemist. At most, a furnace can yield nine pills.

Because nine is the ultimate number—there can't be more.

In other words, at most there could be nine Supreme Mystic Pills from that furnace, and that's the ideal case.

In reality, depending on the alchemist's rank, their state during refinement, the pill-collecting technique, and the age of the ingredients, it's basically impossible to get nine pills from a single batch.

Even the best alchemists rarely achieve such perfection.

The Supreme Mystic Pill is high-grade, and Yang Kai's alchemist rank isn't high, so no matter what, there couldn't be nine pills. There were probably only four, three, or even just two…

Before making a trade with Yang Kai, at the very least, they needed to find out how many pills there were. That was the most basic principle.

Who would have thought, when Yang Kai heard the question, he just grinned again and said, "How many are there… hmm…"

Zhuang Bufan's face darkened. He muttered, "Brother Yang, stop messing around… I'm asking a serious question."

Yang Kai glanced at him and said cheerfully, "Then I'll count them."

"Thank you, Brother Yang!" Zhuang Bufan nodded.

Under everyone's gaze, Yang Kai really did open the pill furnace and looked inside.

The moment he opened the furnace, countless Divine Senses swept over from all directions, trying to see what was inside!

But before anyone could get a clear look, Yang Kai slammed the lid back onto the pill furnace, his expression darkening as he swept his gaze around. With a cold snort, he declared, "Honestly, telling you all how many Spiritual Pills there are wouldn't be a big deal... But seeing you lot sneakily trying to spy on me with your Divine Senses is truly beneath contempt. I've decided..."

He paused, leaving everyone in suspense.

"I'm not telling you!" Yang Kai declared loudly.

"Bastard!"

"You brat, are you playing with us?"

"I didn't try to peek, Brother Yang, tell me quietly!"

Yang Kai swept his cold gaze around, pointing in several directions. "Those who just cursed me can get lost. No matter what you offer, I won't trade the Supreme Mystic Pill to you."

As soon as he said this, a few martial artists looked embarrassed and quickly cupped their fists to beg for forgiveness.

Yang Kai snorted through his nose, and under everyone's gaze, did something that shocked them all.

He reached into the pill furnace, rummaged inside, and when he pulled his hand out, he was pinching a Supreme Mystic Pill between his fingers. It looked exactly like the one he had given to Lan Xun before—no difference at all.

Then… he casually tossed the Supreme Mystic Pill into his mouth and ate it on the spot.

Crunch, crunch…

The crisp sound rang out as Yang Kai puffed his cheeks, chewing the Supreme Mystic Pill like it was candy. The sound was oddly evocative, and his face showed utter bliss, shaking his head as if savoring something indescribable.

Everyone was stunned, staring in disbelief.

Gulp…

After a moment, with a swallow, Yang Kai finally let out a long breath, patted his belly, and said with satisfaction, "That hit the spot!"

Only then did he look at the crowd again, the corners of his mouth lifting in a subtle arc. "No matter how many Supreme Mystic Pills there were before, there's one less now. There aren't many left. If anyone wants one, come trade with me now—first come, first served. If you're late, there won't be any left…"

He sounded just like a street vendor, his tone full of persuasion and temptation.

At the end, he added, "As for what to trade… hmm, just use whatever you got in the Four Seasons Land. If I like it, I'll trade. If I don't, there's no use forcing it. It's all voluntary, so do as you please!"

He patted his pill furnace, slowly descended from midair, and with a surge of Spatial Law, created a special shattered domain within thirty zhang around himself.

Space cracks flickered in and out of sight, swirling around him. The power of the void surged, unpredictable and unstable.

Any martial artist who tried to force their way into this shattered domain would be torn apart by the Spatial Law!

Of course, they could try to break in by force like Luo Yuan had before, but if they did, Yang Kai would definitely escape immediately.

With that lesson learned, no one was interested in making a move against Yang Kai now.

"Me, me!"

"Damn it, let me go first! If any of you try to cut in, I'll kill your whole family!"

"I'm a woman, you bastards! Why are you pushing? Who touched my ass? If you've got the guts, step forward—I'll make sure you regret it!"

In an instant, chaos erupted. Everyone surged forward, shoving and jostling, making quite a scene.

The well-known experts who prided themselves on their status, however, stood quietly, not joining the commotion. It wasn't that they didn't want to trade for the Supreme Mystic Pill, but rushing up now would be too damaging to their image…

Still, their expressions were clearly anxious.

After all, they didn't know how many Supreme Mystic Pills Yang Kai had left, or what he wanted in exchange. If they were too late, they might get nothing at all.

"One at a time! If anyone dares to barge in, don't blame me for being ruthless." Yang Kai sat calmly in the shattered domain, snorting coldly.

As he finished speaking, the domain filled with Spatial Law seemed to open a clear gap, just wide enough for one person to pass through.

The martial artist at the very front reacted quickly and darted inside.

As soon as he entered, the gap closed again, blocking everyone else out.

The noise stopped instantly. Everyone stared at the first person who got in, their faces full of anxiety.

After entering the shattered domain, the man looked around, making sure the swirling space cracks wouldn't harm him. Then he straightened his clothes and strode toward Yang Kai.

When he got close, he forced a smile, cupped his fists, and introduced himself, "I am from the Chang family of Qizhou…"

"I don't care where you're from or what your name is," Yang Kai interrupted bluntly, expressionless. "Take out what you got in the Four Seasons Land and let me see if there's anything interesting!"

"Yes, yes!" The man surnamed Chang nodded repeatedly, not minding Yang Kai's rudeness. As he spoke, he hurriedly took out several items from his Spatial Ring and presented them to Yang Kai, then waited nervously in silence.

Yang Kai glanced at them, then looked up and asked, "Is this all you got this time?"
