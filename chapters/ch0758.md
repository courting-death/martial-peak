## Chapter 758 — Massive Energy

Time flashed by; several days passed while Yang Kai remained secluded in the chamber, probing the mysteries of the Saint-grade pill, but his gains were slight.

During those days of observation he also noticed that An Ling'er seemed calm and showed no sign of betrayal. Yet the people from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, for reasons unknown, had not left and instead took up temporary residence here.

It was likely that the disappearance of the Saintess made them feel it was unsafe to set out just yet.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai stopped paying attention to An Ling'er's situation and devoted his entire mind to the pill in his hand.

After spending several days, Yang Kai still couldn't glean much from it; only one approach remained — a gamble that might yield precious information or nothing at all.

He would take it.

He would use his own body to feel the pill's effects, to perceive the secrets of the pill cloud, to probe the process by which this holy pill had been formed.

Yet Yang Kai hesitated for a long time, torn over whether to employ such a do‑or‑die method.

Pills enveloped by a pill cloud were exceedingly rare, and this one was only a middle‑level Saint‑grade; once swallowed it might be lost to the world forever.

Moreover, because a pill cloud enveloped its exterior, Yang Kai had no way of knowing what the pill actually did — was it a healing pill, a pill that assisted cultivation, a pill that boosted cultivation, or perhaps an antidote?

Everything was unknown; the only certainty was that it was not a poison pill.

Besides, after so many long years, the energy contained within this pill was enormous, and Yang Kai worried he might not be able to withstand it.

Although he possessed the Indomitable Golden Body and could accept unimaginable energies, his meridians and flesh had limited capacity; if too much energy surged into them in a short time and the Indomitable Golden Body couldn't absorb it quickly enough, his body would suffer a heavy blow.

After careful thought, the hesitation on Yang Kai's face slowly turned into resolve.

He decided to go all out.

Such an opportunity, if not tried, would forever nag at him; no matter how much time passed he would keep wondering. Better to take it now and learn the truth once the effects played out.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai left the chamber, paid the custodian enough for ten more days, and ordered that no one be allowed to disturb him without permission — a request the custodian readily agreed to.

Returning to the chamber, Yang Kai reinforced the seals and barriers already set in place so they remained in perfect condition, then drew a long breath and sat cross‑legged where he had been.

Settling his spirit, Yang Kai tossed the holy pill into his mouth and swallowed it.

Wasting no time, he activated the True Yang Technique, waiting for the pill's effects to erupt.

Within three breaths a hot current was born in his lower abdomen, like molten lava, scorching his internal organs.

When that current first formed it was no stronger than a brook, but in the blink of an eye the brook swelled into a river and then roared into an ocean.

Yang Kai could even hear the sound of the vast energy surging in his belly, like waves crashing and raging, and that violent energy kept pouring in.

His expression changed; Yang Kai felt as if he were on fire. His True Yuan undulated, every pore involuntarily opening as countless energies leaked out through them into the air.

The True Yang Technique accelerated, the pill's effects filling his meridians until they ached and swelled.

The medicinal force penetrated everywhere, seeping into every inch of his flesh and blood along his meridians.

In that moment Yang Kai seemed to have opened a door to a chamber filled with explosive energy, and while enduring that baptism he also sought to discern the secrets hidden beyond the door.

It was extremely difficult to do two things at once.

Suddenly Yang Kai sensed something amiss: the medicinal force coursing through his meridians and flesh, despite the operation of the True Yang Technique, showed no sign of being absorbed by the Indomitable Golden Body; instead it all surged toward his mind.

Rushing into his mind it was as if entering an invisible black hole, being swallowed clean.

Yang Kai froze briefly, then quickly immersed his spirit; his spirit body manifested within the Sea of Consciousness.

Before him the Sea of Consciousness was a vast expanse of golden light into which energy from outside was continuously pouring; that sea of flame‑like water accepted and assimilated it.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened as realization struck him.

This holy pill was not a healing pill, nor a cultivation‑assisting pill; it was a pill that enhanced Divine Sense.

For a moment he had been lost in thought, and as the surging energy poured in, his Sea of Consciousness began to churn. The Court of Divine Battle and the World‑Ending Demon Eye floating above his sea wavered precariously.

Even the Spirit‑Soul Short Sword of only upper‑level Heaven‑Grade quality was caught in the storm and blown away in the torrential upheaval.

Alarmed, Yang Kai had thought that however vast the pill's energy, his Indomitable Golden Body could absorb it all thanks to its uniqueness.

He had not expected the pill to be one that enhanced Divine Sense — in that case the Indomitable Golden Body was useless.

Though his Sea of Consciousness could manifest into immense space, it still had limits; so great an influx of energy would sooner or later burst it.

Yang Kai's face darkened as he both stabilized the turmoil within his Sea of Consciousness and pondered how to resolve the crisis.

Just when he was at a loss, multicolored lights suddenly flashed within his Sea of Consciousness, and as they flickered the incoming energies all converged toward one direction and vanished.

Yang Kai stared and then turned to look; a moment later he grinned.

The thing that devoured that enormous energy for him turned out to be the island manifested by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

When he first obtained that soul‑nourishing treasure, Di Mo had said the Warm Spirit Lotus could grow — given enough time it could become six‑colored and eventually seven‑colored.

That process could take a very long time, thousands or even tens of thousands of years.

Once it reached seven colors, the help a Warm Spirit Lotus could give a cultivator would be incalculable.

Yang Kai had already received unimaginable benefits from the Warm Spirit Lotus; the reason his Divine Sense power far exceeded his bodily cultivation was largely because of the Warm Spirit Lotus.

So he understood how enormous the aid from a seven‑colored Warm Spirit Lotus would be.

Di Mo had also said that although the Warm Spirit Lotus grows slowly, its growth could be artificially accelerated: after taking possession of it, frequently consuming soul‑nourishing spirit pills and heaven‑and‑earth treasures could quicken its development.

Strictly speaking, this was an investment: when a cultivator consumed such spirit pills and treasures, the Warm Spirit Lotus shared the efficacy; though some short‑term benefit was shunted away, the lotus would later repay those benefits many times over.

From then on, whenever Yang Kai consumed soul‑nourishing medicines, much of the energy flowed to the Warm Spirit Lotus, all silently and unnoticed by him.

Now, with this unimaginable energy pouring into his Sea of Consciousness, the Warm Spirit Lotus's role was rendered plainly visible.

It devoured frantically, relieving Yang Kai of much of the pressure.

At last, the turmoil inside his Sea of Consciousness had calmed considerably.

Spirits lifted, Yang Kai strove to push the incoming energy toward the Warm Spirit Lotus while controlling his Sea of Consciousness to contain the excess.

But it was still tight; the energy was so massive it made Yang Kai's heart tremble.

Without hesitation he used his Divine Sense to begin probing the secrets of the True Alchemy Formula.

He had to continually expend his Divine Sense just to keep up with the situation before him.

The energy pouring in split into two main directions in an instant: the larger portion was absorbed by the five‑colored Warm Spirit Lotus, while the rest entered Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness to replenish what he kept expending.

The Soul Devouring Worms that lived on the five‑colored island also played their part; they fed on this form of consumed energy and certainly welcomed such a feast.

With all means employed the Sea of Consciousness gradually stabilized; with various aids the inflow and expenditure roughly balanced.

Yang Kai couldn't help breathing easier — he had nearly made a fool of himself by consuming the holy pill before understanding its nature.

Turning his attention away from the Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai split off part of his mind to examine the pill's secrets through its effects.

At this moment Yang Kai's lower abdomen was like a small sun, continuously emitting vast energy.

After a little probing Yang Kai clicked his tongue in surprise: the pill's effects had only released a tiny fraction, perhaps one percent of the total energy stored within.

But as the pill cloud dissipated and the medicinal force wafted out, Yang Kai could discern traces that had been invisible before.

He could judge the materials chosen for the pill, how the furnace was controlled, what kind of spirit formation had been used in its making, even the mood and methods of the pillmaster who refined it.

Faintly, Yang Kai's mind followed the traces left by the pill refined countless years ago and entered into a new realm.

In that realm countless alchemical secrets revealed themselves to him.

His mood was strange and ecstatic; each fragment imprinted on his soul, raising his understanding of alchemy another notch.
