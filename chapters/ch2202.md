## Chapter 2202 — Seven Seals

Atop Ten Thousand Saints Peak, the main summit of Qingyang Shrine, a building-sized ship slowly descended, stirring up a raging gale.

Below, Hall Master Wen Zishan, Deputy Hall Master Qiu Ran, Elder Chen Qian, and the others, having already received word, stood in solemn anticipation.

Before the ship had even landed, several waves of Divine Sense from Emperor Realm experts swept over it. In an instant, the assembled powerhouses had a clear grasp of the disciples’ losses on this journey.

Although a few elite disciples had been lost, those who carried the greatest hopes had all returned safely. Everyone couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, and their grave expressions eased somewhat.

Moments later, the ship touched down.

The disciples leapt down from above. Gao Xueting formed a hand seal, and the ship was stowed away.

“Hahaha! Little Xueting, I’ve missed you so much these past days. Come, let your uncle give you a hug!” Wen Zishan laughed heartily, striding toward Gao Xueting with open arms.

Swoosh—

Sword qi hummed, killing intent flared.

Wen Zishan halted three feet in front of Gao Xueting, cold sweat beading on his brow. At this moment, a cherry blossom longsword was pressed to his throat. Gao Xueting’s face was frosty as she gripped her sword, staring at him coldly. “Take one more step and I’ll kill you!”

Wen Zishan didn’t dare move a muscle…

“Sigh.” Qiu Ran pressed a hand to his forehead, sighing helplessly. “Hall Master, please have some dignity!”

“It was just a joke...” Wen Zishan gave an awkward laugh, leaping lightly back to his original spot. His expression shifted in an instant, turning solemn as he declared, “Now then... as Hall Master, I congratulate you all on your safe return. Each of you is a pillar of our Shrine’s future, the backbone of generations to come. This journey was arduous—your efforts are deeply appreciated.”

The disciples said nothing, simply gazing at him quietly. Gao Xueting also slowly sheathed her sword.

“Your achievements will be remembered by this Hall Master. The deaths of your fellow disciples were not in vain. Now… those of you who obtained extra Star Seals, come with me. The rest, go and rest.”

“Yes!” At the command, the crowd responded in unison.

In the blink of an eye, only four or five people remained.

Yang Kai glanced around and saw that, besides himself, only Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and another Second Stage Dao Origin Realm young man whose name he didn’t know were left.

Although this young man was also a disciple of Qingyang Shrine and had entered the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai hadn’t interacted much with him on the journey, so he didn’t know him well.

Judging by his demeanor, though, he didn’t seem difficult to get along with.

“Where’s that brat Xia Sheng?” After a moment, Wen Zishan looked at Gao Xueting in puzzlement, not seeing Xia Sheng among them. His expression changed, fearing something had happened to Xia Sheng in the Four Seasons Land.

Even Qiu Ran thought the same, his face paling. “Elder Gao, could it be that Xia Sheng…?”

Gao Xueting replied calmly, “No, he’s right there.”

As she spoke, a figure came flying from the distance, shouting, “Wait for me…!”

Moments later, Xia Sheng landed before the group, looking at Gao Xueting with a face full of grievance. “Elder Gao, next time give me a heads up before you act… I wasn’t prepared at all.”

“What are you up to, brat!” Wen Zishan reached out and knocked Xia Sheng on the head with a burst of force, making him shrink his neck.

“Hall Master, what was that for!” Xia Sheng clutched his head, utterly aggrieved.

Wen Zishan snorted, “Just looking at you, I can tell you angered Elder Gao. Can’t I teach you a lesson?”

Xia Sheng blinked, at a loss for words…

“Alright, since you’re here, you all come with me.” As he spoke, Wen Zishan glanced at Yang Kai. “You too!”

Soon, in the great hall atop Ten Thousand Saints Peak, the Qingyang Shrine’s upper echelons took their seats, while the few disciples and Yang Kai stood in the center.

From above, Wen Zishan looked down with a smile. “Elder Gao, you led the team into the Four Seasons Land, so you should know the details. Please tell us—how many Star Seals did each of these disciples obtain?”

Gao Xueting replied calmly, “Although I haven’t compared with other sects, judging by the number of Star Seals these disciples obtained, the harvest this time should be quite good.”

She turned and said, “Xia Sheng obtained four Star Seals, Xiao Baiyi two, Murong Xiaoxiao two, and Shen Muji two…”

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally learned that the Second Stage Dao Origin Realm youth was named Shen Muji.

She paused, then added, “There were also three other disciples who each obtained one, but they are not present.”

Wen Zishan nodded slightly, indicating his understanding.

Before setting out, Qingyang Shrine had stated that any disciple who obtained a Star Seal in the Four Seasons Land would qualify to enter the Shattered Star Sea. So those three who only got one Star Seal kept them and didn’t need to hand them over here.

Those present were all who had obtained extra Star Seals.

“And this one?” Wen Zishan turned his gaze to Yang Kai.

“He…” Gao Xueting’s expression grew a bit complicated. After a moment’s thought, she said softly, “Seven!”

“What?”

“Did I hear that right?”

“That many?”

Even though everyone present was an Emperor Realm expert with extraordinary composure, they couldn’t help but be shocked when they heard Yang Kai had obtained seven Star Seals alone. All eyes turned to him, sizing him up as if seeing him anew.

After all, even Xia Sheng, the Shrine’s top disciple, had only managed four, and that was with the solid foundation of the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. Yet Yang Kai was only at the First Stage—where did he get seven?

This kid’s luck is outrageous! Everyone thought so, secretly feeling Yang Kai’s fortune must be heaven-defying. Otherwise, there was no way he could have gotten so many Star Seals.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yang Kai remained calm and composed.

Seven Star Seals was indeed the sum of all he’d gained in the Four Seasons Land.

The first was a diamond-shaped Star Seal he obtained in Two Seasons Mountain, when a Demonic Beast, chased by Wuchang and the others, fled in panic and ran right into Yang Kai, who killed it in one blow and picked up the prize.

After that, Yang Kai had no further opportunities to get Star Seals.

Not until he guarded the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus and killed two martial artists did he obtain two more.

At the very end, he made a deal with Wuchang and got four from him.

Luck was certainly a factor in getting so many, but strength was also essential.

In a sense, Star Seals weren’t easy to obtain, as there weren’t many. If Yang Kai hadn’t killed those two martial artists, or made that deal with Wuchang, he might have ended up with only the first one by the time the Four Seasons Land closed.

“There are some reasons for this, which I’ll explain to you later, but he really did get seven Star Seals alone!” Gao Xueting said. The reason she referred to was, of course, the matter of the Supreme Mystic Pill.

Wen Zishan nodded, smiling broadly. “Good, good! With this, when the Shattered Star Sea opens, our Shrine will have nineteen people able to enter. That’s truly delightful.”

If the trials in the Four Seasons Land were just minor skirmishes, then the Shattered Star Sea was the place to test one’s Martial Dao and the will of heaven. Not just anyone could enter such a place.

First, you needed a Star Seal as proof. Second, you needed the strength to pass through the entrance to the Shattered Star Sea. Both were essential.

In other words, even with a Star Seal, those without strength still couldn’t enter.

Qingyang Shrine had nineteen spots, but who knew how many would actually make it in the end.

Still, this number already surpassed many sects and factions.

Wen Zishan was naturally overjoyed.

“This is a sign of our Shrine’s great prosperity!” Qiu Ran intoned like a prophet, stroking his snowy beard with satisfaction.

“No time to waste. Little Qian, collect their extra Star Seals.” As Wen Zishan spoke, he gave Chen Qian a look.

Chen Qian understood, rose gracefully, and with a wave of her hand, a secret treasure shaped like an incense burner appeared. Its grade was clearly high, with runes flickering mysteriously across its surface.

She walked over to the group, stopping before the disciple named Shen Muji, and said gently, “Just relax.”

“Yes!” Shen Muji replied, taking a deep breath and immediately calming himself.

Seeing he was ready, Chen Qian held the incense burner in one hand and formed a seal with the other, tapping several points on Shen Muji’s body.

With a muffled groan, Shen Muji staggered back several steps, his face a bit pale, as if he’d suffered a loss of vitality.

But at the same time, a streak of light shot out from his body.

Chen Qian reacted swiftly, beckoning with her hand. An invisible force seized the light and drew it into the incense burner.

Yang Kai watched in amazement.

Back in the Four Seasons Land, when he made the deal with Wuchang, it was Wuchang who used a secret technique to force out his extra Star Seals for Yang Kai to collect. But now it seemed there was also a way to forcibly strip them away.

Thinking this, Yang Kai realized he’d have to be careful traveling the Star Realm in the future. Otherwise, if he ran into someone with ill intent, they might target his Star Seal, and he’d be in for trouble.

Next, Chen Qian repeated the process, stripping the extra Star Seals from Xia Sheng, Murong Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Baiyi one by one.

Yang Kai saw clearly that, regardless of strength, once their Star Seals were stripped, each person seemed somewhat weakened. Even Xia Sheng swayed and turned a bit pale.

It seemed this method of forcible removal had its drawbacks.

Before long, Chen Qian stood before Yang Kai.

This Elder Chen was quite petite, standing a full head shorter than Yang Kai.

She looked up at him and said calmly, “If you’re ready, I’ll begin.”
