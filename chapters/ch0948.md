## Chapter 948 — Returning to One's Ancestral Sect

The old site of the War Soul Hall was now peacefully inhabited by various forces from the Great Han; after more than ten days of discussion and arrangements, every faction had found a place to settle.

The War Soul Hall had once numbered its disciples in the thousands and occupied vast grounds, so there was no problem accommodating the warriors who had come from the Great Han.

A new home brought a fresh atmosphere, and prosperity bloomed everywhere.

Yang Kai gathered the leaders of the factions together and reminded them of several matters, stressing especially the passage at Poxuan Palace that led into the starry sky gate, ordering them to strictly forbid their disciples from entering casually.

A place like that—even someone of the Saint Realm who entered would face ten deaths with barely a chance at life, let alone this group of people from the Great Han.

“This place is different from the Great Han. You must no longer operate in isolated cliques as before; treat one another as family. It may take you years, decades even, to integrate into this world. The road ahead will be hard, but the opportunities here are far greater than back there,” Yang Kai told them as he looked around.

The faction leaders all nodded in agreement; they had willingly followed Yang Kai here and had long since prepared themselves mentally.

If they wanted to develop and make a living, they had to seek common ground while shelving differences, abandon the old clan and sect gatekeeping, and treat everyone as a unified whole.

There was no need for Yang Kai to lecture them on this—they all understood.

Fortunately, most of those now at the helm were young, and young people were easier to persuade.

The Sacred Land had sent over a large amount of cultivation materials, and these had been properly distributed so the warriors who arrived here needn’t worry about resources and could raise their realms without concern.

It had become very easy for the Sacred Land to collect such materials; the five masters and Xia Ningshang had been refining pills constantly, and after the Small Xuan Realm incident subsided, more and more people came to the Sacred Land seeking pills.

The daily income was enormous—enough to support ten Sacred Lands—so setting aside a portion for the people from the Great Han was of no consequence.

During these days Xia Ningshang also rushed over and stayed a few days to meet the people of Lingxiao Pavilion, but because so many sought pills at the Sacred Land she had to return.

Another ten-odd days later, everything finally fell into place.

In a corner of the War Soul Hall’s old site, Yang Kai appeared and strode over to where Ling Taixu stood silently, gazing into the distance with a deep look in his eyes. Yang Kai called out, “Grandmaster!”

Ling Taixu turned and nodded with a smile. “You’ve been tired these days, haven’t you?”

“Not tired.” Yang Kai laughed. “Being able to settle all of my relatives and friends here was my original wish when I came to this world.”

Ling Taixu looked on approvingly. “You handled things well. I think everyone who came here will be grateful to you.”

Yang Kai drew in a breath and showed a trace of worry. “My only concern now is that they might have conflicts down the road.”

Ling Taixu laughed heartily. “Conflicts will certainly arise—people here come from so many factions. But don’t worry; they’re not unreasonable. Even if disputes occur, they’ll know how to resolve them. If they truly intend to unite, after a generation or two has passed they’ll genuinely become one family. It’s only a matter of time.”

“I hope so.” Yang Kai nodded.

He had done what he could; from here on it depended on the efforts of the Great Han warriors themselves.

“Kai’er, you mentioned the Tianxiao Sect on the way here…” Ling Taixu suddenly changed the subject. “Is it true that the founding patriarch of our Lingxiao Pavilion is there?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai said seriously. “Absolutely. When I first came to this world, the patriarch and senior aunt and uncles took care of me.”

On the way here, Yang Kai had spoken to Lingxiao Pavilion about the Tianxiao Sect. At the time, Lingxiao Pavilion had shown great interest and even some excitement. Now that it was suddenly brought up again, it was clear they had some plan in mind.

“Ancestor is actually still alive…” A look of yearning crossed Ling Taixu’s face. “His strength must have already reached the realm of touching upon creation itself, no?”

“The very pinnacle of cultivation,” Yang Kai said in a low voice.

Ling Taixu drew a deep breath. “I want to go and pay my respects.”

He was the Great Elder of Lingxiao Pavilion, but in rank he was many generations below Chu Lingxiao; now to learn that his sect’s founding patriarch still lived, of course he longed to go and meet him.

“I’ll take you.” Yang Kai immediately offered.

“No need—your affairs are many. Just find someone who knows the way to take me there,” Ling Taixu waved his hand.

Yang Kai smiled mysteriously. “If someone else escorts you it’ll take at least four months round trip, but if I accompany you it only takes a few days.”

“Oh?” Ling Taixu raised an eyebrow. “How can you travel so fast?”

“You’ll see soon enough.” Yang Kai chuckled, then added, “Bring Su Mu along as well.”

Ling Taixu pondered for a moment and nodded. “All right—he is now the sect leader of Lingxiao Pavilion, after all; he should accompany me to pay respects to the patriarch.”

Yang Kai immediately sent out his divine sense and searched the old site of the War Soul Hall for Su Mu.

One incense stick later, Su Mu came rushing in hastily. “Brother-in-law, Elder Sect Leader, what did you call me here for?”

“I’m taking you to meet the Sect Patriarch!” Yang Kai grinned and produced the Flying Shuttle, leapt onto it, and motioned for Su Mu and Ling Taixu to board.

Once the two of them stood on it, the Flying Shuttle instantly became a blue light and vanished.

Feeling the terrifying speed, both Ling Taixu and Su Mu changed color.

Su Mu exclaimed, “Brother-in-law, what sort of secret treasure is this? Its speed feels off the charts!”

He had now reached the Transcendent Realm and sent out his divine sense, but he couldn’t trace the scenery flowing past them—meaning the Flying Shuttle flew several times faster than his divine sense could expand.

“It's the Flying Shuttle—an artifact meant specifically for flight,” Yang Kai explained casually.

“This is incredible. With this speed, if I wanted to go to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, I’d be there in the blink of an eye.” Su Mu was ecstatic. “Brother-in-law, get me one too!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Ling Taixu smiled. “Don’t get your hopes up; this treasure is probably not easy to obtain.”

“Indeed—there’s only this one in the world, and it’s in my possession,” Yang Kai admitted.

Su Mu’s disappointment was palpable; only now did he realize the Flying Shuttle’s rarity and treasure, and he stared in awe and suspicion. “Brother-in-law, you even managed to get this unique treasure—your luck is unbelievable… By the way, what patriarch did you say you were taking me to meet?”

Yang Kai then recounted the story of Chu Lingxiao and the Tianxiao Sect in detail.

Su Mu listened with growing anticipation.

The trip was uneventful, and Yang Kai took the opportunity to fill Su Mu and Ling Taixu in on knowledge of the Tongxuan Continent.

Two days later they arrived at the Tianxiao Sect without incident.

Yang Kai charged straight into Qixiu Peak.

Before he had even entered the mountain corridor, a melodic call rang in his ear: “Little junior nephew!”

Turning toward the voice, he saw Fei Yu standing not far off and waving at him—she had clearly noticed his arrival. Beside her stood Cang Yan, Li Wan, and Fei Jian.

Yang Kai’s face brightened and he hurried over with Ling Taixu and Su Mu.

“I was wondering which fool without eyes dared trespass into Qixiu Peak—so it’s you who’s come back.” Fei Yu’s eyes sparkled with warmth as she looked at Yang Kai, chiding playfully, “Back again without sending word ahead… you’re always coming and going like a ghost.”

“Just arrived.” Yang Kai grinned. “Besides, we’re not outsiders.”

“You’re the only one who dares to come and go from my Qixiu Peak at will. If Li Wan and the others dared, I’d have beaten them senseless,” Fei Yu snorted.

Li Wan looked aggrieved. “Why are you dragging me into this? I’ve never run off without telling you.”

Cang Yan glanced suspiciously at Ling Taixu and Su Mu, wondering why Yang Kai had brought two people to Tianxiao Sect.

“This is the Grandmaster I mentioned before, Ling Taixu; this is my junior brother Su Mu. He’s now the Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“Lingxiao Pavilion!” The four senior uncles’ bodies trembled and surprise showed on their faces. “Is that the sect our patriarch founded in another world?”

“Yes.”

“Ling Taixu of Lingxiao Pavilion greets Senior Brothers and Sister!” Ling Taixu clasped his fists solemnly. Though his appearance looked far older than that of Cang Yan and the others, Ling Taixu knew that in terms of true age, each of the four far surpassed him. Thus addressing them as Senior Brother and Senior Sister was only proper.

“Su Mu greets his Senior Uncles and Aunt!” Su Mu quickly offered his salute as well.

“Very good!” Cang Yan laughed and returned their greetings. “Now our Junior Brother and Junior Nephew have effectively acknowledged their roots. If the patriarch knew, he would be delighted.”

“What about the others from Lingxiao Pavilion?” Fei Yu asked with concern.

“I settled them near the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. The journey is too far; they only just arrived on the Tongxuan Continent, so I didn’t bring them here.”

“No matter—if the chance arises, bring them along next time.” Cang Yan said. “Come, let us go and pay respects to the patriarch; we have business there as well.”

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Ling Taixu’s heart stirred with excitement.

In the secluded chamber where Chu Lingxiao had been in seclusion, people each found a place and sat cross-legged; upon learning of Ling Taixu and Su Mu’s origins, Chu Lingxiao was moved.

After speaking for a while, Chu Lingxiao said, “When I founded Lingxiao Pavilion I acted on impulse. I guarded a demon general’s corporeal body for too long over there, so I found a few successors and taught them casually. I never expected that after I left they would expand Lingxiao Pavilion so magnificently. Indeed, I have been somewhat irresponsible. If I’d known, I would have left more cultivation techniques and secret texts. Over the years you have suffered.”

“Patriarch speaks too highly.” Ling Taixu quickly said, “It is also thanks to Patriarch that we disciples have been able to achieve what we have today. To be able to see Patriarch once in my lifetime is already the blessing of the Lingxiao Pavilion’s forebears. If they know of this in the afterlife, they will surely rest with a smile beneath the nine springs.”

Chu Lingxiao nodded lightly, a look of contentment on his face.
