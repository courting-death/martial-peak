## Chapter 2473 — A Place to Set Foot

Just as that blood-red palm was about to strike, Yang Kai finally raised his hand. As his Origin Qi surged within him, a similarly massive palm print met the attack head-on.

Rumble…

A deafening explosion rang out, the winds and clouds churned, energy surged in all directions. In just a moment, both palm prints vanished as if they had never existed.

Yang Kai stood as steady as a mountain, unmoving in place.

From somewhere below came a soft exclamation, tinged with surprise.

A pure Divine Sense swept over, circling Yang Kai repeatedly, clearly trying to see if he was concealing his cultivation. But no matter how it searched, Yang Kai was still just a Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

This left the Emperor who attacked Yang Kai rather shocked.

He had never met a Dao Origin Realm cultivator who could take a blow from him. Although he hadn’t been an Emperor for long, in these depths of the Origin Sea, he had already killed seven or eight at the Dao Origin Realm with a single palm. The gap in strength between the Realms was as vast as heaven and earth.

Yet, it was useless against Yang Kai.

Not only was he unscathed, he hadn’t even been forced to move an inch.

The man was secretly alarmed, unable to fathom Yang Kai’s origins—how could a Dao Origin Realm cultivator possess such terrifying strength? He certainly hadn’t been this strong when he was at that Realm himself.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “I’m just passing through, looking for a place to settle down. Friend, there’s no need to be so enthusiastic, is there?”

His Divine Sense also swept over the Emperor who had attacked him. This fellow had a head of red hair, as if drenched in fresh blood, and his whole body radiated a violent, bloody aura. Who knew which Sect he came from or what evil arts he practiced.

Although Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of him, there was no real enmity between them, so if he could avoid fighting, he preferred not to.

The red-haired youth looked up at Yang Kai’s position, silent for a long while before finally saying, “Go. Don’t appear within a thousand li of me.”

“Much appreciated!” Yang Kai chuckled, cupping his fists before drifting past him.

But after hearing this, Yang Kai understood why a few Emperor Realms could monopolize the richest area of Origin Power. This guy alone wanted a thousand li to himself—if there were a few more Emperors like him, where would anyone else fit?

But this world has never been about reason. If you’re strong, you can do as you please.

Any Dao Origin Realm cultivator who dared disobey would end up as one of the corpses on the island.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai had already left the red-haired youth behind by over two thousand li, but he still hadn’t found a place to settle. He discovered that the small islands that once existed deeper in had all been smashed apart by the Emperors who arrived first.

Clearly, they didn’t want to leave any spots for latecomers to absorb Origin Power, so they acted so domineeringly.

Suddenly, a spear of light shot up from below, piercing through the void and ignoring all spatial barriers, instantly arriving before Yang Kai. The sharp spear intent stung his skin.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. Realizing the power of this strike, he dared not be careless. He raised his hand and drew the Myriad Sword, slashing out with a single stroke.

A brilliant sword light swept across, colliding with the spear and producing a thunderous crash.

“Hm? A mere Dao Origin Realm cultivator, and you actually blocked my strike? Now that’s a surprise.” A voice finally rang out from below, sounding just as astonished as the red-haired youth before.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “You Emperors have already seized so much territory, but why does every one of you have to ambush me? Have you no shame?”

The man just laughed. “If you come here without strength, only death awaits.” He paused, then added, “If you made it this far, did you pass the Red Ghost’s test?”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred. “You mean that red-haired youth?”

“Exactly.”

“He ambushed me just like you, but I blocked him and he let me go.” Yang Kai snorted, clearly displeased.

“No wonder…” The man nodded slightly. After a moment, he waved his hand. “Go on, then. Since the Red Ghost let you in, you must be worth cultivating. I won’t attack you.”

Yang Kai curled his lip at these words. It was as if they were doing him a great favor by letting him in, and he even had the nerve to say Yang Kai was worth cultivating—what arrogance.

“Are there more Emperors ahead? Are they all going to attack me too?” Yang Kai asked with a grim face.

If that was the case, there was no need to hide his strength—he might as well fight his way through and save himself the trouble.

Unexpectedly, the man’s expression changed faster than flipping a page. He said coldly, “You talk too much, boy. Go if you want, but if you don’t, I’ll make you stay.”

Yang Kai snorted and couldn’t be bothered to argue. He turned and flew deeper in.

This time, however, he abandoned his previous low profile and directly unleashed his Origin Qi, making himself as conspicuous as possible. He believed that unless the Emperors were too focused on absorbing Origin Power, they would sense him from far away.

Perhaps because of this bold confidence, as he continued on, he sensed the presence of two more Emperors, but neither attacked him. They merely swept him with their Divine Sense and lost interest.

Yang Kai was quite pleased with this.

Half an hour later, his eyes lit up and he flew down toward a certain spot below.

There, he found a fine place to settle, and it was quite spacious—about a hundred zhang across.

Such a large spot was rare in the Origin Sea, since these islands weren’t true islands. No one knew how they formed, but they were few in number and small in size.

The place Yang Kai found could easily accommodate over a hundred people without feeling crowded.

After landing, Yang Kai glanced around, very satisfied. He considered calling Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao over to join him, but recalling the Emperors’ earlier actions, he decided against it.

Unless he went to fetch them himself—Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao couldn’t make it through with their current strength.

Sitting cross-legged, Yang Kai tried absorbing the Origin Power here. Soon, his face lit up with joy—the Origin Power here was indeed much purer and denser than elsewhere, and seemed easier to absorb.

For any cultivator, this was truly a blessed land for cultivation.

He didn’t rush to refine and absorb it, but instead released his Divine Sense to survey the surroundings.

Within a thousand li, there wasn’t a soul in sight.

With a wave of his hand, a colossal figure appeared beside him. The giant body seemed to reach the sky and step on the earth, and as it appeared, the small island even sank a little.

The Incarnation!

Yang Kai usually wouldn’t summon his Incarnation from the Small Xuan Realm lightly, as its body was too large and unwieldy, and summoning it consumed too much Divine Sense.

But now was the perfect time to call it out.

There was no one around, so he didn’t have to worry about the Incarnation being discovered. With so much Origin Power here, Yang Kai couldn’t absorb it all himself. Summoning the Incarnation would let it benefit as well.

The Incarnation had previously told him that its cultivation had reached a bottleneck, likely related to the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. Letting it absorb and refine Origin Power here might help it break through.

There was no need for words. As soon as the Incarnation appeared, it understood Yang Kai’s intentions and carefully sat down cross-legged, quietly circulating its cultivation technique.

The Incarnation also knew the Star Refining Technique. Back then, it had used this technique to refine the Origin Power of the Floating Continent, merging with it to achieve its massive form.

The Star Refining Technique specialized in refining Origin Power, while the Heaven Devouring Battle Art could devour anything. With these two heaven-defying techniques colliding, Yang Kai was eager to see what kind of astonishing results would emerge.

After releasing the Incarnation, Yang Kai didn’t stop. He formed a few hand seals and tapped the Xuan Realm Pearl, opening a rift and letting it devour the Origin Power here to its heart’s content.

If he wanted to restore the Xuan Realm Pearl’s world laws, he could only pin his hopes on Origin Power.

After quietly observing for a while, Yang Kai saw that the Origin Power in the Origin Sea was being frantically devoured by the Small Xuan Realm. Only then did he close his eyes and focus, activating the Star Refining Technique to refine it himself.

In an instant, the vast island seemed to become a source that devoured Origin Power.

The Incarnation activated both the Star Refining Technique and the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. Its massive body was like a bottomless pit, able to accept and refine any amount of Origin Power.

As for the Xuan Realm Pearl, it was even more terrifying, devouring Origin Power faster than the Incarnation.

Compared to them, Yang Kai’s own activity was insignificant, but his speed at refining Origin Power with the Star Refining Technique was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators.

As time passed, the commotion here grew larger and more terrifying. Thunderous booms rang out as Origin Power from all over the Origin Sea was drawn here and vanished.

The vast Origin Sea was actually being pulled by this mysterious force, slowly flowing toward Yang Kai’s island.

The disturbance here seemed to have affected the entire Origin Sea, but Yang Kai, the instigator, appeared completely unaware.

Little by little, the cultivators absorbing and refining Origin Power at the edge of the Origin Sea sensed something was amiss. To their astonishment, it seemed as though the Origin Sea itself was shrinking. Where there had once been some distance between them and the shoreline, that gap steadily closed, until at last, the Origin Sea had completely receded from their reach.

It was as if the entire Origin Sea was receding like the tide, leaving those cultivators who had been immersed in its waters stranded on the shore, even though they hadn’t moved at all.

This discovery left many cultivators astonished, unable to understand what was happening.
