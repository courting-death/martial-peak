## Chapter 891 — Moonlight Herb

Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects are exceedingly rare and not easy to obtain; some martial artists might never see one in their lifetime.

Because these things already possess a certain degree of sentience and can be regarded as a form of living being, they know to seek good fortune and avoid calamity—when they sense danger they flee far away, making them difficult to find.

Xu Hui smiled as he read the atmosphere and said, "Rest assured, our Sacred Land isn't demanding your wealth. The Saint Lord has decreed that anyone who hands over a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object—regardless of grade or type—will have our Sacred Land's master refine three pills for them free of charge, and at once; no queuing, guaranteed success."

At those words, the gathered crowd erupted.

A master from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land charging for pill refinement does not ask for a meager fee, but neither is it insignificant—it's crystal stones or medicinal materials equal in value to the pill produced.

Such a price is affordable for most.

Saint-Grade materials are hard to come by, but some people are not short of crystal stones.

Still, if the payment were three pills, that would be a handsome sum—enough to tempt many.

Someone in the group asked, "Great Elder, free refinement of three pills—does that apply to any grade?"

Xu Hui smiled and shook his head: "No grade limits. Even if you want a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill refined, it's the same."

"What guts your sect's master has!" the man exclaimed, and the others were stunned.

Although so far no one had actually requested a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill, from Xu Hui's words one could infer the master was capable of producing pills of that caliber and had unshakable confidence in his skill.

"So if any of you have a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object, please don't hide it—the opportunity is rare!" Xu Hui chuckled, urging them on.

He didn't know whether these people actually had Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects, nor what Yang Kai wanted with it, but since the Saint Lord had given the order he had to carry it out fully.

At the end of the line, from the group that had just arrived, someone hesitated for a long moment before asking, "Great Elder, will any kind of Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object do?"

"Any kind," Xu Hui nodded firmly, fixing his gaze on the man.

The man grew serious and asked again, "But what if I only want one pill refined?"

"The remaining two," Xu Hui said, "our Sacred Land will keep for you. Whenever you wish to have them refined, you may come at any time—there will be no waiting."

"Is that so..." The man grew excited; carefully he took from his bosom a jade vessel, jogged up to Xu Hui, and handed it over. "Great Elder, would you please see if this will do?"

He spoke with eager expectation and a touch of nervousness.

The man was only in his thirties and of modest strength, only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, so the pill he could reasonably request would at most be an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade pill.

Moreover, a cultivator of his rank rarely had the chance to speak directly with someone of Xu Hui's stature, so today’s opportunity naturally thrilled him.

Xu Hui raised an eyebrow, took the exquisite jade vessel, and reached to open it.

The man hurriedly warned, "Great Elder, be careful—this thing runs quickly; if you're not careful it'll slip away. I only obtained it by chance and don't even know what it is; I'm ashamed to say so."

"No matter!" Xu Hui said confidently, his vast divine sense enveloping the vessel without leaving the slightest gap.

Many craned their necks to see what Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object was inside.

Even elders Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei leaned in.

The vessel was opened, and in an instant a faint, pure light bloomed from within—like moonlight, crystalline as water.

It seemed to sense its container had been opened, and the light surged to escape.

Xu Hui chuckled, his expression composed.

Enveloped by divine sense, the light could not break free, circling within a tiny area in anxious agitation.

After some time the faint light gradually condensed, coalescing into the shape of a three-leaf spiritual herb.

The herb radiated not insignificant energy fluctuations and vigorous life; it was translucent and exquisite, as if carved from white jade.

The three leaves were tender and fresh, like droplets of water gathered together.

"Truly a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object!" Xu Hui's eyes brightened and he inclined his head slightly.

With his sight he could tell that this herb indeed possessed some degree of sentience.

"Does anyone recognize what kind of Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object this is?" Xu Hui asked aloud of those seeking pills.

Most shook their heads; only one man chuckled, "Great Elder, this is a Moonlight Herb. It draws on the moon's essence and develops sentience. Although it's a type of Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object, its growth span is short—now it has only three leaves, so it will likely be of limited use. If it were allowed to grow another hundred years to five leaves or more, its value would be entirely different."

"Oh? You know this well," Xu Hui smiled at him.

"I'm no expert—I'm simply more interested in spiritual herbs and medicines. Thirty years ago I aimed to become a pill refiner, but my aptitude was lacking; I achieved nothing in that path and turned to martial cultivation instead."

"I see." Xu Hui nodded. A pill refiner's knowledge of herbs and medicines is indeed deeper than most; though this man never became an outstanding alchemist, his grasp of herbal lore surpassed that of ordinary folk.

"So...it's no good?" The Moonlight Herb's owner scratched his head, embarrassed.

Hearing others say the herb had little value made him anxious.

After all, the master had promised to refine three pills—could a single Moonlight Herb be worth that?

"No!" Xu Hui unexpectedly shook his head with a smile. "I said that regardless of grade or species, if it's a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object it will do. I won't go back on my word! Hmm, I'll take this Moonlight Herb. Young brother, come with me—the master can begin refining your pills at once!"

"Wonderful!" the man rejoiced.

He had only just arrived; if he waited he'd have to wait at least six or seven days and pay a fee equivalent to the pill's value.

Yet a single Moonlight Herb let him jump ahead of others and have the master refine three pills for him, regardless of grade!

Later, once he found the materials, he could return to have two Saint Pills refined.

If luck smiled and the pills displayed patterns, selling them might change his life.

He daydreamed, feeling lightheaded as if a bright future were beckoning.

"Wait!" someone suddenly shouted from the crowd.

Xu Hui frowned and glanced over; the speaker was a Saint Realm expert, and Xu Hui's expression soured slightly: "What do you have to say?"

"Not at all, not at all!" the Saint Realm cultivator laughed awkwardly. "Great Elder, please wait a moment—may I speak a few words with this young brother?"

Xu Hui watched him for a long time before nodding slightly: "Then be quick—the Saint Lord is waiting for my reply."

"Thank you, Great Elder!" the man said, then approached the Divine Roaming Realm peak cultivator and spoke to him with a friendly tone.

He intentionally lowered his voice so that, despite curiosity from the crowd, no one could hear their exchange.

At first the Moonlight Herb's owner appeared reluctant, but after the Saint Realm expert said a few words he brightened and nodded repeatedly.

Many in the crowd looked thoughtful, seeming to have guessed what the two were discussing.

After a while the two finished speaking; it appeared they'd reached an understanding and both seemed pleased.

Before Xu Hui could call them to enter the Nine Heavens Sacred Land together, several Saint Realm cultivators had already surrounded the Moonlight Herb's owner.

A fierce bargaining broke out.

The owner was at a loss; he dared not offend any of these Saint Realm experts and could only shout, "Seniors, name your price—the highest bidder wins!"

Upon hearing this, they immediately put forward their offers, each trying to outdo the others.

Xu Hui was half-amused, half-exasperated; he quickly realized what the owner was up to.

The Sacred Land had promised to refine three pills for him, regardless of grade, and for free.

Inspired by the first cultivator who approached him, the owner planned to sell those three chances.

Three chances equaled three payments; the gains would be considerable.

Xu Hui shook his head slowly but did not intervene; since the Sacred Land had handed him the opportunity, it was not appropriate to interfere.

After some time the owner came back to Xu Hui in high spirits, flattering him: "Sorry to keep you waiting, Great Elder; let's go inside."

Xu Hui glanced at him and asked with a smile, "Did their offers satisfy you?"

The man smiled sheepishly: "Very satisfied—extremely satisfied. But is this all right?"

"Of course it's fine. The Sacred Land gave you three chances—how you use them is your affair."

"That's great!" He was giddy from such a windfall.

Those Saint Realm cultivators who didn't wish to wait outside offered benefits nearly equivalent to the cost of refining a Saint Pill.

In effect, the owner had taken rewards belonging to the Sacred Land for himself, and his contribution was only a low-grade Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object.

For a cultivator at the Divine Roaming Realm, this was the greatest opportunity of his life.

They led him into the guest hall, took the three materials that were meant for others, and Xu Hui immediately went to the Saint Lord's court.

In a side chamber, the scent of pills filled the air; Yang Kai sat meditating to recover, a small pill furnace set before him.

Xu Hui entered and reported the matter.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, took the medicinal materials and the Moonlight Herb Xu Hui had brought, and instructed, "Come collect them when I call you."

"Yes!"

After Xu Hui left, Yang Kai placed the Moonlight Herb into the Black Book Space and withdrew his mind into it.

A strand of moonlike radiance darted anxiously through the Black Book Space, seeking shelter.

The Divine Tree inspected it with curiosity, fixing its divine sense upon it and watching without pause.
