## Chapter 495 — Fortune and Misfortune Are Interdependent

Yang Kai’s expression was calm, his gaze clear and penetrating, evidently not engaging in any crafty stratagem of retreat to advance.

Suddenly, Yang Yinghao's expression shifted, and he asked curiously, “So, your main purpose in participating in the succession war is this?”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai nodded. “Only the head of the Yang Family has the ability to vindicate the reputation of Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“Don’t you want to be the head of the Yang Family, commanding the world, turning clouds into rain with a flick of your hand?” Yang Yinghao inquired sternly.

Yang Kai sneered, a hint of derision playing across his face as he said calmly, “What’s so good about being the head of the Yang Family? It’s a position mired in endless affairs. Once you take that seat, you can barely guarantee even your own cultivation time. Uncle, aren’t you the perfect example? Although you have ascended beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, by my estimation, you should be one of the weaker ones at that level, right?”

“Impudent!” Yang Zhen roared angrily, his eye twitching. He had never seen anyone speak so freely in front of Yang Yinghao.

Yang Yinghao waved his hand to stop Yang Zhen’s reprimand, a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. “That’s correct, I’m not particularly outstanding beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, in fact, I’m rather at the bottom of that tier. It’s the sorrow of every head of the Yang Family. I didn’t expect you to be able to see through this.”

He paused, then said meaningfully, “But do you know why every head of the Yang Family has always been beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?”

“Why?” Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly grew curious.

Indeed, according to records, every previous head of the Yang Family has reached beyond the Divine Roaming Realm without exception. That realm represents the pinnacle of this world’s Martial Peak. Few can reach that stage and look down upon the myriad living beings.

It couldn’t be that every head of the family inherently possessed such talent and aptitude, could it?

Moreover, Yang Yinghao was not very old—about fifty or so. To have reached beyond the Divine Roaming Realm at that age, his potential should be terrifying.

Such a terrifying talent. So why is he the weakest among those beyond Divine Roaming?

“Because the Yang Family has the foundation to elevate its head beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!” Yang Yinghao stared intently at Yang Kai, speaking astonishingly.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. He suddenly realized he had unknowingly overheard a family secret.

“Do you understand what I mean?” Yang Yinghao asked.

Yang Kai shook his head, though a hint of speculation burned in his heart, he dared not be certain.

“Heh.” Yang Yinghao smiled. “Do you think being the head of the Yang Family is only about hard work and exhausting oneself for the clan? There are tremendous benefits as well. Not to hide it from you, but compared with your father’s aptitude, I’m still somewhat lacking. However, your father has long suffered from a chronic ailment and his strength had been stagnant. Yet, for some unknown reason, his cultivation has advanced by leaps and bounds recently.”

As he spoke, he glanced subtly at Yang Kai, seemingly pondering something. Yang Kai remained indifferent, revealing no expression.

“Not to mention him, just speaking for myself, if I cultivated on my own, I would probably only reach the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. I know my own aptitude; the Divine Roaming Realm’s peak is my limit. Even if I had fifty more years, I wouldn’t surpass it. Many martial artists reach the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm, but beyond Divine Roaming is extremely rare.”

“But I became the head of the Yang Family, and as early as five years ago, I ascended beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!”

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered, suspicious. “The title of family head squeezed your current cultivation level?”

“You could say that!” Yang Yinghao nodded lightly. “As for the exact mysteries, I cannot tell you. You only need to know this much.”

“Why is the head telling me all this?” Yang Kai’s mind was full of questions. While this indeed stirred some interest in the position of family head, that was all.

“Just chatting casually; don’t take it to heart,” Yang Yinghao smiled faintly.

Yang Kai frowned, pondering deeply, then shook his head and said solemnly, “Then what about my previous request?”

Yang Yinghao said, “I do have the ability to vindicate Lingxiao Pavilion’s name. But if I were to agree to your demand now, it would likely cause the world to suspect I forced you to withdraw from the succession war under this condition. So... I refuse!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

“If you want to clear the sect’s name, rely on your own ability! Or do you believe that missing a few Blood Servants will cost you the succession war?”

Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent as he shook his head. “Family Head, your provocations do not affect me.”

“Then prove it with your strength!” Yang Yinghao smiled slightly. “Blood Servants must be recalled. Your losses, the family will compensate. Make your request clearly. I’ve come specifically to settle this matter.”

Yang Kai inhaled a deep breath of Primordial Qi, realizing that spoken to this point, it was likely impossible to reverse the situation.

The family had long since decided; however much he made a fuss, the stronger party would always prevail.

He frowned and pondered for a while before suddenly raising his eyes, speaking sharply, “From now on, all the Blood Servants who follow and will follow me belong entirely to me!”

Yang Yinghao stood still, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment, while Yang Zhen and a group of white-haired elders gaped, clearly never expecting Yang Kai to have such a large appetite.

“That request... is unreasonable,” Yang Zhen snorted coldly.

The experts in the Blood Servants Hall traditionally swear allegiance only to the family, not to any individual. But if this demand were granted, it would mean at least seven Blood Servants would fall under Yang Kai’s authority.

“That’s my only request. Whether you agree or not, Family Head, it’s your call,” Yang Kai reiterated, his face serious.

Even Yang Yinghao, no stranger to storms and trials, felt a headache coming.

No one had ever made such a demand; it was outright disrespectful.

Yet he had just refused another of Yang Kai’s requests and now would have to refuse again...

Moreover, this had originally been the family's offer to compensate his losses.

He smiled bitterly. “More than half of those Blood Servants cannot participate in the succession war. Why do you want their loyalty?”

“I have my uses,” Yang Kai responded calmly.

Yang Yinghao breathed out deeply, weariness in his eyes. After a long silence, he nodded. “Fine, I agree.”

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, not expecting such a prompt reply.

Yang Zhen hurriedly intervened, “Family Head, you mustn’t—”

“It’s fine!” Yang Yinghao waved him off. “Yang Kai is also family. Even if the Blood Servants fall under his name, they are still part of the Yang Family.”

“Though you say that...”

“That’s enough. This is the family’s fault this time.” Yang Yinghao clearly did not want to argue further and looked at Yang Kai. “I agree to your demand. I hope you will make good use of these Blood Servants. The family did not train them lightly!”

“I understand. Thank you, Uncle.”

“But you must confirm exactly which two Blood Servants will participate in the succession war. Once confirmed, none of the others may intervene.”

“Confirm now?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Yes, now!”

Yang Kai felt immediately conflicted.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu were the first to follow him. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were the first he met and greeted upon returning to Zhongdu. Xiao Shun, Luo Hai, Yan Lingxing, Yang Kai was not yet very close to them, so excluding them there were only four Blood Servants left. It was difficult to treat everyone fairly.

The hesitation lasted only a moment before Yang Kai’s eyes hardened: “Then Ying Jiu and Yuxian.”

“So decisive! That is how a true Yang Family member acts!” Yang Yinghao praised. “Then that’s settled. You should hurry back to War City.”

“Disciple takes his leave!” Yang Kai saluted orderly and left the Elder Hall calmly.

Outside, Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian were sweating heavily, anxiously waiting.

They had overheard the quarrel within the Elder Hall and secretly worried about Yang Kai.

When Yang Kai emerged, both looked at him with grateful expressions and nodded. Being chosen by him to assist in the succession war naturally made them proud and honored.

After leaving the Elder Hall, Yang Kai said nothing, but everyone could tell his mood was less than good.

Returning to Fourth Master Yang’s estate, Yang Kai left some Wan Yao Ling Ye with Fourth Master Yang and Dong Suzhu, before dashing toward War City with Ying Jiu and Yuxian.

Throughout the journey, Yang Kai’s silence made the two Blood Servants nervous. They wanted to lighten his mood but didn’t know how to comfort him.

Just as tension peaked, Yang Kai, riding the Treading Cloud Steed ahead, suddenly burst out into loud laughter, invigorating and heartening.

The two exchanged puzzled glances and caught up. From the side, they saw Yang Kai’s face filled with joy, the earlier gloom and displeasure vanishing into the clouds.

“Young Master...” Tang Yuxian pursed her red lips, unsure why his mood had shifted so drastically.

Yang Kai’s laughter grew louder.

Tang Yuxian suddenly understood, “So your earlier demeanor was just putting on a show for others?”

“Having taken such a great advantage, I naturally have to provide some psychological balance for the others. If I had looked excited all along, those elders might have been suspicious,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

This matter was truly a great gain.

Though the family’s commands limited Yang Kai’s actions in the succession war, in the long run, he was undoubtedly the biggest winner.

So many Blood Servants now under his name, at his disposal—this was unprecedented in the entire Yang Family.

Fortune and misfortune are indeed intertwined.

Besides, only two Blood Servants could participate in the succession war. Could it not still be won? Yang Kai was filled with confidence in his future.

His mind clear and Primordial Qi surging.

In half an hour, they had traveled a hundred miles.

The hooves of the Treading Cloud Steed startled Qiu Yimeng, who anxiously waited at the estate. The young lady hurried out to greet them, her bright eyes observing carefully as she silently wondered what the Yang Family’s summons of Yang Kai back to Zhongdu meant.

When she saw Yang Kai’s silent face, she couldn’t help but feel a pang in her heart, sensing that something was amiss.
