## Chapter 2231 — Escape

The Dao Origin Realm and the Emperor Realm—between the two lies a chasm.

If one were to compare the soul strength of a Dao Origin Realm cultivator to a wooden stick, then the Emperor Realm would be an iron rod. Naturally, the latter is sturdier and more resilient.

The difference between the First Stage, Second Stage, and Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm is merely the thickness and length of the wooden stick each possesses.

To upgrade one’s wooden stick into an iron rod, one must cross that chasm.

Yang Kai was now within that chasm, not having fully crossed it yet. However, because he had touched upon Emperor Intent, his wooden stick was already coated with a layer of iron, giving him a bit of the power only those in the Emperor Realm could possess, though there was still a great difference from a true Emperor Realm cultivator.

But this was already enough.

In this world, aside from him, who else at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm had touched upon the existence of Emperor Intent? Even those ten renowned Emperors of the entire Star Realm could not achieve such a feat when they were at Yang Kai’s level.

To touch upon Emperor Intent ahead of time would naturally bring him immense benefits for his future growth.

Yang Kai continued to watch the battlefield intently. The dual assault on vision and soul that would be unbearable for others was, to him, like a gentle breeze—nothing to be concerned about.

Because the moment that impact reached his Spirit Body, it was completely dissolved by the Warm Spirit Lotus, leaving him entirely unaffected.

Time flowed by slowly.

Yang Kai’s gains grew ever greater, and on the battlefield, the fight between the two experts had clearly reached a fever pitch. Zhou Dian roared repeatedly, unable to contain his fury, while Yi Quan’s expression grew grave, no longer as relaxed as before. His long sword flickered as secret techniques emerged one after another while he tangled with Zhou Dian without pause.

With Yang Kai’s cultivation and eyesight, he simply could not tell which of the two was stronger or who held the advantage. He only felt that they were evenly matched.

However... judging from Zhou Dian’s increasingly agitated voice, it seemed he was falling slightly behind.

This was no surprise. From the bits and pieces he’d heard earlier, Yang Kai deduced that two thousand years ago, Zhou Dian and Yi Quan had fought a great battle. At that time, Zhou Dian was wounded and Yi Quan emerged victorious.

Now, two thousand years later, both had grown, but Yi Quan had obtained an Imperial-Grade Divine Soul Secret Treasure, giving him an even greater edge atop his already formidable strength.

It was only natural that he could suppress Zhou Dian.

But if they wanted to decide a victor... that would be difficult!

Yang Kai reckoned that even if these two fought for ten days or half a month, the battle might still not end.

He was quite happy to see this, as it meant he had plenty of time to continue observing and comprehending.

Just then, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed as he keenly sensed a faint abnormal fluctuation in the space around him.

His expression darkened as he turned to look at Bai Lu and Yuan Fei, only to find that neither of them reacted at all.

He immediately thought it was just his imagination. Just as he was about to refocus on the battle, Yang Kai suddenly noticed something. His face changed dramatically as he shouted toward the front, "Senior, be careful!"

Before he could finish, another figure suddenly appeared on the tense battlefield.

This figure was tall and mysterious, the entire person wrapped in a black cloak, making it impossible to discern their build. Their face was hidden behind a ghastly mask, making them look utterly terrifying.

This person appeared without warning. Even experts like Yi Quan and Zhou Dian failed to notice any trace. If not for Yang Kai’s mastery of Spatial Power and other spatial divine abilities, he likely wouldn’t have sensed it either.

Though the other party acted with secrecy, the faint spatial fluctuation caused by their arrival was still keenly caught by Yang Kai.

But his warning was still too late.

The moment the masked figure appeared, they moved to Yi Quan’s side and slowly thrust out a palm, striking at Yi Quan.

Yi Quan’s face changed drastically. He withdrew his long sword and stabbed to the side, trying to defend with offense.

This strike contained all his strength.

Energy surged on the sword’s edge like a tidal wave, as if it could swallow the heavens and earth.

The masked figure’s attack was barely blocked.

But Zhou Dian seized the opportunity, thrusting and flicking his halberd to break through Yi Quan’s defenses, piercing a hole in his shoulder.

“Ugh...” Yi Quan grunted, his body retreating explosively. Once he steadied himself, he slapped his shoulder repeatedly, trying to ease the injury.

But Zhou Dian’s full-force strike was not so easily resolved. The force that had penetrated Yi Quan’s body had clearly left him seriously wounded, and pure soul energy was now leaking from the wound, flowing into the world.

"My lord!" Bai Lu, Yuan Fei, and the other yao experts cried out in alarm, their faces changing dramatically as they rushed to help.

Yi Quan raised a hand to stop them, his gaze heavy as he looked at the suddenly appearing masked figure, his expression shifting unpredictably.

Zhou Dian also hadn’t expected the masked figure to appear here, and to attack Yi Quan while he was locked in battle. If not for this interference, he would never have been able to wound Yi Quan.

This act displeased Zhou Dian, as it sullied the sanctity of their duel. Even so, he dared not be careless. He cupped his fists and bowed, “Your Majesty, why have you come?”

“To fetch you!” the masked figure replied slowly, their voice hoarse and grating like metal scraping, making it extremely unpleasant to hear.

“But I...” Zhou Dian seemed to want to argue further.

The masked figure cut him off directly, “No need to say more. Take everyone back to the palace. Leave this place to me!”

The king’s order could not be disobeyed. Zhou Dian could only grit his teeth and reply in a deep voice, “Yes!”

With that, he glanced helplessly at Yi Quan, then his figure flickered as he flew toward where Yang Kai was.

Yi Quan turned, looked at Yang Kai, and spat out one word: "Run!"

Yang Kai reacted instantly. Although this sudden change had come out of nowhere, in that brief moment, he had already deduced everything.

This masked figure was undoubtedly Zhou Dian’s master, the one who had ordered his capture.

For someone able to command Zhou Dian, he was clearly also a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Judging from his earlier appearance and ambush on Yi Quan, his strength was likely even greater than Yi Quan’s.

With this person restraining Yi Quan, Zhou Dian would have no more opponents.

How could Yang Kai hesitate? The moment Yi Quan uttered the word “run,” he moved, traversing a thousand zhang in an instant.

In that moment, he had already used his spatial divine ability.

In front of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert like Zhou Dian, he could think of no other way to escape except by using spatial divine abilities.

As Yang Kai fled, Bai Lu and Yuan Fei stood side by side, blocking Zhou Dian’s path.

These two yao experts, seeing a powerful enemy approach, both let out deep shouts and revealed their true forms in flashes of light.

“Roar...” As Yuan Fei roared, he charged at Zhou Dian, trying to block him.

Bai Lu, meanwhile, was shrouded in pure white light. Who knew what profound secret technique she used, but she transformed the area within thirty li into a world of pure white, making it impossible to tell direction.

“Those who block me die!” Zhou Dian shouted angrily, his halberd spinning in his hands.

Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss...

The sound of space being torn rang out. Before Yuan Fei could even get close to Zhou Dian, he was struck by a mysterious attack and sent flying, crashing far away, his fate unknown.

The gap in strength was simply too great. Yuan Fei was no match for Zhou Dian at all.

The world of white also began to crack. In just two breaths, it shattered completely.

Bai Lu’s figure reappeared, but the light around her was now extremely dim.

Zhou Dian turned into a stream of light, flying over the two without even glancing at them, chasing straight after Yang Kai.

“He runs so fast!” Zhou Dian exclaimed in surprise as he looked at the distant figure.

He had thought that, as a powerful expert, capturing Yang Kai would be a simple matter. But when he actually tried, he found that this brat, only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, possessed a wondrous secret technique. When used, it completely ignored the barriers of space, allowing him to instantly move from one place to another. The brief delay caused by Yuan Fei and Bai Lu had nearly allowed Yang Kai to escape his Divine Sense’s range.

“Interesting!” Zhou Dian snorted coldly, and his already lightning-fast speed increased even further.

Meanwhile, Lian Yan, who had come with Zhou Dian, saw the situation turn dire and, while everyone was distracted, quietly slipped out of Heavenly Yao Valley.

...

In Heavenly Yao Mountain, Yang Kai was fleeing for his life, repeatedly using spatial secret techniques and concealing his aura. He dared not run in a straight line, constantly changing direction in hopes of shaking off Zhou Dian behind him.

But it was all in vain. No matter what he did, a powerful Divine Sense remained locked onto him.

He hadn’t realized it while just observing, but now, truly facing it, Yang Kai deeply understood the terror of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

The vast gap in cultivation between himself and Zhou Dian was not something spatial divine abilities could bridge.

The distance between them grew ever smaller. For the first time, Yang Kai felt what it meant to despair!

Spatial divine abilities could not shake off his pursuer. He no longer knew what method to use to resolve this crisis.

The Soul-Devouring Worms probably wouldn’t work, since Yi Quan had said before that they weren’t strong enough. Yi Quan had even suppressed them previously.

Zhou Dian and Yi Quan were experts of the same level. If Yi Quan could do it, Zhou Dian certainly could as well!

The Soul-Severing Blade might offer a sliver of hope, but not much. After all, Yang Kai had never refined it and couldn’t unleash its full power. The only reason he’d succeeded in ambushing Ban Qing before was because Ban Qing wasn’t strong enough and Yang Kai had caught him off guard.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai realized he was out of options. It seemed he could only surrender!

Just as his thoughts raced, Zhou Dian was only thirty li behind him. At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a powerful force hurtling toward him from behind.

In his panic, he looked back, and his face instantly turned ashen.

He saw that Zhou Dian had actually thrown his halberd at him. Although Yang Kai didn’t know what was special about this attack, he still did everything he could to dodge.
