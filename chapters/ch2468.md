## Chapter 2468 — The Mountain and River Bell’s Suppression

But just then, Feng Xuan’s heart suddenly skipped a beat—a vague sense of unease welled up within him. It was pure instinct, the kind of intuition that only grows sharper with cultivation.

He stared wide-eyed at Yang Kai, only to see Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turn solemn. Yang Kai’s hands rapidly formed a series of strange seals, and an indescribable profound intent began to swirl around him. The depth and mystery of this intent even moved Feng Xuan, making him want to immerse himself in it and comprehend it further.

What secret technique is this? Feng Xuan’s face instantly filled with shock and suspicion. Although he instinctively sensed something was wrong, he still couldn’t suppress his curiosity. He stared intently, wanting to see it clearly.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai’s seals were complete. A mysterious mark hovered before him, and with a palm strike, he sent it out.

“The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream!” Yang Kai’s deep voice echoed like a soul-reaping call from purgatory, ringing in Feng Xi’s ears.

Feng Xi’s face changed dramatically as he cried out in shock, “The Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability—the Years Like a Shuttle Seal!”

Unlike ordinary cultivators, Feng Xuan was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, and also the Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, a descendant of the Great Emperor Wenqing.

So his knowledge and experience were extremely broad. The moment Yang Kai unleashed his move, he recognized it as the once-famous divine ability of the Great Emperor of Time. His heart pounded wildly, his face was filled with shock, but his eyes were brimming with excitement.

The Great Emperor of Time—rumor had it he was the only Great Emperor to ever comprehend the Laws of Time. In the countless years of the Star Realm, there was no one else like him.

Throughout history, countless experts had tried to comprehend the Laws of Time, but none could even step through the threshold. This showed just how strange and mysterious these Laws were. Feng Xuan had thought that after the Great Emperor of Time’s fall, no one in this world could ever comprehend the Laws of Time again.

Yet now, he actually saw the unique divine ability of the Great Emperor of Time from Yang Kai’s hands.

Didn’t this mean Yang Kai had inherited the Great Emperor of Time’s legacy? Otherwise, how could he unleash the Years Like a Shuttle Seal!

For a moment, Feng Xuan’s heart was filled with envy, jealousy, and a trace of fear—his emotions were impossibly complex.

The moment the Years Like a Shuttle Seal appeared, Feng Xuan realized he had underestimated Yang Kai’s strength. Under the influence of that strange Law Power, he felt as if everything around him had slowed down.

He knew this was an illusion—a false sensation brought about by the influence of the Laws of Time.

Shocked to his core, he swept up his longsword, Origin Qi surging within him. Sword energy burst forth from the deep-blue blade, and his entire being radiated sword intent. His expression was solemn, his eyes devoid of all desire and emotion.

"Sentiment Questioned, Sentiment Severed; the Heavenly Dao, Without Dao—Sever!"

It was the same secret divine art, unleashed through the very same body, yet the power it displayed was worlds apart. When Feng Xi had used this technique earlier, he had been battered into a daze by Yang Kai’s spatial divine abilities, knocked senseless on the spot. Now, however, with Feng Xuan descending through Soul Descent to wield it, the might of the art was nothing short of heaven-shaking.

That emotionless, desireless slash swept across, colliding head-on with the Years Like a Shuttle Seal that pierced through the barrier of time.

Two completely different Law Powers clashed, causing the void to collapse and the world to shatter.

Thunderous booms rang out as the shockwaves exploded, sweeping in all directions.

Whether it was Yang Kai or Feng Xi, both were like lone boats sailing through a stormy sea, bodies swaying as if they could capsize at any moment.

But the yellow-faced youth and the scholarly middle-aged man watching from not far away fared much worse. Under the erosion of the two Law Powers, their eyes went blank, as if they’d lost their souls. Their skin quickly wrinkled, their hair turned white, and the power of time swept over them, turning them into decrepit old men in an instant.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The deafening explosions continued. Yang Kai was suddenly sent flying backward—he had actually fallen into disadvantage in this clash.

It wasn’t that the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability was inferior to Wenqing Sect’s secret technique, but simply that Yang Kai’s strength couldn’t compare to Feng Xuan’s.

Seeing this, Feng Xuan’s eyes narrowed, his face turned ruthless, and as his body swayed, he forcefully drew upon his remaining strength to deliver a killing blow.

Although he wanted to capture Yang Kai alive and extract the Great Emperor of Time’s legacy and secret techniques from him, Feng Xi’s body simply couldn’t withstand it any longer.

After the Soul Descent, the strain on Feng Xi’s body was immense. Being forced to unleash the Dao-less, Emotionless Slash had already pushed him to his absolute limit; if he continued to entangle himself with Yang Kai, there would be no need for further injury—Feng Xi’s body would collapse on its own.

He felt a wave of regret in his heart.

Back in Binglun City, if he’d thrown caution and reputation aside to attack Yang Kai, he wouldn’t be in this mess today. Maybe he could have captured Yang Kai, and then the Great Emperor of Time’s legacy would be his.

At that point, with the legacies of two Great Emperors in his hands, he’d be poised to become the overlord of the Northern Territory.

“What’s the point of being emotionless if you still seek to question emotion? And if you claim to have no Dao, how can you pursue the Martial Dao at all?” Yang Kai shouted as he staggered backward, his face twisted with fury. “Your Wenqing Sect is just lying to itself—what a joke!” He suddenly burst into wild laughter, madness flashing in his eyes.

Feng Xuan roared, “Ignorant brat, what do you know? Die now!”

As he spoke, he slashed his sword at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shouted angrily, “You want to kill me? You’re not qualified! Mountain and River Bell, suppress him!”

With a wave of his hand, a palm-sized bell-shaped Secret Treasure suddenly flew out—it was the Mountain and River Bell he had only recently subdued.

Even the Years Like a Shuttle Seal couldn’t do anything to Feng Xuan. Now, Yang Kai’s only trump card was the Mountain and River Bell. If even that couldn’t suppress Feng Xuan, he’d have no choice but to flee.

He believed that even though he was seriously injured, with his mastery of spatial secret techniques, it would still be difficult for Feng Xuan to kill him.

As soon as the Mountain and River Bell appeared, Yang Kai immediately felt the Origin Qi in his body and the power of his Divine Soul in his Sea of Consciousness pour out like a breached dam, draining away in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai was startled, his face instantly turning pale, his head splitting with pain.

This was his first time using the Mountain and River Bell, and he never expected the price to be so great.

Before, when his cultivation was lacking and he used the Extinction Thunder Bead, he’d had a similar experience, but compared to this, that was nothing at all.

At this moment, Yang Kai truly felt like he was about to die.

This Primordial Era treasure hadn’t even hurt his enemy yet, but had already left him unable to take care of himself. Who knew what the outcome would be?

He forced himself to stay conscious, staring at Feng Xi.

Feng Xi’s face changed dramatically as he cried out, “The Mountain and River Bell? The Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s life-bound Secret Treasure?!”

He was utterly shocked. Yang Kai had already amazed him with his spatial secret techniques—after all, not everyone could comprehend and cultivate those. Then, when Yang Kai unleashed the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability, Feng Xuan couldn’t imagine what kind of fortune Yang Kai had encountered to obtain things countless experts could never get in a lifetime.

And now, Yang Kai had even brought out the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s life-bound Secret Treasure. Feng Xuan nearly bit off his own tongue in disbelief.

It’s fake, it has to be fake!

Feng Xuan screamed in his heart, but when he looked closely, the Mountain and River Bell rapidly expanded, a bell toll rang out, resonating deep within his soul and making him restless. Complex patterns and images flickered across the bell’s surface, flowing endlessly, and a primordial aura filled the air, making it hard to breathe.

It really was the Mountain and River Bell! That aura of the Primordial Era was not something that could be faked.

Feng Xuan’s face instantly turned as pale as paper.

Without thinking, he turned to flee.

But a mysterious force suppressed the entire world, sealing space. He couldn’t move at all, and the power in his meridians was locked, unable to circulate.

The Mountain and River Bell—its toll suppresses mountains and rivers, its Imperial Aura reverses the heavens!

When the bell tolls, its suppression is absolute—no one can escape. Even someone as skilled in space powers as Yang Kai, once locked onto by the Mountain and River Bell, would have nowhere to run, let alone Feng Xuan.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to suppress the True Phoenix Fire for tens of thousands of years.

Watching as the Mountain and River Bell descended upon him, Feng Xuan felt his very Divine Soul tremble. He screamed in terror, “Brat, stop! If you dare kill my son, this Lord will hunt you to the ends of the earth and tear you to pieces!”

“Go to hell!” Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood, cursing furiously.

Boom…

Unsurprisingly, Feng Xi’s body was directly suppressed by the Mountain and River Bell, vanishing without a trace.

“Ah…”

The yellow-faced youth and the scholarly middle-aged man stood there trembling, now old and decrepit, their eyes nearly popping out in shock.

Yang Kai, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, had actually suppressed their Sect Master’s Soul Descent body…

Was this really something a Dao Origin Realm warrior could do? Both men felt a chill run down their spines, icy fear gripping them from head to toe.

“Did the Young Sect Master… die?” The yellow-faced youth opened his mouth, all his teeth falling out in a row, unable to even speak clearly.

The scholarly middle-aged man was the same.

Although the two hadn’t been struck directly by the Years Like a Shuttle Seal, they’d been affected by the Laws of Time. Their bodies were no longer those of men in their prime.

“Cough, cough…” Yang Kai kept coughing, looking utterly miserable. He weakly flicked his finger, sending a burst of force at the Mountain and River Bell.

Boom…

The bell tolled again, and a massive shockwave spread in all directions.

“No!” The yellow-faced youth and the scholarly man shouted, trying to escape, but the sound wave engulfed them. Both spat blood, their blood mixed with fragments of their organs, and in the blink of an eye, their lives were snuffed out.

Only then did Yang Kai reach out, and the now-enlarged Mountain and River Bell flew back to his hand, shrinking to palm size midway.

At the spot where the Mountain and River Bell had just suppressed him, Feng Xi was already reduced to a mangled heap of flesh and blood—his death unspeakably tragic.

Three Star Seals of varying brightness shot out from the corpses, flying toward the back of Yang Kai’s hand.

All three Star Seals were of extremely high grade—Feng Xi’s was a Seven-Pointed Star Seal, while the other two were Six-Pointed Star Seals. With these, Yang Kai’s Star Seal was one big step closer to upgrading.

But Yang Kai had no mind to care about any of that. He didn’t even have the strength to collect the three’s Spatial Rings. The aftereffects of using the Mountain and River Bell swept over him, leaving him weak and powerless. His vision went black, and he fainted on the spot.
