## Chapter 589 — The Succession Ceremony

In truth, Yang Yinghao also sensed that Yang Kai must have succeeded, though he could not fathom what had transpired in these past two days.

“Mm.” Sure enough, Yang Kai nodded gently.

Yang Yinghao hesitated, then after a long moment of contemplation, asked, “How many did you absorb?”

“All of them.”

“All of them?” Yang Yinghao’s eyes nearly popped out in disbelief as he stared at Yang Kai.

“How did you endure it?” Yang Yinghao was dumbfounded.

He himself had ventured into that space before, fully aware of the opportunities within and of the dangers waiting there. Back then, with his cultivation at the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage, he had fought tooth and nail and only managed to absorb the spirit bodies of two Yang Family ancestors.

Even that had taken him at least two to three years to completely expel the thoughts and consciousness from those two ancestral spirit bodies.

After all, while inheriting their insight into the Dao of Heaven and Martial Dao, he also acquired the torment they had endured over countless years—pain so excruciating as if personally experienced. This had to be purged, or it would disrupt a lifetime of peace.

If there had been one more, Yang Yinghao suspected he would not have been able to endure it, and though he might not have died, he would have become a cripple.

Yet now Yang Kai told him he had absorbed the spirit bodies of all the Yang Family ancestors.

Yang Yinghao could not believe it, yet had no choice but to accept it.

Because the Four Sacred Beast statues had already cracked open with countless fissures, and the space where those consciousnesses had gathered no longer existed. Such a sign meant that the place where the ancestral spirit bodies converged had vanished, and those spirit bodies had been absorbed.

From now on, the Divine Root Hall would scarcely be able to fulfill its previous function, unless the Four Sacred Beast statues could be repaired, and again, some expert dies and retreats their spirit bodies inside.

Yang Yinghao’s expression was complex as he looked at Yang Kai with newfound respect.

This was not the typical demeanor a senior would show a junior, yet Yang Yinghao could not help revealing it.

He understood that perhaps for now, he stood on a slightly higher step than Yang Kai, but with the passage of time, Yang Kai would ascend to heights beyond his imagining, standing atop the clouds to overlook all living beings.

“Sorry for destroying this foundation of the Yang Family. I will compensate in the future,” Yang Kai frowned, noticing the damage done to the Four Sacred Beast statues.

“No need. This place was prepared specifically for the Yang Family Head anyway.” Yang Yinghao shook his head and spoke respectfully, “Family Head, the Succession Ceremony of the Seven Great Families has been fully prepared, held at our Yang Family’s Sacrificial Altar. We only await your arrival to begin.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, silently acknowledging how much his position and identity had changed in the eyes of others. Such a monumental event had been waiting all along for him. He smiled broadly, “Then let us hurry. We shouldn’t keep them waiting.”

Yang Yinghao nodded slightly and took the lead.

Arriving outside the Divine Root Hall, the elders and Fourth Master Yang and his wife were no longer there, only Di Mo remained on guard.

Seeing Yang Kai safely emerge, Di Mo chuckled softly.

The Yang Family Sacrificial Altar.

Nearly two years ago, the Yang Family’s Succession War began here. The Yang Family’s eight brothers gathered, listening to Family Head Yang Yinghao’s impassioned speech before riding their Treading Cloud Steeds to War City, high-spirited.

Nearly two years later, the Succession Ceremony for the Seven Great Families was again held here.

When Yang Kai arrived, all affairs were prepared. Accompanied by a shout of “Yang Family Family Head has arrived,” all present rose respectfully.

Yang Kai maintained a calm expression as he strode up to the Sacrificial Altar, swept his gaze around, and said in a clear voice, “This junior is still young, and though I am temporarily acting as the Yang Family Head, I am unfamiliar with the rites and procedures of this succession ceremony. Today, I shall trouble my Great Uncle to preside over it.”

It was impossible to let him preside over the ceremony. Though he would not embarrass himself, this was an event of the Seven Great Families. If procedures were incorrectly handled, it would be far too careless.

Yang Yinghao slightly nodded, then instantly appeared atop the altar.

While Yang Yinghao spoke, Yang Kai quietly slipped down and made his way to the side where Qiu Yimeng and others stood.

“How do you feel?” Yang Kai glanced at the seven young people with a smile.

“Terrible.” Huo Xingchen pouted. “Whenever I think that I have to become the head of the Huo Family, I feel like dying.”

“You really aren’t suited for it.” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

“Yang Kai, thank you.” Qiu Yimeng suddenly said.

“For what?” Yang Kai tilted his head, looking at her.

“Don’t feign ignorance. We both know that the reason you so generously accepted all those forces seeking to ally with you that day was to pressure the Eight Great Families, forcing them to step down.” Qiu Yimeng’s face blossomed with a knowing smile. “Others think you were just gathering strength, but I know your aim was this very situation.”

Yang Kai was taken aback but did not deny it, nodding, “There’s some truth to that.”

“I have always wanted to inherit the Qiu Family. Now that my wish is fulfilled, I owe you thanks.” Qiu Yimeng was touched. “Tell me, what would you like as reward? If you want me, that’s possible too.”

Huo Xingchen and the others shuddered, looking at Qiu Yimeng with strange expressions.

Meng Shanyi coughed violently, pale and gasping. After a long moment, he said, “Qiu Yimeng, you are now head of the Qiu Family. It’s hardly proper to say such things publicly; it could affect the family’s reputation.”

“Brother Meng, your injuries have yet to heal?” Yang Kai looked at him appreciatively for changing the subject.

Meng Shanyi grimaced. “I fear I shall never fully recover in this lifetime.”

Meng Shanyi had suffered poisoning from Ghost King and Poison King’s ghostly and toxic energies. Though he had escaped death, he had been bedridden these many months. If not for today’s ceremony, he would not have appeared.

Yang Kai frowned, thought for a moment, then leaned forward and whispered, “Open your mouth!”

“Huh?” Meng Shanyi was suspicious.

The next moment, he sensed something flicked into his mouth by Yang Kai. Instinctively, he swallowed, and a warm current spread through his abdomen, suddenly restoring him some strength. His pallid face regained a flush.

In Meng Shanyi’s mind, various speculations flashed by, and his expression brightened as he cupped his fist, “Thanks, Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head without saying more.

At that moment, Yang Yinghao finished speaking, loudly pronouncing, “The Succession Ceremony will now begin!”

Drums thundered, brass instruments played, and the atmosphere grew lively.

A strange smile crept at the corner of Yang Kai’s lips as he turned to gaze northward.

Amid the clamor, several forms shot rapidly from the north, filling everyone with a chilling dread that spread deep within their hearts.

“They’ve come,” Qiu Yimeng stood beside Yang Kai, eyes fixed on the distance.

“They have no choice,” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

The drum and musical sounds continued, yet the elite forces of the Eight Great Families gathered their strength stealthily, eager and ready to act.

Though sensing something amiss here, the figures from the north approached with calm assurance, moving like lightning.

Though Yang Kai had stayed inside the Divine Root Hall these past two days, this outcome was precisely what he had long anticipated.

The Succession Ceremony of the Seven Great Families was but a pretense. The real transfer of family head titles had secretly occurred the night before.

That meant Qiu Yimeng and the others were now legitimately heads of the Seven Great Families.

With these young leaders, the alliance with Yang Kai’s Manor was formally established. If the Cangyun Evil Land did not act now, once the ceremony concluded today, they would face a fierce assault led by Yang Kai and the elites of Zhongdu.

Strike first or be struck—this was the law all understood.

Although Yang Bai knew it was a trap, he had no choice but to recklessly charge in.

Before long, the silhouettes of the Six Great Evil Kings came into view, standing in a hexagonal formation, calmly hovering midair. Each bore a sinister aura, and malicious laughter echoed from the mouths of Ghost King and Poison King, unbearable and stirring the qi and blood within.

“Six Evil Kings!” Yang Yinghao and others stared hard at the six, their eyes burning with hatred.

Among them, Ye Kuangren and Kang Rui were stupefied as they saw two people held by Yinming Ghost King.

Those were Ye Xinrou and Kang Zhan, seized six months ago.

Now, their expressions were vacant, their clothes tattered, their appearance wasted. Their True Yuan seemed entirely drained; they had been reduced to mere ordinary mortals.

It was clear they had suffered inhuman tortures at the hands of the Cangyun Evil Land during these months.

Noticing their gazes, Ghost King laughed sinisterly, “The Seven Great Families hold a grand Succession Ceremony, a world event. Our master sent us to congratulate you and offer these humble gifts. Please accept them with grace!”

With that, he tossed Ye Xinrou and Kang Zhan down.

Ye Kuangren and Kang Rui shouted and rushed forward to catch them.

“Stop!” Yang Yinghao shouted sharply.

Ghost King's action was suspicious—he would not return those two without doing something to them.

To everyone's surprise, after Ye Kuangren and Kang Rui received Ye Xinrou and Kang Zhan, nothing peculiar happened. The two youths remained dazed, soulless, with lifeless eyes. Though they emitted qi, they were like walking corpses.

Ye Kuangren and Kang Rui examined their condition carefully but found no abnormalities. Still cautious, they entrusted these two to their family members with a stern command: “Take them down and imprison them.”

Having arranged this, the two raised their heads, fixing their gaze fiercely on the Six Great Evil Kings.

“You old family heads, truly wary ones,” Ghost King sneered, mocking them.

“Enough talk! Since you dare show yourselves here today, you shall die without a grave!” Ye Kuangren roared.

Suddenly, a figure appeared mysteriously before the Six Great Evil Kings, interrupting Ye Kuangren’s words.

Upon seeing his face, all changed color.

Evil Lord Yang Bai!
