## Chapter 2152 — Golden Cloud

“There’s actually such a miraculous secret art in this world?” Lan Xun listened to Yang Kai’s explanation and was instantly astonished.

She was no stranger to wonders, and her knowledge was vast—after all, she was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor. In the Star God Palace, she could learn any secret art she wished, but she had truly never heard of anything like the Qiankun Shifting Divine Art.

Yet the effects of this secret art were plain to see. With only First Stage cultivation in the Dao Origin Realm, Yang Kai emerged unscathed from the combined assault of two Third Stage experts. This was nothing short of a remarkable feat.

Of course, she had no way of knowing that there was no such thing as the Qiankun Shifting Divine Art at all. Yang Kai had simply used the Nothingness secret art at a critical moment, slipping himself into the void…

"It’s enough that you know of this secret art; it must never be spread," Yang Kai said solemnly, almost demanding an oath from Lan Xun.

“Mm, mm.” Lan Xun nodded repeatedly, all the while pondering whether she ought to wrest this secret art from Yang Kai. The conditions for using the Qiankun Shifting Divine Art were indeed harsh, but its power was undeniable—at a crucial moment, it could absolutely save a life.

Suddenly, Yang Kai rubbed his hands together, looking a bit embarrassed. “Princess, I answered one of your questions. Could you answer one of mine?”

“What do you want to ask?” Before Lan Xun could speak, Xiao Chen immediately grew wary.

"I just want to ask about the Star Seals. What do you think I want to ask?" Yang Kai looked at Xiao Chen with an innocent expression, as if cowed by his imposing manner.

Lan Xun pursed her lips and smiled. “Brother Xiao Chen, why are you so fierce with others?” Then she turned to Yang Kai and said, “You want to ask about the categories and grades of the Star Seal, right?”

Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, flattering, “Princess truly has a keen mind, seeing right through my thoughts.”

Lan Xun gave a faint, noncommittal smile, yet did not hold back. Composing herself, she said, "Star Seals do indeed have ranks. Their shapes are not fixed… but the more intricate the seal, the higher its grade. Take the Diamond-shaped Star Seal in your hand—among the lower forms, only the Triangular Star Seal ranks below it. Above it are the Five-Rayed, Six-Rayed, Seven-Rayed, and even Eight-Rayed Star Seals."

"What's the difference between them?" Yang Kai asked sincerely.

The reason he was cozying up to Lan Xun was to probe for information about the Star Seal. He could have asked Hua Qingsi, but Lan Xun was the daughter of an Emperor—she might know things others didn’t.

“I can’t say exactly,” Lan Xun slowly shook her head. “But it’s said that the higher the grade of the Star Seal, the greater the benefits one can obtain in the Shattered Star Sea. As for the reason, perhaps only by entering the Shattered Star Sea can it be discovered.”

“I see…” Yang Kai mused.

Whether or not Lan Xun had revealed all she knew, at least she had answered Yang Kai’s question. Even if it wasn’t complete, Yang Kai couldn’t press further.

As they spoke, they arrived at their destination.

Ahead, martial artists gathered in small groups, standing atop the treetops of a forest, all looking up at the sky as if silently waiting for something.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately leapt onto an empty treetop and looked around.

Those who had set out before him—Wuchang, Luo Yuan, Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and others—were already here. Besides them, there were other martial artists, clearly drawn by the earlier commotion.

With a rough glance, Yang Kai counted at least a dozen people, and from deep within the forest came the sound of figures rushing through the air—clearly, more were on their way.

In the sky above, a massive cloud rolled and churned, shining with dazzling golden light as if cast from pure gold. Its brilliance was overwhelming, and it was clear it contained some profound mystery. Yang Kai faintly sensed a strange energy fluctuation from within that golden cloud.

“Hmm…” As he observed, his gaze suddenly paused, shifting to a nearby spot.

Over there, a man and a woman were smiling at him. When he looked their way, the woman even waved at Yang Kai.

“What bad luck!” Yang Kai cursed inwardly, but he couldn’t pretend not to see them. With a flicker, he leapt dozens of zhang to the opposite side.

“Why are you two here as well?” After landing, Yang Kai asked the pair.

These two were none other than Bian Yuqing and Kou Wu of the Biyu Sect.

Although Yang Kai no longer had any enmity with these two, the man standing behind them was Wu Mengchuan. If he could avoid it, he truly had no wish to cross paths with them.

“We were already here!” Bian Yuqing replied with a smile. From her words, it seemed that after being brought in, their arrival point was Two Seasons Mountain.

“Oh?” Kou Wu’s eyes lit up, staring at the back of Yang Kai’s hand. “Junior Brother Yang actually obtained a Star Seal? That’s truly worth celebrating!”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched helplessly. “If I could, I’d rather not have it!”

“Junior Brother Yang, you don’t really mean that, do you?” Kou Wu teased.

Yang Kai snorted, “Look around and see how everyone reacted to your words. Then you’ll know what I mean.”

Kou Wu glanced up, and his face immediately darkened.

He saw that all the martial artists gathered here had turned their eyes to the back of Yang Kai’s hand. Some even showed greedy, covetous looks.

Although dozens of Star Seals had just rained down from the heavens, not a single cultivator present had actually obtained one. Star Seals were the token for entry into the Shattered Star Sea, and before setting foot in the Four Seasons Land, the elders of every Sect had cautioned their disciples a thousand times over: safeguard your own life first, but do everything you can to vie for a Star Seal.

Kou Wu, caught off guard, had spoken a bit too loudly, making Yang Kai the center of attention. He couldn’t help but feel guilty and uneasy.

Bian Yuqing just giggled, her beautiful eyes glancing around as she softly said, “If you don’t want it, why not give it to me?”

“Keep dreaming!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

"So heartless…" Bian Yuqing gazed at Yang Kai with grievance, biting her red lips. "If I hadn’t looked after you back then, how would you have what you have today?"

“You dare bring up the past?” Yang Kai shot her a sidelong glance and snorted. “If you hadn’t forced me to stay in the Biyu Sect, I wouldn’t have been…”

“Wouldn’t have been what?” Bian Yuqing asked.

“Nothing.” Yang Kai waved his hand. Just thinking about being forcibly taught the Heaven Devouring Battle Art by Wu Mengchuan made him uneasy. Fortunately, he hadn’t cultivated it himself, but had given it to his Incarnation. That way, even if Wu Mengchuan had some scheme, it couldn’t harm him.

“Look at this man—truly a beast in human skin! Just now, he acted so meek and naive before Princess, but now he’s tangled up with that seductive woman. He’s clearly no good!” Not far away, Xiao Chen finally seized the chance to sidle up to Lan Xun, looking at Yang Kai with disdain and doing his best to smear him.

“Say what you will, but why get so close?” Lan Xun moved away with a look of disgust.

“I was just afraid you wouldn’t hear me…” Exposed, Xiao Chen looked embarrassed and grew even more resentful of Yang Kai. Earlier, Yang Kai had also gotten close to the Princess, but she hadn’t minded. Yet when it was his turn, he was spurned…

Xiao Chen’s anger flared up inside.

“I’m not deaf!” Lan Xun snorted, her beautiful eyes glancing around suspiciously. “More than that, I want to know… where did those falling Star Seals go?”

Everyone had been chasing the direction the Star Seals fell, but upon arriving, they found no trace. Lan Xun couldn’t help but feel puzzled.

“Let me ask.” Xiao Chen immediately volunteered. Scanning the crowd, his gaze settled on a short man who was with another man and woman. Judging by their attire, they were clearly from the same sect.

Their cultivation wasn’t low either—the short man was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while the other two were at the Second Stage.

“You! Come here!” Xiao Chen called out to the short man from afar.

The short man looked around suspiciously, then pointed at himself. “Me?”

“That’s right, you!” Xiao Chen said impatiently.

Realizing Xiao Chen was calling him, the short man’s face changed slightly, and the man and woman with him grew tense, unsure what Xiao Chen wanted.

Before entering the Four Seasons Land, the elders of the smaller sects and families had done thorough research, passing on the names and portraits of the elite and important figures from the major sects to their disciples. This way, their disciples could avoid unnecessary conflict.

So even though the three had never met Xiao Chen in person, they knew who he was.

Now, being summoned by Xiao Chen, the short man was naturally nervous. Though he was also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, just like Xiao Chen, he knew full well that if they fought, he’d be dead in less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

That’s the difference between background and training.

Despite his reluctance, the short man slowly flew over to Xiao Chen and Lan Xun, forcing out an awkward smile and cupping his fists. “Jing Li of Renwu Sect greets Lord Xiao. May I ask what Lord Xiao wishes of me?”

This Jing Li fellow made himself very humble. Though he was much older than Xiao Chen and had the same cultivation, he called Xiao Chen ‘Lord’ with every word, making Xiao Chen feel quite comfortable.
