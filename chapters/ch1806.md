## Chapter 1806 — Wudao Pill

Although some of the medicinal materials had lost their potency, their sheer quantity made it still no small a gain.

"You didn't hide any away, did you?" Yang Kai asked, casting a sidelong glance at Lü Guichen.

"I— I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare!" Lü Guichen flinched and hastily waved his hands. Now that he was under another's roof, how could he dare give Yang Kai any cause for trouble? He quickly swore and vowed that if he had hoarded anything, may heaven strike him with thunder and so on.

"Enough. This has nothing to do with you here; step aside." Yang Kai waved impatiently.

Lü Guichen, however, remained rooted to the spot, stammering as he looked at Yang Kai, as if he wanted to say something but held back.

"What else is it?"

"Young hero... uh, that, that, that origin..."

"Is that something you should be asking?" Yang Kai's expression hardened; a chill flared in his eyes as an invisible Divine Sense surged outward.

In an instant, Lü Guichen suffered as if struck by a heavy blow. The defenses of his Sea of Consciousness were torn apart in a single moment; a splitting pain wracked his head as he staggered backward, his face turning pale.

After taking that blow, Lü Guichen was mortally frightened and immediately realised his earlier suspicions had been correct: if Yang Kai truly wished to kill him, it would be nothing more than slaughtering a chicken or a dog...

He looked up, but Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen—he had long since left the spot.

Lü Guichen gave a bitter laugh and quickly sat cross‑legged, circulating his arts and using Saint Yuan to treat his injuries.

At a certain place on the Floating Continent, where the mountains and waters were fair, Yang Kai appeared.

"The scenery's good—this will do." he murmured, then released several Blood Beasts to spread around and stand guard.

Although there was currently only one outsider, Lü Guichen, on the Floating Continent, Yang Kai was confident he wouldn't rashly come to disturb him. Still, one must prepare for contingencies; by releasing a few Blood Beasts as sentries, Yang Kai could rest easy.

He then produced his Purple Void Cauldron used for alchemy and began searching the Spatial Ring for ingredients.

"What pill should I refine?" Yang Kai's Divine Sense scanned the Spatial Ring.

This time his alchemy was primarily to stir the qi for his breakthrough, so it didn't matter what pill he made; he only needed the act of refining to draw himself into harmony with the world.

“Purple Sun Grass, Hundred-Leaf Lotus… huh, even Hollow Fruit is here. Perfect — I’ll refine a Wudao Pill, then. Just right to take it after my breakthrough to stabilize my realm,” Yang Kai quickly decided.

He had all the main ingredients needed to refine the Wudao Pill already, which made things most convenient.

Taking out each of the herbs one by one and placing them by his side, Yang Kai then formed a hand seal and pointed toward the Purple Void Cauldron.

The Divine Sense Fire surged in at once, and the Purple Void Cauldron's temperature leapt.

Herbs were methodically cast into the furnace, the intensity of the Divine Sense Fire constantly adjusted. Yang Kai's alchemical path had begun with the True Alchemy Formula; he had also received guidance from the Tianzang Elder of Tongxuan Continent, and later he inherited the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy—every technique he learned was among the finest of alchemy.

Coupled with his exchanges with Xia Ningshang on the art of refining pills, his skill in alchemy had reached a notable level.

One by one, seals and patterns were impressed into the Purple Void Cauldron. Spirit arrays flickered into being and dissolved within the cauldron as Yang Kai maintained an utterly focused mien. He discarded all distractions and devoted himself entirely to the refining.

His aura began to meld with the heaven and earth; he seemed to become part of the world itself.

Refining a Spiritual Pill was a complex procedure; it was far more than simply condensing medicinal fluid and letting it react in the furnace.

Precisely when to apply what level of heat, when to etch which spirit array, which seal to perform—every step demanded exactitude. A single misstep or a slight mistiming could ruin the refinement; even if a pill formed, its quality might be poor.

Alchemy was a path that tested mind and will to the utmost.

With Divine Sense Fire at his command, Yang Kai had a decisive advantage in refining; the time and effort he spent were far less than those of an ordinary alchemist.

Especially with the restorative effects of the Seven-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus combined with his powerful Divine Soul, he could wield his Divine Sense Fire without restraint.

Time flowed slowly as the Purple Void Cauldron emitted gurgling sounds—the precious medicinal fluids reacting, undergoing wondrous transformations.

A faint, strange fragrance wafted from the cauldron, refreshing the spirit; it was the sign that the pill had begun to condense.

Yang Kai's expression turned more solemn. With a gesture he called in one of the Blood Beasts on sentry duty; it transformed into Golden Blood Threads and shot back into his hand.

The Golden Blood Threads were like a wisp of gold and crimson smoke, dancing on Yang Kai's fingertips.

As he twirled them, the Golden Blood Threads slowly reformed into golden radiance, while the red was sifted away and condensed into a crimson mist.

From within that mist came the distant roar of a beast, and at moments it even manifested into the likeness of a demonic beast.

"Stop kicking up a fuss; being used for refining is your best fate—behave yourself." Yang Kai reached out and seized the crimson mist, laughing lightly.

The sentient red mist seemed to sense danger and only grew more restless instead of calming.

Yang Kai snorted and tossed the red mist directly into the cauldron.

The last line of the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy did say that a pill must have spirit to be called a Spiritual Pill!

Yang Kai had pondered over that for a long time before finally understanding what it truly meant.

A pill could never gain sentience for no reason — unless it had been left untouched for an exceedingly long time, in an environment of exceptionally dense Spiritual Qi, where the harmony of heaven and earth over countless years would gradually give birth to a Pill Spirit.

Since a pill could not become sentient by accident, he could instead imbue it with spirit himself.

The best method was to use the inner core of a demonic beast as a Pill Guide!

A demonic beast's inner core contained its essence and spirit, making it the finest Pill Guide.

Although Yang Kai did not possess any high‑grade inner cores, he did have Blood Beasts.

They could also serve as Dan Guides!

This time he was refining Void King‑Grade Spiritual Pill, and a Pill Guide was indispensable. Yang Kai had to use his Blood Beasts; though this would cost him one Blood Beast, compared to the value of the Wudao Pill, the trade‑off was obvious.

The blood mist was cast into the Purple Void Cauldron, and immediately the cauldron seemed to trigger a tremendous chain reaction; deafening noises erupted.

"Trying to resist!" Yang Kai's expression hardened. He formed seals and continuously suppressed it.

As befits the soul of a Ninth‑Tier demonic beast, it took Yang Kai dozens of breaths to fully pacify it.

The fragrance flowing through the air only grew more heady.

Thud, thud, thud...

At the same time, Yang Kai felt the fluctuations of his Saint Yuan within him; it began to beat with a violent, impelling rhythm.

"Is it coming?" his eyes glittered; he knew his actions had stirred the qi—he stood at the threshold of breakthrough.

But with the pill nearly complete, he had no mind to abandon it halfway.

Hastily forming seals, he began to employ the condensation techniques recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy, fashioning different seals and imprinting them into the Purple Void Cauldron.

The commotion in the cauldron intensified. Only after Yang Kai impressed hundreds of seals did a rolling sound suddenly come from within—something was tumbling about in the Purple Void Cauldron.

"Come out!" Yang Kai roared, slapping the Purple Void Cauldron with a palm. In the next instant, three beams of light shot forth from the cauldron, each fleeing in a different direction.

"Ha! Trying to run—how foolish!" Yang Kai laughed. With a flick of his body, he appeared behind one pill, grabbed it without looking, and shoved it into a prepared jade vial. He repeated the action, packing the second and third pills into bottles.

To refine a Pill and yield three finished ones in a single attempt — such an achievement was already regarded as the pinnacle of Alchemy within the entire Star Domain.

The most renowned alchemists, no matter how exquisite their skill, could only ever produce one Spiritual Pill from a single set of ingredients.

But Yang Kai had shattered that common sense.

The ancient alchemical techniques recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy were indeed peerlessly wondrous.

Perhaps in ancient times such methods were common among the great powers, but over time this miraculous alchemy had been lost, leaving later alchemists able only to refine a single pill from one set of materials.

Rumble... thunderous detonations rolled through the sky.

Yang Kai looked up and saw a mass of pitch‑black clouds gathering overhead like a century‑unwashed quilt, heavy and suffocating.

Within that black cloud lay a terrifying aura of destruction, as though it could obliterate the entire Floating Continent.

And it had only begun; vast amounts of Spiritual Qi continuously poured into the black cloud from the surroundings, enlarging it.

Yang Kai's face turned grave.

This time his advancement was a major realm promotion—from the Origin Returning Realm to the Void King Realm—and the coming heaven‑earth Baptism would surely be extraordinary.

After observing for a moment, he scattered countless Saint Crystals with a wave and then punched out explosively, Saint Yuan surging to strike those crystals.

"Explode for me!"

Boom—tens of millions of Saint Crystals shattered into fine dust in midair, the Spiritual Qi stored within them splashing out in every direction and filling the vast area.

In the blink of an eye, the Spiritual Qi around Yang Kai rose a whole grade within a ten‑li radius of his position.

A breakthrough demanded copious Spiritual Qi. Though the Floating Continent's Qi was abundant, Yang Kai did not dare slacken; he was willing to shatter tens of millions of Saint Crystals to enrich his local environment.

With the Spiritual Qi now plentiful, Yang Kai still did not stop his preparations.

With a sweep of his hand he scattered piece after piece of hexagonal stones imbued with profound intent around his body.

There were over a hundred of those stones; they echoed each other from afar and gradually caused the area to form the power of a Domain Field.

Domain Stones!

Besides giving some of his Domain Stones to close relations, Yang Kai had kept a number in reserve; now at the gateway of the Void King Realm breakthrough, he spared no expense.

He hoped to draw energy from those Domain Stones during his breakthrough to heighten his comprehension and grasp of Domain.

He then released his Blood Beasts, as well as the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao and the artifact spirit Liu Yan, issuing orders: "Spread out—within thirty li; any who approach are to be slain without mercy!"

He took this precaution mainly to guard against Lü Guichen. If that brat still bore resentment and came to disturb him during his breakthrough, the consequences would be unimaginable.

In the next moment the Blood Beasts and the Stone Puppet scattered. Before departing, the artifact spirit Liu Yan gazed upward toward the black clouds with a face full of dread.

She could sense the horror of this heaven‑earth Baptism; even with her current strength she could not claim she could easily block it.
