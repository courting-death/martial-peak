## Chapter 631 — What Are You Doing

In that pool of blood, Yun Xuan stared wide-eyed, her gaze vacant as she lay there; her plump, full form exposed to the air, a torn wound on her flat belly gushing blood that stained her fair body with a lurid beauty.

She was still breathing and not in mortal danger, but Yang Kai keenly sensed that she had lost the will to live.

Whatever had just happened had given her a death wish.

Propping his body up with great weakness, Yang Kai slowly walked over to her, picked up his trousers and pulled them on, then took his robe and tore it in two.

After a moment’s hesitation, Yang Kai produced some Wan Yao Ling Ye and smeared it on the wound in Yun Xuan’s belly.

His touch sent tremors through Yun Xuan’s delicate body; she finally came to her senses, and when she saw the situation before her, a most complicated expression rose in her beautiful eyes.

“I know what you want to say, but it’s best if you don’t speak now. Survive first — beat me, curse me, do whatever you want later. In any case, what had to be done has been done. Don’t worry, I won’t cling to you, and I don’t want you to cling to me either. Let’s just treat it as a dream; once everything stabilizes, we go our separate ways!” Yang Kai spoke with a fastidious air, as if muttering to himself.

Using one half of the robe, he cleaned the wound on Yun Xuan’s belly, then used the remaining half to bandage her.

Yun Xuan meant to resist, but her whole body could not summon a fraction of strength.

The afterglow of the peak made her body exquisitely sensitive; when Yang Kai touched her, a shameful, uncontrollable pleasure and comfort rose deep within her.

Such feelings overwhelmed her with mortification; she shut her beautiful eyes and whimpered in tears.

Having gently dressed her, Yang Kai finally breathed hard, then collapsed to the ground with a thud.

Since he began cultivating, he had never suffered such severe injuries; if he had not, at the crucial moment, avoided vital spots, the Enchantress’s blow would very likely have ended his life.

This plan was extremely risky, but after Yun Xuan's explanation a flash of insight struck Yang Kai: lure the Enchantress in close, then strike back when the opportunity arose.

He had not expected the Enchantress to be so cautious, forcing him to grit his teeth and act out the whole charade.

The place where the two of them stood was still sealed by the means the Enchantress had used.

After the Enchantress died, the surrounding formation likewise weakened greatly, yet Yang Kai strangely found that Ruan Xinyu and Zhou Luo outside showed not the slightest movement.

He forced out a strand of True Yuan and blasted apart the formation that enveloped them; when Yang Kai saw the states of Ruan Xinyu and Zhou Luo clearly, he relaxed.

The Enchantress had likely been afraid they would try to flee while she was sucking the Essence-Blood, and by some means had rendered them unconscious.

“Rest for a while; they should wake up soon,” Yang Kai advised.

Yun Xuan still whimpered and cried, tears slipping down her cheeks, ignoring Yang Kai.

Seeing she was in pain, Yang Kai said no more.

In eerie silence, Yang Kai sat cross-legged and circulated his True Yuan to neutralize the medicinal effects of the Wan Yao Ling Milk.

Come to think of it, this was also his first time taking Wan Yao Ling Milk. Although he had long known this second-rank Spiritual Medicine was potent for healing, Yang Kai quickly discovered he had underestimated its might.

The pain in his belly soon vanished, replaced by a tingling numbness; the flesh there seemed to writhe and proliferate, filling in the wound.

Making use of the idle time, Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense into his Sea of Consciousness and absorbed the Divine Sense energy left behind by the Enchantress after her death.

Time passed slowly.

Half a day later, Ruan Xinyu and Zhou Luo successively regained consciousness from their stupor.

As if still not fully understanding the situation, when they woke they looked at each other with bewildered eyes.

After a moment of shock, they finally recalled what had happened before they blacked out.

Ruan Xinyu’s face changed dramatically; she checked her clothes with concentration, and when she found herself intact she breathed a sigh of relief.

Zhou Luo turned his head and almost had his eyes pop from their sockets.

Not far off lay the Enchantress who had so easily slain more than a dozen Duao Alliance disciples and a Transcendent Realm expert — she lay in a horrible state, her tempting body mangled, her head crushed and in pieces.

Yun Xuan sat to one side with her arms wrapped around her knees, looking desolate and helpless; her tears had stopped, but her eye sockets were bloodshot.

She stared fixedly at Yang Kai, who sat a short distance away in meditation, a complex look in her beautiful eyes.

“Yun Xuan, are you all right?” Zhou Luo hurried forward and asked solicitously.

Yun Xuan remained dazed and bereft, offering no reply.

“What happened? How did the Enchantress die? Could some passing expert have saved us?” Zhou Luo rattled off several questions, excited — he had thought they were doomed, so surviving naturally filled him with exhilaration.

“Don’t speak yet.” Ruan Xinyu’s brows knit; she suddenly realized Yun Xuan’s mental state was off and quickly came forward to crouch before her. Biting her thin lip, struggling in her brow, she at last asked softly, “Yun Xuan, can you tell me what happened?”

Yun Xuan still said nothing, only staring intently at Yang Kai.

That look darkened Zhou Luo’s expression; he glared coldly toward where Yang Kai sat.

“Ah — you’re hurt?” Ruan Xinyu finally noticed the wound on Yun Xuan’s belly; though coated with Wan Yao Ling Ye and bandaged, the crimson seepage was obvious.

“She’s hurt? Let me see!” Zhou Luo cried out and rushed forward to inspect the wound.

Ruan Xinyu turned and gave him a cold look; Zhou Luo laughed awkwardly and froze where he stood.

Ruan Xinyu placed a hand on Yun Xuan’s pulse to check, then said softly, “It’s nothing serious. Her breath is weak, but with some recuperation she should recover. Hm? What is that smell?”

Ruan Xinyu’s brow suddenly pinched; she detected an unusual scent from Yun Xuan, somewhat fishy, not like fresh blood.

Hearing that, Zhou Luo sniffed as well, and upon recognizing the familiar smell his face changed drastically.

Looking from Yun Xuan’s current state to Yang Kai’s bare chest and then to the Enchantress’s mangled corpse, Zhou Luo suddenly understood what had transpired while he was unconscious.

He was an old hand in matters of the heart and had bedded countless women; Ruan Xinyu, naive and inexperienced, did not grasp what the scent in the air signified, but he did.

His face twisted into a grimace and his True Yuan surged uncontrollably.

“What are you doing?” Ruan Xinyu asked, displeased, wondering why Zhou Luo had suddenly flared up.

Zhou Luo let out a grim laugh and fixed his gaze on Yun Xuan. In a low voice he said, “Yun Xuan, were you... defiled by that brat?”

At his words, the previously unresponsive Yun Xuan’s delicate body shuddered violently.

Sensing her odd reaction, Ruan Xinyu immediately covered her mouth; she thought it over and realized, before she lost consciousness, Yun Xuan and the youth named Yang Kai had been under the Enchantress’s control, and given the Enchantress’s nature and methods she would certainly have prompted something between them.

The relief of surviving the calamity had kept her from thinking of it at the time.

“Yun Xuan, this can’t be true, can it?” Ruan Xinyu’s face went pale; she asked softly. Although she and Yun Xuan did not always get along, she did in truth admire Yun Xuan to some degree, for Yun Xuan’s status was somewhat different from hers.

Yun Xuan’s tears fell again; she buried her head in her knees and wept bitterly.

“So it is...” Zhou Luo nearly went mad; he had long courted Yun Xuan but never won her favor, and now, out here in this remote place, her beautiful body had been cheapened by some blasted, out-of-nowhere brat.

A tremendous sense of humiliation welled up in him and his aura became dangerous.

He coldly glared at Yang Kai, who sat in meditation nearby, smiled grimly, and strode toward him step by step.

“Zhou Luo, what are you doing?” Ruan Xinyu cried out.

Zhou Luo sneered, “Doing? Haha — what else can I do? That brat has defiled Yun Xuan’s purity. What do you expect me to do? I want him dead!”

As he spoke, he closed the distance to Yang Kai with terrible speed, his expression fierce and terrifying.

“Stop!” Ruan Xinyu abandoned Yun Xuan and rushed forward, grabbing at Zhou Luo. “Don’t do this.”

“You’re still protecting him?” Zhou Luo taunted Ruan Xinyu. “What does that brat have to do with you that you’d shield him?”

“We haven’t even figured out what happened; killing him like this would be improper,” Ruan Xinyu protested.

“How much more proof do you need? Yun Xuan has already tacitly accepted it!” Zhou Luo roared.

“And what does that have to do with you?” Ruan Xinyu retorted coldly, looking at Zhou Luo with contempt. “Who do you think you are to Yun Xuan?”

“Get out of my way!” Zhou Luo flew into a rage, erupting with force and sweeping Ruan Xinyu aside. “I may not be anything to Yun Xuan, but I absolutely will not allow any other man to touch her. That brat must die, or else my resentment will not be quelled!”

With a roar, Zhou Luo was murderous; in a frenzy he unleashed a heavy punch toward the undefended Yang Kai’s face.

“No!” Yun Xuan cried out in terror from behind.

Hearing her voice only intensified Zhou Luo’s blind fury and cemented his resolve to kill Yang Kai.

He struck without mercy.

Ruan Xinyu, knocked aside to the ground, turned her head away, unable to watch.

Zhou Luo was a Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; to ambush an unsuspecting Seventh Stage Divine Roaming Realm opponent like this, the outcome was obvious — and besides, he himself seemed heavily injured.

Just as that heavy punch was about to smash into Yang Kai’s face, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes. One hand shot up and blocked the blow, grasping Zhou Luo’s fist.

Zhou Luo’s violent momentum, like a gale striking a mountain, was halted in an instant.

Yang Kai remained motionless and stared coldly at Zhou Luo, curling his lips into a smile. “Friend, what are you doing?”

Zhou Luo was clearly stunned; the strike he had painstakingly prepared had been so easily intercepted by a youth two Stages lower than him that he could hardly accept it.

His expression flickered; Zhou Luo found himself unable to read this young man anymore.
