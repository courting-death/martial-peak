## Chapter 1996 — Dragon Ascension Altar

Atop the ancient and desolate altar lay fully a dozen or so unknown items, each shrouded beneath a murky veil of light as if a bowl had been inverted over them; through that dim curtain the forms were not entirely clear, yet one could still make out certain outlines.

The objects within that light screen were astonishingly varied, encompassing all manner of things.

There were hammer-shaped, sword-shaped, and dagger-like Secret Treasures, yellowed canon pages of cultivation techniques, and several jade bottles that looked very aged. Each item appeared extraordinary, and those Secret Treasures emitted immensely powerful energy fluctuations—the weakest at least being Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures.

This made Yang Kai look feverish with desire.

He was not the only one; the other martial artists who had rushed here gazed greedily at the altar, each one filled with covetous longing.

"Are these the items those great powers deposited here? Maybe the Dao Origin Fruit is here!" a nearby cultivator blurted.

"Not so!" someone replied. "I arrived earlier and heard this altar suddenly surfaced from the earth—it wasn't originally here. It seems some friend triggered the local restriction to reveal the altar, and everything on it gives off an ancient aura; they are certainly not items deposited by those great powers."

"So then, these things were already here long ago? Treasures left from the ancient times?"

"Perhaps so!"

"Then what are we waiting for? Grab them!"

Treasures left from antiquity were preserved so well—their value was hard to estimate and far exceeded those deposited by the great powers. Once word spread, the assembled martial artists' blood boiled with excitement.

Many who had intended to observe a while longer could no longer restrain themselves; they mustered courage and surged forward, and their motion immediately set everyone's nerves on edge—more and more cultivators began to move.

Even Yang Kai began to step forward, though he did not rush to the front; he stayed toward the middle. That way he had ample time to observe the movements of those ahead and avoid falling into any trap.

"Everyone, slow down!" At that moment a loud, resonant shout rang out, and a young man in white, graceful and confident of bearing, leapt up into the high air.

The youth was fair-lipped and white-toothed, handsome in appearance, with bright eyes and an imposing manner—clearly of noble lineage.

"Please remain calm and hear me out," the youth called again.

Many martial artists frowned and looked up impatiently; after all, the treasures were in plain sight, and someone suddenly preventing their advance was infuriating—blocking a man's money was akin to slaying his parents, such hatred could not be forgiven...

But when the crowd saw the youth's face, many obediently halted, and others looked surprised.

"So it's Young Master Jiang Chuhe!" someone in the crowd recognized him and cupped a fist. "What does Young Master Jiang mean by this? Could it be he wants to rely on the Jiang Family's influence to monopolize the altar's treasures? If so, please spare us the lecture, Young Master Jiang."

"Indeed—those with affinity should take the treasures. The Jiang Family is notable in Fenglin City, but this is the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; if Young Master Jiang wishes to monopolize them, perhaps you should weigh that carefully," another voice chimed in.

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood the youth's identity.

A member of the Jiang Family from Fenglin City!

Within Fenglin City, under the citylord's manor, there were several families; the Jiang Family was respectable and had an elder at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Yang Kai had not had dealings with the Jiang Family, but he had seen the corpses of several Jiang Family cultivators slain by Luanfeng at Yuqing Mountain.

Almost everyone who had entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda this time hailed from Fenglin City, so many recognized Jiang Chuhe; even those who did not know him by sight had at least heard his name.

Yet, as that man had said, within the bounds of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda the Jiang Family's presence carried little weight.

More importantly, the treasures were right before them.

People die for wealth and birds die for food—timeless truth. Even if the Jiang Family's elder personally came, these hundreds of Void King Realm cultivators would not necessarily be cowed.

Jiang Chuhe was unperturbed; he smiled and said, "Friend, you exaggerate. With several hundred peers gathered here, even if I had the greatest courage, I would not dare offend everyone's wrath. I have never intended to monopolize the treasures."

"Then what does Young Master Jiang intend to do?"

Jiang Chuhe continued smiling, "I merely wish to tell everyone that where there is profit there is risk; moreover, this is the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda! Do you truly believe the altar's items are so easily obtained? If they were, they would long since be gone—why would they wait for people like us to come collect them?"

"We know that, but... if we hesitate because of risk then what is the point of cultivation? We've already steeled ourselves!" the man who had spoken earlier snorted.

"Brave words!" Jiang Chuhe smiled toward him, then shifted tone, "However... perhaps this friend should first inquire what exactly this altar is—know thyself and know thy enemy, and one will never be defeated."

"This is my first time in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; how would I know what this altar is?" the man waved his head, then looked at Jiang Chuhe in surprise, "Do you know, Young Master Jiang? If so, please enlighten us."

Jiang Chuhe shook his head, "I do not know either, but I think... someone here should know."

As he spoke he turned his gaze toward a certain part of the crowd with a smile and called, "Miss Qin, what do you say?"

The crowd followed his glance and immediately saw a woman surrounded like a moon among stars by several cultivators; she looked to be about twenty-five or twenty-six, petite and delicate, but she seemed ill—her complexion waxen, frame thin, and her lips a little pale.

Were it not for those signs, and if she were more buxom, she would be an unparalleled beauty; even so, she swayed like a flower in storm and aroused pity.

Seeing Jiang Chuhe shift everyone's attention to her, Miss Qin knit her brows with a trace of annoyance, and the cultivators around her glared angrily at Jiang Chuhe, greatly displeased.

"Miss Qin? Miss Qin Yu of the Qin family?" came an exclamation from the crowd—apparently Qin Yu was quite renowned.

"I've heard Miss Qin Yu has read widely since childhood and is well-learned, especially about secret realms; may I ask how much you know of this altar? Please share—my peers and I would be grateful," Jiang Chuhe said with a dignified smile, seeming unconcerned by Qin Yu's annoyance and the glare of her guards.

Yang Kai's face shifted as he suddenly understood Jiang Chuhe's motive for showing off now.

This fellow was obviously trying to glean information about the altar.

Had he approached Qin Yu alone she might have refused, but by doing this in front of everyone Qin Yu was put in an awkward position; even if she wished not to speak, she would be compelled to answer.

No one wanted to incur the crowd's wrath.

Jiang Chuhe had some cunning, though his method was a bit despicable.

Many, like Yang Kai, were aware of his intention, but because their own interests were involved they did not expose it; instead they eagerly looked to Qin Yu.

"Miss Qin, with so many peers present, if you know anything of this altar please tell us—are there any concealed dangers? We would be most grateful!"

Under countless gazes Qin Yu seemed uneasy; perhaps the wind and noise unnerved her and she coughed lightly, covering her mouth with a handkerchief.

"My lady has been ill since childhood and should not speak much; please forgive her," a guard beside Qin Yu, a man in his forties at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, said coldly as he cupped his fist from afar.

Qin Yu gestured slightly and whispered, "It matters not. Since Young Master Jiang and friends wish to know... I shall say something."

Whatever illness she had left her listless; her speech was weak and heart-wrenching to hear.

Yet at the news that she would tell them about the altar the crowd trembled and watched her expectantly.

"Miss Qin indeed has heard of this altar—my respect," Jiang Chuhe brightened; his earlier maneuver had been a tentative attempt, and it had hit the mark.

On one hand he hoped Qin Yu would speak in detail to enlighten him; on the other he feared others might gain the information and compete with him, leaving him conflicted.

"This is the Dragon Ascension Altar..." Qin Yu said slowly; the first floor of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda fell silent aside from her weak voice on the wind, "it embodies the meaning of the fish leaping the Dragon Gate and transforming into a dragon!"

"The Dragon Ascension Altar's appearances are irregular, and its locations are fickle—it may appear on the first floor, the second floor, or the fifth... rumor has it it existed since ancient times, so even those from the Star God Palace find it difficult to see the altar when they enter here."

"In the Star God Palace's records the Dragon Ascension Altar is said to have appeared only eight times... each time it's accompanied by the manifestation of rare treasures; if any of us could obtain one, perhaps we could leap the Dragon Gate and ascend—reaching the Emperor Realm might not be impossible."

"Fish leaping the Dragon Gate!"

"Emperor Realm!"

Many cultivators murmured, their eyes shining.

The martial artists of Fenglin City were largely from the lowest rungs; though not without some strength, they lacked background and patrons, so advancing beyond the Void King Realm was near impossible.

Qin Yu's words, however, filled them with hope as if a broad and noble path to the Emperor's throne had opened before them.
