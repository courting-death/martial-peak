## Chapter 1080 — You Are Truly Heartless

In Zong Ao's room, Yang Kai poured wine for the old man, his demeanor deferential and respectful.

The old fellow was calm and at ease, enjoying himself as if he had every right to, without an ounce of embarrassment.

The cup brimmed with wine. Zong Ao raised it, took a sip, curled his lips, and set it down. "If there's anything, speak up. Just don't keep coveting this old man's treasures."

Yang Kai smiled. "I don't mean that, Senior Zong. You're worrying too much. I'm only here to take my leave. I'm truly grateful for your care these past days."

Whether Zong Ao had truly been a good man or had once harbored murderous intent, Yang Kai had indeed received a great deal of care from him these past days. Had it not been for his guidance, Yang Kai would never have known how to save Xue Yue or how to awaken her dormant Spirit Body.

Even though Zong Ao himself benefited greatly, he was an elder, and it was only proper for Yang Kai to show respect.

"Taking your leave?" Zong Ao exclaimed in surprise. "You're leaving?"

"Yes, I'm leaving in two days," Yang Kai nodded.

Zong Ao's expression turned odd. "You're afraid the Third Young Master Xue Yue will come looking for you, aren't you? You ought to leave. If people from Shuiyue Star show up, staying will be a death sentence."

He still believed Yang Kai was recklessly bold enough to lay a hand on Xue Yue's woman.

Yang Kai didn't bother to explain and let him maintain that assumption.

"Kid, have you thought about staying by this old man's side?" Zong Ao suddenly suggested. "She's only a woman. Since Xue Yue is Chairman Ai Ou's offspring, she likely knows how to keep things proper. If you stay with me, I'll talk to that youth — I can probably turn a major problem into a small one, and a small one into nothing. Otherwise, how can a martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm escape the Hengluo Commerce Guild's pursuit? The Star Domain is vast, but there might not be a place for you to hide."

Why did everyone want to keep him? Yang Kai felt annoyed inwardly but showed no change on his face. He knew Senior Zong had taken an interest in his alchemical aptitude. He shook his head. "I appreciate your kindness, Senior Zong, but this junior is determined to go."

Zong Ao nodded faintly. "Very well, I won't force you then. Hmm, take these and have a look. I see you have a talent for alchemy, but you haven't received systematic training. You're not fully familiar with the properties of high-grade ingredients and Pills; these should help you."

As he spoke, he took many heavy tomes from his Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened. He didn't stand on ceremony and took the books, stuffing them into his own ring.

Yang Kai knew these tomes well — they were part of Zong Ao's palace collection. Some were penned by Zong Ao himself, others collected from outside. All explained the properties, grades, and growth environments of various ingredients across the Star Domain.

If he absorbed all of it, Yang Kai's alchemy could align with the Star Domain's standards; he'd no longer encounter unknown ingredients.

He regretted not having read more last time and feared he might not get such a chance again, so he hadn't expected Zong Ao to offer them willingly.

Yang Kai was deeply grateful.

"Tell me, kid, where did you learn all your alchemy? Your spirit formations are somewhat different from those in the Star Domain. Though they share a root, there are subtle differences," Zong Ao probed, curious about Yang Kai's background.

"Senior Zong, I come from a low-grade continent where the strongest martial artists reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm — the level I'm at now. The highest-ranked alchemists there top out at Saint-Grade Upper-Level. Spiritual Herbs, Spiritual Medicines, and Secret Treasure materials top out at that grade, so I don't know much about materials above the Saint-Grade..." Yang Kai no longer hid the truth, chatting with Zong Ao over wine.

Zong Ao grew increasingly astonished and felt Yang Kai was extraordinary.

For someone from a low-grade continent to comprehend alchemy so deeply — to devise an ingenious solution to a problem that had baffled him for a century — and now have a one-in-ten chance of producing Pill Patterns in his pills, that was staggering.

If Yang Kai had been born on one of the Star Domain's finest cultivation stars, what heights might he have reached? The conversation between the two grew more lively.

After another round of drinking, Yang Kai took his leave. Zong Ao didn't try to stop him; he only said that the method for generating Pill Patterns wouldn't be leaked without Yang Kai's permission, so he could rest assured.

Yang Kai waved his hand and said nothing further.

Alchemists, smiths, and martial artists alike treasured their secrets. They didn't expose their foundations; precious Martial Skills and knowledge were treated as restricted lore, taught only to their heirs. Outsiders had no place to pry. If such a breach occurred, it would be a life-and-death matter.

Zong Ao had learned Yang Kai's method for generating Pill Patterns and was already satisfied; he naturally wouldn't spread it.

For two days things were calm. Zong Ao had moved back to his valley to replant his thousand-acre medicinal field. The old fellow's cultivation wasn't low, and he had many years ahead — plenty of time to bring the field's herbs to maturity.

Xue Yue and Yang Kai both stayed shut in their rooms those two days.

Halika and Lin Mufeng also seemed to sense the tense atmosphere and went about their tasks cautiously, waiting for people from the main star to come handle matters.

Two days later Yang Kai went to Xue Yue's room and entered without knocking.

A chill seemed to hang in the room. Xue Yue sat by the table, her expression indifferent. When Yang Kai approached she only lifted her eyelids to glance at him.

Yang Kai distinctly felt a boiling anger suppressed in her chest, and her demeanor had shifted from a few days prior — a cold, sharp aura curled around her delicate body.

Yang Kai steeled himself and sat down before her.

"Have a drink first," Xue Yue poured a cup herself and set it before him.

"It isn't poisoned, is it?" Yang Kai eyed her distrustfully.

"What good would killing you do me?" Xue Yue stared back coldly.

Yang Kai looked at the clear wine and shook his head. "Forget it. Let's get to the point. I won't drink it."

He was certain there was a trick. From what he knew of Xue Yue, she wouldn't easily let go. Yang Kai prepared to tear off the mask and make a scene if necessary.

Seeing his vigilance, Xue Yue sneered, drained her cup in one gulp, and slammed the cup onto the table in front of Yang Kai, the sound like a challenge.

"Have you decided?"

"What about you?" Xue Yue answered with a counter question instead of responding.

"Don't play word games with me — it's pointless. I gave you my answer three days ago."

"Is there truly no room to change your mind?" Xue Yue persisted, unwilling to give up.

"None." Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Xue Yue ground her teeth and cried in a strained voice, "Fine, you're right — forced fruit isn't sweet. We're bound by the Soul Chain; if I force you to stay and one day you kill yourself, I'd have to die with you. It's not worth it. If you insist on leaving, then let's break the Soul Chain. From now on no one will care for the other."

"I'm glad you've thought it through," Yang Kai said happily.

"Don't be happy." Xue Yue rose slowly, took a few steps, and lightly parted her lips. "Perhaps my stubbornness has something to do with the Soul Chain, but you're right: a large part of it is my womanly heart. Ever since I was three, only in front of you could I truly be myself. These past days were happy. Senior Zong told me you nearly lost half your life to awaken me. I don't know what happened then, but Senior Zong wouldn't lie. I have to thank you — no one has ever tried so hard for me. For the first time I felt cared for as a woman."

Yang Kai's brows tightened; he grew silently more cautious.

The more Xue Yue poured out her heart, the more Yang Kai felt danger gathering. People like her, when showing their true feelings and receiving no reply, could be terrifyingly volatile.

"Once we break the Soul Chain and the tie is gone, I don't know what I'll do. I very well might hunt you down and finish you off!" Xue Yue stood behind Yang Kai, both hands on his shoulders, leaning down to whisper breath like orchid-scented blades.

"I've prepared myself. Don't worry — I'll run far away, so you'll never find me," Yang Kai nodded.

"You're too weak. If I truly wanted to find you, it wouldn't matter where you hide!" Xue Yue's breath was cold at his ear, yet there was an odd warmth in it as she softened, "Is even a woman like me powerless to keep you?"

Yang Kai said nothing. Oddly, a pang of soreness rose in his chest.

"You're truly heartless!" Xue Yue bit her lip and hissed.

The next moment Yang Kai felt a pain at his neck — a warm trickle flowed from there, two drops of hot fluid seeping deep into his collar.

He nearly said something comforting.

After a long while Xue Yue released him. Her mouth dripped golden blood; she swallowed it and ground her teeth, "Drinking your blood today is a parting return for all the disrespect you've shown me. If I see you again, I'll flay you and eat your flesh. Don't doubt me — I mean it. Go. Never appear before me again, for I don't know what I'll do."

She turned her back to Yang Kai; her fragrant shoulders trembled as her voice quivered.

Yang Kai sighed softly, rose, opened his mouth, and found himself at a loss for words.

As he walked away, Xue Yue's beautiful eyes brimmed with tears that streamed down.

She knew she would never again live as freely as before. From this day on she would revert to being Third Young Master Xue Yue.

The Star Shuttle pierced space like a needle, streaking rapidly through the Starry Sky.

An hour later, Yang Kai halted and stood in the void, looking down at the resplendent Rainfall Star.

In his Sea of Consciousness a constraint seemed to have been unlocked, giving Yang Kai a fleeting illusion of freedom. In the haze, a questioning voice sounded at his ear.

Yang Kai answered it affirmatively.

With a thunderous crack, the invisible fetter within his Sea of Consciousness shattered. All the sorrow and the reluctance toward Xue Yue dissipated in an instant, and Yang Kai felt his spirits lighten.
