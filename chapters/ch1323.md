## Chapter 1323 — Complete Suppression

In a single careless moment half of his arm simply disappeared; the old man surnamed Wang was filled with terror and stumbled back several steps. Once steady he looked at Yang Kai with a face of utter disbelief. He, an expert of the Origin Returning Realm, had been fighting against warriors of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet had been injured so grievously—if he told anyone, no one would believe it.

Saint Yuan condensed to the severed limb to stop the bleeding, and the old man Wang snatched a pill from his spatial ring and shoved it into his mouth. His gaze toward Yang Kai had grown wary—if this man had means to wound his arm, then he had the power to kill him.

Only now did he have time to inspect the abnormalities in his Sea of Consciousness. Had there not been something amiss within it earlier, he would not have been so easily taken in; he should have been able to perceive the strangeness of that attack. He wanted to know what had gone wrong with his Sea of Consciousness.

When he investigated, the old man Wang’s face went ashen and he barked, "Soul-Devouring insects? How is this possible!"

Under his scrutiny he discovered that countless tiny creatures—so small they were invisible to the naked eye—had somehow crawled into his Sea of Consciousness. Those little worms were subtle and silent, lying dormant within his Sea of Consciousness as if waiting for some command to spring forth and strike.

The earlier disturbance in his Sea of Consciousness had obviously been caused by those Soul-Devouring insects devouring his Divine Sense!

Those Saint King Realm warriors had failed to withstand Yang Kai’s blow likely for the same reason; otherwise how could they have been unable to evade the slicing of golden threads? Realizing this, a cold sweat broke out over the old man Wang. He had heard of the infamous Soul-Devouring insects before. Ordinarily, despite their fearsome reputation, they wouldn’t trouble him—at his strength as an Origin Returning Realm expert he could easily expel them.

But these Soul-Devouring insects were clearly no ordinary breed; they had evolved. The old man tried to drive them out with his Divine Sense, but they would not budge. They remained tightly hidden in the depths of his Sea of Consciousness, becoming a latent threat. To completely purge them would not be possible without a day or two of sitting meditation and recuperation.

With that thought, retreat immediately sprang into the old man Wang’s mind and his expression flickered.

His Shi and the Soul-Burying Bell were countered by the other party; now grievously wounded and with Soul-Devouring insects waiting in his Sea of Consciousness, staying would likely mean death. He feared the attack that had devoured half his arm more than anything.

"So you actually recognize Soul-Devouring insects. Old bastard, you’ve got some insight! But consider yourself unlucky. Your Shi does nothing to me—I’m your nemesis!" Yang Kai mocked with a loud laugh. As he waved his hands, blade after blade of space was cleaved forth. Each Space Blade was ink-black, tearing the void as it surged forward; any Divine Sense probing them would find nothing inside but a void and chaos—there was no substance within.

In an instant a dozen or so black Space Blades hurled madly toward the old man Wang, hissing loudly.

The old man Wang’s eye twitched and his complexion darkened to the extreme as he shouted, "Brat, don’t be too arrogant!"

At the same time his body suddenly swelled, a mass of black qi billowing out to cover a radius of over ten zhang. He employed some profound art to try and conceal his form.

But as the dozen Space Blades sliced through the black mist, clear channels were instantly carved through it. Before the old man Wang could finish his sentence he wailed and hurriedly dodged the Space Blades that closed in.

"Come on, use every trick you’ve got — I’ll kill you and teach you a lesson!" Yang Kai sneered coldly, his voice filled with cruel amusement as he baited his opponent’s temper. His hands never ceased; the Space Blades raged like torrents of water.

The old man Wang nearly coughed up blood in fury—those were exactly the words he had used a moment ago to Yang Kai, yet now the situation had turned so sharply that his words were returned to him verbatim.

It felt as though he had been slapped hard across the face—Elder Wang’s old cheeks burned hot with shame, his heart filled with unwillingness he couldn’t voice. Under the relentless assault of those Space Blades, he no longer had the mood to even speak, forced only to duck and dodge in silence. If, when half his arm was first devoured, he still hadn’t realized what kind of power this was, then now he had an idea.

The fluctuations of spatial force radiating from the Space Blades were unmistakably clear—he was no fool and could not fail to perceive it.

The old man Wang was astonished beyond measure. He had never imagined that on Dark Star anyone could refine spatial force into blades in such a way, and could strike from great distance.

Even that Elder Mo of the Battle Sky Alliance could not accomplish such a feat! Rumor had it that Elder Mo was also adept with spatial force—many sects called on him to repair damaged or malfunctioning space arrays—but compared to this arrogant youth, Elder Mo’s use of spatial force was on a completely different level.

Not only did the other party control Soul-Devouring insects, he was also proficient in this sinister power! The old man Wang no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai and at once elevated him to be an equal opponent.

The Space Blades seemed endless, savage and invincible, devouring every obstacle in their path with unstoppable force, leaving the old man Wang only able to dodge in disarray.

“Old bastard, is dodging all you can do?” Yang Kai barked harshly. After slashing out several more Space Blades, a faint image of a lotus bud appeared within his eyes. He let out a low shout: “Bloom, Lotus!”

While relying on the terrain to evade the Space Blades, the old man Wang’s movements suddenly froze. Even without meeting Yang Kai’s gaze he felt the lotus image appear in his mind; in an instant the whole world seemed to vanish, replaced only by that bud radiating seven-colored, faint light.

The next moment he felt the power of his Sea of Consciousness frantically converging toward a single point, no longer under his control—and the source of that convergence was precisely the strangely appearing lotus bud.

As the power of his Sea of Consciousness poured in, the lotus bud actually began to open rapidly.

Although he did not know the profundity of the Blooming Lotus technique, the old man Wang knew he absolutely could not allow it to fully bloom; otherwise the consequences would be catastrophic.

He cried out and bit off the tip of his tongue, forcing his attention away from the flower bud. His Sea of Consciousness churned violently.

Boom……

A thunderous boom resounded—an impact that shook the very depths of his soul. Elder Wang’s face turned deathly pale as he spat out a mouthful of blood mist, his body staggering violently. His complexion seemed to age by decades in an instant.

He had used some secret art to rupture that lotus bud, but his spirit had been grievously wounded in the process.

Qian Yue stood aside, staring dumbfounded. Her eyes shone with wonder and her expression was filled with both shock and joy.

When she first realized they had been ambushed, Qian Yue thought they were doomed. Yet she never expected these enemies—so powerful and seemingly invincible—would be so easily shattered and slain by Yang Kai; even Steward Wang of the Origin Returning Realm was no match for Yang Kai.

If Qian Yue had not known Steward Wang personally, she might have assumed him merely a Saint King Realm warrior. But she knew he was a genuine Origin Returning Realm expert—when she met him before she was always cautious and careful in his presence. Now Steward Wang was panic-stricken and like a dog driven from its den, with none of the bearing of an elder master.

For a moment Qian Yue’s feelings were complicated; she stared at Yang Kai in a daze and thought that Su Yan’s judgment had been sound. When she first met Yang Kai she had even looked down on him—how could she have known Su Yan’s far-sightedness?

In that instant she relaxed and then glanced at Yang Yan, noticing the latter’s calm, unperturbed expression. She realized Yang Yan had full confidence in Yang Kai too; it had only been her own needless worry.

“An Origin Returning Realm—so this is all it amounts to?” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “Honestly, I’ve never had the slightest interest in Shen Shitao, nor did I intend to get in Wang Yuhan’s way. It’s just that your precious grandson was too petty and brought death upon himself—and dragged you, his elder, down with him. If I were you, I’d bash my own head in and be done with it. Why keep clinging to life in disgrace?”

Hearing Yang Kai’s mockery and ridicule, the Wang Elder was not only furious but filled with bitter regret. If things truly were as that brat said, then what had he come here for? Just to be humiliated—and to court death himself?

At that moment the old man Wang wished he could drag Wang Yuhan up from the underworld and kill him a dozen times over. His face was hideous with rage, but he had not the energy to act on it.

He knew that even at his peak he could not handle Yang Kai; if he did not retreat now, he might never leave.

A murderous glint flashed in his eyes as the old man Wang suddenly pointed. A beam of arcane light shot out and struck the flag that had been opposing the Hundred Mountains Painting; the flag rolled and unstable energies poured from within. With a great boom it exploded, spewing countless malformed phantoms that flew uncontrollably in all directions.

This secret treasure even had a self-destruct function!

Yang Kai’s expression turned grave. He hastily re-sheathed the Hundred Mountains Painting and once again manifested the Purple Shield to guard Qian Yue and Yang Yan, protecting the two women from being affected.

After handling that, he looked up and discovered the old man Wang already a hundred zhang away.

He had escaped just like that!

Yang Kai snorted coldly and unfurled his Wind-and-Thunder Wings. Amid the thunder of wind and lightning, his figure faded from sight.

So far he had never killed an Origin Returning Realm practitioner; an opportunity like this was rare and he would not miss it. Besides, from the techniques the old man had employed and his understanding of Shi it was clear he had some understanding already—if Yang Kai killed him and absorbed his spirit energy and insight into the Martial Dao, he might glean something of Shi and prepare himself toward the Origin Returning Realm.

Although the old man Wang’s cultivation was somewhat higher than Yang Kai’s, he was wounded, while Yang Kai had the aid of the Wind-and-Thunder Wings and thus superior speed.
