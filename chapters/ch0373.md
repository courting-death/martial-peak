## Chapter 373 — Lü Liang's Inquiry

Not long after departing, a group of people approached swiftly from ahead, with Lü Liang, the head of the Lü Family, leading the way.

Dressed in a long, green robe, Lü Liang's tall figure was complemented by a pair of finely trimmed mustaches above his lips, lending him an air of elegance and erudition. However, his long, narrow eyes sparkled with a constant hint of intelligence.

The first impression he gave was one of shrewdness, and the second impression was no different.

He strode forward with quick steps, his face filled with excitement, beaming with joy as he approached Qiu Yimeng, bowing respectfully, “Miss Qiu, your visit shines a light upon the Lü Family!”

Although he was the head of a prominent family, the Lü Family had been raised by the Qiu Family, and Qiu Yimeng held a significant status within the Qiu Family. Therefore, Lü Liang was cautious not to appear negligent in front of her.

Moreover, it was always he, Lü Liang, who paid visits to the Qiu Family, while today marked the first time that a direct descendant from the Qiu Family had come to the Lü residence. Lü Liang was both thrilled and surprised, treating her with utmost courtesy.

Qiu Yimeng smiled graciously, “Uncle Lü, you flatter me. I passed by here and thought to take a moment’s rest. I hope I am not troubling you.”

Lü Liang quickly waved his hand, “How could that be? It is an honor for my Lü Family to have you here, Miss Qiu. We will certainly welcome you wholeheartedly; please, there is no need for such talk of troubling us.”

Qiu Yimeng's use of the term "Uncle" further delighted Lü Liang, who silently praised his years of effort spent cultivating ties with the Qiu Family. Finally, he thought, they had solidified their relationship.

With just a few pleasantries exchanged, their rapport deepened considerably. The high-ranking members of the Lü Family standing behind Lü Liang were all smiling as they stepped forward to greet her.

After some banter, Lü Liang's expression turned serious. He cast a cautious glance at the two Blood Servants and then looked at Yang Kai, asking earnestly, “Miss, and this young gentleman is…?"

Lü Liang possessed keen insight and could readily discern Yang Kai's notable status, or else he wouldn’t have two Divine Roaming Realm experts following him.

Qiu Yimeng smiled subtly without answering, instead, she pointed upwards at the sky.

At that moment, a hawk's cry echoed, and as the people of the Lü Family raised their heads to look, Lü Liang immediately realized Yang Kai's identity.

His expression grew serious as he said, “So it is Young Master Yang!”

“Head Lü!” Yang Kai responded calmly, cupping his hands in greeting.

The other high-ranking members of the Lü Family gasped in astonishment, eyeing Yang Kai with curiosity.

The Yang Family had been actively rallying its scattered direct descendants, and the call of the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle resounded throughout the empire. The prominent Blood Servants repeatedly made their appearances. How could the Lü Family not be aware of this significant event?

Yet who would have thought they would encounter a young master of the Yang Family today!

Upon closer inspection, they realized this young man appeared steady and resolute, his demeanor calm, exuding an aura befitting a young master from a great clan. They couldn’t help but feel trepidation, knowing the Yang Family did not send out weaklings.

Lü Liang laughed heartily again, gesturing for them to enter, “Young Master Yang, please, come inside!”

As he welcomed them, he instructed those behind him, “Go prepare the finest food and drinks. It is an honor for my Lü Family to host these two esteemed guests, and we must not neglect them.”

“Understood!”

Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly, taking Luo Xiaoman by the hand as they stepped inside, with Yang Kai trailing leisurely behind.

Inside the grand hall of the Lü Family, a splendid array of delicacies adorned the tables, with a myriad of exotic fruits. Jugs of fine wine were continually presented by beautiful maidens.

The atmosphere was vibrant; glasses clinked as everyone was caught up in the lively gathering.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, being women, naturally refrained from drinking alcohol. Lü Liang was clearly considerate of this and had prepared the Lü Family’s specialty fruit wine for them, fragrant and pleasant, ensuring they wouldn’t get drunk.

The two women drank happily.

Though Yang Kai was a man, no one dared to fill his glass heavily. Whenever the high-ranking members of the Lü Family raised their cups in toast, they all drained their own cups in deference, allowing Yang Kai the freedom to drink as he pleased.

Tang Yuxian was treated the same way as Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, her cup filled with fruit wine.

Only Tu Feng drank with extravagant abandon.

As a Blood Servant of the Yang Family, he held considerable status in front of the Lü Family.

The high-ranking members of the Lü Family were filled with excitement, frequently toasting to Tu Feng.

Tu Feng remained immovable, draining his cup whenever someone approached to toast, his hearty demeanor adding to the liveliness of the gathering.

The Lü Family were local strongmen within a thousand miles, but before the Blood Servants of the Yang Family, they appeared inferior, their manner and demeanor notably humble.

In the past, they had only heard the resounding names of the Blood Servants and had never encountered them in person. With two appearing now, they certainly weren’t inclined to let the opportunity slip.

Lü Liang’s social strategies were no mere bluster, his eloquence was exceptional. In conversation, he lavished praise and flattery without leaving a hint of insincerity, making the guests feel at ease.

As the drinks circulated, many were surprised to find that the young master they hosted seemed unpretentious, starkly different from the rumored arrogant persona. He treated people and things with remarkable affability, causing the Lü Family members to be taken aback.

Were it not for Qiu Yimeng stating that Yang Kai belonged to the Yang Family, and without the two Blood Servants' undeniable identities, Lü Liang might have hesitated to believe this man was genuinely from the Yang Family.

“Uncle, having traveled so far, Xiaoman and I will take our leave for a rest. You all enjoy yourselves!” After some time, feeling a bit bored, Qiu Yimeng stood to say.

“Someone!” Lü Liang quickly called out, and immediately, two beautiful maidens entered gracefully, “Please lead these young ladies to their quarters for a rest!”

“Understood!”

After the two maidens escorted Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman away, the banquet continued.

Suddenly, a high-ranking member of the Lü Family chuckled with deep meaning, “Head Lü, merely drinking like this feels rather dull. Why not invite someone to lighten the mood?”

Lü Liang nodded slightly, “You are right; I was careless.”

As he spoke, he clapped his hands.

Immediately, a group of young women in delicate attire entered, dancing lightly.

It was obvious they had been prepared outside for some time, waiting only for Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman to leave before making their entrance.

Each of these women was charmingly beautiful, draped in sheer fabrics, with flat stomachs, exquisite belly buttons, snow-white arms, and long legs displayed in the open air.

With drums and melodies ringing, the graceful young women first bowed to all present before beginning their dance, smiling as they moved, enchanting the audience with their elegance.

Their enchanting figures unfurled captivating sights as they gracefully twirled, showcasing alluring glimpses that were tantalizing.

These women continually threw flirtatious glances towards Yang Kai and the others, appearing quite eager to please, displaying a mixture of shyness and youthful allure.

Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but snort softly.

Though she did not enjoy witnessing such displays, she understood Lü Liang’s intentions and quietly kept abreast, discreetly gauging Yang Kai's reaction.

Tu Feng unabashedly observed, his scarred face appearing more menacing.

In contrast, Yang Kai maintained a calm demeanor. Though he looked upon the dancers with a discerning eye, appreciating the spectacle, he showed no visible signs of excitement. Even when they danced provocatively before him, he remained utterly composed.

Seeing this, everyone present couldn’t help but be secretly astonished.

It was natural for a young man, especially a young one, to enjoy female company. Among the high-ranking members of the Lü Family present, none were without their own youthful bravado. At Yang Kai’s age, they had yearned to charm countless beautiful women, savoring the blossoming pleasures.

Only with age and maturity did their aspirations shift towards loftier ideals.

Lü Liang intended to use this opportunity to probe Yang Kai’s interests, curious if the young man indeed had an affinity for women.

However, he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to remain completely unfazed in the face of such blatant temptation, displaying a countenance of tranquility, showing no sign of yielding to carnal desires.

This Young Master Yang was somewhat… extraordinary!

To maintain one’s composure in the face of allure — such willpower in a young man was undeniably remarkable. With willpower like that, great things could be achieved.

In an instant, Lü Liang mentally noted that this was an impressive quality and nodded to himself.

Tang Yuxian also had gleaming eyes, her surprise palpable.

Living long in Zhongdu, she was well-acquainted with the debauchery of young masters. Not only did they show strong interest in young maidens, but even someone like her became a target for their attention, often leaving Tang Yuxian exasperated.

Yang Kai’s current demeanor undoubtedly eased Tang Yuxian’s spirits.

Unbeknownst to her, while these maidens were undoubtedly beautiful, Yang Kai had witnessed beauties beyond compare — Xia Ningshang, Shan Qingluo, the sisters from the Hu Family, each one an exceptional beauty, capable of causing cities to fall.

And after enduring the influences of the Dual Cultivation Technique for years, he had long since become immune to the allure of appearance.

Across the world, unless Shan Qingluo herself attempted to tempt Yang Kai, he surely would not become emotionally stirred against his will.

These youthful dancers, in his eyes, were merely a trifle.

Before long, as the dance concluded, Lü Liang waved his hand with a smile, and the young women respectfully withdrew.

As they departed, they glanced back at Yang Kai with lingering gazes, seemingly recognizing the young man's esteemed status. If they could win his favor, they might rise above petty roles at the Lü Family and become something more.

Lü Liang laughed heartily, “These girls hail from nearby impoverished families. My Lü Family has taken them in and nurtured them. They are all flawless and pristine, and only on rare occasions when esteemed guests arrive do we let them perform. Young Master Yang, would you be interested in taking one or two as company? With beauties by your side, you could find joy amidst the power struggles.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, slowly shaking his head.

Lü Liang's narrowed eyes sparkled momentarily. It was clear then that Yang Kai truly lacked interest in the women.

If he had any desire, Yang Kai would only need to nod lightly, and Lü Liang would undoubtedly arrange everything promptly.

Another high-ranking member of the Lü Family, Lü Changmu, seized the moment to interject, “Speaking of the struggle for power, I am reminded of events nearly twenty years ago. That power struggle was exceptionally fierce.”

“Indeed,” another person chimed in, “countless noble families fell from grace, their legacies extinguished. It’s unfortunate that our Lü Family lacked the strength to participate at that time; it remains a regret.”
