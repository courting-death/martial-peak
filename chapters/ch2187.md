## Chapter 2187 — Proposal

Although Xia Sheng's words were quiet, everyone present had sharp ears and keen senses, so they all heard him clearly. In an instant, they all glared angrily at Yang Kai, thinking him despicable and shameless for scheming like this!

"I'm not pretending!" Yang Kai replied with a confident smile, saying proudly, "I am a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist!"

As soon as he said this, no one responded. They all looked at Yang Kai with strange expressions. A gentle breeze blew across the mountaintop, and silence fell.

"Hahaha..." After a long while, a burst of laughter finally rang out. Xiao Chen pointed at Yang Kai with disdain and said, "You? You’re a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist? Do you think alchemists are something you can just grab off the street? Kid, you'd best think carefully before you speak—disaster comes from the mouth!"

In the end, he no longer concealed the contempt in his eyes, glaring at him viciously.

"Brother Xiao knows me so well?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen snorted coldly, "If not for this trip to the Four Seasons Land, I wouldn’t even know your name, let alone claim to know you."

He acted as if he didn’t take Yang Kai seriously at all.

"Exactly." Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "Since Brother Xiao doesn’t know me, why are you so certain that I’m not a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist? Your logic is quite strange."

"This..." Xiao Chen frowned, unable to refute for a moment, but still stubbornly said, "Anyway, someone like you can’t possibly be a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist. If you’re just trying to muddle through, I advise you to give up early, or else... hmph!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhuang Bufan suddenly spoke up, "Brother Yang, you’ve been guarding this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus all this time, not letting anyone approach... could it be because you already knew everything about it?"

Earlier, he and Yang Kai had a fierce battle. Although he lost narrowly, it didn’t affect his favorable impression of Yang Kai.

Just as Yang Kai thought Zhuang Bufan was a decent person, Zhuang Bufan also felt Yang Kai was all right. So at this moment, he deliberately spoke up to help him out.

"Oh?" Hearing Zhuang Bufan say this, Lan Xun raised her delicate brows and looked at him in surprise, "Brother Zhuang means that it was Brother Yang who has been guarding this place all along?"

"That’s right. When I arrived, only Brother Yang was here. When the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus appeared, he was the first to arrive." Zhuang Bufan nodded slightly.

"Brother Yang, what Brother Zhuang said..." Lan Xun looked at Yang Kai.

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded lightly. "When the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus first appeared, I came here right away. I also knew what it was and what it was for, so I guarded it here, driving away quite a few who didn’t recognize its value. I originally planned to wait for it to mature before picking it, but I didn’t expect everyone to return early... and now, things have turned out like this."

At this, Yang Kai let out a bitter laugh.

"You really are an alchemist?" Lan Xun’s eyes showed surprise.

If he weren’t an alchemist, how could he so precisely identify a Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, such a rare Spiritual Medicine? Even someone like Zhuang Bufan could only guess, not be certain. Only a highly skilled and knowledgeable alchemist would have a great chance of recognizing the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

If before, Lan Xun still doubted Yang Kai’s words and thought, as Xia Sheng said, that he was just pretending to be an alchemist to muddle through, now she had a bit more confidence in him.

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

"And you’re a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist?" Lan Xun’s expression brightened.

“I say I am, but unfortunately, there are some who refuse to believe it.” Yang Kai spread his hands, his gaze drifting—intentionally or not—over Xiao Chen.

The latter immediately put on a stern face and said, "Anyone can say whatever they want. I could say I’m an Imperial-Grade Alchemist... would you believe it?"

Yang Kai shrugged, looking helpless.

But Lan Xun just smiled and said, "Whether you are or not, we can verify it right here! As long as Brother Yang can refine a batch of Dao Origin-Grade Pills on the spot, this question will be settled. There’s still plenty of time, enough for you to refine Pills. What do you think, Brother Yang...?"

Before Yang Kai could speak, Xiao Chen interjected, "Does he have the guts? If he really did it, wouldn’t he be exposing himself?"

Lan Xun couldn’t help but glare at Xiao Chen, finally stopping his endless chatter.

Yang Kai frowned, looking troubled, "Must I really do this?"

Lan Xun smiled and said, "Does Brother Yang lack confidence in himself? Although I don’t think you’d lie about something like this, it’s a serious matter. If you can’t refine the Supreme Mystic Pill, it’s better not to act rashly, or you’ll waste a heavenly treasure."

"Her Highness is right!" Zhuang Bufan also nodded. "Although refining the Pill would give more people a chance, if the Spiritual Medicine is ruined, it’s not worth it. At worst, when the Spiritual Medicine matures, everyone can compete for it. Brother Yang, think it over."

He was also deliberately giving Yang Kai a way out.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai only pondered for a moment before saying, "It’s not unreasonable to prove myself. After all, none of you trust me..."

"You really are a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist!" Xia Sheng was shocked, looking at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

Xiao Baiyi and Zhuang Bufan were also dumbfounded, as if they’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Of all people, only they knew how strong Yang Kai was. One had fought him fiercely at the Platform of Discourse, the other had just competed with him in Origin Qi!

Yet Yang Kai, with only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, had defeated them both.

Achieving such feats at only the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm clearly resulted from long, diligent accumulation—a foundation built up over time and unleashed in a single moment. One could well imagine how hard Yang Kai must have trained day after day—how could someone like that possibly have spare time to study alchemy? And yet, against all reason, he had somehow become a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist. Even if someone started cultivating from the womb, it would be impossible to reach such heights!

But Yang Kai’s tone and demeanor made it clear he really was a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist! This left Xiao Baiyi and Zhuang Bufan utterly shocked.

"But... even if I prove I’m a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist, I still can’t refine the Supreme Mystic Pill!" Yang Kai frowned.

"What do you mean?" Lan Xun asked in surprise.

"You need materials to refine pills, right?" Yang Kai looked at her. "The recipe for the Supreme Mystic Pill requires a total of nineteen ingredients. I deliberately gathered materials for it before, but I only managed to collect eighteen—just one is missing!"

"So he was searching other people’s Spatial Rings to find ingredients for the Supreme Mystic Pill!" Zhuang Bufan suddenly realized why Yang Kai had acted so mysteriously before.

Rather than robbing them, he had merely checked the Spatial Rings of his Junior Brother and Junior Sister, taking nothing and returning them afterward; yet if robbery was not his aim, then what, exactly, was the meaning behind such an action?

Only now did Zhuang Bufan finally understand!

Realizing this, Zhuang Bufan no longer doubted Yang Kai’s claim of being a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist.

If he hadn’t been preparing to refine the Supreme Mystic Pill, why would Yang Kai go to such lengths to gather materials? He must have been forced by circumstances. After all, this was the Four Seasons Land, and the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus was about to mature. He had to guard it and couldn’t leave, so he had no choice but to turn to others.

Zhuang Bufan was shocked inside but kept his composure outwardly.

Lan Xun smiled and asked, “Brother Yang, may I ask what ingredient you’re still missing? If you don’t mind sharing, with so many people present, perhaps someone just happens to have it.” As soon as she finished speaking, as if suddenly recalling something, she quickly added, “Wait—since the ingredients for alchemy are bound to be extremely precious, even if someone does have it, they might not be willing to hand it over so easily.”

"Mm, Her Highness is absolutely right." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"If someone won’t hand it over, just take it by force." Xiao Chen snorted coldly.

Wuchang sneered, "Idiot, if people don’t say they have it, how will you take it? Are you going to check everyone’s Spatial Ring one by one?"

"And why not?" Xiao Chen replied.

"Oh? In that case, if I want to check your Spatial Ring, you’d be willing?"

"If I had that ingredient, I certainly wouldn’t keep it to myself. No need for you to check!" Xiao Chen answered earnestly.

"Enough, enough." Lan Xun frowned and waved her hand to interrupt him. After thinking for a moment, she said seriously, "I have a proposal. How about this... later, whoever has what Brother Yang needs and volunteers to hand it over, once the Supreme Mystic Pill is refined, they can take one directly!"

"Your Highness... can you really say that?" Yang Kai was shocked.

The others’ faces also changed several times, clearly not expecting Lan Xun’s suggestion to be so surprising!

After all, even if Yang Kai really was a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist and succeeded in refining the pill, how many would there be in a batch? To give one away in advance—no one would be happy about that.

Lan Xun smiled slightly, "In the face of opportunity, everyone is equal. Don’t you men all love to gamble? Why are you all shrinking back now?" As she spoke, her beautiful eyes swept over everyone. "Brother Yang hasn’t even said what ingredient he needs yet. What are you all afraid of? Maybe the ingredient is in your Spatial Ring. If so, just hand it over and you’ll get a Supreme Mystic Pill. What a good deal!"

"Or maybe you’ll get nothing!" Xiao Baiyi muttered.

If Yang Kai failed to refine the pill, then indeed, they’d get nothing.

"But... I do have a question!" Zhuang Bufan spoke up.

"Please, Brother Zhuang." Lan Xun smiled at him.

"If the last ingredient Brother Yang needs is owned by two or more people, how should that be resolved?"
