## Chapter 1416 — Awakened Ancient Tree

Those assorted attacks and secret arts collided with the sandstorm in an instant, sand and grit spraying everywhere. The Purple Shield's defense was indeed outstanding, but this time there were simply too many enemies attacking Yang Kai, and they were all experts of the Origin Returning Realm; the secret treasures they invoked struck with tremendous power, not something ordinary warriors could match.

The protection formed by the Purple Shield was already set to break within a mere two breaths, looking perilously close to collapse.

Yang Kai’s expression tightened slightly, and just as he was about to deploy another defensive technique, an earth-shattering attack suddenly surged toward him—slow in appearance yet swift in truth. It was merely a single beam of light, seemingly aimed at Yang Kai, but when it struck the Purple Shield, it stirred the powers of countless Secret Treasures and secret arts into utter chaos.

In an instant Yang Kai felt his pressure greatly reduced; the change made his brow lift and he looked toward the direction the attack had come from, where he saw a middle-aged man in scholar's robes, long hair down to his waist and bearing a rakish air, smiling with his hands clasped behind his back.

What was this man's intent? Yang Kai couldn't quite fathom it.

The others were even more baffled; someone snarled angrily, "Elder Mo, what are you doing?"

That long-haired, waist-length middle-aged man was none other than Elder Mo Yu of the Qiantian Sect; his personal strength was not inferior to figures like Mo Xiaosheng and Cheng Pengxuan, and even surpassed Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng in some respects—he was a man of great renown.

Mo Yu smiled indifferently. "What else can I do? I took a fancy to the child's treasure. I'm simply trying to kill and seize it—what of it?"

The speaker frowned, vexed and angry, but there was no time to pursue the matter.

From the earlier attack it was clear Mo Yu had truly intended to kill and seize the treasure. Yet by the result he had instead done Yang Kai a great favor, for his strike deflected most of the incoming attacks aimed at Yang Kai.

Whether Mo Yu had acted intentionally or not was unknown; irritated, someone could only shout loudly as a reminder, "Elder Mo, you can strike, but could you be a bit more restrained?"

Mo Yu smiled faintly and said nothing further, instead regarding Yang Kai with keen interest.

He was extraordinarily expectant. Previously Dragon Lair Mountain had been in dire straits and seemed doomed, yet at the crucial moment a woman surnamed Ye had appeared; if not for the final disaster at the Imperial Garden, Dragon Lair Mountain should by now have been calm.

But because of the Imperial Garden incident, Dragon Lair Mountain had once more been shoved into the eye of the storm, and the situation had become even more perilous.

He was eager to know whether Yang Kai's streak of luck would end here, or whether fortune would once again smile upon him and he would resolve this crisis.

As the chief elder of the Qiantian Sect, he was of course not the sort to naively believe in fate; the real reason was that Yang Kai had once saved two of his disciples' lives. Mo Yu was not one to confuse favors and grievances—having promised Shen Shitao's request, he would naturally lend what little assistance he could.

Without Shen Shitao's appeal, Mo Yu would not have minded kicking someone when they were down; the Imperial Garden's extraordinary treasure also stirred his heart.

Moreover, if Yang Kai truly died, he would be the first to snatch Yang Kai's Spatial Ring.

After that one strike he made no further moves and instead watched to see how things unfolded, his attention largely drawn to that Void King-Grade refining furnace—its intense energy fluctuations left him astonished and uneasy; he could not imagine what was concealed within.

The group of enemies eyeing Yang Kai hungrily had now regrouped; their secret treasures hummed as they prepared to unleash another round of attacks.

At that moment a rushing, whistling sound of air-splitting came from one side, and with it a scorching force enveloped the scene. Golden, whip-like attacks descended from the sky, lashing down upon the enemy ranks.

Each strike was ferocious to the extreme, making one's expression change at once.

Those foes who had been poised to strike Yang Kai were stunned and hurriedly raised their defenses.

"What is—" Mo Yu's eyes widened as he stared incredulously toward the source of the assault and discovered a towering tree over ten zhang tall, its branches and leaves luxuriant.

The tree shimmered with dazzling golden light. As its branches swayed, countless golden leaves fell like rain and transformed into beams of golden light that shot toward the enemies like flying knives and arrows.

Those whip-like attacks were plainly the tree's branches transformed.

What shocked Mo Yu was not the tree's attacks but that on its massive trunk a clear set of facial features had appeared, now twisted in fury.

The force behind each branch-swipe and each golden-leaf assault was not inferior to the full-strength strike of a First Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior.

Attack after attack rained down, the scene terrifying to behold.

Even a top expert like himself, if trapped within it, would be flustered; let alone the others. The enemies surrounding Yang Kai had few top Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts among them, and wrapped in these strange assaults, were it not for their numbers casualties would likely occur immediately.

"Awakened Ancient Tree!" Mo Yu cried in astonishment—he had never imagined Dragon Lair Mountain would harbor such a treasure.

Moreover, this Awakened Ancient Tree was a rare Yang attribute spirit tree!

Trees are living things, but for a tree to awaken consciousness is harder than reaching the heavens. In all his years Mo Yu had only ever heard of Awakened Ancient Trees, never seen one with his own eyes; this was his first.

An Awakened Ancient Tree would be at least ten thousand years, perhaps tens of thousands of years old—a rare, heaven-defying treasure! If used for forging, it could certainly produce exceedingly powerful secret treasures.

What left him even more dumbfounded was that this Awakened Ancient Tree possessed such potent offensive abilities.

How could this be? Even if ordinary Awakened Ancient Trees awakened, they would not possess much strength; when facing powerful warriors they would usually use special powers to conceal their aura and avoid calamity.

But Dragon Lair Mountain's Awakened Ancient Tree had turned itself into a weapon of war—its branches and leaves all served as means to strike the enemy. It stood as an impregnable bulwark; even he would find it difficult to break through it quickly.

Dragon Lair Mountain… was full of things beyond imagination.

Mo Yu's plots glittered in his eyes; his interest grew stronger.

The Divine Tree's sudden eruption of power also surprised Yang Kai for a moment, but he quickly relaxed—this tree had awakened before he acquired it; it was already a spirit tree of no mean rank. Over the years he had fed it no fewer than ten drops of Golden Blood, so such growth was not unreasonable.

At that thought, Yang Kai split his lips into a savage grin.

"Boy, give up your life!" a furious roar sounded, and immediately a ripple appeared in the void not far ahead. A grim-faced warrior in Battle Sky Alliance garb burst forth from nowhere.

From the energy fluctuation about him it was clear this man possessed the strength of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and was adept at concealment. While everyone's attention was distracted, he had covertly crept close to Yang Kai and was launching a lethal strike.

Admittedly, he had planned well and knew how to seize the moment—this was the instant Yang Kai's mind relaxed, and a sneak attack now could conceivably raise his chances of success.

Even a lion uses its full strength when hunting a rabbit. Though this man was powerful, within Dragon Lair Mountain—Yang Kai’s domain—he dared not underestimate him in the slightest. The moment he struck, it was with the force of thunder and lightning, unleashing his full power.

The distance between them suddenly closed. The man’s long sword, gleaming with cold light, thrust straight toward Yang Kai’s chest. Before the blade even reached him, the sword aura flickered like a serpent’s tongue, its chilling killing intent as biting as the wind over a frozen plain, pricking Yang Kai’s skin with pain.

Yang Kai, however, still stood motionless, only a grim, cold smile rising at the corner of his mouth, appearing utterly unperturbed.

Something was wrong! The Second Stage Origin Returning Realm expert felt a jolt in his heart, an indistinct sense of unease, though he could not pin down why—he just felt that if he persisted with the rash strike, he might be the one to suffer.

Thoughts flashed through his mind; his expression hardened, and rather than withdrawing, he poured his Saint Yuan into the sword even more violently.

The sword radiance swelled, its momentum like a rainbow!

Mo Yu stood not far off, eyes fixed unwaveringly on Yang Kai, wanting to know what support he relied upon to remain so composed in the face of a Second Stage Origin Returning Realm expert's ambush.

The answer was revealed in an instant: as the enemy's attack descended, a small, unassuming figure suddenly appeared before Yang Kai, gray and drab, barely two chi tall—only reaching Yang Kai's knee.

Mo Yu raised his brow in surprise, staring intently at the gray figure, for a moment unable to identify what it was.

It looked like a stone, yet it had limbs and facial features, its appearance simple and honest; its nose, mouth, and ears seemed carved, with sharp contours, but its two eyes were full of spirit. It hunched, with arms nearly reaching its knees—odd to the extreme.

Even a mere stone could gain sentience? Mo Yu could hardly believe his eyes.

What baffled Mo Yu most was that he detected no energy fluctuations or breath of life from the thing.

Was it alive or dead?

The Stone Puppet answered Mo Yu's doubt through action.

Facing the Second Stage Origin Returning Realm warrior's sneak attack, the Stone Puppet opened its mouth and spat out a lacquer-black staff; then it stretched out a hand, seized the staff, and, as if casually, swept it forward.

One sweep of the staff changed the color of heaven and earth—the spiritual qi in a radius of several li seemed to be stirred.

Mo Yu's eye twitched; with his sight he could see that this seemingly casual sweep contained immense power—an ordinary attack could never create such momentum.

He thought to himself that the Battle Sky Alliance warrior was in for ill luck.

His prediction was accurate: although this Battle Sky Alliance man was of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and recognized the staff's might, he was now trapped with no way to retreat. He could only desperately drive his Saint Yuan, and the long sword in his hand hummed and erupted with boundless radiance.
