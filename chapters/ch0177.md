## Chapter 177 — Reunion with the Lady

In the days that followed, Di Mo was in "seclusion," while Yang Kai was refining the medicinal power of the basket of rare herbs he had gathered.

After all, these treasures were non-toxic, and his Indomitable Golden Body could absorb all kinds of energy without worrying about any conflicts arising from the different energies.

For over ten days, Yang Kai consumed the rare herbs worth over a million taels of silver.

With effort comes reward; his strength smoothly advanced from the Qi Movement – Third Stage to the Qi Movement – Fourth Stage.

Having arrived at Yunxia Island for just about two months, he had already made consecutive breakthroughs. This trip was indeed worthwhile.

The rare herbs on the right half of the island had nearly been depleted, and the source of the evil demons in this area had been devoured by Di Mo. Yang Kai estimated that in a few more days, this right half of the island would no longer be the forbidden ground for Yunxia warriors as it had been before.

It was time to leave!

Yang Kai descended the mountain and walked towards the seaside.

To leave Yunxia Island, the only way was by boat, which was a headache for Yang Kai. Building a ship himself was certainly not feasible; the only method he could think of was to seize a ship from the Yunxia Sect.

But how to seize it, and how to escape afterward, was the biggest problem.

While he was contemplating some details, Yang Kai suddenly heard some rustling sounds coming from not far away. Listening closely, he could also hear a person’s heavy breathing, mixed with a woman’s pleas for mercy as she struggled.

Yang Kai's expression darkened, and he hurried towards the source of the noise.

Upon arriving, he found that his suspicions were correct; the Yunxia Sect had sent those captured commoners to the right half of the island to pick Black Mysterious Fruits again.

Not far from him, a burly man was sitting on top of a woman, tearing at her clothes with both hands, breathing heavily like an ox, and letting out lewd laughter.

The woman was pinned beneath him, struggling desperately but unable to break free. She kept begging for mercy, tears streaming down her face.

Yang Kai sensed a trace of evil energy emanating from that burly man!

His figure flashed, and he rushed over, kicking the man in the waist and sending him flying. The woman broke free from the man's grasp and quickly scrambled to her feet, clutching her tattered clothing and trembling as she hid behind Yang Kai.

The man let out a cry as he flew through the air. Once he landed, he quickly got back up, glaring at Yang Kai with fierce eyes.

His eyes were blood-red, and his face was filled with malice. He was clearly on the verge of being consumed by the evil energy within him, glaring at Yang Kai with a ferocious expression, snorting hot air from his nostrils.

"Ah!" Yang Kai sighed. This man should have been a poor person, but after repeatedly entering the right half of Yunxia Island, he had lost his true nature. That was why Yang Kai had not killed him but merely kicked him away.

"You little brat, get lost!" The man’s face showed a hint of pain, but since Yang Kai had ruined his good deed, he was unwilling to back down.

Yang Kai looked at him with indifference. After a moment, the man let out a roar and charged at Yang Kai like a mad bull, his face twisted with rage.

"Better to end your suffering early." Yang Kai stood his ground, waiting for the man to reach him before extending a finger to point at his chest.

True Yang Yuan Qi surged in, instantly stopping the man’s heart. Without feeling any pain, he collapsed to the ground, his life extinguished.

Behind him, the woman was sobbing softly. Yang Kai felt a pang of discomfort in his heart. He turned around, intending to offer some words of comfort. However, when his eyes swept over the woman’s face, he was struck dumb, his eyes trembling in disbelief.

This woman appeared to be around thirty years old, originally should have been dignified and beautiful, as could be inferred from her fair skin. But at this moment, her face was marred by hideous scars, crisscrossing like a terrifying web. Each scar was about a finger wide, stretching from the left side of her face to the right, with pale red flesh rolling outwards. Although the wounds had healed, the scars would forever mar her beautiful visage.

The woman seemed to realize how horrifying her appearance was. One hand covered her torn collar, while the other shielded her face, trembling all over as she tearfully expressed her gratitude.

As she thanked him, she timidly stepped back, as if afraid of scaring Yang Kai.

Yang Kai felt a chill throughout his body, his expression stern as he reached out and firmly grasped the woman’s wrist.

"No... please don’t..." The woman struggled, thinking she had just escaped from a tiger's mouth only to fall into a wolf's den. Her head hung low, her disheveled black hair obscuring her face, tears dripping down as she pleaded.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, extending his other hand to gently lift her chin.

"Please, don’t..." The woman’s tears had soaked her cheeks, and she looked up at Yang Kai weakly, the scars on her face becoming even more horrifying.

In Yang Kai's eyes, there was no lust, only heartache and hesitation. The hand that lifted her chin trembled slightly as he brushed aside her hair that covered her face, revealing her features clearly before him.

The woman shut her eyes, not knowing if it was due to her shame at being seen or if she was frightened by Yang Kai's actions, tears flowing continuously.

Yang Kai's pupils contracted, and after staring for a long time, he finally blurted out, "Madam?"

Hearing this long-lost title, the woman slowly opened her eyes. A flicker of doubt crossed her tear-stained eyes, and as she looked closely at Yang Kai, the doubt gradually vanished, replaced by surprise and joy.

"You really are the Madam?" Yang Kai could hardly believe it. The moment he saw this woman, he felt a sense of familiarity, which was why he had acted so recklessly earlier. But now he could confirm that this woman was indeed the one he had met before.

The woman finally recognized Yang Kai's voice, and a dirty face from over two months ago flashed in her mind. She trembled as she said, "You... you are that little beggar?"

Yang Kai took a deep breath. The moment the woman uttered the words "little beggar," he knew he had not been mistaken.

This woman was actually the widow of the Jiang family!

The only ones who knew he was the little beggar, besides Cui’er, were this Madam and the young lady of the Jiang family.

"What are you doing here? Your face..." Yang Kai had too many questions. Weren't Cui’er and the others supposed to have sought refuge with the Miao family in Haicheng? On the day they parted, Miao Huacheng had even come to greet them personally. The two families had a marriage contract; the young lady of the Jiang family should have married into the Miao family by now. This Madam should have been enjoying a life of comfort with the Miao family.

How... how did things turn out like this?

"Young hero..." Upon realizing Yang Kai was the little beggar who had once saved her, the Madam suddenly knelt on the ground with a thud, banging her head against the ground, producing a thumping sound, and sorrowfully said, "Please, young hero, seek justice for my Jiang family!"

Yang Kai reacted quickly, rushing to help her up. Even so, the Madam's forehead hit the ground hard enough to draw blood, indicating the force of her action.

"This isn't a place for talking; we should leave here first." Yang Kai supported her and hurried back the way he came.

Why had the Madam become like this? Why had she been captured and brought to Yunxia Island? Where were Cui’er and the young lady? What had happened to the Miao family in Haicheng? He had too many questions.

Though these matters were not directly related to him, he had spent several days with the widow of the Jiang family and had shared pleasant conversations with Cui’er. This maid would often share snacks with him, and she was lively and charming; a kind person should receive good fortune.

After hastily leading the Madam for a while, they finally arrived at a small hill nearby, which was already considered deep within the right half of Yunxia Island, a place ordinary people could not reach.

They found a spot to sit down. The once despairing Madam, having miraculously encountered Yang Kai again, was overwhelmed with emotion and began to sob uncontrollably.

Yang Kai did not comfort her or interrupt; he simply waited quietly. He knew that not only did he have many questions, but the Madam surely had much to tell him as well.

After a full half an hour, the Madam gradually stopped sobbing, her hair still covering her terrifying face as she hugged her knees and trembled.

Yang Kai took off his outer garment and draped it over her.

"Thank you!" Even in dire straits, the Madam displayed her good upbringing.

"Now, tell me, what exactly happened?"

The Madam's eyes fell into a memory, her voice low as she recounted the events that transpired after she and her companions parted ways with Yang Kai. Her tone was somber.

"I, Huan'er, and Cui’er followed Miao Huacheng to the Miao family. For the first few days, Miao Huacheng treated us fairly well. But when I brought up Huan'er’s marriage, he kept dodging the topic. I had some doubts but didn’t take them to heart. After a few more days, when I mentioned it again, he agreed but said that his son was of noble status and that my Huan'er was not worthy. If she wanted to marry into the Miao family, she could only be a concubine. I was furious but didn’t explode."

"The next day, I told Huan'er and Cui’er to pack our things and leave the Miao family. We were orphans, having traveled a long way to Haicheng, enduring hardships, not to become concubines for the Miao family. Moreover, this was a marriage contract set by my late husband with Miao Huacheng; how could he go back on his word?"

"However, before we could leave the Miao family, Miao Huacheng turned against us and imprisoned the three of us." As she spoke, a look of fear crossed the Madam's face, clearly shaken by the sudden turn of events.

Her tone choked with emotion, she continued, "I had no idea why Miao Huacheng would act like this. After some inquiries, I learned that everything was orchestrated by him. My husband’s death was also due to him colluding with those in Tongzhou to kill my husband, then sending word to me to bring Huan'er to Haicheng for marriage. How foolish I was, completely unaware, leading Huan'er into a den of wolves and tigers."

"Why would he do this? Wasn't your husband a close friend of Miao Huacheng?" Yang Kai felt that something was amiss. When he had parted with the Madam, he had also met Miao Huacheng, and his sorrowful tone and expression did not seem like an act.
