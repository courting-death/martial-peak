## Chapter 219 — The Mantis Stalks the Cicada (Part Two)

Day and night were indistinguishable, yin and yang were chaotic, and the world was in a state of confusion; these were the most apparent characteristics of this place.

“It's here!” Shu Xiaoyu said excitedly. Chen Xueshu and Yang Kai, however, quickly scanned their surroundings with vigilance. Once they confirmed there was no danger, they couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

This foreign land occupied a vast area, and those who entered were not necessarily from the same floating patch of water; they would not appear together. Yang Kai had learned this information beforehand, and upon seeing it for himself, he found it to be true.

Yang Kai quietly distanced himself from Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu. Although it wasn't very obvious, Chen Xueshu still noticed the subtle shift.

Chen Xueshu didn't think much of it and smiled at Yang Kai, saying, “Junior Brother Yang, would you like to join us? It’s better to look out for each other!”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head and clasped his fists, replying, “I appreciate the kind offer, but I would like to try on my own.”

Chen Xueshu nodded slightly, not insisting, “Then Junior Brother Yang, be careful!”

“Until we meet again!” With that, Yang Kai turned and swiftly left.

“Why is he running so fast? It's not like we're going to harm him!” Shu Xiaoyu pouted her red lips, somewhat dissatisfied with Yang Kai's caution.

Chen Xueshu chuckled and patted Shu Xiaoyu's head, saying, “That's exactly what he's afraid of!”

“But we have no intention of doing him harm!” Shu Xiaoyu was still a bit miffed. “With his low strength, I bet he’ll die quickly!”

Chen Xueshu shook his head with a serious expression: “Not necessarily. This person is very cautious and careful; such individuals tend to live longer! Also, I always feel he’s a bit strange.”

“What’s strange about him?” Shu Xiaoyu blinked her big eyes in confusion.

“He dares to come here with only the strength of the Separation and Union Realm Third Layer; either he has a death wish or he has some backing.”

“You mean…”

“This person likely has some extraordinary means; otherwise, his master wouldn’t have let him come here to train. Sigh, anyone who can enter this place must have some skills. We should be careful and try to avoid conflicts.”

After parting ways with the two from the Yingyue Sect, Yang Kai fully unleashed his movement technique, darting over ten miles. He changed directions several times along the way and then suddenly turned to land on a large tree, vigilantly observing the surroundings.

It wasn't that he underestimated others; being cautious was never a bad thing.

Moreover, this was also a test to see if Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu were sincere or if they were two-faced.

After waiting quietly in the tree for a long time, Yang Kai found no signs of anyone pursuing him. He then confirmed that the two indeed had no malicious intent toward him.

Both of them possessed True Essence Realm strength. They were certainly talented individuals within the Yingyue Sect, and if they truly intended to harm him, they wouldn’t have waited this long.

Ling Taixu had previously mentioned that if he encountered trustworthy individuals, it would be good to cooperate. Now, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu were on Yang Kai's list of trusted individuals.

If fate allowed them to meet again, Yang Kai wouldn’t mind teaming up with them.

Hiding in the treetop, Yang Kai first tried out his two killing secret treasures. After some effort, he was disheartened to find that he couldn't summon them here; it seemed they were indeed sealed within his body.

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai called out.

“Old servant is here,” the Earth Demon quickly replied.

“Can the Soul-Breaking Spike be used?”

“I'm afraid it will disappoint the young master; it cannot be used…”

Yang Kai cursed this damned place inwardly. Even the Soul-Breaking Spike, which wasn’t even his own treasure, was restricted. Without the Soul-Breaking Spike, the Earth Demon couldn’t exert any combat power; it seemed this time he would have to rely solely on his own strength.

Fortunately, Ling Taixu had given Yang Kai a Spatial Pouch earlier, which contained many good items.

He hadn’t had the time to check it before, but now he finally had a moment to spare.

Taking out the small cloth bag from his chest, he untied the opening and reached inside, pulling out a number of items.

There were about a dozen bottles of pills, most of which were for healing, and a few bottles were entirely composed of Yang attribute pills. This made Yang Kai extremely happy. He secretly thought that his master treated him very well; with these few bottles of pills, he wouldn’t have to worry about running out of Yang Liquid.

In addition to the pills, Yang Kai also found several sets of clean clothes and a long sword.

This long sword wasn’t a secret treasure; it was merely a weapon forged from fine steel, so it could be used here. However, Yang Kai had never learned any sword techniques. Using it for slashing was no better than fighting barehanded. At his current level, a sword that didn’t feel right in his hands wouldn’t increase his combat power at all.

After carefully putting everything away, Yang Kai jumped down from the tree, rubbing his fists together, excitedly stepping onto his journey of training.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai encountered a Fourth-Order demon beast. After some effort, he managed to kill it and stood quietly in place, waiting.

As expected, after the demon beast died, Yang Kai distinctly felt its energy and flesh essence gathering towards a certain spot in the air.

Almost visibly, the demon beast's corpse slowly shriveled and sank, while the red energy flowing out from its body increased.

After a while, a red bead, roughly the size of a pea, formed.

Yang Kai was quick to react, grabbing it the moment it took shape. He focused on feeling it and discovered that this bead contained a very peculiar energy. Although the energy wasn’t too abundant, considering it was just a Fourth-Order demon beast, it was still not disappointing.

In this realm, who knew what kind of laws of nature were hidden; it was astonishing that such a thing happened after a living creature died.

Putting the blood bead away, Yang Kai looked down at the demon beast and saw that its corpse had completely turned into a pile of powder, the essence gone, leaving only dregs.

Yang Kai felt a hint of anticipation about how much improvement a single blood bead could bring him, but it was clear that now was not the right time to refine and absorb it.

Having made a gain, Yang Kai's fighting spirit soared, and his steps became lighter.

This place was indeed a good training ground for warriors of the Separation and Union Realm and True Essence Realm. In just one day since arriving, Yang Kai had already killed five or six lone demon beasts, all of which were Third or Fourth Order. They consumed little of his energy, but the rewards were quite substantial; the blood beads from Third-Order demon beasts were much smaller than those from Fourth-Order ones, clearly lacking in energy.

He also encountered a Fifth-Order demon beast, but after weighing it for a long time, he refrained from attacking. A Fifth-Order demon beast was equivalent to a True Essence Realm warrior. Even if Yang Kai were to kill it by chance, he would have to go all out and be prepared to get injured.

Thus, unless absolutely necessary, Yang Kai did not wish to engage with a Fifth-Order demon beast.

For three consecutive days, Yang Kai hunted demon beasts without a care, resting in relatively safe spots to recover his strength before continuing his hunt.

In these three days, he hadn’t encountered a single person.

No wonder many warriors of the Separation and Union Realm dared to enter; if things continued this way, even warriors of the Qi Movement Realm wouldn’t have to worry about anything, aside from being careful to avoid demon beasts.

Three days later, Yang Kai crouched down, hiding in a thicket, and secretly observed ahead.

There were two Fourth-Order demon beasts, Illusionary Thunder Wolves.

Fourth-Order demon beasts were equivalent to warriors of the Separation and Union Realm, matching Yang Kai's current level. If they attacked together, it might be somewhat troublesome for him.

However, after thinking for a long time, Yang Kai decided to take action.

The highest level of demon beasts he could handle now was Fourth-Order. If he encountered two at once, there was no reason to give up.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai sprang from his hiding place and swiftly approached the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves. He had focused all his attention on these two demon beasts when suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of someone moving not far away.

His heart sank, and Yang Kai quickly glanced over, only to see a figure in a dark red robe hurriedly hiding itself about a hundred zhang away.

His thoughts raced, and Yang Kai quickly understood what was happening.

The other party was clearly observing the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves just like him, without noticing each other's presence. Coincidentally, they both chose to strike at the same time.

Perhaps it was because Yang Kai was faster, so he emerged first, while the other person had just revealed themselves.

At this moment, the other party also noticed Yang Kai and hurriedly hid again.

Unfortunately, the clothing that person wore was too conspicuous, revealing some flaws.

It was already too late to retreat now; the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves had also turned their attention to Yang Kai, baring their fangs and rushing over without hesitation.

Yang Kai felt a sense of despair as he pondered how to deal with this situation where the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. He also recalled the identities of those people on the opposite side.

After a moment, Yang Kai's heart steadied, and he quickened his pace, pretending to be oblivious as he charged towards the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves.

These two Fourth-Order demon beasts were as swift as the wind, their bodies crackling with arcs of electricity. As they ran, they split into a left and right encirclement, closing in on Yang Kai in the blink of an eye.

The two demon beasts clearly had rich hunting experience, coordinating their attacks with perfect timing.

Yang Kai hurriedly sidestepped to evade one of the Illusionary Thunder Wolves' bites, but was bitten on the shoulder by the other.

A jolt of electricity coursed through his body, causing Yang Kai to shudder involuntarily. He quickly circulated his Yuan Qi to dispel it, his muscles tensing as he punched the Illusionary Thunder Wolf in the face, taking advantage of the moment it hadn’t torn flesh from him to send it flying.

With a howl, the Illusionary Thunder Wolf tumbled several times on the ground.

Yang Kai's strike hadn’t been full force, so he hadn’t injured it much. After landing, the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves joined forces again, roaring as they lunged at him.

Yang Kai kicked out, striking the belly of the Illusionary Thunder Wolf below, sending it flying, while he pushed against the other Illusionary Thunder Wolf with both palms to block its attack.

Taking advantage of the fact that the two demon beasts were still recovering, Yang Kai charged in, engaging in a fierce battle with the two Illusionary Thunder Wolves.

In truth, if he were to unleash all his abilities, Yang Kai wouldn’t have to fight so hard. However, since he knew someone was watching him, he had to put on a show and be cautious.
