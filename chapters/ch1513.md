## Chapter 1513 — Array Destroyed

A thunderous rumble filled the air in an unending roar. Beyond the reach of both the naked eye and Divine Sense, the entire inner city of Battle Sky City had fallen into chaos. Wherever the pure white beams fired from the Crystal Cannons swept past, everything was reduced to nothingness—utterly erased from existence.

The Battle Sky Alliance's foundation, amassed over thousands upon tens of thousands of years, was almost completely annihilated within the span of a half incense stick, leaving scarcely two tenths of it intact.

Anyone could see the catastrophic losses suffered by the Battle Sky Alliance, for amidst the scattered bombardment of the Crystal Cannons not only did buildings collapse, but many martial artists screamed their deaths in agony.

Each wail more harrowing than the last; it struck terror into the heart.

Even so, no one from the Battle Sky Alliance dared to step forward to meet the attack.

Yang Kai's brow gradually knitted; he had somewhat underestimated the endurance of Qu Zheng and the others.

The Crystal Cannon's power was indeed formidable, and he certainly did not lack Origin Saint Crystal, but prolonged continuous bombardment would impose a strain on the Crystal Cannon. Once that load was exceeded, the Crystal Cannon would no longer be usable.

Even if these devices had been personally refined by Yang Yan, that constraint could not be avoided.

The Battle Sky Alliance intended to employ stillness against motion — waiting until his side's offensive weakened before they made their move.

That thought flickered through his mind and Yang Kai sneered, his immense Divine Sense surging forth like a tide.

That utterly frigid chill possessed the power to freeze Divine Sense, yet Yang Kai's Divine Sense moved through the biting cold without hindrance.

Divine Sense Fire!

His Divine Sense was a mutated Divine Sense, searingly hot, precisely sufficient to counter that savage cold; it could not be said to have no effect, but it was nearly negligible.

Time passed slowly as Yang Kai searched bit by bit.

Suddenly his eyes brightened and a mocking smile curled his lip as he calmly ordered, "Fire a Crystal Cannon at the left, three notches!"

The disciple controlling the Crystal Cannon, though uncertain why such an order had been given, did not hesitate; he adjusted the firing direction and loosed a Crystal Cannon shot.

Yang Kai concentrated and sensed; nodding slightly, he added, "A bit more to the left, lower the angle!"

"Yes!"

At the same time, some ten li out in the direction the Crystal Cannon had been firing, there stood something like a well, and around that well were many exquisite formations arrayed, concealing the well and providing powerful protection.

From the well's mouth surged streams of dense, almost solid cold-aligned energy, injected into the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array to strengthen its power.

The Condensed Jade Ice Spring!

That wellhead was one of the array eyes of the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array.

Three Origin Returning Realm experts guarded the place. At present they sat cross-legged nearby, brows furrowed with worry as they squinted toward the inner city shrouded in cold.

A Void King-Grade warship of Lingxiao Sect had appeared before the city; Battle Sky Alliance was in disarray. Even a powerhouse like Lu Feng had been slain in a single strike. No one dared stand in front of that warship.

Their only reliance was the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array, hoping it could deal with the enemy.

A white pillar of light streaked rapidly from the front. The three involuntarily widened their eyes and secretly urged their Saint Yuan, hearts tight with dread.

It was the enemy's Crystal Cannon, that much the three knew; though there were many clever formations here, whether they could withstand the Crystal Cannon's bombardment was anyone's guess.

If they failed to hold it, the three might meet the same fate as Elder Lu Feng.

Fortunately their worry proved needless — that single white pillar, though fearsome, flew past from the flank and did not harm the three or the Formation Core.

The three Origin Returning Realm experts each wiped sweat from their brows and breathed heavily.

"It matters not, it was mere chance. With the great array covering us, they won't be able to locate the array eyes. The Alliance Master said we need only wait until their energy is exhausted, then we'll strike," the bearded man muttered, half to himself and half to reassure his companions.

"But they come with such overwhelming momentum — they must be prepared. What if the array cannot hold out until then?" the elegantly dressed woman asked anxiously.

"Hmph, what is there to fear? A warship's Crystal Cannon is powerful, but its consumption is tremendous; it will exhaust itself. Besides, every Crystal Cannon has a usage limit; they cannot fire too many times in quick succession. We simply wait. Those from Lingxiao Sect are like headless flies now. If this goes well, our Saint Alliance will not only slay those thieves but seize a Void King-Grade warship — think about how great that benefit would be," the elder said in a deep voice, his temperament steadier than the other two.

Hearing this, the other two brightened at once, their minds conjuring visions of that terrifying warship belonging to the Battle Sky Alliance; their hearts flared with excitement.

Then another white pillar shot forth from the front, skimming by not far away.

The bearded man suddenly paled, cold sweat breaking out on him.

This time it had been closer than the last.

Before the thought finished, a third white pillar attacked from the front.

"Bad!" the elder cried, springing to his feet as he shouted, "Open the formation!"

At his command the three poured their Saint Yuan into the Formation Plate, whereupon a thick light-screen formed in a semicircle, enclosing them and the Condensed Jade Ice Spring's wellhead.

Boom……

That seemingly impregnable screen could not withstand the Crystal Cannon's strike; it shattered in under three breaths.

The three faces changed drastically.

Luckily each was seasoned; they produced their defensive Secret Treasures to form a protective barrier in front.

The Crystal Cannon's residual might continued to surge in.

Hissing sounds rose as the white pillar dimmed and ultimately dissipated.

The three staggered, unsteady; all were deathly pale. The elegantly dressed woman tasted blood in her throat and spat a spray of blood mist, while the three Secret Treasures shattered into fragments.

"It's happening again — three of them!" the bearded man cried in terror.

The woman and the elder went ashen, staring dumbfounded at the three white pillars rapidly approaching; they could hardly believe their eyes.

The enemy had somehow found the position of the wellhead! How could this be? How had they done it?

One strike had already gravely wounded them; now three shots fired together were simply unstoppable!

Light engulfed them; the spot where the Condensed Jade Ice Spring lay trembled, and the three Origin Returning Realm men vanished without a sound. Even the earth was rent, leaving a massive pit more than ten zhang deep.

Inside the warship Yang Kai sneered and ordered his disciples to readjust their firing direction.

At the same time, in an inner-city palace considered utterly secure, Mo Xiaosheng's expression changed as he looked up at Qu Zheng, who sat in the lead seat, and said gravely, "Alliance Master, one of the array eyes has been destroyed!"

"What?" Qu Zheng sprang from his chair and stared at Mo Xiaosheng in disbelief. "How was it destroyed? Was it merely a lucky hit by the enemy or...?"

Mo Xiaosheng shook his head slowly. "This old man does not know. The three guarding there have perished and the wellhead is shattered. Whether the enemy did it intentionally or not, we cannot continue to sit and wait for death."

"What does the Great Elder propose?"

"Full power into the array! Fight the warship to the death!" Mo Xiaosheng barked.

Qu Zheng frowned at this and hesitated, his face troubled as if wrestling with the decision.

"Alliance Master, the Lingxiao Sect has brought a warship. Now it is either them or us. If we delay until two more array eyes are destroyed, we will have no chance to strike back. Though pouring all our power into the array comes at a high cost, it is better than waiting for death," the Great Elder urged.

"The Great Elder is right." Qu Zheng drew a deep breath and his gaze hardened. "Fine. Issue the order. Put all power into the array. I would rather lose our millennia-old foundation than allow Lingxiao Sect to succeed!"

"Yes!" Mo Xiaosheng replied and poured his Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass at his hand to relay the command.

In the next moment the inner city was swept by a storm of energy. The air was already bitterly cold, but now the dense chill grew even more terrifying, covering even the warship's hull with a thick layer of ice.

That freezing profound intent hindered the warship's movement; even aboard the warship each person felt bone-deep cold as if their very souls might freeze.

"What is happening? Why has it suddenly turned so frigid here?" Qian Tong asked, his face dark.

"It seems they set some trick in motion," Yang Kai muttered, brows knitted. His Divine Sense probing revealed that the two spring mouths which had been gently exuding cold were now erupting violently like volcanic vents, and the nearby martial artists guarding the array eyes were rapidly withdrawing, seemingly unwilling to remain in place.

Crackle crackle……

Crisp sounds came from the exterior of the warship — the hull was beginning to freeze.

More than that, the dense icy aura congealed into beast forms of varying sizes, crystalline as jade, like carved ice, yet each emitted powerful energy fluctuations.

In a short while the warship was surrounded by countless ice beasts.

Everyone aboard the warship changed color.

They had long heard of the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array's formidable power, but seeing it in person proved it lived up to its reputation. With such means the inner city of Battle Sky City could be secure for ten thousand years.

Once formed, the ice beasts attacked with extreme ferocity and in an instant overwhelmed the warship.

All aboard clenched their teeth in fear, dreading that the warship would be destroyed.

Yang Kai's face was as dark as night. He rose and shouted, "Deploy protective measures! Pay no heed to those ice beasts — at all costs, destroy those two array eyes!"
