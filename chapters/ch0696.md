## Chapter 696 — Setting Out Together

When Yang Kai appeared, Cang Yan and the others wasted no words; they gave him a slight nod and immediately set out.

The four of them each employed their own means and sped along with ease, Yang Kai trailing behind them at an unhurried pace.

Sensing the current state of his body, the four Great Protectors of Tianxiao Sect all showed a flicker of unease.

They had discovered that ever since Fei Yu had given Yang Kai the Hunyuan Shackles several months ago, he had worn them continuously and had never taken them off; even now he still bore several thousand jin of weight.

And he himself seemed to have grown accustomed to such a burden; there was no trace of awkwardness on his face, only a plain, ordinary composure.

This brat’s physical body is perversely strong—almost excessive, they thought involuntarily; it rivaled the demonic clans themselves!

Not long after they set off, Cang Yan let out a soft exclamation, looking down; at the same time Yang Kai heard a voice calling up from below. At the source of the sound stood a white‑haired elder stroking his beard and gazing their way, and beside the elder a young woman bounded about, waving and calling out coquettishly.

“It’s Elder Du!” Cang Yan exclaimed in surprise, waving his hand. “Let's go down and have a look.”

When he landed, Yang Kai indeed saw Elder Du of the Alchemists' Association and Mi Na. At the sight of Yang Kai, Mi Na charged forward at once, huffing angrily, “You bastard, didn’t you say you’d come to Giant Stone City to see me when you had time? How come you haven’t shown up these past few months?”

“Uh… I was a bit busy, I forgot,” Yang Kai replied, embarrassed for a moment.

“You think my alchemy skills are inferior to yours and look down on me?” Mi Na planted her hands on her hips and demanded, refusing to relent.

“No, no.” Yang Kai hastily waved his hands. “I was really just busy.”

“You’d better be telling the truth, or I’ll bite you to death!” Mi Na said, feeling much better. “I’m now a Spirit‑Grade, Lower‑Level alchemist, same as you—don’t get cocky. I might surpass you any day.”

Elder Du watched the exchange with a smiling expression, his eyes flashing as he said, “Mi Na, young friend Yang seems different from before.”

“Different how?” Mi Na asked suspiciously.

“Young friend Yang should at least be a Spirit‑Grade, Upper‑Level alchemist by now, shouldn’t he?” Elder Du fixed a burning gaze on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai scratched his head, then his expression suddenly turned solemn as he cupped his fists and said, “Sorry, Elder Du. I didn’t tell you the truth at the Alchemists' Association before. Actually, I reached Spirit‑Grade, Upper‑Level some months ago.”

Elder Du’s face changed slightly; he looked at Yang Kai with astonishment and shock, while Mi Na covered her mouth, struck and crestfallen.

“So that’s it.” Elder Du suddenly laughed, “It seems this old man underestimated you. Young friend Yang, don’t take it to heart—this old man is glad you can tell the truth to me now.”

“How did Elder Du know I’m a Spirit‑Grade, Upper‑Level alchemist now?” Yang Kai asked in puzzlement.

“Aren’t Cang Yan and the others taking you to Fuyun City? Any alchemist able to go there is at least Spirit‑Grade, Upper‑Level,” Elder Du replied with a faint smile.

Cang Yan’s expression shifted. “Elder Du, you’re going there too?”

“Yes, I’ve been waiting here specifically for you. The journey is long and this old man hoped to find a few escorts to accompany me,” Elder Du said half‑jokingly, half‑seriously. “But rest assured, I’m not heading there for the soon‑to‑bloom Thousand‑Year Demon Flower. I’m only taking Mi Na out to gain experience and broaden her horizons—this little miss thinks she’s the only gifted alchemist in the world; I believe this trip will teach her much.”

“Elder Du, I don’t think that anymore,” Mi Na protested, feeling deeply aggrieved.

Before meeting Yang Kai, Mi Na had indeed been arrogant. Though young, she had qualified as an Upper‑Level Mystery‑Grade alchemist months earlier; Elder Du and her master Ye Xiong had pinned great hopes on her, even grooming her as the inheritor of the Alchemists' Association in Giant Stone City.

But after meeting Yang Kai, Mi Na suffered successive blows. This time was the worst: Yang Kai had already been a Spirit‑Grade, Upper‑Level alchemist while she was still celebrating her small breakthrough.

Thinking of that, Mi Na’s pretty face flushed with shame; she wished she could crawl into a hole and never show her face again.

Elder Du chuckled, “The Thousand‑Year Demon Flower is about to bloom and I’m sure many powerful alchemists will head to Fuyun City. This is a once‑in‑a‑thousand‑years event; I don’t want to miss it. If you don’t mind, would you take this old man and the young miss along with you?”

“Elder Du, you’re too polite.” Cang Yan shook his head. “Since you’re also going to Fuyun City, then let us go together and look out for one another.”

Elder Du smiled and inclined his head.

With the matter settled, the four from Tianxiao Sect circulated their True Yuan and enveloped Elder Du and Mi Na, carrying them forward together.

Seeing Mi Na’s sulky expression, Yang Kai felt a bit guilty and approached, asking, “What’s wrong?”

“You’re unbearable!” Mi Na pouted and glared at him.

“Unbearable?” Yang Kai looked astonished.

Mi Na nodded emphatically, then straightened and added, “But don’t get smug—Elder Du said that as long as I persist and work hard, I’ll one day catch up to you.”

“I’m not smug, am I?” Yang Kai said helplessly.

“Even if your face doesn’t show it, you’re proud inside,” Mi Na insisted.

Yang Kai shook his head and sighed, “Your world is truly dark.”

The small group around them couldn’t help smiling at the quarrel between the two younger ones; it seemed to lighten the mood of the journey.

Tianxiao Sect still lay a great distance from their destination, Fuyun City; even with the strength of Cang Yan and the others, it would take a month to arrive.

That was while they were flying at full speed.

Fortunately, there was still ample time before the Thousand‑Year Demon Flower’s bloom, so Cang Yan and his companions proceeded at a relatively unhurried pace.

As they flew, Yang Kai saw at length the vast abundance of Tongxuan Continent; countless powers of every size rose across the land. Each day many sects were exterminated, yet those forces sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain—cut one down, another would emerge.

Moreover, along the way they encountered several groups of Transcendent Realm masters heading toward Fuyun City; without exception, each of those Transcendent Realm masters had an alchemist at their side.

Whenever they passed one another, both sides were cautious and avoided confrontation.

But as they drew nearer to Fuyun City, the hostility in the air intensified. Cang Yan and the others remained constantly vigilant, taking care to protect Yang Kai, Elder Du, and the rest.

Twenty days later, Yang Kai and the others witnessed a great battle between Transcendent Realm masters.

The two sides were nearly equal in number and strength, each unleashing martial skills and secret treasures with terrifying momentum.

The outcome went unseen; Cang Yan and the others would not meddle in others’ disputes and simply led Yang Kai and the party brazenly through the battlefield.

After witnessing that first clash, such battles among Transcendent Realm masters grew frequent—almost every day they passed scenes of ongoing fights or traces left behind after a battle.

Cang Yan explained that these were contenders heading to Fuyun City who began eliminating rivals along the way to remove potential threats.

Yang Kai’s heart shivered; he more clearly understood the lure the Thousand‑Year Demon Flower held for Transcendent Realm practitioners of the second and third Stages.

Yet what puzzled him was that this event, which stirred the human, yao, and demon races alike, did not seem to attract any Saint Realm masters.

When he voiced this doubt, Cang Yan smiled and said, “Saints will not interfere; it’s an unwritten rule. The Thousand‑Year Demon Flower is only needed by Transcendent Realm practitioners who seek to breakthrough into the Saint Realm. Whether human, yao, or demon, if they want the flower, they must seize it by their own strength.”

“That is one reason,” Elder Du took up the explanation. “There is another, deeper reason as well.”

“Oh? Pray tell.” Cang Yan appeared surprised; he evidently did not know the deeper cause.

Yang Kai and Mi Na listened eagerly; such secrets were irresistible to young cultivators.

“The Thousand‑Year Demon Flower does not seem to be a native product of Tongxuan Continent,” Elder Du said in a low voice.

Fei Yu’s pretty face shifted with astonishment. “Could it be from the starry sky?”

“Yes, it’s said to be so,” Du Wan nodded slightly. “Long ago, a seed fell from the starry sky onto Wangtian Cliff, and there a plant unseen by the world sprouted. A thousand years later it bloomed once and was obtained by someone, revealing its wondrous use. The news spread and the human, yao and demon races were set aflame. Saints are rare everywhere, but the Thousand‑Year Demon Flower can help a Third‑Stage Transcendent break into the Saint Realm. In the next thousand years, Saint Realm masters intervened and a great war ensued; in the end a human champion climbed Wangtian Cliff, but unexpectedly the flower that should have bloomed withered in an instant.”

“Why was that?” everyone asked, faces strange.

“No one knows why. From then on, Saint Realm masters stopped meddling in the flower’s affairs; if a Saint’s aura appears, the Thousand‑Year Demon Flower will not bloom. So now those who go to Wangtian Cliff are basically Transcendent Realm practitioners.”

“How strange.” Li Wan exclaimed.

“A product from the starry sky cannot be explained by ordinary reasoning,” Elder Du said, slowly shaking his head.

“Elder Du, has anyone truly ventured into the starry sky?” Cang Yan frowned and asked. “I’ve heard many rumors of the starry sky, but none can confirm what that world is like.”

“This old man cannot say for certain,” Elder Du smiled faintly. “The demons say that the ancient incomparable Great Demon God successfully fled into the starry sky; there are similar rumors among humans and the yao, but no one truly knows the facts.”

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered, and he said nothing.

Although he knew the Great Demon God had not fled into the starry sky but was long dead, such matters were best left unsaid. The hatred among the human, yao, and demon races ran deep; none wished to implicate the other two, and many secretly hoped to see the others exterminated.
