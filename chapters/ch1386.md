## Chapter 1386 — Flying Shark Battle Shuttle

These people's reactions clearly pleased Lu Ye; even though he knew they had no real sincerity, he did not need any.

What use is flattering and kowtowing before absolute strength?

A faint smile tugged his lips as Lu Ye nodded: "Very well. Since you display such 'sincerity', sparing your lives is not out of the question. But... those who have entered the Saint Realm are out of luck—their strength is too low and useless. Kill them all!"

At his words, every face changed drastically, especially those Saint Realm cultivators, who were thrown into panic—they never imagined that even groveling would not save them, and they immediately began to beg for mercy.

Two Origin Returning Realm cultivators also spoke up nearby, after all these Saint Realm men were their juniors; how could they be slain on a whim?

Lu Ye remained unmoved and said coldly, "Do you need this venerated one to take action personally?"

Cheng and the other Origin Returning Realm man fell silent at that. Remembering just how the middle-aged elder had been cruelly slain, they exchanged a look, steeled themselves, and suddenly Saint Yuan burst forth as they reached out and struck at those Saint Realm cultivators.

With a series of crisp snaps, every one of the Saint Realm men had their skulls shattered—each died a gruesome death on the spot.

"Hm." Lu Ye lightly nodded, satisfied with that, and instructed, "I have a matter I want you to carry out."

"Please command us, Master!" Cheng replied respectfully.

"By whatever means you choose—lure them or snatch them—bring some Origin Returning Realm cultivators to me, their strength must not be weaker than the two of you, and gather more from the Saint King Realm as well."

Hearing this, the Cheng-surnamed man immediately understood Lu Ye's plan—this youth plainly intended to use the same method to gather subordinates—and inwardly felt a dark pleasure, without the slightest resistance.

Human mind is peculiar like that: having been wronged oneself, one is often glad to see others wronged too; it somehow restores balance.

"But Master, where shall we bring those people?" he asked.

"The Xie Family!" Lu Ye said, then produced a Star Shuttle and flew toward the Xie Family headquarters.

Only after he departed did Cheng draw deep breaths; when Lu Ye had tormented him earlier he had thought himself dead, so being left alive now was naturally a relief.

"Brother Cheng, are we really going to take orders from this brat?" the other Origin Returning Realm man asked, staring in the direction Lu Ye had vanished, frowning with obvious reluctance. Although he had been the quickest to pledge his loyalty a moment ago, he still felt a strong aversion in his heart.

After all, Lu Ye's cultivation was a step lower than his, and the Liu Yun Valley he came from was not particularly powerful. What merit had such a man to deserve their loyalty?

"What else can we do? Brother Ren, do you want to try the heart-devouring agony of the Ten-Thousand Poisons?" Cheng shivered as he recalled the torment he had just endured.

The cultivator surnamed Ren's face turned equally ugly as he hesitated, "But that brat..."

"Isn't it strange?" Cheng mused. "By all rights, the Liu Yun Valley shouldn't have such a fiend, yet his methods are beyond comprehension. He bore a strike from the Black Snake Sword without flinching—Brother Ren, do you have the confidence to take a blow from the Black Snake Sword head-on?"

Ren hurriedly shook his head. The Black Snake Sword was the middle-aged elder’s most relied-upon secret treasure, its power immense—he would never dare take a blow from it head-on. Yet Lu Ye had done exactly that. Looking back now, many doubts remained; it was intriguing, but Lu Ye’s strength was clearly considerable.

"If we two fight him alone, we are absolutely no match; he is already so formidable at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and if one day he rises to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—hehe—Brother Ren, surely you understand how pleasant it is to take shelter under a great tree?"

Hearing this, Ren's eyes lit up.

"Besides, our families are not powerful. With the Imperial Garden's emergence, everyone wants a share. If we join with that brat, perhaps we might gain something, and that Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu is too strange—I have never even heard of it; few would know how to dispel it."

"Brother Cheng speaks reasonably. Then we might as well obey him for now—there will be time in the future."

"Indeed, that's what I mean!" Cheng immediately nodded.

With their opinions aligned, they set out to carry out Lu Ye's orders—to lure some Origin Returning Realm cultivators to the Xie Family so Lu Ye could plant the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu.

……

Half a month later, within the stone residence on Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai gazed at the blood-red Star Emperor Token in his hand, a trace of joy appearing in his eyes.

After half a month's refining he had finally integrated that intact Star Emperor Token into his body. He had heard of these one-time secret treasures before—each possessed tremendous power—but because of their limited number of uses, ordinary artificers rarely forged them.

He had never expected that he would obtain one, and a famed Star Emperor Token at that!

Sealed inside was an Imperial-grade divine art; once unleashed it could render its user invincible even against the whole Dark Star. But the consequences were equally severe — an Imperial divine art was no trifle, and if one lacked the strength to break its seal, there was a very real chance of perishing together with one's enemy.

Yang Kai decided he could not unseal it now; even upon reaching the Origin Returning Realm he would need to weigh the matter—perhaps only upon attaining the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would he be qualified to use it.

After merrily toying with it for a while, Yang Kai tucked it into his body. He was about to practice the Golden Blood Threads secret art when his expression shifted and he looked up, astonished.

Shortly after, Yang Kai rose and vanished like a specter within the stone residence, concealing his aura and silently flying out of Dragon Lair Mountain.

It was the dead of night, and Yang Kai had deliberately covered his tracks, so no one on Dragon Lair Mountain noticed his departure.

Half an hour later, on a barren plain roughly two hundred li from Tianyun City, Yang Kai's figure touched down.

Not far off, a graceful figure stood waiting. Spotting him, she lifted her eyelids and, with a helpless look, said, "I knew you couldn't be fooled."

"Nonsense!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "You gave me the token to the mountain-protecting formation; when you opened the formation I naturally detected it!"

It turned out that the one who had snuck out in the middle of the night was Yang Yan!

"What are you doing sneaking out?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"I want to go to a place," Yang Yan did not hide it and answered.

"Where? Why didn't you tell me?" Yang Kai looked at her with displeasure. Right now the area around Tianyun City was a nest of vipers—various powers had moved in to monitor the Imperial Garden, but though the Imperial Garden had been quiet for some time, the cultivators staying nearby could not endure the boredom; many of the old grudges between factions remained.

Daily battles broke out near Tianyun City; every day there were deaths.

Yingyue Hall naturally would not intervene lightly in these rivalries, which only made the situation around Tianyun City grow more chaotic.

Yang Yan going out alone was indeed dangerous, and Yang Kai was of course a little angry.

"Didn't you follow me?" Yang Yan pouted.

"Speak then—where are you sneaking off to?" Yang Kai helplessly asked.

"You'll know when we get there," Yang Yan giggled, then added before Yang Kai could press further, "When we arrive, I might learn many things and perhaps answer many of your questions. Don't ask now—because I don't yet know how to answer you."

Yang Kai frowned, then after a moment nodded: "I'll arrange matters at Dragon Lair Mountain, then we'll depart."

"No need, I've already let Wu Yi and Qian Yue know," Yang Yan said, sticking out her tongue, and Yang Kai finally understood she had not been planning to leave him behind.

He could not help but laugh quietly.

Yang Yan then reached into her Spatial Ring and produced a long shuttle-like secret treasure, lightly tossing it forward.

In an instant, a brilliant radiance burst forth. The long shuttle treasure grew with the wind—within a blink it became one zhang high and three zhang long, hovering silently ahead, looking like a shark.

"This is..." Yang Kai stared in astonishment.

"My improved flying secret treasure—the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle. It's the first time I've used it; it should be rather good." Yang Yan smiled slightly, casually infused Saint Yuan into the shuttle, and with a light sound an entrance suddenly appeared on the craft.

Yang Yan floated in lightly, waved to Yang Kai, and in a turn of her body slipped inside and vanished.

Yang Kai marveled, circled the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle several times, and then followed in.

Once inside, Yang Kai was struck by a sense of wonder; from the outside the shuttle appeared only three zhang long, but entering revealed a world within—it contained several rooms. Although the space was not vast, it was by no means small.

A wave of familiar force fluctuations lingered around Yang Kai.

The power of space!

After a quick probe, Yang Kai found Yang Yan's trail and headed toward it, arriving at a room filled with various formations.

The entire room was steeped in spiritual qi, and circular objects like Saint Crystals were placed in grooves, countless in number.

Origin Saint Crystals!

These were clearly Origin Saint Crystals that only Stone Puppets could condense—an existence a notch above Upper-Level Saint Crystals.

At present Yang Yan was tinkering with a Formation Plate, and Yang Kai leaned over to see that the plate displayed clear routes—flecks of light flickering, somewhat resembling a Star Chart.

Yang Yan, practiced in handling it, selected a point, and the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle gave a slight shudder before shooting forward at breakneck speed.

Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense and, after a quick probe, his expression changed drastically.

He discovered the shuttle's flight speed was several times faster than a Star Shuttle—already at a level of terrifying velocity.

"You had me infuse those things with spatial power so you could refine this?" Yang Kai looked around in amazement.

"Yes."

"You can even produce such a thing?" Yang Kai was genuinely shocked.

This so-called Flying Shark Battle Shuttle was essentially a miniaturized warship, and a very high-grade one.
