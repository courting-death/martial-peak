## Chapter 1782 — What Are You Barking About?

"Heh heh heh heh..." As the three sides were locked in a stalemate, Yang Kai suddenly let out a sly, uncanny laugh.

Zi Long frowned and turned his gaze over, asking with displeasure, "Kid, what are you laughing at?"

Yang Kai merely cast him a cold glance and said nothing.

Zi Long narrowed his eyes, a chill flashing within his pupils.

A mere practitioner of the Origin Returning Realm—how dare he ignore him; he clearly had no idea how high the heavens were or how deep the earth was.

Though Zi Long was annoyed, he could still hold himself back; it was Zi Donglai beside him, face twisted with rage, who barked at Yang Kai, "Kid, didn’t you hear my father ask you a question? Are you deaf?"

Yang Kai glanced at him, put on an act as if he were poking his ear, then flicked away an imaginary bit of earwax in the direction of Zi Long and Zi Donglai, mocking, “He asks a question and I’m supposed to answer? What the hell is he supposed to be? And what the hell are you?”

Yang Kai considered that he had no grudge with Zi Long or Zi Donglai, yet Zi Long had just struck at him outright; had his strength not been formidable, he would have been in serious danger.

The other side was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; for them to act against him was outright bullying the weak, and it had been a sneak attack to boot!

That rankled Yang Kai’s heart, and now Zi Donglai’s arrogant swagger made him despise them all the more.

So Yang Kai was not the least bit polite toward this father and son.

Hearing such insolence, the killing intent in Zi Long’s eyes grew, and Zi Donglai, furious, even sneered, "Fine, you’ve got nerve! It’s been a long time since this Young Master has met someone this audacious. Wait for me—half an hour from now, this Young Master will personally take your life!"

"Zi Donglai, is it?" Yang Kai shot him a sidelong look, contempt written all over his face. "Ever heard a saying, by the way?"

"What?" Zi Donglai sneered coldly at Yang Kai.

"Dogs that bite... don’t bark. Loudmouths like you usually don’t bite!" Yang Kai chuckled.

"Are you insulting me?" Zi Donglai’s face suddenly hardened, his tone low and deadly.

“So what if I insult you!” Yang Kai burst into wild laughter, eyes gleaming with madness. He threw him a string of mocking looks, gesturing provocatively as he goaded, “Come on then—hit me! Go ahead, if you’ve got the guts, kill me, fool!”

Zi Donglai felt as if his lungs would burst from fury.

As the Young Master of Purple Star, his status was exalted. His cultivation was no joke; wherever he went people hailed him like a star around which all others revolved. A single command from him could ensure that an offender wouldn’t live to see the next sunrise.

He had never been taunted like this and felt powerless to respond.

At any other time he would have charged over to teach Yang Kai a lesson. But here—within the Medicine Valley covered by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light—no matter how much he wanted to humiliate Yang Kai or vent his rage, it remained only in his thoughts.

He lacked the ability to get past that Seven Luminaries Divine Light and reach Yang Kai.

He had never encountered anything so infuriating; he felt an unbearable vexation, itching to rush forward and give Yang Kai a ruthless beating.

Zi Donglai fixed Yang Kai with a venomous, hateful stare, spitting out his anger.

"You dumbass!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, spitting in the direction of Zi Donglai and Zi Long with utter disdain.

"Just you wait—half an hour from now I’ll make you feel what it means to cross this Young Master!" Zi Donglai bellowed viciously.

"All you can do is bark?" Yang Kai sneered at him.

Zi Donglai’s face darkened with anger, as if he still wanted to speak, but Zi Long shot him a glare and said coolly, “Why waste words on him? In half an hour, he’ll be a dead man. What’s the point of talking so much to a corpse?”

Zi Donglai’s heart jolted; realizing his father was displeased with his earlier behavior, he quickly adopted a humbled air and nodded assent. He no longer wasted breath on Yang Kai, but his expression grew even more vicious as he plotted how to deal with Yang Kai in half an hour and avenge his humiliation.

Nearby, Xu Wei laughed out loud and clapped his hands, "Interesting, very interesting—kid, you are indeed fascinating. I find myself suddenly very interested in you."

He had been watching coldly from not far off. Seeing Yang Kai offend Zi Long and Zi Donglai without fear, seeming utterly heedless of death, secretly pleased him but also made him think Yang Kai’s head was a little off.

Didn’t he know that once the Seven Luminaries Divine Light faded he would surely die? And with his earlier curses and taunts, Zi Long would not simply kill him outright—he would torture him properly.

This fellow was simply making trouble for himself; if he could have swallowed his pride and left when the Seven Luminaries Divine Light subsided, he might have preserved his life, but now...

Xu Wei looked at Yang Kai as if at a dead man.

"So? Young man, interested in teaming up with me?" Xu Wei asked with a smile.

"Work with you?" Yang Kai looked at Xu Wei and spat, "Not interested. This Young Master hasn't forgotten how you treated me before."

"Young man, watch your tongue." Xu Wei’s face darkened; Yang Kai calling himself ‘Young Master’ before him was practically an insult.

"Someone like you—why would I help?" Yang Kai sneered.

Seeing Yang Kai clash with Xu Wei too, Zi Donglai beamed. He, with the weakest strength among the three parties, thought Yang Kai was foolish for not biding his time—so arrogant, offending one side and then another; it was a one-way ticket to death.

How could such an unobservant person possibly have cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?

"Elder Xu, this kid seems to look down on you," Zi Donglai taunted while stirring trouble on the side.

Xu Wei frowned and ignored Zi Donglai; Zi Long’s presence made him extremely wary, and he didn’t want to follow Zi Donglai’s lead and fall into any trap.

Besides, if he wanted to seize the Wudao Flower later, he couldn’t do it alone. Although Yang Kai seemed reckless, he had just fended off Zi Long’s attack—his strength was not to be underestimated. Perhaps he could use that to slow Zi Long for a moment; with an instant of opportunity, Xu Wei could snatch a Wudao Flower and then flee.

He couldn’t beat Zi Long, but escaping should be no problem.

"Forget it, I won’t bother quarreling with you," Xu Wei waved magnanimously, still regarding Yang Kai, "Actually, there wasn’t much feud between us—just some misunderstandings before."

"Misunderstanding?" Yang Kai chuckled, "That’s quite a big misunderstanding."

Xu Wei furrowed his brows and feigned sincerity, "Kid, in a place like this, everyone looks out for themselves—that’s normal. I was wrong in my previous actions; if you want to pursue it, I can compensate you."

He mentioned it lightly, without specifying what kind of compensation he intended to offer, then went on, “But let’s set that matter aside for now. This old man wishes to cooperate with you—what do you say?”

"How would that work?" Yang Kai asked casually while dispelling the medicine’s effect in his body.

“Simple. In a moment, you and I will join forces and exchange a few moves with this master of Purple Star. You should know how precious the Wudao Flower is—if we don’t work together, neither of us will get it, and we’ll only let others take advantage,” Xu Wei said gravely.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and did not answer immediately, appearing to consider the offer.

Zi Long’s eyes flashed with keen light as he regarded Xu Wei coldly, "Xu Wei, you’re presumptuous—do you think pairing with this kid will let you snatch the Wudao Flower from me!"

Xu Wei laughed loudly, "Whether we can snatch it remains to be seen. Five Wudao Flowers are right there; I’m not about to let the chance slip. This is something worth fighting for even at the cost of my life!"

"Very well—then I’ll watch and see if you and this kid can achieve your goal." Zi Long’s expression was indifferent; after saying that he closed his eyes, appearing unmoved by anything outside.

"Kid, have you made up your mind?" Xu Wei urged Yang Kai, "Look around—you know there are many strange herbs here besides the Wudao Flower. There’s a Tianying Grass—do you know what Tianying Grass is used for? It can be used to refine a Void King Pill; if you obtain it, your chances of advancing to the Void King Realm in the future will greatly increase. There are also several Questioning Heart Orchids, which are excellent for tempering one’s mind. You’re young and have advanced so far; your mind must be unstable—those orchids are rare treasures for you. If we succeed, I’ll only request one Wudao Flower; everything else we obtain will be yours. Isn’t that sincere enough?"

"That is sincere enough!" Yang Kai nodded.

"So you accept?" Xu Wei smiled.

Yang Kai shook his head.

Xu Wei’s face darkened and he snapped, "Kid, are you mocking me?"

Yang Kai chuckled coldly. “Old fool, do you really take this Young Master for an idiot? You think flapping your lips a few times will be enough to bewitch me into doing your bidding? Use your head for once, will you? You’ve lived all these years in vain—this Young Master has never seen anyone as brainless as you!”

Saying this, Yang Kai shook his head and sighed as if in grief.

Xu Wei’s face had gone ashen from the direct insults, his gaze burning with fury. Like Zi Donglai, he wished he could rush over and beat Yang Kai to vent his hatred.

Now it was Zi Donglai’s turn to burst out laughing. “Elder Xu, this brat really doesn’t know life from death. You’d best not waste your breath on him.”

“What are you barking about?” Yang Kai turned to him again, his tongue sharp and hissing venom. “Could you shut your mouth and be a dog that actually bites? You never learn a thing. If I were your father, I’d have strangled you when you were born—being able to sire such a stupid son, your old man can’t have been much better.”
