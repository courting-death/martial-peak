## Chapter 864 — Time to Teach Them a Lesson

From the Small Xuan Realm, nearly a thousand ancient demons poured out and scattered across this vast snowy expanse.

Not far off, Xueli stood alert with Yu Mo, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others, curiosity and wariness etched on their faces—no one knew where this crowd had come from.

Suddenly, heaven-and-earth energy churned, and those who had emerged from the Small Xuan Realm began to radiate varying degrees of a sucking force, ravenously devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

In an instant, the Spiritual Qi within a radius of over ten li was drained dry.

Energy from farther afield surged in to replenish the void, only to be absorbed by the ancient demons.

The sky twisted with shifting clouds and winds, and a dreadful might bore down from above.

Everyone’s faces changed.

But the ancient demons all broke into delighted expressions, opening themselves to receive the baptism of that heavenly might.

Wu Jie watched with peculiar astonishment before blurtedly shouting, “They’re breaking through?”

The scene and its commotion were unmistakable signs of imminent breakthroughs; and it wasn’t just one or two—among nearly a thousand, well over half stood on the brink of advancing.

The rest of them likewise experienced sudden surges in their power.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted as memories came flooding back—when he first arrived on the Tongxuan Continent from his world, his strength had also leapt in a single instant.

Once the invisible shackles sealing them were smashed and the land’s nourishment flowed in, realms and cultivation naturally rose.

The situation these Ancient Demon Clan members faced now was probably much like his own when he had broken through.

Looking around, Yang Kai realized with some surprise that the biggest commotion among those breaking through came from Han Fei and Hua Mo.

The two leaders had been experts at the First Stage of the Saint Realm and had pushed their cultivation to the limit; if they broke through now, they would ascend to the Second Stage.

A Saint Realm expert’s breakthrough was no trivial matter.

The two immediately moved with speed to retreat, so the heavenly might their breakthroughs produced wouldn’t affect the clan.

Yang Kai glanced anxiously at Li Rong and was surprised to find the beauty radiantly flush—her eyes bright; she had clearly grown stronger upon leaving the Small Xuan Realm and setting foot here.

Yinya and Xueji showed the same signs.

“Lady Li…” Yang Kai called softly at her side. “Shouldn’t the clan spread out a bit?”

There were simply too many attempting breakthroughs; the collective heavenly might made even him uneasy. If they didn’t spread out it could easily cause casualties.

But with powerful enemies lurking nearby, scattering might not be wise.

“No need,” Li Rong shook her head slowly. “Master, have you forgotten our clan’s greatest asset? Han Fei and Hua Mo have already gone. As long as the heavenly might from their breakthroughs doesn’t affect our people, no one will be harmed.”

Hearing her, Yang Kai suddenly remembered: the Ancient Demon Clan’s biggest advantage was their astonishing physical constitution.

For fighters of the same level, the Ancient Demon Clan’s bodies were far superior to nearly any other people.

Moreover, they could unfold Demon Marks to toughen their bodies further.

Enduring the baptism of heavenly might required precisely such formidable physiques.

With Li Rong utterly unconcerned, Yang Kai relaxed.

“And the bigger issue now isn’t our people’s breakthroughs—Master, that woman must be one of the current demon generals, correct?” Li Rong looked toward Xueli and asked.

“Yes, a Third Stage Saint Realm expert.”

“Not bad,” Li Rong chuckled, appraising Xueli. “At least our clan hasn’t degenerated too far.”

At the same time, Yu Mo frowned beside Xueli and asked, “Lady, what should we do? Judging by how they are, many look ready to break through—should we…”

Xueli shook her head slowly. “They are demons of our kind. Though I don’t know why they’re with that human brat, if we strike now we may provoke their hatred. Let them finish, then question them. If possible, bring them back to Sand City. Four at the First Stage, one at the Second Stage…a formidable force. If we can recruit them, Sand City’s strength would tower over the other three.”

“As you say!” Yu Mo bowed his head and fell silent.

There were many of these suddenly appearing demons and a great number of experts; if they could be brought under her banner, they would be a tremendous boon, leaving the forces of the other three demon generals far inferior.

“They don’t seem intent on stopping our clan,” Li Rong observed toward Xueli with a small smile.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “That woman probably thinks you aren’t a threat, so she doesn’t care if you break through.”

“Then she’s in for a surprise,” Li Rong said meaningfully.

Yang Kai looked at her, noting the confident spark in her eyes and feeling intrigued.

He had never seen Li Rong fight; he only knew her cultivation roughly matched the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—one tier below Xueli.

Yet from the tone of her words, she clearly did not regard Xueli with any respect.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and grew quietly expectant.

He was eager to see what would happen if these two women clashed.

Hundreds of clan members were breaking through while others watched with calm.

The atmosphere across the snowy mountains grew eerie and tense.

Rumbling and cracking sounds filled the sky...

The dreadful heavenly might descended like rows of fang-like serpents, striking the crowd with brutal force.

Groans of pain rose as many of those attempting breakthroughs were wounded in the first wave, blood seeping from their mouths.

Had any of them broken alone, their bodies’ quality would have shielded them from such harm. But gathered en masse, the heavenly might became terrifying beyond measure.

Even when spread among several, some still showed signs of being unable to withstand it.

Yet those injured only laughed, defiant and proud; their flesh writhed and, unguarded, they stared at the sky expecting the next wave, eyes alight with anticipation, as if they wished the heavenly might to strike harder.

Wu Jie had long since moved far away, fearing being implicated.

Yang Kai flew to his side and watched quietly.

“Madmen…” Wu Jie’s lips twitched. “These people are insane—who endures the baptism of heavenly might like this? They’re courting death!”

“Not necessarily,” Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head.

“Do you really think they can stand it, Saint Lord? Some were hurt in the first round; I can’t imagine they’ll hold out. They should spread out and ascend individually—why gather like this? I don’t understand.”

“Ordinary demons might not withstand it, but these are not ordinary demons,” Yang Kai said with a wry laugh.

Wu Jie frowned, more baffled than before.

Aren’t demons just demons—how can there be ordinary and extraordinary ones?

Rumbling continued...

Heavenly might kept hammering down like catastrophe, repeatedly injuring the ancient demons.

But they acted like lunatics— the more they bled, the more exhilarated they grew; under the night, each pair of eyes shimmered with feral light, fierce as wolves, terrifying to behold.

Disciples from Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall watched in horror; even Zhang Ao and Cao Guan felt their hearts tremble.

The spectacle of hundreds breaking through together was truly magnificent.

From afar two other locations also erupted with earth-shattering commotions.

Those were the bursts caused by Han Fei and Hua Mo—their breakthroughs were no less terrifying.

Xueli’s eyes gleamed with delight; she grew ever more determined to bring this group under her command.

Each person here, regardless of cultivation or age, exuded the purest demonic aura—brutal, bloody, ruthless.

Xueli admired them greatly.

She thought to herself that this was the true face of the demons.

Unable to hide her excitement, Xueli shouted across, “Woman—what is your name? Where did you all come from?”

Li Rong smiled gently and parted her lips: “Are you speaking to me?”

“Yes.” Xueli nodded solemnly. “This Lord is Xueli, one of the Four Great Demon Generals of today. Tell me your name and your origins!”

As a fellow demon and one whose cultivation sat a tier higher, Xueli’s manner was naturally imperious.

“If you are a Demon General, can’t you tell where my clan comes from?” Li Rong flicked her sleeve and turned slightly, radiating composed grace.

Xueli frowned in displeasure. “Should I be able to tell?”

Li Rong gave a light laugh. “‘This Lord, this Lord’… even a Demon General dares to call herself ‘This Lord’ in front of me? Has today’s demon race truly forgotten its ancient history?”

At her words, everyone’s expressions shifted oddly.

Xueli sneered coldly at Li Rong, her face hostile.

She was clearly angered.

The reason she hadn’t stopped this clan’s ascension was that she considered them kin and hoped to recruit them; she didn’t expect their apparent leader to speak so brazenly.

Only the Demon Lord could speak to Xueli like that!

Sometimes even the Demon Lord’s words held little sway over her.

“Don’t mistake my desire for talent as weakness,” Xueli snorted coldly. “If you weren’t demons, I’d have struck long ago—how dare you be so brazen before me? A mere Second Stage Saint Realm—teach her a lesson!”

Li Rong’s lovely face also darkened coldly. “Indeed, it’s about time we taught you a proper lesson. Though my clan has not appeared for thousands of years, I didn’t expect that even fellow Demons like you would have forgotten… Today, as my clan returns to this world, I’ll use you as a sacrifice to mark the occasion—and to remind you of your place!”

Xueli’s eyes narrowed, and she shouted sternly, “Who in the world are you?”
