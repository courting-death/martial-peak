## Chapter 2128 — Make a Bet

"Little Xueting, how about we make a bet!" At that moment, Wen Zishan suddenly sent a voice transmission.

"What are we betting on?" Gao Xueting turned her head to look in that direction.

"Let's bet on which of those two will win!" Wen Zishan smiled slightly, pointing downward.

"And the stakes?" Gao Xueting asked coldly.

"Hmm, let me think..." Wen Zishan appeared thoughtful. "Ah, that's right. Little Xueting, haven't you always wanted to train in the Life and Death Gate? If you win, this Lord will allow you to go."

"Are you serious?" Gao Xueting's beautiful eyes narrowed as she called out.

Nearby, Chen Qian's expression changed at the words 'Life and Death Gate.'

"When has this Lord ever... lied to you?" Wen Zishan asked with a harmless smile.

Gao Xueting stared intently at Wen Zishan, as if trying to see into his heart. But he maintained that gentle, dazzling smile. After a while, Gao Xueting finally looked away and said, "It's true, you may be lazy, irresponsible, lacking in proper conduct, and have none of the bearing of a Sect Master..."

Wen Zishan's face darkened at her words, his mouth twitching. "Hearing your evaluation, this Lord feels... completely useless!"

Gao Xueting changed her tone. "But you really haven't lied to anyone!"

"Is that my only redeeming quality..." Wen Zishan looked dejected.

"Then if you win, what do you want?" Gao Xueting asked coldly.

Wen Zishan chuckled, his bright gaze sweeping over Gao Xueting several times.

She felt uncomfortable under his gaze, her face reddening slightly. She snorted, "Put away those filthy thoughts and ideas, or I'll gouge your eyes out."

"What are you imagining..." Wen Zishan chuckled. "Alright then, how about this—if I win, you agree to one small request of mine. It won't violate your principles, and it won't be anything excessive!"

"What kind of small request?" Gao Xueting asked warily.

"Well... I haven't thought of it yet. I'll tell you when I do, alright?" Wen Zishan laughed it off.

"Sister Gao, don't fall for it! The Hall Master is always scheming, who knows what he's plotting." Chen Qian kindly reminded her, afraid Gao Xueting would impulsively fall into Wen Zishan's trap.

"I know!" Gao Xueting nodded, then glanced downward. "But he has to win this bet first, otherwise it doesn't matter."

She nodded to Wen Zishan. "Alright, I agree."

"It's a deal!" Wen Zishan laughed. "No backing out."

"You'd better get my pass for the Life and Death Gate ready!"

Chen Qian sighed helplessly. Although she didn't think Yang Kai could defeat Xue Yi, who ranked fifteenth among Dao Origin Realm cultivators in Qingyang Shrine, she still felt uneasy—despite the Hall Master's usual unseriousness, he was reliable at critical moments.

Chen Qian didn't believe Wen Zishan would really let Gao Xueting enter the Life and Death Gate. So he must be very confident in this bet.

Thinking this, she quickly looked down.

Below, Xue Yi looked at the approaching Yang Kai with a sneer. "Wouldn't it be easier to just lie down? Why come out? You're courting death!"

"Friend, you're quite underhanded. I've learned a lot!" Yang Kai snorted.

Just then, a voice sounded in his ear: "Kid, do your best and knock your opponent down. This Lord can promise you one request that isn't too much!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai was stunned.

Because the voice was clearly that of Wen Zishan, Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine!

He had met Wen Zishan just a few days earlier, so he recognized the voice. Besides, in the main hall of Qingyang Shrine no one would dare impersonate the Hall Master to send such a transmission.

In other words, the sender had to be Wen Zishan himself.

"What is this?" Yang Kai frowned, releasing his Divine Sense to scan the surroundings, but found no trace of Wen Zishan.

A sect head secretly sending a message to an outsider, urging him to beat the sect's own elite disciple—if Yang Kai weren't experiencing it, he wouldn't have believed it.

And... Wen Zishan even promised he could grant a modest request?

What does that mean?

Even with Yang Kai's cleverness, he couldn't figure it out.

At that moment, a fierce attack descended.

"What are you thinking about? Facing a powerful enemy and you dare to get distracted... Don't underestimate me!" Xue Yi's words came with his attack—a wild punch, its force swirling like a vortex, as if to destroy everything in its path.

"A powerful enemy?" Yang Kai suddenly looked up, his cold eyes fixed on Xue Yi with disdain. Facing that earth-shattering blow, he didn't dodge or evade, but met it head-on with his own punch.

Boom...

A loud explosion rang out, shaking the sky.

The ground beneath them collapsed, forming a huge round pit as the earth cracked in all directions, spiderweb-like fissures spreading everywhere.

A series of sharp, sizzling hisses tore through the air...

At the clash of their fists, their Origin Qi collided, producing a piercing sound.

The surrounding stones and dirt were affected, floating weightlessly into the air. Within a hundred zhang, space warped repeatedly.

"Not bad!" Xue Yi raised his thick eyebrows in surprise as he looked at Yang Kai, now close by.

Earlier, he had sent Yang Kai flying with a punch, thinking his opponent was nothing special. But after this real exchange, he realized Yang Kai was strong. Even though he was a Stage lower, he wasn't so easy to defeat.

Not far away, Xiao Baiyi also showed a look of astonishment, his expression changing slightly.

"You're not bad either... with your mouth!" Yang Kai retorted, his lips curling in a mocking smile.

As he spoke, he swung his other fist in an arc at Xue Yi's cheek.

Xue Yi was unfazed, snorted coldly, and raised his arm to block. Without pausing, he flicked his arm, taking advantage of Yang Kai's attack to launch another offensive.

Yang Kai reacted quickly, turning his fist into a palm and blocking in front of his neck. As Xue Yi's attack arrived, he gripped fiercely, as if trying to crush his fist.

"Naive!" Xue Yi sneered, leaning back slightly. His foot, rooted to the ground, shot out like a cannonball, kicking straight at Yang Kai's abdomen.

Yang Kai's elbow dropped sharply, neutralizing the attack before it could land!

The two exchanged blows at lightning speed, testing, attacking, and countering in close combat.

Their movements were fluid and unpatterned, dazzling to watch and truly impressive!

Xiao Baiyi's eyes finally grew serious.

Although he ranked second in the sect's martial competitions, if he fought Xue Yi in close combat like this, he would definitely lose. Yet Yang Kai was evenly matched with Xue Yi...

In other words, in the domain of close combat, his level was the same as Xue Yi's.

What Xiao Baiyi couldn't accept was that Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—a Stage lower than Xue Yi and two Stages lower than himself.

Where did this guy come from? He and Xue Yi were both elite disciples of Qingyang Shrine.

Bang bang bang...

In front of the palace, the two figures weaved and clashed, not using Secret Treasures or secret techniques, only their bodies and Origin Qi. The wild fighting style was mesmerizing.

The ground was pitted with deep holes, the void collapsed under the violent power, and the battlefield shifted repeatedly. The entire lonely peak was a ruin.

"Sister Gao..." Chen Qian was stunned. Though shocked at having underestimated Yang Kai, she was more worried about the bet between Gao Xueting and that shameless Hall Master. If Yang Kai really won, with the Hall Master's twisted sense of humor, who knows what embarrassing thing he'd make Gao Xueting do.

"Damn, I misjudged!" Gao Xueting gritted her teeth, glaring fiercely at Wen Zishan, who was leisurely drinking wine and eating spirit fruit, looking completely confident. Her already frustrated mood grew worse.

"Think you're sure to win?" Gao Xueting muttered coldly. "In that case, don't blame me for using my trump card!"

With that, she focused downward, her Divine Sense stirring.

Below, Xue Yi, who was fighting fiercely with Yang Kai, suddenly showed a look of terror and cried out, "No!"

In that instant, he seemed to be greatly shocked, his whole face filled with fear.

Yang Kai didn't care what had happened to him, and punched him squarely in the face.

Xue Yi let out a strange cry, his body flying like a broken kite. Blood streamed from his nose as he crashed heavily to the ground.

"Huh?" Xiao Baiyi stared in surprise, unable to understand what had happened to Xue Yi in that moment, to be hit head-on by Yang Kai when they were evenly matched.

"Looks like that did more harm than good!" Wen Zishan hovered in the void, giving Gao Xueting a gloating smile.

Gao Xueting snorted coldly. "Enough nonsense, just wait and see!"

Wen Zishan’s jab fell flat, but he didn’t mind in the slightest—he’d always been thick-skinned and shameless anyway.

On the other side, Xue Yi slowly got up, wiped under his nose, and sneered, "I don't want to be locked up for half a year... Hei Gu Peak is no place for people..."

"What nonsense are you spouting? Got punched silly?" Yang Kai squinted at him.

"I just want to say... you're finished!" Xue Yi's eyes flashed with extreme danger, his whole body shining. "I only meant to teach you a lesson, but now... I might accidentally kill you!"

As he spoke, the light on his body flared, accompanied by a thunderous roar. His exposed skin and flesh became like cast iron, gleaming with a metallic sheen.
