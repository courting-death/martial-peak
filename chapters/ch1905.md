## Chapter 1905 — Long Tianshang

If he had even a single Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert at his command, combined with Zuo De's status as a Void King-Grade alchemist, then it would mean he alone was supreme across the entire Star Domain!

Zuo De was inevitably stirred. Although he suspected it might be a trap set by Yang Kai, his confidence in his own alchemy compelled him to want to accept on the spot.

"Yang Kai!" Xue Yue cried out, as if trying to dissuade him, but Yang Kai raised a hand to stop her.

He fixed his gaze on Zuo De and said calmly, "This Yang is of no great talent, but I now have the cultivation of a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and I am at the height of my strength — living for a few thousand years should be no problem. I'll serve as your bodyguard for one thousand years; time-wise that's more than sufficient. I only wonder whether Master dares accept this wager."

Ai Ou was moved; many of the alchemists were moved — all were shocked by Yang Kai's astonishing proposal.

Zuo De's expression shifted for a moment before he inclined his head and said, "What you say is correct — this proposal does stir me! But merely acting as a bodyguard is not enough; I want you to obey my every command!"

Ai Ou's face darkened; he looked deeply displeased.

Void King Realm experts were all towering figures; even when they suppressed their airs before Zuo De, it was out of respect. For Ai Ou, Yang Kai offering to serve as Zuo De’s bodyguard for a thousand years was already an astonishing—almost unbearable—proposal, one he himself could never agree to under any circumstances.

Yet Zuo De was not satisfied; he even demanded that Yang Kai obey him unquestioningly.

That was no longer merely a bodyguard — that was a servant!

A bodyguard only needed to be responsible for protecting Zuo De's personal safety; a servant was different. A servant had to carry out every order he was given, completely foregoing his own dignity.

It was an insult to Void King Realm experts! A contemptuous slight!

Ai Ou was also a Void King Realm expert, and, like Yang Kai, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator; he could sympathize with Yang Kai's position and inevitably felt anger welling up.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, agreed without a moment of hesitation.

Zuo De apparently had not expected Yang Kai to agree so readily — he had thought the other party would haggle. His proposal had been intended to squeeze out as many advantages as possible; he had even quickly thought up several backup schemes, such as forcing Yang Kai to obey his commands unconditionally for a set number of times...

But to his surprise there was no leverage to be had. He was momentarily stunned, then quickly opened his mouth: "One thousand years is not enough — two thousand!"

"Fine!" Yang Kai agreed again without a moment's thought.

"Master Zuo De!" Ai Ou suddenly thundered. "Isn't this proposal a bit too much?"

He could no longer suppress his anger. Zuo De's tardy arrival in Shuitian City had already been bad enough; using Xue Yue's marriage as leverage was worse; and now he had the gall to raise the term from one thousand years to two thousand.

Two thousand years of bondage — who could bear that?

Ai Ou could not.

In any case, Yang Kai's suggestion to compete in alchemy with Zuo De had been made for Gu Bihu's sake. Ai Ou did not know why Yang Kai had done this, but he was grateful; whether the plan succeeded or not, he would owe Yang Kai a monumental favor.

Which Second Stage of the Void King Realm would willingly trade away one or two thousand years of freedom for such a thing?

Only this person would!

So he stepped forward without hesitation, changing his earlier stance and castigating Zuo De.

If he lacked that boldness and decisiveness, he did not deserve to be chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Zuo De sneered, "He agreed himself — Chairman Ai Ou, why are you in such a hurry?"

Yang Kai smiled faintly at Ai Ou and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, calm yourself. Although I agreed to two thousand years, whether Master can live that long is another matter."

Those words were, in a way, a curse that Zuo De might die sooner rather than later. Zuo De was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator and had already lived many years; otherwise he would not have become a Void King-Grade alchemist. The future two thousand years were indeed a long road for him.

Zuo De's face darkened and he snorted coldly, "Rest assured — for the sake of today's wager, I will strive to live through the two thousand-year term."

"Let's hope so," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Ai Ou sighed, then raised a hand and patted Yang Kai's shoulder. "Brother Yang, from now on we are brothers. I will remember what you have done today."

"Heh..." Yang Kai's mouth twitched. From deep within his heart a tangle of emotions welled up, like an overturned spice shop — every flavor rushing in at once; he couldn't tell whether to feel joy or sorrow.

He quickly changed the subject, saying, "My stake has already been set. Master, what will yours be?"

Zuo De's face turned cold as he asked, "What do you think I should set as my stake?"

Yang Kai smiled slightly, "My stake is my personal freedom. Given that, for fairness' sake, shouldn't Master do the same?"

Zuo De frowned and did not answer immediately.

"What? Master don't dare accept? Do you lack confidence in your alchemy, thinking you'll lose to me?" Yang Kai prodded from the side.

"Ridiculous!" Zuo De's fury flared. "In the art of pill-refinement I will not lose to anyone — goading won't work on me!"

"Tsk tsk..." Yang Kai clicked his tongue mockingly. "Master is a bit poor at losing, isn't he? Fine, fine — since you are so resentful I will not ask you to stake years of your personal freedom. Here's how it will be: during Master’s life, produce one hundred Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills for me each year."

"One hundred per year?" Zuo De's face darkened with anger. "Don't you think that's a bit greedy?"

Zong Ao, who had been standing at the side the whole time, said coldly, "Master, you are wrong. Yang Kai is staking two thousand years of his personal freedom; he is a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert — shouldn't Master put up an equivalent stake? One hundred Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills per year may mean little to Master, but two thousand years of freedom is a heavy burden for Yang Kai. You are a respected elder; are you going to hide behind your age and refuse?"

Zong Ao had watched the whole affair and could no longer restrain himself.

As a fellow alchemist, he had held some contempt for Zuo De's character, yet still showed him respect as a master; but now he saw that the old man's character was worse than he had imagined — in comparison Yang Kai's personal magnetism seemed boundless.

The last shred of respect Zong Ao had for Zuo De vanished.

Hearing Zong Ao's words, Zuo De remained unmoved and sneered, "In my view his personal freedom is worthless. But my one hundred Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills each year — people would break their heads over them; how many would die for that!"

"Hmm...there's some truth in that," Yang Kai unexpectedly nodded in agreement. "Then I won't ask for a hundred per year — how about eighty?"

"Fifty, anything more is out of the question!" Zuo De waved his hand.

"Seventy-five..."

"Fifty-five!"

"Seventy!"

"Sixty!"

"Deal!"

Under everyone's stunned gaze, after a swift round of haggling the two men finally fixed the figure at sixty Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills per year.

Although it was a little less than Yang Kai's original demand, sixty Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills a year was still unimaginable wealth. In the entire Star Domain, any single Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill was worth fighting and dying for.

Only a master like Zuo De could casually toss out sums of a hundred or sixty without batting an eye...

"You brat!" With the terms settled, Zuo De showed a feral glint, sneering at Yang Kai, "This wager between us was made in front of Chairman Ai Ou and all these Origin-Grade alchemists. If you lose and dare refuse to honor it..."

"Don't worry — Chairman Ai Ou's reputation spans the Star Domain and he acts fairly, not like some who deceive and steal fame," Yang Kai said with a smiling suggestion. "I ask him to be the arbiter; if either of us dares to refuse to own up, let Chairman Ai Ou execute them on the spot!"

Zuo De's face could not help but change; a flicker of fear shone in his eyes.

As a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, if Ai Ou truly wanted him dead he might not survive until morning.

After a moment's thought he said gravely, "I'm not questioning Chairman Ai Ou's character, but...you are also a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, equal in cultivation to Chairman Ai Ou. If you wanted to flee, Chairman Ai Ou might not be able to stop you."

Ai Ou's face cooled and he was about to speak when a subtle ripple of energy rose in the void, and a figure suddenly materialized.

The man wore a smile that warmed like spring; his hair and beard were white, yet his complexion was ruddy and bright, making him appear almost youthful. A sheathed long sword hung across his back; he stood straight-backed, and the whole man felt like a concealed razor — formidable and awe-inspiring.

He walked down step by step from the sky with his hands behind his back and smiled, "If Ai Ou cannot stop him, I will personally intervene. Master Zuo De, what do you think of that?"

At the sound of his voice everyone turned to look; when Ai Ou saw his face he was startled and cupped his fists in salute, "Uncle Long, what brings you here?"

"Uncle Long..." the words fell from lips around him.

Ai Ou's form of address made everyone understand the newcomer's identity.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild's sole Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert, a figure at the pinnacle of the Star Domain — Long Tianshang!

The Purple Star had Kuang Shizong to hold court; the Hengluo Commerce Guild had Long Tianshang — both were mighty existences that struck terror across the cosmos.

But in terms of renown Long Tianshang's name carried far more weight. A thousand years ago, when he had just advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, for reasons unknown he went to a Cultivation Star and slaughtered dozens of sects and forces; for tens of millions of li around that star blood ran in rivers and corpses piled like mountains, turning it into a living hell.

That battle spread Long Tianshang's infamy far and wide — whenever people in the Star Domain spoke his name they changed color.
