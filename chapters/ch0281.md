## Chapter 281 — Eating from Both the Pot and the Bowl

Meng Wuya and Xiao Fusheng argued for most of the day, and in the end, it was unclear what kind of agreement they reached, but both old fellows emerged with smiles on their faces.

Xiao Fusheng immediately went to prepare for the opening of Wan Yao Pool, allowing Xia Ningshang to comprehend the way of alchemy in front of the image of Dan Sheng.

Opening Wan Yao Pool was a costly affair, as each time required a significant investment of pills to imbue the image of Dan Sheng with unfathomable mysteries, enabling comprehension.

The number of pills invested each time had to be at least around a hundred. The more precious the pills, the longer the energy from the image of Dan Sheng would be sustained.

Because of the material costs, even Yao Wang Valley could not open it many times in a year. Each opening was either for the elders of the peaks to comprehend or for the elite disciples below the peaks.

Aside from those in Yao Wang Valley, other alchemists from the outside world could only seek to comprehend the way of alchemy in front of the image of Dan Sheng through the alchemy conference.

Every five years, the alchemy conference attracted countless alchemists.

All the pills refined by these alchemists during the conference, regardless of quality or quantity, would be thrown into Wan Yao Pool to open the forbidden ground, allowing the top fifty from the alchemy conference to share in the legacy of Dan Sheng.

Over these thousands of years, Wan Yao Pool had consumed countless pills.

Thus, it was named Wan Yao Pool!

The connection and mysteries between Wan Yao Pool and the image of Dan Sheng had been explored many times by Yao Wang Valley throughout the generations, yet they had never grasped the key.

Here had become the sacred ground in the hearts of all alchemists! The image of Dan Sheng was a treasure that alchemists yearned to see. Many dedicated their lives just to sit quietly for a moment in front of the image of Dan Sheng.

Upon learning that Wan Yao Pool would soon be opened for Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai's thoughts immediately became lively.

Although he could not personally accompany Xia Ningshang to Wan Yao Pool, he could send the Earth Demon to investigate the situation.

After ensuring everything was foolproof, Yang Kai found Xia Ningshang and handed her the Soul-Breaking Spike and the Earth Demon, along with borrowing Dong Qingyan's ancient jade that could shield one's aura.

Without this ancient jade, the evil aura of the Earth Demon would be exposed before experts in the Divine Roaming Realm.

Two days later, everything was in order. Xiao Fusheng personally took Xia Ningshang to Dan Sheng Peak, heading towards Wan Yao Pool.

Meng Wuya shamelessly insisted on witnessing the event, but was ruthlessly rejected by Xiao Fusheng.

Even Meng Wuya was not allowed close, which showed how much Yao Wang Valley valued the forbidden ground.

On the day Xia Ningshang went to Wan Yao Pool, Meng Wuya, feeling bored, took the opportunity to find Yang Kai for a heart-to-heart talk.

During their conversation, Shopkeeper Meng incessantly told Yang Kai how much Su Yan had lost weight and looked haggard during his absence, how she missed someone, and how Jie Hongchen was relentlessly pursuing her, all while secretly observing Yang Kai's reactions.

After listening, Yang Kai chuckled lightly, "Shopkeeper Meng, let's not beat around the bush. Are you worried I might take advantage of Junior Sister?"

Meng Wuya's expression faltered, not expecting Yang Kai to be so thick-skinned and direct. He forced a smile and said, "Little Yang Kai, I have watched you grow up. I know you wouldn't be so beastly, right? Ningshang is still young and innocent, easily deceived... cough, I’m not talking about you. I just don’t want her to be hurt in love. Besides, Su Yan is a proud daughter of heaven; many dream of winning her favor. If you can win her affection, what more could you ask for? You can’t be eating from the bowl while looking at the pot, can you?"

This was the first time Meng Wuya spoke so openly about Xia Ningshang, naturally being very sincere.

Yang Kai grinned, "Shopkeeper Meng, I only have one question for you."

"En."

"Will Junior Sister get married and have children in the future? Or do you hope she remains single for life?"

"How could I hope she remains single for life?" Meng Wuya rolled his eyes, "She is my precious disciple, and I naturally wish for her to be happy and carefree for a lifetime."

"Then, Shopkeeper Meng, who do you think is worthy of Junior Sister?"

Meng Wuya shook his head, a proud expression on his face: "No one is worthy! My disciple is like a pearl among jade; the person worthy of her hasn’t even been born yet."

"What about Su Yan? How does she compare to Junior Sister?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Meng Wuya's expression became serious: "Su Yan is indeed extraordinary, but I’m not boasting; she still falls short compared to my Ningshang!"

"Even if… she obtained the inheritance from the Inheritance Celestial Cave?" Yang Kai's voice grew low.

Meng Wuya's expression changed: "Did she really obtain it?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Meng Wuya's complexion shifted several times, recalling the dragon-shaped phoenix seal from that day, and said solemnly, "If that’s the case, her future achievements will be limitless, on par with Ningshang!"

"Hehe!" Yang Kai chuckled softly.

Meng Wuya looked at him suspiciously, suddenly realizing how Yang Kai had circled around the topic.

If Su Yan and Xia Ningshang were on par, and since Su Yan was willing to be with him, why couldn’t Xia Ningshang?

"So, you must eat what's in the bowl and not let go of what's in the pot. A man must dare to love and hate; being wishy-washy will only hurt Junior Sister's heart," Yang Kai said lightly.

Meng Wuya opened his mouth, unable to refute, feeling both angry and ashamed. He stood up and scolded, "You little rascal, I’ve long seen through your ill intentions, you lecherous rogue! Damn it, in this vast world, how could I have thought of staying in Lingxiao Pavilion, bringing trouble upon myself!"

Regret was useless now; his precious disciple was completely infatuated with Yang Kai, and this little rogue was clearly a scoundrel who would accept anyone. The situation could not be salvaged.

Gritting his teeth, Meng Wuya said, "You little brat, if you dare to make Ningshang sad, I... I will go to Zhongdu and destroy your Yang Family!"

After saying this, he stormed off in anger.

Yang Kai touched his nose, completely unconcerned.

Meng Wuya had great abilities and it was not surprising that he knew his identity; he must have learned it from the Sect Leader. Since the shopkeeper dared to tell him, he must be quite at ease with him.

So there was no need to worry about him betraying himself.

A day later, Xia Ningshang and Xiao Fusheng returned together.

After secretly handing the Soul-Breaking Spike and the ancient jade to Yang Kai, Junior Sister hurriedly entered seclusion.

Having comprehended for an entire day in front of the image of Dan Sheng, she had gained immense knowledge and needed time to organize what she had learned.

After retracting the Soul-Breaking Spike into her body, she finally had time to ask.

"What was the situation there?"

"The defenses are very tight. Besides four experts in the Divine Roaming Realm guarding within thirty zhang, there are also over a dozen True Essence Realm cultivators patrolling around," the Earth Demon replied hurriedly.

"Were you able to infiltrate?"

"This old servant could only circle around the bottom of Wan Yao Pool and didn’t discover anything significant, but it seems there is a very hidden and mysterious formation at the bottom that I cannot activate."

"What kind of formation?"

The Earth Demon quickly concentrated his Divine Sense and transmitted what he had seen into Yang Kai's mind. What he had seen was quite vague, but thanks to his keen eyesight, he had discerned some traces of the formation. Anyone else going down would have found it impossible to detect any clues.

"This formation..." Yang Kai stared for a long time, suddenly realizing that this formation resembled the patterns displayed on the fifth page of the Wordless Black Book.

There must be a connection between the two. If he was not mistaken, the patterns on the fifth page of the black book should be the key to activating the formation.

He still had to go there in person! But how could he enter such a tightly guarded place?

"Young Master, this old servant overheard those guards whispering that once the alchemy conference begins, the defenses there will loosen a bit. Because there aren’t many people from Yao Wang Valley, and the alchemy conference is always lively, many will go down the mountain to maintain order. By then, only two Divine Roaming Realm experts will be guarding, which should be an opportunity!" the Earth Demon reminded.

"Two Divine Roaming Realm experts..." Yang Kai frowned tightly.

Two Divine Roaming Realm experts were still Divine Roaming Realm experts. Even with the ancient jade shielding his aura and True Essence traces, it would be difficult to escape their notice.

Moreover, besides these two Divine Roaming Realm experts, there would certainly be others.

If only someone could distract them!

The Earth Demon should be able to draw away a group! As long as he was fast enough, he could escape back to Hidden Cloud Peak, return to Junior Sister, and come back to collect him after completing his actions.

The key was that he alone could not draw away all the guards; he needed another helper. Yang Kai furrowed his brows in deep thought.

The alchemy conference would be held as scheduled, gathering alchemists from all over the world at Yao Wang Valley, all preparing to showcase their skills and seize good rankings to rise to fame.

The people on Hidden Cloud Peak were not very concerned about the alchemy conference, except for Dong Qingyan, who wanted to see the excitement. Xiao Fusheng did not stop her, allowing her to frequently broaden her horizons.

Xia Ningshang and Meng Wuya also temporarily resided at Hidden Cloud Peak, studying the theoretical knowledge of alchemy with Dong Qingyan under Elder Xiao every day.

After their studies, they would accompany Yang Kai, sometimes just sitting quietly without speaking, and sometimes chatting with Yang Kai. Every day was filled with joy, as if they felt satisfied with life as long as it continued like this.

The alchemy conference lasted a full ten days, and tomorrow would be the finals. After the conference, the top fifty alchemists would be selected, and all the pills refined during this conference would be used to open Wan Yao Pool for these fifty alchemists to comprehend the image of Dan Sheng.

This was a grand event that occurred only once every five years, drawing the attention of the world!

In the deep of night, Yang Kai ghosted out of the house.

Tomorrow was the finals, and tonight should be the busiest moment for Yao Wang Valley. After waiting for so many days and planning, it was finally time to act.

Holding the ancient jade borrowed from Dong Qingyan in his palm, he continuously infused True Essence into it, shielding his entire aura and True Essence traces.

Under the bright moon and sparse stars, Yang Kai moved like the wind through the mountains and forests, heading straight towards Dan Sheng Peak.

In just half an hour, Yang Kai arrived at a position three hundred zhang beneath Dan Sheng Peak, where the forbidden ground was located.

After listening carefully for a long time, Yang Kai crouched down and continued to approach.

He waited until he was about a hundred zhang away before stopping.

Looking up at the sky, he quietly awaited the passage of time.
