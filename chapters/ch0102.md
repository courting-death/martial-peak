## Chapter 102 — Meng Wuya’s Miscalculation

No sooner had these words been spoken than Meng Wuya felt his vision blur, his head suddenly resting heavily upon the vegetable platter before him.

When he finally awoke, an immense span of time had already passed!

Xia Ningshang’s medicine was dosed with no small measure!

Betrayed by his own disciple, Meng Wuya was left wanting to weep but unable, utterly humiliated. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he did not even pause to wash his face, setting off directly from Lingxiao Pavilion to rush here.

He was filled with bitter regret. Had he known the resolve of his disciple was so firm, he would never have been so foolish as to sow discord about Yang Kai’s character. Was this not courting death?

Though his disciple possessed countless treasures to avoid many dangers, this was, after all, the interior of Black Wind Mountain. What if she encountered one or two powerful, reckless beasts and was devoured?

Had he come along, such worries would be needless.

“Foolish words, foolish words,” Meng Wuya cursed himself, wishing he could slap his own face.

Ten li from the convergence point of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, Meng Wuya already sensed the chilling Yin energy emanating from that direction. Suspended midair, he anxiously looked up.

Within the valley, the Yin energy churned violently, yet seemed bound by an invisible force, unable to escape.

Seeing this, the knot in Meng Wuya’s heart finally loosened.

The Nine-Yin Eight-Lock Formation had been activated, meaning his disciple had safely arrived!

“Phew… at last, no major blunders,” Meng Wuya exhaled heavily. Heaven alone knew how anxious he had been during these days of travel, his heart nearly giving out.

Soon, Meng Wuya reached the valley’s edge but did not enter. Instead, he focused his mind to peer inside. The Yin energy was too dense; nothing could be seen or heard, and even his Divine Sense could not penetrate to investigate.

Since the formation was active, it meant his disciple must have already begun her work. All he needed was to await her good news.

Bound by the formation, none inside could leave, and none outside could enter. Though Meng Wuya could break the formation, doing so might ruin his disciple’s painstaking efforts.

Yes, waiting was best! Meng Wuya comforted himself.

This time, however, he was mistaken. Xia Ningshang had activated the formation early not to deal with the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, but to confront the Blood Battle Gang’s deadly trap. Meng Wuya had no inkling that Xia Ningshang was now grievously weakened, nor that Yang Kai was drenched in blood, both caught in dire peril.

Had he known, he would have spared no effort to break the formation and slaughter Wen Feichen and the others a thousand times over. Damn it! To dare scheme against my own disciple’s plan—curse your ancestors to the eighteenth generation!

Sometimes, fate is strange indeed: so near, yet as distant as the heavens.

Within the valley, Yang Kai remained motionless, his back straight as a spear, awaiting the imminent arrival of his formidable foes.

Suddenly, the rustling of fluttering robes echoed from all directions.

At last, they had come! Yang Kai’s expression grew grave as he glanced toward Xia Ningshang’s hiding place. He wondered if he would survive this battle.

But… he had done his utmost, and had no regrets.

Three figures appeared almost simultaneously beside Yang Kai, followed shortly by a fourth.

The first three were Separation and Union Realm experts of the Blood Battle Gang, while the last was only a Qi Movement Realm cultivator at the ninth stage, naturally slower.

None spoke upon arrival, their eyes wide with shock as they stared at Yang Kai. For only an hour had passed, yet this youth, once merely at Open Origin Realm Fourth Stage, now possessed the strength of the Open Origin Realm’s peak!

What was going on?

At their feet lay the corpse of Nu Lang, his neck broken, death grim and cruel. His eyes bulged in disbelief, as if unwilling to accept his fate. The eerie valley, filled with chilling winds, only deepened the horror.

“Did you kill this man?” one of the Blood Battle Gang’s Separation and Union Realm experts asked.

“What of your strongest, and your Young Master Long?” Yang Kai did not answer but instead looked around. The number of opponents was not as expected.

Originally, the Blood Battle Gang had seven members. Wen Feichen and Long Hui remained behind, and another Qi Movement Realm disciple had been slain by Xia Ningshang’s Yin energy chains. Only these four remained.

“Hmph, we need not send Wen or Young Master Long against you!” The speaker sneered. He was a young man of about twenty-five or twenty-six.

“Blood Battle Gang… ha! You only know how to overwhelm by numbers,” Yang Kai mocked.

The youth’s face darkened. “One of us is enough to deal with a wretch like you!”

Though his power was largely sealed by the Yin energy chains, he still retained the foundation of the Separation and Union Realm. If he fought seriously, he would surely surpass a first-stage Qi Movement Realm cultivator. How could he not handle Yang Kai?

“Empty words. Why not put your strength to the test?” Yang Kai sneered.

He could feel their diminished power; they were no longer the threat they once were. Their Yuan Qi fluctuations were unstable. The three who came earlier were now roughly equal to Nu Lang’s strength, strong but not overwhelmingly so. The last was even weaker.

One-on-one, Yang Kai was confident of victory. If he could take down one first, the rest would be easier to handle.

“Young brat, so arrogant! Let your grandpa teach you a lesson!” The youth charged forward, words unfinished.

Just as the plan was about to succeed, and the youth neared within ten steps, Yang Kai was prepared to strike him down even at the cost of injury, when another voice rang out.

“Disciple Yuan Lang, do not fall into his trap!”

The youth halted abruptly, casting a cold glance at Yang Kai. “Yes, Senior Brother Cai.”

“There is only him here. We do not know where that woman is. She is cunning and must be guarded against. This youth, having slain Nu Lang, is likely playing possum! Capture him quickly and force him to reveal her whereabouts!” Cai’s expression was wary as he waved his hand. “Attack together!”

Four against one, and the opponent an Open Origin Realm cultivator—no matter how formidable his skills, he would surely be captured.

The four moved almost simultaneously, surrounding Yang Kai from all sides, their fierce attacks descending like a storm.

Facing such peril, Yang Kai remained unflinching, laughing aloud: “I told you Blood Battle Gang only knows how to overwhelm by numbers, yet you still refuse to admit it!”

Yuan Lang’s face flushed red as he unleashed his attack, angrily shouting, “You sharp-tongued brat! Just wait until I catch you!”
