## Chapter 659 — Not to Be Violated

Ever since that day when that single Golden Pupil Eye appeared in Yang Kai's mind and its golden light washed over her, Li Rong had been harboring doubts.

She discovered that the feeling this Golden Pupil Eye gave her was very similar to certain records in the ancestral texts.

So after leaving Yang Kai, Li Rong immediately consulted the classics and indeed found that, just as she suspected, that Golden Pupil Eye was no trivial matter.

Dispatching Duan Ya, who was in the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, to protect Yang Kai’s safety, and even this time insisting that Han Fei personally go out to escort him to the volcano, all stemmed from her desire to protect him.

Until the truth was revealed, she did not want to see this human suffer any harm. She did not voice her suspicions to anyone, not even Han Fei and Hua Mo, who were two of the four commanders.

She wasn’t yet certain; she needed time to observe Yang Kai to verify whether her conjecture was correct.

But Chu Jian’s attack shattered her hopes and filled her with fury.

Now learning that Han Fei and Yang Kai were actually unharmed, Li Rong could not contain her joy and rushed headlong toward them, using her formidable cultivation to break through the deadly domain around the volcano’s mouth, eager to reach them a moment sooner and lend aid.

Hua Mo followed behind her, trembling with fear.

He realized that Lady Li was behaving somewhat out of character this time; for the sake of a human, she was utterly disregarding her own safety.

On the other side of the volcanic mouth, Yang Kai plummeted from the air, landing headfirst and rolling several times before coming to a stop. He struggled to his feet, wiped the blood from his mouth, and stared around with wary, grave eyes.

The ancient demon clan members who had chased him down regarded him in astonishment; one of them nodded and said, “This outsider’s body is no less robust than ours—falling from such a height and not even injuring his tendons or bones.”

“I heard that at Mo Shen Fort he severely wounded Pan Lang and several of his men.”

“Really?”

“Well, that is interesting.”

The crowd jabbered, not in a hurry to attack Yang Kai; instead they wore expressions of amazement.

A figure appeared eerily in midair, looking down on Yang Kai from above; a powerful, despair-inducing aura radiated from him.

Chu Jian!

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. He turned his head to look not far away and discovered Han Fei, who had struggled to delay him, lying in a pool of blood; her beautiful eyes opened and closed slowly, her face pale, lips moving as if murmuring.

Too far away to hear her words, Yang Kai could still make out her lips and guessed she was telling him to flee.

“My lord!” many Ancient Demon Clan members saluted in unison.

Chu Jian inclined his head slightly and sneered at Yang Kai, “There is a saying among you humans: those who know the times are geniuses. I advise you not to resist. Han Fei cannot protect you, and Li Rong cannot save you!”

“Heh…” Facing certain doom, Yang Kai instead laughed.

“What are you laughing at?” Chu Jian snorted coldly, displeased.

Yang Kai slowly raised a hand and pointed behind Chu Jian, “Li Rong appears to be coming; why not tell her that yourself.”

Chu Jian’s expression changed. He turned and indeed saw a graceful figure rapidly approaching; Li Rong’s face was etched with anxiety, and before she could speak a sharp command rang out, “Chu Jian, do not lay a hand on that human. If you obey me this once, I will pardon past transgressions; but if a single hair is harmed on his head, I will not spare you!”

“Lady Li!” Chu Jian snorted and called out, “Now that I, Chu Jian, have taken this step, there is no turning back! Today it is either your death or mine!”

Saying this, he no longer paid attention to the incoming Li Rong, instead turning his cold gaze back on Yang Kai.

Li Rong’s earlier words made Chu Jian increasingly convinced that this human held an extraordinary place in her heart.

He had no need to fight Li Rong; if he merely captured this human he would certainly win!

Chu Jian seemed already to envision Li Rong bowing before him, his control over Mo Shen Fort, and his domination of the Small Xuan Realm.

The glorious prospect excited him and made his expression fervent. Once he unified the Small Xuan Realm, he believed he could restore his people’s true nature, and upon departing this place the world would tremble.

A dreamlike whisper suddenly echoed through the heavens and earth.

“Enter Demonic State!”

Yang Kai’s voice was low. He pressed the tip of his right middle finger against his own forehead; his tone was icy as wind from the Nine Nether Purgatory, sending shivers down the spine.

Heaven and earth trembled, and everyone felt a sudden, disturbing unease in their hearts.

The chaotic sky abruptly opened into a vast vortex, within which an aura of destruction swirled.

Winds and clouds roiled; a dread far more terrifying than a volcanic eruption descended.

Yang Kai bared his torso as dark, intricate markings surfaced across his flesh like living serpents crawling and searing into his skin.

In an instant his entire aura changed, becoming brutally feral, bloodthirsty, and malevolent.

He had to unleash his last trump card, solely to buy enough time to escape before Li Rong arrived.

As long as he could hold out until Li Rong came, he would no longer face the danger of being seized by Chu Jian.

If possible, Yang Kai preferred not to use Enter Demonic State in front of the Ancient Demon Clan, because the method resembled their Demon God Transformation; he did not know the exact connection, but instinct warned him that using Enter Demonic State might cause trouble.

It could even make them think he had secretly learned their Demon God Transformation.

That is a taboo the Ancient Demon Clan would not tolerate.

But now he could no longer bother with such concerns.

Yet Yang Kai soon discovered that this time, Enter Demonic State behaved very differently from before.

One by one, energy streams surged out from the Ancient Demon Clan members around him and poured into Yang Kai’s body; even Chu Jian, who had reached the Second Stage of Ascension, could not avoid it.

Even Han Fei, who lay dozens of zhang away and had already been grievously wounded, had a large portion of her energy drawn out and immediately fell into unconsciousness.

In an instant, those gathered around Yang Kai realized their own power had diminished considerably.

Yang Kai, conversely, sensed a tremendous force swelling within him; his face brightened as he clenched his fist, feeling as if he could command the very heavens and earth.

At that moment he felt omnipotent!

“Demon God Transformation?” Chu Jian cried out in alarm, eyes trembling as he looked at Yang Kai. The human’s exposed flesh, except for his face, was completely covered by Demon Marks—an archetypal Demon God Transformation.

Moreover, the extent to which the Demon Marks had unfolded on him exceeded Chu Jian’s own by several degrees.

“How is this possible?” Chu Jian was stunned.

Demon God Transformation was a martial skill that only the Ancient Demon Clan could perform; even other demon kin could not imitate it, for Demon Marks are innate and other races do not possess them, so they naturally could not enact Demon God Transformation.

How then could this human do it? And his Demon God Transformation... seemed more profound and powerful than anyone else’s.

Faintly, a power that suppressed them radiated from that human.

Chu Jian was horrified to find his own facial Demon Marks melting away like spring snow beneath the fierce sun; they quickly vanished, his Qi and blood fell, his combat strength plummeted, and his spirit sank to the depths...

Chu Jian was shaken, and Li Rong was equally stunned.

Yet what overwhelmed her more was joy.

The beautiful woman charging forward had an unusual light in her eyes; she stared unblinkingly at Yang Kai, her chest rising and falling violently as if she beheld a long-awaited scene, her expression overflowing with excitement.

Hua Mo trailing behind her gaped, his eyes wide, utterly dumbfounded.

When they were about a hundred zhang from Yang Kai, Li Rong and Hua Mo suddenly groaned and involuntarily fell toward the ground.

From that direction emanated a power that suppressed them so completely they could not even summon the thought of progressing further.

Every Ancient Demon Clan member’s body trembled; they looked at Yang Kai as if he were their natural enemy, fear filling their hearts.

“Indeed... indeed... indeed it is. I did not misjudge it...” Li Rong murmured, tears welling at the corners of her eyes as if a weight had been lifted.

“Lady Li... what is happening? How can he perform Demon God Transformation, and why does his Demon God Transformation suppress us?” Hua Mo asked, his heart chilled.

“This is the gift the Great Demon God bestowed upon our Ancient Demon Clan. Surely our ancestors’ prayers took effect; that Great Demon God has sent him to save our people!” Li Rong’s face was full of reverent devotion.

“Great Demon God?” Hua Mo’s face altered slightly at the mention.

The Great Demon God occupied a supreme position in the hearts of the Ancient Demon Clan.

“But Lady Li, I cannot muster any strength at all,” Hua Mo said, his expression grave.

“Not only can you not muster strength, none of the Ancient Demon Clan standing before him can. The Great Demon God’s majesty brooks no violation!” Li Rong straightened her delicate form against the wind, standing where she was and gazing at Yang Kai with utmost reverence.

“Then Chu Jian...” Hua Mo’s expression shifted.

“He is no exception.” Li Rong sneered softly and fell silent, choosing to watch the situation unfold.

Over there, Yang Kai suddenly let out a long howl.

In that instant he experienced a kind of exhilaration he had never known before; for some reason this time, after using Enter Demonic State, his mood felt different.

He felt as if he stood atop the clouds, looking down indifferently upon the myriad lives below.

Those who had once weighed upon him with great pressure, even Chu Jian and the Ancient Demon Clan who had driven him almost to despair, now seemed to him like ants; life and death rested on his mere thought.

He could not understand why he felt this way. His intention in using Enter Demonic State had merely been to delay until Li Rong arrived, yet such a turn of events had occurred.

All the Ancient Demon Clan members trembled; Yang Kai reined in his spirit and glanced at Li Rong, Hua Mo and the others a hundred zhang away, noticing with curiosity that they had halted and did not intend to approach.

But the way that beautiful woman looked at him was somewhat different than before.
