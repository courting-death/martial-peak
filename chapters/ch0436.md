## Chapter 436 — Visitors from the Lü Family

In the side hall, not only was Qiu Yimeng puzzled, but everyone else also failed to understand why Yang Kai did not seize the moment to pursue an attack.

At this point, he should have the qualifications to go after Yang Quan.

"Could it be that you still cling to some brotherly affection at a time like this?" Qiu Yimeng sneered coldly. "Don’t forget, last night you were attacked by two of your brothers; did they ever consider you? The Yang Family’s succession war, to put it bluntly, is survival of the fittest, building your path to fame with the blood and bones of martial artists from other clans."

Yang Kai frowned slightly. Although he admitted Qiu Yimeng’s words were true, he showed no sign of response.

Qiu Yimeng seemed not to notice his expression and continued, "Moreover, even if you don’t attack Yang Quan, sooner or later, someone will. It’s better to grasp this juicy piece of meat yourself than let others have it."

"Junior Brother must have his reasons for acting this way, right?" Lan Chudie suddenly spoke, a gentle understanding light flickering in her beautiful eyes.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly felt discomfort for no reason and snorted softly, "What reasons?"

"Think for yourself. You, Young Lady Qiu, are clever enough to figure it out." Yang Kai chuckled softly.

Qiu Yimeng stared at him in a daze, and the emotions that had slightly stirred within her suddenly calmed down. Her sharp tone earlier was partly because no matter what suggestions she put forth, Yang Kai never accepted them, which frustrated her. Also, Yang Kai had glanced briefly at Lan Chudie’s chest just now, which irritated her.

I have them too, just not that big!

Qiu Yimeng was a shrewd and intelligent woman who naturally had her own ways of thinking. Once her mood evened out, her mind sped up, considering Yang Kai’s intentions and the interests involved in his refusal to attack.

Dong Qinghan sensed the subtle tension in the atmosphere and dared not interrupt, keeping quiet.

The entire side hall was so quiet one could hear a pin drop. After some time, Qiu Yimeng’s eyes brightened as she lifted her gaze, looking at Yang Kai with an expression of understanding, smiling gently, "I get it now."

"If you understand, then don't propose it anymore," Yang Kai nodded.

"Fine, I won’t boss you around anymore. Feels like showing off in an expert’s shop," Qiu Yimeng pouted, clearly vexed.

"Good girl, a woman is better off obedient," Yang Kai shot her a knowing look.

Dong Qinghan had just taken a sip of water and almost choked, coughing uncontrollably while his admiration for Yang Kai deepened further.

Who else would dare say such words to Qiu Yimeng? Among the notable families of Zhongdu, not a single scion had the courage or qualifications. Only this cousin of his dared.

What audacity! Yet Young Lady Qiu did not even bother to retort.

Lan Chudie listened, somewhat confused but too shy to inquire, unable to grasp the deeper meaning.

The two elders of Fengyun pondered for a moment before nodding repeatedly.

"Um... may I ask a question?" Dong Qinghan’s curiosity got the better of him. "What exactly are you two keeping secret?"

Qiu Yimeng chuckled softly, gazing at the elders. "If the two seniors have figured it out, why not tell Young Master Dong? Otherwise, you might worry your young master sick."

Exchanging glances, Feng Wei finally cleared his throat and spoke, "The two of us have only discerned one reason, and if incorrect, we hope Young Master Kai and Miss Qiu will enlighten us."

He paused briefly before continuing, "Young Master Kai’s momentum is at its peak. None of the other seven remaining young masters can match him. On the surface, it does appear now is the perfect time for him to press the attack. The other young masters suffered heavy losses last night and have neither time nor inclination to meddle. As for the eldest young master Yang Wei, since he did not intervene last night, it is clear he relies on his status as first brother and grants his juniors a margin of courtesy. If Young Master Kai were to attack Yang Quan’s manor now, given Yang Wei’s temper, he probably wouldn’t strike covertly but might instead join forces with Kai and share the spoils."

"But if Young Master Kai truly did so, he would have defeated two of the Yang Family’s young masters consecutively. While his name would grow even louder, he would also be pushed to the very center of the storm. The other five young masters would undoubtedly see him as their greatest enemy, and it’s likely they would be forced to band together... to eliminate him!"

Feng Wei’s face turned grave as he said, "A tree that stands out in the forest is easily blown down by the wind."

Upon hearing this, Dong Qinghan and Lan Chudie suddenly understood why Yang Kai refused to accept Qiu Yimeng’s suggestion.

Feng Wei’s analysis was spot on—it was highly likely, no, certain to happen.

If the other young masters of the Yang Family were forced to unite, Yang Kai’s days would be difficult indeed.

One flashy move is enough; a second would only backfire.

Dong Qinghan inwardly sighed, secretly grateful he was not born into the old Yang Family. If he had to contend with such a scheming opponent as Yang Kai, he might never even understand the cause of his defeat.

Fengyun shook their heads gently, "We see only this reason, but I imagine Young Master Kai has other reasons. Would Young Master Kai enlighten us?"

"Is this one reason not sufficient?" Dong Qinghan was astonished. This single reason alone was enough to keep Yang Kai inactive.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, "There are indeed other reasons, but I cannot speak of them now. Saying so would only make me seem arrogant. In due time, all will be clear."

Feng Wei nodded slightly, "If Young Master Kai has difficulties, we shall not press. Let us wait and see."

Qiu Yimeng sighed, "You become harder to understand the more I look."

Even she could not discern the second reason for Yang Kai’s restraint, nor could one say whether he had a third.

As the group conversed, Xiang Tianxiao strode in with a fierce step and a serious expression, clasping his fists and saying, "Young Master Kai, visitors have come seeking alliance."

"I told you to refuse anyone we don’t know," Yang Kai frowned.

"They claim to know you," Xiang Tianxiao replied.

"From which family?" Yang Kai was somewhat surprised.

"The Lü Family."

Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng exchanged glances and smiled, both knowing that Lü Liang had sent someone.

"Since they have come, let them in," Yang Kai ordered. Though reluctant, he decided to accept the gesture as the Lü Family was surely bringing gifts.

Xiang Tianxiao acknowledged and went to welcome them.

After a while, Lü Song led two formidable martial artists, both at the seventh stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, boldly stepping inside.

Lü Song sincerely did not want to deliver the goods to Yang Kai. He believed Yang Kai must be a cunning and treacherous man; otherwise, why would he have swindled his family’s property?

He had never met someone so shameless!

If possible, Lü Song would take the supplies to support another Yang Family scion. But after Yang Kai’s bizarre behavior the previous night became known, Lü Song realized it was impossible to withhold the goods.

Besides, Lü Liang had ordered that no matter how Yang Kai performed in the succession war, the supplies must be delivered to him. Moreover, Yang Kai’s performance had been remarkably brave.

If Lü Song secretly handed the resources to someone else, he would face severe punishment upon returning.

This time, the Lü Family not only brought gifts but also escorts to serve as Yang Kai’s muscle. Lü Song felt disgusted thinking about it. The Lü Family dispatched a considerable force: two at Divine Roaming Realm seventh stage as Lü Song’s guardians, one at the fourth stage, two at the third, and over twenty True Essence Realm martial artists.

Such backup would earn any scion a warm welcome in their manor. Yet this Yang Kai was oddly stiff, letting his own men lead him in without even acknowledging their arrival.

Lü Song was filled with fury.

Though keeping a calm expression when entering, he hurriedly greeted Qiu Yimeng, "Lü Song greets my cousin."

Qiu Yimeng nodded lightly, "Thank you, it must have been a hard journey."

Lü Song smiled, "Not hard, just bringing something over, nothing more." 

Scanning the crowd, he asked, "Which one is Young Master Kai?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly, "That’s me."

Lü Song’s gaze settled on him, a slight smirk on his lips, "Pleasure to meet you, Young Master Kai. Lü Song has long heard of your name."

Qiu Yimeng’s brows knit slightly; Lü Song’s tone carried a faint hint of provocation.

Yang Kai remained indifferent, replying, "The head of the Lü Family is too kind."

After all, Yang Kai was the one cheating Lü Liang out of his property, so it was natural Lü Song did not feel pleased. He didn’t bother to argue, knowing his actions were somewhat unscrupulous but also forced by circumstance.

Surprised by Yang Kai’s calm, Lü Song refrained from making a face and said, "Before I came, my father instructed that the items be delivered directly to you. I brought the men so that you may command them. Hopefully, they can assist in the succession war."

"I understand," Yang Kai nodded. "In that case, feel free to do as you please. The manor is large; have Qiu Yimeng arrange lodgings for you. I will attend to any matters that arise."

Regarding the Lü Family head Lü Liang’s attitude, Yang Kai was not surprised. But he held little regard for these late-arriving supporters.

If his guess was correct, Lü Song and company had already been at War City and simply waited to see if Yang Kai would be eliminated last night before making their move.

Whether this guess was right or wrong needed to be verified by people from the Bamboo Segment Gang.

Naturally, Yang Kai did not equate these latecomers to the Dong Family or Qiu Yimeng.

Just as Qiu Yimeng smiled and was about to arrange accommodations for Lü Song and his group, Xiang Tianxiao dashed in again, reporting, "Young Master Kai, more people have arrived..."

"From which family?"

"Ziwei Valley!"

Qiu Yimeng’s eyes lit up with joy. "It’s Xiao Man who brought them."

As she spoke, she hurried over to Yang Kai’s side and whispered, "It’s not that Xiao Man didn’t want to help you yesterday, but you know she’s a girl. Though she holds some position in Ziwei Valley, she lacks authority over major decisions. For her to bring people today certainly took a lot of effort. You must thank her properly."
