## Chapter 1983 — Dragons and Serpents Entwined

On that day, the contest between Yang Kai and Zuo De had, because of the final pill-gathering technique, given rise to the Great Dao Pill Tone.

That final pill-gathering technique was the prototype of the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art, a method Yang Kai had derived himself by combining all the pill-refining knowledge he possessed with a lifetime of refining experience and his own insights.

And with the sounding of the Great Dao Pill Tone, the all-encompassing Laws of the Heavenly Dao perfected that set of pill-gathering moves for Yang Kai.

Thus the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art could be considered a crystallization of the Heavenly Dao.

The ultimate truths of heaven and earth were everywhere; only those with the right affinity could glean a bit from them and thereby reap boundless benefit.

Yang Kai’s Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art was a product born of the heavens and earth themselves; he had merely been fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of it.

Such a technique—even if he wished to pass it on to others—would likely be beyond an outsider’s comprehension, for it was the Great Dao Pill Tone’s own endorsement of him.

At the time Yang Kai had felt this pill-gathering technique to be extremely arcane; to fully comprehend it would not be something one accomplished in a short time.

In hindsight, there was some truth to that; after all, this set of techniques—born in his native Star Domain and honed into the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art—remained an extraordinarily advanced method even when used within the Star Realm.

Every pill he refined ended with the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art to consolidate the pills.

At that moment, it was time to consolidate the pills.

As he performed the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art, the fragrance within the refining room grew ever richer, and at one point odd sounds even emanated from the Purple Void Cauldron.

Sensing the moment had come, Yang Kai tapped the Purple Void Cauldron; the lid flew open, and following it were six round, plump Spiritual Pills.

Yang Kai took out a jade vial he had prepared in advance and stored them away.

"Only six!" Yang Kai frowned slightly. He looked somewhat dissatisfied.

Theoretically, the materials for one Origin Condensing Pill could yield up to nine pills; that was the limit most pill formulas reached. Although Yang Kai’s pill-refining aptitude was not poor and he had the unique Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art to aid his consolidation, human effort had its limits: he was after all only an Upper-Level Void King-Grade pill-refiner, and even at full exertion he could only consolidate six pills at once.

He was three pills short of the nine-pill limit!

But that was already remarkable; very few pill-refiners could bring a batch up to the absolute limit. Those who could were master pill-refiners famed across the entire Star Realm.

Even they sometimes slipped—no one could achieve such results every single time.

A count of six was beyond what ordinary Dao Origin-Grade pill-refiners could reach. Yang Kai’s ability to do so owed more than half the credit to the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art.

That was why pill-refiners clamoured for superior consolidation methods; a strong consolidating method meant producing more pills at the last moment, effectively saving a huge amount of materials, time, and effort.

When Yang Kai first refined Origin Condensing Pills he could only condense two pills, but now, in just over ten days, he had reached six—a frightening rate of growth that few would believe if told.

Though it seemed not far from the nine-pill limit, sometimes a single pill or two could be an impassable gulf; to reach the absolute limit Yang Kai still needed a great deal of practice and accumulated experience.

He exhausted one hundred portions of materials over the course of six or seven days.

As usual, he intentionally produced failures in over ten batches so that Kang Siran would have no cause for suspicion.

In truth, with his skill, he could now refine Origin Condensing Pills with his eyes closed and not fail.

When Kang Siran arrived to collect the pills, his expression was a study in wonder.

Although he had already experienced this once before, Kang Siran still could not believe Yang Kai could refine one hundred batches of Spiritual Pills in such a short time.

The quantity was almost no different from the last time—just over three hundred pills.

This time Yang Kai held back more than two hundred Origin Condensing Pills!

"Master Yang, to cooperate with you is truly my honour!" Kang Siran beamed at Yang Kai. "If not for you holding things down, my Spiritual Pill workshop would likely have gone under. I owe you a great debt; if you ever require assistance in the future, I will go through fire and water without hesitation."

"It’s part of the job, Shopkeeper Kang—you flatter me." Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Yang Kai’s modesty and warmth made Kang Siran laugh all the more heartily; he truly had never seen such a young, capable pill-refiner who was so unpretentious.

Previously, which of the three pill-refiners at the Spiritual Pill workshop had been easy to deal with?

Every time they came to collect pills, the three of them wore sour looks, as if the workshop owed them hundreds of thousands of Source Crystals; even though Kang Siran’s standing and cultivation exceeded theirs, he always had to greet them with a smile and handle them carefully.

He even had to fulfill their all manner of strange demands!

Take Fan Hong, for example—every time he finished refining pills he had to find a beautiful maiden to relax with, and her cultivation could not be below the Origin Returning Realm!

Origin Returning Realm practitioners were not scarce in Fenglin City, but to find such a woman the Spiritual Pill workshop had to pay a high price! The other two refiners’ demands were even more absurd: one wanted to drink a brew only available at the City Lord’s mansion, and another wanted to eat Demonic Flame fruit that grew deep within the Flame Swamp!

That Myriad Red Flower Brew cost one thousand Source Crystals for a small cup! And it was a special tribute from the City Lord’s mansion; without Kang Siran’s connections it would have been impossible to obtain.

The Demonic Flame fruit was even rarer—deep within the Flame Swamp was a perilous place where Dao Origin Realm warriors risked death to enter; a single Demonic Flame fruit was worth no less than five thousand Source Crystals, and could easily fetch seven or eight thousand! But that thing only satisfied appetite; it had virtually no use in improving one’s strength.

Every time Kang Siran thought of these things his heart bled.

And Master Yang was not only affable; he had no other demands—just a few pills would satisfy him.

By comparison, Yang Kai’s noble character completely outshone those three rotten men!

Those three were now in the Danqi Pavilion—let Zhuo Ningsi that bitch have her hands full with them, thought Kang Siran with relief, and his mood brightened.

"Master Yang, why not rest for a few days? With the Origin Condensing Pills you provided, our Spiritual Pill workshop won’t need to worry about stock for the next half month," Kang Siran said, moved by Yang Kai’s diligence and offering the suggestion.

"Oh? If the Origin Condensing Pills are sufficient, should I refine other Spiritual Pills?" Yang Kai asked.

Kang Siran chuckled: "The demand for other Spiritual Pills isn’t great; I have some inventory, so there’s no rush. Master Yang, you should rest—don’t overwork yourself."

"Very well, I’ll rest for a few days then." Yang Kai thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.

"That’s best. By the way, Master Yang, since you’re new to Fenglin City, would you like to accompany me on an outing tomorrow?"

"Where to?" Yang Kai asked, looking at Kang Siran with some suspicion.

Kang Siran smiled faintly. "The Star God Palace has sent an envoy, currently staying at the City Lord’s mansion. I was fortunate enough to be invited as part of the entourage; tomorrow the envoy will go out, and I can bring one companion."

"The Star God Palace’s envoy?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Seeing his reaction, Kang Siran secretly relaxed—thankful Yang Kai was not so ignorant as to be unaware of the Star God Palace, for it was the hegemon of the Southern Territory and the sect where the Radiant Moon Great Emperor resided.

The Radiant Moon Great Emperor was one of the Ten Great Emperors.

And the envoy of the Star God Palace clearly held exceedingly high status.

"Why would the Star God Palace’s envoy come to Fenglin City?" Yang Kai frowned; Fenglin City was hardly prosperous enough to attract such a figure.

Soon Yang Kai understood. "Could it be because of matters at Yuqing Mountain?"

"Exactly," Kang Siran nodded. "Luan Feng traces appeared at Yuqing Mountain. Many outsiders have arrived in Fenglin City recently to investigate. Master Yang, you are here refining pills day and night and are unfamiliar with outside events. The envoy is here because of Luan Feng’s appearance—otherwise tiny Fenglin City couldn’t attract so many experts."

"Who has come?" Yang Kai’s curiosity was piqued.

He was not being nosy so much as attempting to probe the power structure of the Southern Territory.

Hearing his question, Kang Siran naturally told him everything he knew.

"News of Luan Feng’s appearance spread quickly; virtually every major sect in the Southern Territory came. Off the top of my head there are the Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, and Qingyang Shrine—forces second only to the Star God Palace. Also, our Ziyuan Commerce Guild and the Qiyao Commerce Guild have experts present, though I handle only trade matters and wasn’t notified nor did I meet those guild experts," Kang Siran said calmly. "Countless smaller forces also came; Fenglin City is now... teeming with dragons, ghosts, and serpents — a scene of unparalleled bustle."

"Are they trying to track Luan Feng’s movements?" Yang Kai asked, astonished.

"Not exactly!" Kang Siran laughed in surprise. "Luan Feng is an Ancient Divine Spirit; even if one of the Ten Great Emperors personally intervened they might not prevail. Who would risk life and limb to track her? Yet the appearance of a Divine Spirit naturally draws attention. Many forces know no useful result will come of tracking it, but they cannot leave it alone—so those who came are not necessarily the true high ranks of sects; some are green hands looking to gain experience and see the world."

"I see!"

"Our Spiritual Pill workshop may not amount to much, but it's an asset of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild and the City Lord has always looked after it. This time, to welcome the Star God Palace's envoy I was fortunate enough to be invited along in the entourage. Master Yang, would you be interested in coming with me to see the place on Yuqing Mountain where the Divine Spirit appeared? I hear the World‑Ending Black Flame still burns there and even Dao Origin Realm warriors dare not go deep. Of course we won't be venturing in—just a leisurely trip to clear our minds and broaden our horizons. To actually see that World‑Ending Black Flame with your own eyes would be something not to miss in a lifetime."

"I've already learned a harsh lesson from that thing," Yang Kai thought to himself.
