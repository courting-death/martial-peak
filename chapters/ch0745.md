## Chapter 745 — You Shouldn't Do That

When the Yellow-Faced Elder finished speaking, he said no more, stroking his whiskers as he stood to one side and waited silently.

Although his words could not be fully trusted, the mere mention of the ancient ruins still set everyone's nerves on edge.

Wherever there are ruins, there will surely be treasures; the bustling world moves for profit and people swarm where gain lies. The outsider cultivators gathered on the shore could not help but be tempted.

Besides, everyone had noticed the commotion caused earlier when that sealing formation was triggered.

They all gathered together, frowning and discussing; many others, like Yang Kai, stood alone and watched the situation warily.

The Seven Families Alliance had surely been forced into this decision, but they probably intended to take these outsiders along to scout ahead so as to minimize losses to their own houses.

That implied they had some knowledge of the ancient ruins below, but not much.

Thoughts spun rapidly through Yang Kai's mind, and he soon grasped the general outline.

Should he go?

There was certainly danger below, yet the source emitting such strong Yang attribute energy made Yang Kai very curious.

Now that he had reached the Transcendent Realm, he still had no decent Secret Treasure. That Bone Shield had been destroyed by the starry sky storm last time; the only Secret Treasure he could employ was the Spirit-Soul Short Sword within his Sea of Consciousness.

But that Spirit-Soul Short Sword was only a Heaven-Grade, Upper-Level item—still valuable back in Zhongdu, but of little use here.

If a formidable Secret Treasure were emitting such a Yang attribute aura, it would be perfectly complementary to Yang Kai. Obtaining it would greatly increase his power.

Even if it were not a Secret Treasure, some precious material could still give him considerable aid.

With that thought, Yang Kai made his decision.

Many others had made the same decision. Not long after the Yellow-Faced Elder finished speaking, someone strode from the crowd toward where the Seven Families Alliance had gathered.

Before long scattered cultivators surged forward, and Yang Kai moved up as well. But many still watched hesitantly, faces uncertain and undecided.

Seeing this, the previously silent Yellow-Faced Elder suddenly said, "Ah—one more thing to tell you all. Although our Seven Families Alliance is taking the lead, participation is limited; we cannot accept everyone. Each family will recruit only thirty people. As for strength, the higher the better—those below the Divine Roaming Realm, please do not come to make a scene."

"Damn it, you old man, why didn't you say this earlier!" curses rose from the crowd. Those who had been hesitating feared losing their places; everyone surged forward in a scramble.

The Yellow-Faced Elder stroked his whiskers, a faint, inexplicable smile at the corner of his mouth, pleased with his trick.

The Seven Families Alliance each sent one person to stand at the front. Any cultivator wishing to act with them could freely choose which family to join.

Seven long lines formed; at least two thousand people had gathered here.

Yang Kai had arrived early; he casually gave a name and then displayed his disguised cultivation—Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage—easily passing and was sent to wait elsewhere.

Time passed slowly as cultivators came before the experts of the Seven Families Alliance. Most were politely rejected for lack of strength, though many, like Yang Kai, received approval.

In the span of only an hour, everyone had been checked.

Yet the number of those left exceeded the Yellow-Faced Elder's expectation—nearly three hundred. The weakest were still Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage; among them were also experts of the Transcendent Realm, though not many—of those three hundred, perhaps fewer than ten were of the Transcendent Realm.

The warriors of the seven families gathered to discuss, and the Yellow-Faced Elder proclaimed in a clear voice, "I have felt your enthusiasm. Those who pass will go down to sea with our Seven Families Alliance; the remaining friends please stay on the shore. If anyone disobeys, do not blame the Seven Families Alliance for showing no mercy!"

Those left behind were not very powerful; the Yellow-Faced Elder's tone grew less polite than before—clearly he felt certain they would not dare cause trouble here, after all, this was the territory of the Seven Families Alliance.

Seeing him turn so quickly, the excluded cultivators could only curse softly to themselves and feel helpless.

After speaking, the experts of the Seven Families Alliance huddled together again, apparently preparing matters.

Yang Kai stood in a secluded corner, coldly observing the strength of those around him; most people made the same calculations, as if everyone here were a rival.

Noting this, Yang Kai let out a dry laugh—treasure had not even been found yet and the air was already so volatile. If something truly valuable were discovered, these people would likely begin slaughtering each other at once.

The Seven Families Alliance had played a clever hand!

Knowing they could not prevent these outsiders from going down to explore, they adopted this conciliatory strategy. On the surface it appeared they were willing to share the secrets of the ancient ruins, but in truth, by bringing these outsiders down they would hinder one another. Such a scattered group would achieve little within the ruins; then the Seven Families Alliance's cultivators could sit back and watch tigers fight, reap the benefits, and collect most of the gains—minimizing their own losses while securing immense profit.

Yang Kai quietly shook his head.

While he observed, a wisp of fragrant breeze suddenly drifted to him from the side, carrying a scent that felt somewhat familiar.

Yang Kai frowned and turned to see a woman standing beside him, smiling softly.

He looked at her with suspicion, then his expression altered and he exclaimed in surprise, "You—"

"Shh…" the woman quickly raised a jade finger and gave Yang Kai a knowing look.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered; he quietly released his Divine Sense to probe around and studied the pretty-featured woman. With a strange smile he murmured, "Young lady, how are you here?"

"You are so certain it's me?" the woman smiled faintly, seeming somewhat surprised.

Yang Kai chuckled, shaking his head. "There's a saying: one can recognize a woman by her scent! Every woman's fragrance is different. Though you've altered your appearance—well, I don't know how you concealed your original aura, but that scent cannot be changed."

"What a dog nose!" the woman's cheeks flushed as she scolded Yang Kai. "With so much experience, you must have seduced many women, right?"

"No." Yang Kai shook his head solemnly. "I've always kept myself pure; I would never stoop to such shameless acts."

The woman laughed coquettishly, fluttering like a blossom. "I don't believe you for a moment."

Yang Kai shot her a sidelong glance, then watched two Transcendent Realm, Second Stage experts hurry past nearby. Their Divine Senses were being cast about recklessly as if searching frantically for someone, but after probing here to no avail they left utterly frustrated.

"You shouldn't be like this. After all, you're the Saintess—what are you doing coming here?" Yang Kai subtly nodded toward the direction the two experts had left. "They seem to be looking for you."

"Don't look at them! They're on alert; if they discover you it'll be really bad." The woman hurriedly tugged at Yang Kai's sleeve.

Yang Kai had truly been stunned when he realized the woman's true identity.

She was, of all people, the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land from that great ship!

He could not fathom what exquisite method she had used to compress her aura to perfection and even alter her original appearance.

If she had not approached him herself, Yang Kai would not have discovered her.

The Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land truly possessed strange talents! No wonder she could slip away from those two Second Stage Transcendent Realm experts and hide here unnoticed.

"You haven't told me—what are you doing here?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"To join in the excitement—there are so many people here."

"This sort of excitement is no place to join; you might lose your life!" Yang Kai snorted, eying her oddly.

The Saintess was immediately annoyed. "You think I know nothing and would go to my death? Hmph. If it's somewhere a Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage can go, why can't I? My strength is far greater than yours."

"Hey, where are the manners and cultivation expected of a Saintess?" Yang Kai gaped. The woman before him was very different from the gentle, refined Saintess he'd seen before—this seemed like her true self.

"None of your business; you would never be chosen as the Saint Lord anyway!" she scoffed.

"I have no desire to be any Saint Lord either!" Yang Kai sneered.

The woman's expression suddenly grew serious. "Don't expose me; I only came close because I trust you."

"Rest assured, I don't meddle in others' affairs," Yang Kai nodded, but then grew wary. "Why would a Saintess come near an unknown youth like me?"

The Saintess's long lashes fluttered as she smiled. "How to put it... I always feel you are hiding something—there's a mysterious aura about you that I can't see through. I'm rather curious."

Yang Kai's face grew cold; he gave a sly, grim laugh. "Mutual, mutual."

Yang Kai still couldn't discern the extent of her cultivation. Even at such close distance it was the same—there seemed to be a mysterious force about her that repelled his probing.

"Your smile is oddly wicked," the Saintess timidly observed Yang Kai, then sighed. "I grew up in the Sacred Land; this is my first time leaving it on a tour. Everywhere I go people follow me—it's unbearably annoying. I only wanted to be in control for once, so I shook them off."

"No need to explain," Yang Kai said coolly. "I have little interest in outsiders' affairs. And when we reach those ancient ruins, don't entangle me. If you encounter danger, you are on your own—don't expect anyone to come save you!"
