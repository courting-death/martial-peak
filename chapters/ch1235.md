## Chapter 1235 — Fourth Layer

Yang Kai hadn't expected that after penetrating this far he still couldn't find a suitable place to leave Daiyuan; abandoning her now would be tantamount to sentencing her to death.

It seemed he would have to search for somewhere appropriate where she could remain for a while; during that time he could attend to his own business. As long as the place was safe enough, she could stay until Flowing Flame Sandland closed, at which point the area's heaven-and-earth laws would naturally transport her out.

Just as Yang Kai was thinking this, Daiyuan uttered a soft cry from behind. Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense, his expression changing slightly, and he instantly flashed beside her, catching the faltering woman in his arms.

She had actually reached the end of her tether; the Saint Yuan in her body was withered and dried up, nearly gone without a single drop left. The Rainbow Handkerchief and the armor that had guarded her could no longer exert their power, and the searing heat, the instant those protections failed, pressed in on her from all directions.

If Yang Kai did not act, the next moment she would be reduced to ash.

Daiyuan could not hold on any longer. After Yang Kai scooped her up, her beautiful eyes blinked weakly twice; her face was deathly pale, and then she fell into an unconscious swoon without a sound.

She had pushed herself to such an extreme!

Yang Kai gave a rueful laugh; he had not earlier examined Daiyuan's internal condition closely, assuming that if she could keep going she hadn't been pushed to her limits, so he had been walking in front.

Had he known, he certainly would have acted sooner.

Daiyuan's body was soft and pliant, springy to the touch and redolent with an alluring fragrance. With the Rainbow Handkerchief gone, the sweat-dampened form of the woman was fully exposed to Yang Kai, and the array of her charms was enough to startle anyone.

If not for her face, this woman would undoubtedly be a calamity-class beauty!

Shaking his head slightly, Yang Kai stimulated his Saint Yuan to form a defensive dome that enveloped her. He lifted her at the waist and pressed forward step by step into the interior of the Third Layer.

……

Daiyuan woke slowly; before she opened her eyes she could feel herself immersed in an environment thick with Spiritual Qi. The once-depleted Saint Yuan in her body now seemed to have recovered considerably; the air at her mouth and nose was clear and pleasant, and a faint medicinal scent lingered.

"Purple Jade Fruit!" Daiyuan's heart leapt. From that aroma she immediately identified the source and hurriedly opened her eyes, looking around.

Her gaze was instantly drawn to a purple spirit tree not far off, its branches like grapevines. The vine twined among several large trees, and from its tendrils hung clusters of pale purple, grape-like berries that glowed with a crystal clarity and gave off an intoxicating scent.

"Not yet ripe…" Daiyuan showed a trace of disappointment. Purple Jade Fruit was a genuine Void King-Grade Lower-Level spirit fruit; when ripe it should be suffused with purple light and look like exquisite purple jade. Whether used for refining pills or consumed directly, it greatly benefited martial practitioners.

The most prized aspect was that these spirit fruits grew like grapes, in clusters; once they appeared they came in numbers.

So the instant she smelled the fragrance, Daiyuan was startled awake—these things were exceedingly rare.

Looking more closely, Daiyuan noticed distinct signs of recent picking at several spots among the vines. Realizing this, she immediately understood it must have been Yang Kai who had plucked them, and she recalled the events before she lost consciousness.

Turning her head she found Yang Kai standing not far away. Unfortunately, for some reason his expression was sullen; he seemed displeased, brow furrowed and lost in thought, unaware that she had awakened.

"Junior Brother Yang!" Daiyuan rose slowly and greeted Yang Kai.

"You're awake." Yang Kai turned his head; his dark expression eased considerably, though some displeasure still lingered between his brows.

"Where is this…" Daiyuan asked, eyeing the surroundings. Before her spread verdant greenery and vigorous life; birdsong and blossoms everywhere. Rolling mountains rose in all directions, their peaks piercing the clouds with no end in sight. Thick Spiritual Qi mingled with the mists, shrouding the peaks and making the place look like the foundation of some great Sect.

Daiyuan was inwardly shocked: the place where their Liuli Sect was located was a spirit mountain treasure land too, but compared with the scene before her it was like a small lamp beside a great sun.

If some power were to take root here, how advantageous would it be for its disciples to cultivate, enjoying such heaven-sent opportunities?

Was there really such a treasure land in the world? From the looks of the mountains, there seemed to be no trace of human activity—this land had seemingly gone unused.

Yet as she looked up, Daiyuan noticed the sky was veiled by a crimson curtain that hid the stars and moon, which left her puzzled.

"Don't doubt it; this is still Flowing Flame Sandland," Yang Kai said lightly.

Daiyuan frowned, as if understanding: "We've returned to the Second Layer?"

"Second Layer?" Yang Kai glanced at her, then shook his head with a smile. "No, this is the Fourth Layer!"

"What?" Daiyuan cried out. "The Fourth Layer?"

"Yes, the Fourth Layer—the heaven-and-earth treasure area!" Yang Kai's voice took on a much more serious tone.

"Ah…" Daiyuan covered her small mouth, and after the initial shock her beautiful eyes trembled violently as she whispered, unable to help herself, "There really is a Fourth Layer heaven-and-earth treasure area…"

Yang Kai tilted his head. "You knew there was such a place?"

Daiyuan was momentarily stunned, then shook her head and said, “I’m not sure. It was only a guess I made earlier. Since the First Layer’s Heat-Flame Zone was followed by an area of heaven-and-earth treasures, then after the Third Layer’s Heat-Flame Zone, there might also be such a region. The current situation merely confirms my earlier speculation.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly at her words.

Not only had Daiyuan formerly harbored such suspicions; he had too. But when he actually set foot in this place his mood became exceedingly complex.

Unlike Daiyuan's excitement at discovering new lands, after his initial surprise Yang Kai felt mostly disappointment.

He had not found the environment he most desired!

A few days earlier, after Daiyuan had fainted, Yang Kai had carried her ever deeper. He had watched the scorching environment approach what he needed, but unexpectedly he had broken directly through the Third Layer and plunged into the Fourth Layer.

At first Yang Kai had been prepared to accept the situation; coming to such a place was not bad, and refining Profound Yin Moon Water did not have to be rushed.

But to his great disappointment, the heaven-and-earth treasures hidden within this Fourth Layer were surprisingly scarce. After searching for several days he had only found a single Purple Jade Fruit tree and picked two clusters of its fruit just an hour ago.

This angered him; he had a vague sense of being swindled.

He hadn't found the environment he needed, and the heaven-and-earth treasures here were so rare—of course he couldn't feel any satisfaction.

The only consolation was that here he could finally part ways with Daiyuan. Having made up his mind, Yang Kai said, "Miss Daiyuan, I've roamed this area for several days and done a bit of reconnaissance. I found no traces of demonic beasts and no formations, so this place is very safe."

Daiyuan was startled, thought for a moment, then smiled sympathetically. "So Junior Brother intends to act alone?"

"Yes." Seeing she had read his intention, Yang Kai did not hide it.

"I see…" Daiyuan nodded gently. "Very well. I was planning to search for a certain Spiritual Herb here. Since it's so safe, I won't trouble you. I've delayed you enough on this journey."

"It's nothing. Then we'll part here. I hope you find what you're seeking, Miss Daiyuan." Yang Kai said, bluntly making his exit and striding off into the distance.

The day the Flowing Flame Sandland closed was drawing near; he had to quicken his pace.

He had only gone a short distance when Daiyuan suddenly called after him, "Junior Brother Yang!"

"What is it?" Yang Kai called back.

Daiyuan bit her red lip and smiled slightly. "I would like to come and thank you properly some other day. Would Junior Brother be willing to receive such a visit?"

Yang Kai's expression flickered, then he replied as usual, "Of course. Ask Wei Guchang where I live when you come."

"Very well." When Yang Kai agreed, Daiyuan's face brightened; she seemed much relieved.

"By the way," Yang Kai remembered, "although the elite disciples of the great powers have already withdrawn and likely no one else will intrude into this Fourth Layer, you should remain cautious. I have a feeling that that fellow from Star Emperor Sect will come here."

"That man…" The image of the cold-faced man rose in Daiyuan's mind. She parted her lips and said, "If it's him, it's nothing—people from Star Emperor Sect never trouble others without reason. As long as I don't provoke him, I'll be fine."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and said no more. He swayed a few times and then vanished from Daiyuan's sight, diving into the rolling mountains ahead.

"He's going deeper?" After Yang Kai left, Daiyuan murmured to herself, "It seems this Junior Brother seeks to cultivate some extraordinary secret technique if he must go further inward."

With her quick wit she immediately realized Yang Kai intended to press on to see if there was a Fifth Layer Heat-Flame Zone. Since even the Third Layer's environment could not satisfy his needs, his hopes must be pinned on the Fifth Layer.

Standing where she was for a while, a bittersweet smile crept to Daiyuan's lips.

She had always thought herself fairly strong—though not on the level of Fang Tianzhong or Qu Changfeng, she believed herself somewhat superior to most who dwelt in the Third Layer of the Saint King Realm. Now, compared to Yang Kai, she finally understood she had been viewing the world from the bottom of a well.

There truly were such astonishing, peerless talents in the world.

And that fellow from Star Emperor Sect was also an uncanny existence. When he seized the Red Candle Fruit, Daiyuan had been startled by each of his moves; the combat prowess he displayed was terrifying.

She could only wonder which of the two would prevail should they ever meet.
