## Chapter 879 — Not an Outsider

Bound by someone as formidable as Li Rong, even Saintess Nan, with all her world-shaking prowess, couldn’t exert herself — so there was no real danger of her harming An Ling'er.

Night was falling, yet the entire Nine Heavens Sacred Land buzzed with activity.

Thousands of disciples returned from the Sacred Tomb, and there was much to be done.

The Ancient Demon Clan, having come to the peak with Yang Kai and Xu Hui, began constructing their future homes.

Tonight was destined to be sleepless.

…

A full month later, the once clamorous Sacred Land gradually quieted down.

The mess left behind after the yao withdrew was cleared up, and the Nine Heavens Sacred Land settled back into steady growth; on the mountain where the Ancient Demon Clan lived, houses of all sizes had been built, stretching in an elegant cluster.

While the Ancient Demon Clan built their homes, Xu Hui and the others offered much help, for which Li Rong and her people were deeply grateful.

After more than a month together, Xu Hui and the other elders found their views softening and their instinctive aversion to the demons lessened.

They discovered that these demon-followers of Yang Kai differed from them only in race and the nature of their internal energy; in almost every other way they were much the same.

They hadn’t run amok or caused trouble; every one of the demon folk had behaved responsibly.

Gradually, disciples of the Sacred Land and the demon folk learned to coexist peacefully.

Yang Kai was pleased with the state of affairs. He hadn’t had a moment’s rest over the past month, shuttling between matters of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Ancient Demon Clan — handling one thing after another until he was exhausted, with no time even to converse with the Divine Tree.

Now that there was finally a stable foothold, Yang Kai wanted to bring the Divine Tree out of the Black Book Space.

But considering the difficulty and the physique of the Ancient Demon Clan, he gave up on the idea.

The Yang-attribute energy the Divine Tree radiated was simply too intense; even the Ancient Demon Clan would likely find it overwhelming. And with Yang Kai’s current strength, forcing the Divine Tree out of the Black Book Space would probably leave him completely spent.

Only in rare moments of leisure could he send his mind into the Black Book Space, speak a few words with the Divine Tree, and soothe its loneliness.

From the Divine Tree he also learned that the two strange jet-black spheres continued to suck in the essence of rare ores; the rare ores Yang Kai had left in the Black Book Space were almost entirely consumed, reduced to dust, their inner essences completely gone.

Over such a long time, the vein-like marks sprouting inside those jet-black spheres had become increasingly obvious and connected, like the channels of a body.

Yang Kai had a vague feeling they were unusual, but he still didn’t know what function those ore-devouring jet-black spheres served.

One day, while Yang Kai was discussing matters with Li Rong and Xu Hui, a disciple of the Sacred Land reported: “Saint Lord, someone outside the peak requests an audience.”

“Who?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Sect Master Wu Jie of the Netherworld Sect!” the disciple reported.

“Wu Jie?” Xu Hui slammed the table and rose, barking, “What nerve! I haven’t settled accounts with him for what he did last time, and now he actually dares to come to our Nine Peaks of the Sacred Land? He’ll refuse the road to Heaven and force his way into Hell — how many did he bring with him?”

The disciple hurriedly answered, “Only one person, but he seems to have captured two unknown fellows and brought them here unconscious.”

Xu Hui snorted coldly. “He comes alone and still dares show his face. Does he think the Sacred Land means nothing? Saint Lord, let me go teach him a lesson!”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “No need. Wu Jie is not an outsider.”

Xu Hui was stunned, unable to immediately understand why Yang Kai would say that.

Back then that man had joined Zhang Ao and Cao Guan and others in kicking the Sacred Land when it was down; Xu Hui hated him to the bone, wanting to flay him alive, feed on his flesh, and drink his blood to vent his hatred.

Yang Kai didn’t rush to explain; he told the disciple, “Bring him in.”

After the disciple left on the order, Yang Kai finally began to explain slowly.

When Xu Hui learned that Wu Jie had shown favor to Yang Kai two or three years earlier and had followed Yang Kai around recently, he looked odd and said, “I see; I’ve long heard Wu Jie is good at managing relationships and sensing the times — seems the reputation was well earned.”

“That he befriended the master years ago shows his keen vision,” Li Rong said with a tight smile. “Not everyone could see the master’s potential. People like Zhang Ao and Cao Guan are prime examples — they reaped what they sowed and met no good end.”

“Zhang Ao and Cao Guan are dead?” Xu Hui was utterly shocked.

“I forgot to tell you that,” Yang Kai nodded slightly. “The leadership of Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall was wiped out; they’ve basically lost any standing. Wu Jie’s visit now likely means he’s resolved matters with those two forces.”

“They had it coming!” Xu Hui still looked displeased. “I was planning when to take people over and settle accounts, but now it seems unnecessary — consider them lucky. If they’d fallen into my hands, they’d have known what it’s like to wish for death.”

Xu Hui ground his teeth and cursed with great resentment.

Li Rong watched Yang Kai with a small smile, unable to suppress some amusement.

Not long after, Wu Jie strode in from outside clad in black robes, exactly as the disciple had reported, holding two unconscious martial artists by their wrists.

Those two martial artists bore no visible wounds and seemed merely asleep, breathing evenly and serene as if in peaceful slumber.

When he drew near, Wu Jie dropped the two men to the ground and cupped his fist: “Sect Master Wu pays respects to the Saint Lord, to Lady Li… and greetings to the Great Elder.”

Yang Kai and Li Rong smiled and inclined their heads; Xu Hui’s face darkened and he snorted with disdain, clearly not fond of Wu Jie — inwardly thinking him a fair-weather friend, a turncoat who shifted with the wind, sly and untrustworthy, ashamed to be associated with him.

Wu Jie didn’t care.

“Sit,” Yang Kai gestured.

Wu Jie nodded lightly and sat to one side.

A pretty female disciple at once served tea.

After a few sips, Yang Kai asked, “Sect Master Wu, have you come to deal with those two sects?”

Wu Jie’s face lit up and he declared cheerfully, “All thanks to the Saint Lord’s favor. Over the past month I’ve been busy recruiting two thousand new disciples. The less gifted were dismissed after receiving some cultivation supplies. Now, within a thousand li, aside from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, only my Netherworld Sect remains.”

“That must have taken a lot of trickery?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Not much. After killing a few stubborn leaders, things became much easier,” Wu Jie said casually.

“Excellent news — congratulations. Your sect’s strength has indeed grown; now it’s only a matter of time before Sect Master Wu breaks into the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.”

At those words, Wu Jie's expression dimmed and he forced a smile: “Saint Lord, please don’t jest with me. I know my own aptitude — unless some great opportunity befalls me, I’m unlikely to reach the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; my current cultivation is my limit.”

“At least you know your place,” Xu Hui snorted, his eyes full of contempt.

Wu Jie gave an awkward laugh, aware of Xu Hui’s grudge and unwilling to press further. “So I must place my hopes on the disciples below. From now on, the Netherworld Sect will look to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land for guidance. I also hope the Saint Lord and the Great Elder will look kindly on the Netherworld Sect.”

“We’re all one family — no need for words of two houses,” Yang Kai replied with a slight nod.

Xu Hui’s expression softened a touch; a sect leader saying such things eased some of his resentment.

“By the way, these are cultivation supplies taken from Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall. I took the liberty of keeping thirty percent and brought the remaining seventy percent here for the Saint Lord to inventory,” Wu Jie said as he produced several Spatial Pouches and respectfully handed them over.

Xu Hui looked to Yang Kai for approval; Yang Kai gave a steady nod.

Standing, Yang Kai accepted the Spatial Pouches Wu Jie offered and casually swept them with his Divine Sense, his delight evident.

The pouches were packed full of excellent cultivation materials, and from their number it was clear Wu Jie had indeed kept less than thirty percent.

The Sacred Land’s storerooms were empty and in dire need of supplies; Wu Jie’s timely delivery felt like a life-saving gift.

Xu Hui was greatly satisfied; at last a smile cracked his stern face. “Sect Master Wu, you are most kind. I hope our two sects can mend ties and never repeat past mistakes.”

“They won’t. Rest assured, Great Elder — I’m no Zhang Ao or Cao Guan, with a wolf’s heart and a dog’s conscience.”

“That’s best,” Xu Hui nodded in approval; his attitude finally eased.

“There’s one more matter I must report to the Saint Lord,” Wu Jie said, his face turning serious.

“About those two men?” Yang Kai asked.

“Yes,” Wu Jie nodded. “When I entered the Sacred Land today I happened upon them wandering the outskirts, and there seemed to be many others searching for something. I simply grabbed two of them to ask what they were up to.”

“Aren’t they disciples dismissed from Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

“No.” Wu Jie shook his head firmly. “Both have cultivation at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm. If they were from Poxuan Palace or the War Soul Hall I would remember them, but I’ve never seen them before.”

“Wake them and question them — find out what business brought them here,” Yang Kai said, displeased. With so many outsiders prowling near the Nine Peaks in these turbulent times, he wanted them thoroughly interrogated.

Yang Kai sensed the faint scent of conspiracy and it made him uneasy.

Wu Jie snapped his fingers softly near the two men’s ears; in an instant they stirred from their slumber, leapt to their feet with True Yuan surging, and looked at Wu Jie and Yang Kai with guarded vigilance.
