## Chapter 2553 — The Little Girl Courts Death

The Ghost King's strike was truly terrifying; before the attack even landed, the fierce wind alone sliced Yang Kai's skin, making it sting painfully.

Vmmm—

The Myriad Sword hummed, and Yang Kai swept his sword upward, fiercely channeling his Emperor Yuan. The sword's radiance was dazzling and brilliant.

With a clang, sparks flew in all directions.

The Ghost King's charging form paused slightly, its massive body even leaning back a bit. This showed just how powerful Yang Kai's blow was. The feedback from the Ghost King made Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen's eyes narrow in disbelief.

At the same time, Yang Kai was sent flying like a rag sack, crashing into the pristine light barrier before coming to a stop.

A flash of shock appeared in his eyes; he hadn't expected the Ghost King to be so formidable.

Seeing Yang Kai suffer, Yin Lesheng couldn't help but laugh loudly, "With me and Senior Uncle Hua working together, this Ghost King's strength rivals the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm! Yang Kai, what do you have to fight me with? Prepare to die!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he once again drove the Ghost King to pounce at Yang Kai, clearly intending to take his life before Yang Kai could catch his breath.

Sss sss sss sss—

The massive, pitch-black scythe swung down again, unstoppable in its might, cleaving Yang Kai's body cleanly in two.

Hua Feichen raised his brows and said without hesitation, "It's a phantom!"

With the two working together, their senses seemed sharper than ever. They instantly realized that Yang Kai had already slipped away, and the figure cleaved in two was nothing more than a phantom left behind.

"Ghost King, return!" Yin Lesheng shouted without thinking, rapidly changing his hand seals. The Ghost King suddenly exploded into a cloud of black mist and vanished eerily from sight.

The next moment, Yang Kai's figure appeared out of nowhere three zhang in front of Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen. His expression was cold, and the Myriad Sword in his hand flickered with sword light, ready to strike at the two.

Yin Lesheng met his gaze, sneering without a hint of panic.

Behind Yang Kai, a mass of black mist suddenly appeared. Within it, the Ghost King's body flickered in and out of view, its massive scythe sweeping horizontally.

Yang Kai frowned, a chill running down his back. He instantly realized the Ghost King had caught up behind him.

He hadn't expected this thing to be so troublesome, sticking to him like a maggot on bones. He had planned to capture the ringleaders, taking out Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen, avoiding a direct clash with the Ghost King.

But now, it seemed that plan wouldn't work.

In a rush, Yang Kai could only slip away again. When he reappeared, he was already more than ten zhang away.

"What's the point of jumping around, Yang Kai? If you're a real man, fight me head-on!" Yin Lesheng roared in anger. He found that although he'd sealed off this space, preventing Yang Kai from using his space techniques to escape, within this sealed area, Yang Kai still moved freely, slippery as an eel and impossible to catch.

Yang Kai sneered, "You and your Senior Uncle teamed up, with all these Senior Brothers helping with the formation, and you still have the nerve to talk about fighting me head-on? Are you out of your mind?"

Yin Lesheng's face turned awkward, but he stubbornly retorted, "If you have the guts, call your own Senior Uncle and Senior Brothers. I won't say a word against you."

Yang Kai snorted, "Twisting words to suit yourself." He pointed the Myriad Sword straight at Yin Lesheng, provoking, "Yin, old grudges and new, today we'll settle them all. If you're still a man, face me one-on-one. Let's see if I can beat you so badly your own mother wouldn't recognize you."

"My mother died long ago, why bring her up!" Yin Lesheng snapped.

Yang Kai mocked, "You're the top disciple of the Netherworld Sect, a dominant figure in the Great Wilderness Star Domain. What, you don't even have the guts to duel me?"

Yin Lesheng's face darkened, anger surging in his heart. Even the Ghost King he controlled flickered with unstable light.

Whether as the top disciple of the Netherworld Sect or as a ruler of the Great Wilderness Star Domain, Yin Lesheng had his pride. If anyone else said this, he'd have slapped them already, but facing Yang Kai, he truly didn't dare to fight one-on-one.

He'd seen Yang Kai's strength and skill; he was no match and would only suffer if he acted rashly.

"Junior Nephew, he's stalling for time!" Hua Feichen said coldly, glancing intentionally at the Ghost King.

The Ghost King's body was crawling with countless Soul-Devouring Worms, their relentless gnawing echoing in the air. It was clear they were devouring the Ghost King's energy, and in just this short span, Hua Feichen could already sense the Ghost King growing noticeably weaker. If they kept dragging things out, Yang Kai might not be the one to fall—the Ghost King would perish first.

Once the Ghost King was destroyed, all the Netherworld Sect disciples present would suffer backlash, including Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng.

"I know!" Yin Lesheng gritted his teeth.

"No time to waste, act now!" Hua Feichen shouted, forming seals again.

Yin Lesheng cooperated, glancing outside at Lin'er.

"Useless!" Lin'er snorted coldly. A whole group fighting one person, even setting up the Heaven Net Sealing Array, and still being beaten so badly—how could the Netherworld Sect be so incompetent?

If she'd known earlier, she wouldn't have asked them to help her vent her anger.

Now her anger hadn't been vented, but had only built up more, especially seeing Yang Kai showing off over there. Lin'er was so furious she could barely breathe, wishing she could go teach him a lesson herself.

She didn’t stop to consider that, as a mere Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, she had no real ability to teach Yang Kai a lesson. Didn’t she see how even Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng were treating him like a deadly threat?

"Awooo—" No one knew what secret technique the two Emperor Realm experts from the Netherworld Sect used, but the Ghost King suddenly howled at the sky. The scythe in its hand surged with power, and its massive form floated to Yang Kai in an instant, sweeping at him fiercely.

Yang Kai said impatiently, "Again and again, do you really think this attack will work on me?"

He was no longer in a hurry to capture the ringleaders. All he needed was to keep dragging things out with the Netherworld Sect. Before long, the Soul-Devouring Worms would finish devouring the Ghost King, and by then, he wouldn’t even need to lift a finger—the Netherworld Sect disciples would meet their own miserable end.

So, as he spoke, he prepared to dodge again.

But just then, the pristine light barrier that had been shrouding the earth suddenly stirred. The enormous shadow of the ancient tree trembled, and a thick branch broke free from the barrier, whipping toward Yang Kai like a bolt of lightning.

Yang Kai couldn't have expected such a twist.

He didn't know how this pristine light barrier was formed, thinking it was a trick set up by the Netherworld Sect.

Previously, it hadn't shown any unusual movement, just sealing the space, so Yang Kai hadn't been on guard.

In that moment of carelessness, one of his arms was caught by the branch.

Startled, he struggled hard, but couldn't break free.

It didn't stop there. As the shadow kept shaking, three more branches whipped at him, precisely wrapping his other arm and both legs.

In an instant, Yang Kai was entangled by four branches, stretched out in a large cross shape.

The branches tightened, dragging him into midair.

Yang Kai suddenly turned his head, glaring at the red-clothed girl called Lin'er. Her face was a bit pale, hands forming seals, clearly activating some secret technique.

She was behind this!

Realizing this, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and shouted, "Little girl, you're courting death!"

Because of her background, he'd only given her a light warning in Desolate City before. Seeing her now mixed up with the Netherworld Sect, he hadn't planned to do anything to her, just deal with the sect and ignore her.

Who could have guessed she had such a strange trick, catching him off guard? Now Yang Kai truly felt murderous intent.

Lin'er was startled by Yang Kai's murderous glare, but quickly steeled herself and snapped back, "Even if you kill me, I won't back down!"

Yin Lesheng laughed, "Well done, Miss Lin'er! Let's see how this brat escapes now!"

Hua Feichen said nothing, but poured his Emperor Yuan into controlling the Ghost King with Yin Lesheng, driving it toward Yang Kai.

The massive scythe swung down, death's aura rushing forth.

Yin Lesheng's eyes widened, eager to watch Yang Kai die.

Hua Feichen smiled, thinking it was finally over. If Yang Kai could escape this, it would be beyond belief.

The attack came in a flash. Yang Kai's pupils shrank to pinpoints, and he shouted, "Dragon Transformation!"

A deafening roar erupted. A golden dragon head appeared behind Yang Kai, shaking the world. Under the dragon's might, all living things bowed.

The Ghost King, charging at him, paused, its attack halting for a moment.

Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen gaped at the roaring dragon head, a sense of utter absurdity rising in their hearts.

Lin'er fared even worse. With the lowest cultivation, she nearly collapsed under the dragon's pressure. The power of the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl was greatly diminished.

She was never able to unleash the full power of this Imperial Treasure, nor could she maintain it for long. Now, under the dragon’s pressure, the pristine light barrier began to show signs of collapse. Fortunately, Lin’er had seen her share of grand events, so she gritted her teeth and held on, refusing to let Yang Kai break free from her bindings.

The golden dragon head flickered and dove into Yang Kai's body.

Instantly, Yang Kai's hands turned into dragon claws, patches of dragon scales appeared on his exposed skin, and even a golden dragon tail formed behind him, sweeping the ground and leaving deep grooves.

Boom—

The Ghost King's attack landed squarely on Yang Kai's chest.

Creak creak—

The grating sound made one's teeth ache, sparks flying everywhere.

The Ghost King's blow didn't seem to hit flesh, but struck the hardest Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai spat a mouthful of blood, but shockingly, his blood was gold, not red.

And on his chest, a wound a foot long appeared, deep enough to see bone.

Even with the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique greatly boosting his defense, taking the Ghost King's blow head-on was still hard to bear.
