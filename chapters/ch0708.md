## Chapter 708 — Who Is This Pretty Face?

To possess such astonishing alchemy without a master… if, like me, he had studied under this Senior for more than ten years, to what heights would he have grown?

"If you ask me, he probably taught himself from some handbooks and notes left by predecessors," the old man guessed offhand, yet his guess was uncannily close to the truth.

"Master, I'm so disheartened!" Zhai Yao hung his head listlessly, utterly dispirited.

"Heh heh, you needn't be like that." The old man smiled kindly. "There are always a rare one or two people in the world born with supreme aptitude. He belongs to that sort. Though no one guided him, his control over spirit formations and True Yuan, and his understanding of material combinations for pills, are all his own—he's a very promising seed."

"Sigh." Zhai Yao heaved a heavy sigh. "Master, it's been just over a year since I came out of the Great Wilderness, yet I've already been defeated by two different people. The last loss was understandable—the other party has a different physique—but this time I truly lost in a muddled way."

What had originally been a contest fought with full confidence unexpectedly ended with Yang Kai producing Pill Patterns at the crucial moment, leaving him utterly routed.

"Now you know there are heavens beyond heavens and people beyond people," the old man said in a low voice.

Zhai Yao nodded repeatedly. "Rest assured, Master; from now on I will apply myself all the more to alchemy and will not disappoint your expectations."

The old man stroked his beard and smiled, nodding.

A flash of acuity, however, passed through the depths of his eyes—there was something he did not say to his disciple.

From the Spirit-Grade Pill Zhai Yao had brought back this time, the old man detected some familiar traces—marks in the method of sketching the spirit formation by the alchemist during the refining process.

Those traces seemed somewhat similar to the technique used by that young girl who had defeated Zhai Yao a year ago.

Were the two connected in some way? The old man pondered, his curiosity about Yang Kai deepening; he could not help forming the idea of meeting him.

Two days later, when Cang Yan and the others finally returned, Yang Kai realized at once that the faces of these senior uncles were not looking very good.

After sipping some tea to rest, Li Wan sighed heavily. "It seems we underestimated the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's temptation to experts of the Transcendent Realm. This matter is rather troublesome."

"How so?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"There are too many people. Right now at that mountain there are at least a hundred Transcendent Realm experts gathered, all waiting for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower to bloom. When the day comes, that number will likely triple," Cang Yan inhaled lightly.

Yang Kai's expression changed.

Over three hundred Transcendent Realm experts — even if only a tenth of them were Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, that would still be thirty of them.

Although Cang Yan and the others were not weak and their realms were certainly not low, under such circumstances it would still be very difficult to escort Yang Kai up to Wangtian Cliff and monopolize the Thousand-Year Demon Flower.

It might even end in total annihilation.

A talent like Yang Kai is rare; Cang Yan and the others had to consider whether to take such a risk. If they could not bear the consequences, it would be best to leave Fuyun City now.

"Could we find partners to cooperate with?" Yang Kai's expression shifted and he proposed the idea.

"Partner with whom?" Cang Yan slowly shook his head. "Everyone's after the Thousand-Year Demon Flower. Working with anyone isn't realistic. Cooperation means splitting the flower's medicinal liquid. There are four of us; who knows how much medicinal liquid the Thousand-Year Demon Flower will yield? If it's insufficient, disputes will break out."

"If there are those who won't go for the flower's medicinal liquid, then we could cooperate with them, right?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"There are no such people."

"There are."

"You mean that kid?" Fei Yu considered, understanding whom Yang Kai meant.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded.

"Which kid? What's going on?" Li Wan blurted. "During the days we were gone, you all weren't staying in the inn, were you?"

"Ah, that's a small matter." Fei Yu hastily changed the subject. "We did meet a very interesting little fellow."

"Tell us about it." Cang Yan perked up.

Yang Kai immediately recounted what had happened after meeting Zhai Yao. The senior uncles listened in amazement. For Zhou Liang, an expert who had reached the Saint Realm, to be so courteous and even expel his own concubine for someone—Zhai Yao's status must be extraordinary.

Moreover, that youth was not even Zhou Liang's guest but the guest of a demonic expert named Ao Gu; for Zhou Liang, a human, to stand up for him was all the more intriguing.

Though they had not seen him, from Yang Kai's description everyone seemed to sense a huge, weighty shadow lurking behind Zhai Yao.

"Can that be trusted?" Cang Yan asked gravely.

"I believe him." Yang Kai nodded.

"To be honest, I believe him too. That kid's all right," Fei Yu smiled, lips pursed.

"Since you all say so, then it's believable." Cang Yan nodded heavily. "The other side also wants to cooperate with you?"

"He said as much."

"It seems they are not confident about ascending Wangtian Cliff under the gaze of so many strong ones. If so, it wouldn't hurt to go find him and talk—each party could take what they need." Cang Yan's eyes narrowed and gleamed. "However, if he is not after the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's medicinal liquid, then what is he after? We must find out. It's not that I distrust him; one must always be wary."

"Should I go to the City Lord's Mansion to talk to him?" Yang Kai asked; he was very curious about some of the words Zhai Yao had said earlier. The fellow seemed to know secrets others did not, and Yang Kai wanted to know where he had learned them.

Besides, Yang Kai more wanted to know what power stood behind Zhai Yao.

Zhou Liang would not have treated such a young man so courteously for no reason; the only explanation was that someone stood behind Zhai Yao, and Zhou Liang was currying favor with that person.

If Yang Kai's guess was correct, that person would be Zhou Liang's teacher, and at this moment should be a guest inside the City Lord's Mansion!

That person would certainly be a top alchemy master; conversing with such a figure would also be to Yang Kai's benefit.

With his senior uncles' permission, Yang Kai and Fei Yu left the inn and headed toward the City Lord's Mansion.

They had not gone far when they were met by an old man and a young girl; the old man was Du Wan, and the youngster was, of course, Mi Na. Mi Na bounced over to speak with Fei Yu for a moment, then turned her lovely eyes to Yang Kai and exclaimed in astonishment, "Who is this pretty face?"

Yang Kai's face darkened. "Who do you think?"

Mi Na instinctively covered her mouth and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, her delicate finger pointing at him. "You… how come you…"

Abruptly remembering, she clapped her hands. "Oh right, it was Elder Du who gave you that thing—I almost forgot."

As she spoke she reached out and pinched Yang Kai's face, clicking her tongue in wonder.

Elder Du and Fei Yu stood by chuckling, making no move to stop her.

"You bastard, you stir up such a racket as soon as you arrive in Fuyun City; you're never quiet wherever you go." Mi Na laughed coquettishly, toying with Yang Kai's fair face, excited.

"You've heard about it?" Fei Yu asked Mi Na, her eyes shining.

"Mm, all of Fuyun City knows." Mi Na nodded slightly and kept kneading Yang Kai, as if she had found a new toy.

Yang Kai bristled, saying darkly, "If you pinch me again I'll strike back, you little girl—don't get any ideas!"

Saying that, he cast a meaningful glance at her full, perky bosom, his gaze laced with lascivious malice.

Mi Na immediately stepped back, crossing her arms over her chest, biting her teeth and scolding, "Pervert."

"Elder Du, where are you headed?" Yang Kai ignored the madcap girl and turned to Du Wan.

"There's an alchemical competition in the square, hosted by the Alchemists' Association. I'm taking Mi Na to participate—it's rare to go out, so I want her to gain some experience." Du Wan explained, then asked with expectation, "Young friend Yang, do you want to enter? Although registration has passed, with my recommendation you can still participate."

"Go, go—it's all young people. If you go, you could bring some glory to our Giant Stone City's Alchemists' Association!" Mi Na urged eagerly.

Yang Kai pinched his nose and smiled wryly. "Elder Du, you deliberately made a detour to come here, didn't you?"

Du Wan chuckled. "You saw through us?"

It was unlikely Du Wan and company had happened to pass this way. When he and Fei Yu were wandering the market district that day, Yang Kai had heard of the alchemical competition and knew the arena was not in this direction.

Because of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, countless alchemists had gathered in Fuyun City; it was a rare scene. The Alchemists' Association naturally wanted to stage something to showcase the generation's strength and provide a platform for exchange and competition.

"Actually, I made a bet with a few old friends, wagering on whose young disciple is the mightiest. They're all heads of their respective city Alchemists' Associations. The wager is anything inside their Spatial Pouches—these old fellows have deep foundations." Du Wan's face gleamed with enticement.

Mi Na added, "If you win the final victory, the Alchemists' Council will also give huge rewards: rare medicinal materials, and even a supreme pill furnace."

As she said this she shook Yang Kai's arm and coaxed, coquettishly, "Brother Yang Kai, go—I so want that pill furnace; it's a Saint-Grade pill furnace."

A chill ran down Yang Kai's spine and he shivered. Reluctantly he said, "If Elder Du says so, how can I refuse? Stop shaking me—you're making me dizzy."

"You agreed? Wonderful!" Mi Na immediately became excited.

Yang Kai thought for a moment. "Mm — if I do win the final victory, I would like to choose the medicinal materials I need from among the wagers and rewards; I don't want the pill furnace."

"That's fine." Mi Na bobbed her head quickly like a chick pecking.

"Don't be so excited; there are many great alchemists in the world. We might not end up triumphant."

"We will," Mi Na declared confidently. "This is a contest among the younger generation of alchemists; no one can be more skilled than you."
