## Chapter 30 — The Salted Fish’s Great Comeback

The next day, a group of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples gathered together to practice. They chatted and laughed, enduring the hardship but finding joy within it. Suddenly, one of them looked terrified in a certain direction, trembling as he said, “Su… Su Shao…”

“What’s wrong?” Su Mu asked, puzzled.

“He’s really here.”

“Who’s here?” Su Mu grew impatient. Following the direction the man pointed, he saw Yang Kai strolling over with a smile, carrying a broom.

The group’s expressions changed drastically.

“Good morning, fellow junior brothers. So diligent to be up early training,” Yang Kai greeted them cheerfully. He glanced specifically at Zhao Hu and Li Yuntian, both sporting bruises and swelling. They instinctively shrank back, recalling the weight of Yang Kai’s fists, their skin tightening in fear.

“What do you want?” Su Mu’s face darkened. Although he knew Yang Kai’s purpose, he still asked, for the young man had boasted loudly in front of everyone just yesterday.

“To challenge,” Yang Kai replied with a dazzling smile. Scanning the crowd, he kindly asked, “Which junior brother hasn’t been challenged these past few days? Come, spar with your senior brother.”

The rules of Lingxiao Pavilion were clear: fellow disciples must spar without evasion or cowardice. Any violation meant expulsion.

With this rule in place, no matter how much Su Mu’s subordinates feared Yang Kai, if they hadn’t been challenged in the past five days, they had to accept the challenge, even if it meant being soundly beaten.

That day, Zhang San, one of Su Mu’s men, was thoroughly thrashed. Yang Kai left satisfied, while Su Mu cursed under his breath at his retreating figure.

The next day, Yang Kai came again. Li Si was beaten up, and Yang Kai left content once more. Su Mu’s threats were constant but ineffective.

On the third day, Yang Kai returned. Wang Wu was the unlucky one, bruised and battered. Yang Kai once again left with a smile, while Su Mu’s curses grew feeble.

By the time Yang Kai came again, Su Mu had learned his lesson. He neither cursed nor threatened him anymore, knowing such actions were useless. This senior brother was utterly unafraid of his intimidation.

Su Mu only glared at him with eyes full of deep-seated hatred.

After being tormented repeatedly, Su Mu’s group of junior brothers finally rebelled.

Yang Kai’s bullying had gone too far. Among the many ordinary disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, he singled out their group alone. It was clearly an act of retaliation. Moreover, there were quite a few of them. Yang Kai challenged one each day, cycling through them, never returning empty-handed.

Yang Kai’s actions stirred a great uproar throughout Lingxiao Pavilion. This Trial Disciple’s salted fish turnaround captured everyone’s attention. Ever since he defeated Zhao Hu, it seemed he had changed completely—no longer the pushover anyone could easily bully. Every day he sought out a fight, winning each time. Rumors even spread that Su Mu was utterly powerless against him. Su Mu was no ordinary person; he had powerful backing.

If even Su Mu was helpless against Yang Kai, how could the other ordinary disciples dare to provoke him? As a result, no one dared challenge Yang Kai anymore. Everyone knew this senior brother, who had been demoted to Trial Disciple after three years and served as a mere sweeper, was not to be trifled with.

As these rumors spread, everyone speculated about Yang Kai’s true strength. Some guessed he was at Body Tempering – Fourth Stage, others said Fifth Stage, and some even believed he had reached the Eighth Stage, considering he had defeated Li Yuntian, who was at Body Tempering Realm – Seventh Stage.

But no one truly knew Yang Kai’s real cultivation level.

Only Xia Ningshang knew! She had been secretly observing every one of Yang Kai’s fights these past few days. With her strength far surpassing his, she could clearly discern his realm.

Yet, precisely because she saw it, Xia Ningshang was secretly alarmed.

When Yang Kai defeated Li Yuntian, he was only at Body Tempering Realm – Fifth Stage. In less than four days, he had already reached the Sixth Stage.

How had he cultivated so quickly? Even with her special constitution and numerous pills taken at the Body Tempering Realm, her progress had never been this rapid.

To uncover the mystery, Xia Ningshang even secretly staked out Yang Kai’s small hut, trying to discover how he cultivated. But no matter how she observed, she found nothing unusual. He merely practiced his fist and kick techniques, often exhausting himself to the point of collapse, drenched in sweat.

Xia Ningshang couldn’t understand why the basic Lingxiao Pavilion techniques were so taxing for him. These were not mysterious skills.

After several days of investigation, Xia Ningshang still found no clues. Though she sensed there were secrets about Yang Kai, she felt embarrassed to continue spying. After all, spying on others was hardly something to boast about—especially when the subject was a frequently shirtless young man.

Each time, Xia Ningshang’s face flushed with embarrassment and shame. Yang Kai always stripped off his upper clothes when training, as if his bony frame was something to show off.

“But it seems he’s a bit more solid now, with some flesh gained,” she thought, recalling the first time she saw Yang Kai naked. Comparing then and now, her face blushed deeply.

Yang Kai, of course, was unaware he was being watched these past days. After finishing his sweeping duties at Lingxiao Pavilion each day, he would seek out Su Mu’s group for a challenge, then return to his hut to cultivate. Though dull and monotonous, his days were fulfilling.

The incense burner’s effect was extraordinarily strong. Coupled with half an hour of daily practice of the Body Tempering Chapter, he had reached Body Tempering – Sixth Stage yesterday. The qi sense within his body had begun to solidify.

Just one more step, and he would reach Body Tempering Realm – Seventh Stage. At that level, a small amount of Primordial Qi would form within the body. Though little, it was still Primordial Qi. With it, he could begin cultivating martial techniques, no longer limited to the dull Long Fist and Whip Kick.

From Seventh to Ninth Stage of Body Tempering Realm was the phase where Primordial Qi was born and grew, flowing through the meridians and integrating them. Only by forming a Great Cycle of Primordial Qi within, bridging heaven and earth, could one break through the Body Tempering Realm to reach a higher level.

Practicing as if courting death, Yang Kai felt his growth daily—a very real sensation. By today, he could already perform his fist and kick techniques under the incense burner’s fragrance, though not for long. Morning practice of the Body Tempering Chapter was also much easier than before, with progress every day.

If conditions permitted, Yang Kai believed he would soon truly rise.

However, he discovered an awkward problem: his supply of Desolate Deadwood Herb had run out. Though he still had some Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers left, they were running low.

These past days, Yang Kai had been extremely frugal, but the consumption of herbs was simply too rapid. Before he knew it, they were gone.

With no other choice, Yang Kai made a trip to the Contribution Hall, exchanging all his remaining Contribution Points for more herbs.
