## Chapter 186 — Miao Lin's Arrogance

In the dark cave, where no light penetrated, Yang Kai and the four from Yunxia Sect took positions on either side, each focusing on recovering their strength. Occasionally, sounds of rustling echoed from outside, the strange insects scurrying about.

The four from Yunxia were clearly unwilling to sit idly by. After recovering for a while, they planned to charge out. While recuperating, they whispered among themselves, wary of Yang Kai eavesdropping.

After nearly a day and night, they finally decided to act. Stealthily, they rose and slowly approached Yang Kai. Yu Aoqing's pretty face was filled with murderous intent, and Miao Lin was similarly inclined, while Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian followed closely behind.

Just as they were less than a zhang away from Yang Kai, he suddenly opened his eyes, a smile that was neither a smile nor a frown on his face as he looked at them.

The four from Yunxia halted.

“Let me guess,” Yang Kai said leisurely, his voice deliberately low to avoid alarming the insects outside. “You don’t actually want to kill me, do you?”

Yu Aoqing’s expression was frosty as she replied, “You know?”

“Of course I know. Isn’t this your usual tactic? Letting others go in front to bear the risks while you stay behind? I’ve experienced it many times along the way. You want me to lead the charge out, right?”

Yu Aoqing slightly nodded, her voice cold. “Since you know, don’t think of resisting. Otherwise, you’ll regret it.”

Yang Kai scoffed, “I may not be your match, but if you want to kill me, it won't be that easy. If you’re not afraid of the commotion attracting those insects, feel free to try.”

Yu Aoqing’s expression faltered. The reason she was being so cautious was precisely to avoid drawing the attention of the strange insects outside. Yang Kai clearly understood her intentions, hence his low tone.

“Let me warn you, don’t have any ideas about me. If you want to escape, do it on your own!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. “I will not be your vanguard!”

“Don’t you want to escape?” Yu Aoqing, seeing her intimidation failing, softened her tone slightly. “Those insects brought us here. It can’t be anything good. Staying here will only lead to death. If you charge out with us, there might still be a chance for survival!”

Yang Kai decisively shook his head. “I want to escape, but I don’t want to be used. Moreover, even if I lead the way and we all escape, how do I know you won’t turn on me?”

“I can give you my word!” Yu Aoqing, seeing a glimmer of hope, quickly pressed on. “As long as you go in front, if we manage to escape, no one from Yunxia Sect will trouble you.”

“Don’t bother. I won’t trust a woman with a heart like a snake and scorpion,” Yang Kai replied with a cold laugh, closing his eyes again.

What the four from Yunxia didn’t know was that the outside had already been enveloped by the mist created by those strange insects, but Yang Kai was well aware. Even if he could miraculously escape this insect lair, he wouldn’t be able to run far.

Since that was the case, why waste energy?

“Qing Sister, kill him! He’s stubborn and useless to keep alive!” Miao Lin had long harbored murderous thoughts towards Yang Kai. Seeing that he could not be used, he naturally wanted to strike.

Yu Aoqing took a deep breath and slowly shook her head.

In the current situation, escaping was the priority. This boy, while detestable, would surely attract the insects if they killed him. It would be a loss greater than the gain.

“You all escape your way, I won’t ruin your plans. Hehe, I also want to see if you can truly leave this place!” Yang Kai grinned at Yu Aoqing.

“May you be gnawed and bitten by those insects, dying without a burial place!” Yu Aoqing cursed viciously at Yang Kai, turning to the other three. “Let’s go!”

The four from Yunxia quietly left the cave. Perhaps due to the night, the few large insects guarding outside were not disturbed by their movements, remaining dumbly in place.

Soon, their figures vanished into the passage.

But not long after, a fierce sound of battle erupted outside. Mixed with the shouts of the four from Yunxia, it was evident they had exposed their whereabouts and were targeted by the strange insects.

The sounds of fighting gradually faded away until they disappeared completely.

Yang Kai wore a cold smile, remaining undisturbed as he continued to sit in meditation.

In truth, escaping this insect lair was not difficult, as these insects were not particularly formidable. The four from Yunxia could have run out when their tracks were discovered, and Yang Kai could certainly do the same. The only thing trapping him was the bizarre mist, the source of which he could not fathom, possessing immense lethality that made him wary.

After about two hours, Yang Kai heard heavy footsteps approaching from outside.

He opened his eyes and saw Yu Aoqing entering, her hair disheveled and looking utterly exhausted, followed closely by Luo Qianqian and then Miao Lin.

Zhang Yu was absent, likely in dire straits.

After the insects brought the three back, the perimeter guards had become much stricter.

At this moment, the three from Yunxia had lost all their previous arrogance, leaving only despair and exhaustion. Their bodies bore numerous wounds, looking utterly tragic.

They had indeed escaped the insect lair, but were pursued relentlessly by the overwhelming swarm of strange insects, ultimately being surrounded after exhausting their strength, and then brought back here.

Yu Aoqing and Luo Qianqian crouched on the ground, trembling, while Miao Lin was no better off.

Casting a sideways glance at Yang Kai, Yu Aoqing feared he would take the opportunity to mock them, but Yang Kai completely ignored her, continuing to meditate.

“Qing Sister… what happened to Zhang Yu? Where did those insects take her?” Luo Qianqian asked, her voice trembling.

“How would I know?” Yu Aoqing replied somewhat impatiently.

“Are we just going to abandon her?”

“Abandon her? How can we care for her when we can barely protect ourselves?” Yu Aoqing clenched her fists. When Zhang Yu separated from them, she had not died, only suffered serious injuries, and was then dragged down another passage by those insects. What fate awaited her?

Yu Aoqing did not know.

Just as the two were conversing, a piercing scream suddenly echoed through the passage, a sound so tragic it was as if the person were undergoing unspeakable torture.

It was Zhang Yu’s voice!

Yu Aoqing and Luo Qianqian’s faces turned pale, their bodies shaking even more violently. Miao Lin sat down with a thud. “What happened to Zhang Yu? Who is torturing her?”

The screams continued, clearly enduring unimaginable pain.

The two girls quickly covered their ears, no longer daring to listen.

Yang Kai remained indifferent. Although the disciples of Yunxia Sect were far from decent, and had even supported Yu Aoqing's use of ordinary people as expendable scouts along the way, still—killing was one thing. Forcing someone to endure such torment before death was far too cruel.
Especially since this torment was not inflicted by humans.

Zhang Yu’s screams gradually weakened, soon disappearing altogether.

“Ha ha, we’re doomed. We definitely can’t get out,” Miao Lin said, somewhat dazed. Among them, his strength was the weakest, only in the Qi Movement Realm. If it weren’t for Yunxia Sect wanting to extract information about Hidden Island from him, he wouldn’t have been brought along.

He had thought it was an opportunity to shine within the sect, but unexpectedly faced disaster, now trapped in a dead end. How could Miao Lin, a debauched young master, withstand this?

“It won’t happen. We will live and get out. Sister Qing will lead us out, right?” Luo Qianqian shook her head vigorously, her naive belief evoking pity.

“We can’t get out. No one can leave alive,” Miao Lin said, lost and hopeless.

“Shut up!” Yu Aoqing snapped coldly.

She turned to look at the calm Yang Kai, comparing him to her own junior brothers and sisters, and suddenly realized that this young man had a mental fortitude stronger than anyone present.

From beginning to end, he showed no signs of panic or unease, simply sitting there quietly. His composure was remarkable.

But Yu Aoqing did not believe he would willingly accept death!

Time slowly passed, and the panic of Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian spread, reaching a peak of fear, both becoming somewhat neurotic.

Yu Aoqing, while stronger in mental fortitude, was not far behind. She crouched in a corner, hugging her knees, trembling incessantly. At this moment, she regretted deeply, wishing she had not followed the crowd to explore Hidden Island, regretting not seeking her father immediately when the ship broke apart. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have fallen to this state. With Yu Xiuping protecting her, no matter what, it would have been better than her current predicament.

But in that chaos, Yu Aoqing did not know if her father was still alive. After all, even a supreme elder like Ding Jiazi had perished under the attack of that massive tentacle. For her father, a True Essence Realm Ninth Layer cultivator, to die there would not be unusual.

Father, if you are alive, where are you? Your daughter is on the brink of death.

Calling to the heavens yielded no response, calling to the earth was in vain! The proud Yu Aoqing could not help but shed tears.

It was unclear how much time passed, just as Yu Aoqing was dozing off, she suddenly heard heavy breathing sound in front of her.

Yu Aoqing was startled, opening her eyes to see Miao Lin approaching her with a somewhat crazed expression, his eyes burning with fervor and unmasked desire.

“Miao Lin, what are you doing?” Yu Aoqing shouted coldly, instinctively shrinking back.

“Sister Qing…” Miao Lin licked his dry lips, grinning. “Junior Brother is deeply in love with you, doesn’t Sister know?”

Yu Aoqing frowned tightly, noticing something was off with Miao Lin. It seemed he was under immense pressure, his mental defenses crumbling.

“Sister, a celestial beauty like you is someone Junior Brother admires greatly. I dream of you every night,” Miao Lin continued to close in on Yu Aoqing, professing his feelings passionately, but then abruptly changed tone, “In my dreams, we are honest with each other, turning the world upside down, how blissful it is!”

This made Yu Aoqing feel a mix of anger and shame, and she slapped Miao Lin’s shoulder hard.

Miao Lin was unable to withstand it, flying out in response, but Yu Aoqing was already exhausted, and this slap lacked power, naturally failing to injure Miao Lin.

As he stood up, Miao Lin still lewdly smiled as he approached Yu Aoqing again, shamelessly saying, “Junior Brother knows Sister’s noble status, always looking down on others. Because of this, Sister probably hasn’t experienced the joys of love, right?”
