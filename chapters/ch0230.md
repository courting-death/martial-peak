## Chapter 230 — Parting Ways

“How strong are you?” Wu Chengyi continued to inquire.

“Separation and Union Seventh Stage!” 

As soon as these words were spoken, Yang Kai clearly saw a hint of concealed disdain and impatience in Wu Chengyi's eyes. It was no wonder; among the surviving martial artists, who did not possess True Essence Realm? Yang Kai’s strength at Separation and Union Seventh Stage was indeed somewhat lacking.

Ye Qingsi from the Shura Sect also revealed a trace of surprise on her delicate face, clearly not expecting Yang Kai's strength to be so low.

She had thought that surviving alone in this perilous foreign land for over half a year meant that Yang Kai was at least at the True Essence Realm level. However, upon hearing him claim to be only at Separation and Union Seventh Stage, it was hard not to be shocked.

“Yang brother, are you really only at Separation and Union Seventh Stage?” Ye Qingsi pressed further.

Yang Kai nodded and urged the Yuan Qi within his body. As the fluctuations of his Yuan Qi spread out, his realm became immediately clear.

Many martial artists around were taken aback, followed by a series of light laughs.

“What are you laughing at?” Shu Xiaoyu felt indignant for Yang Kai and couldn’t help but scold them. This group of blind fools! Although Yang Kai was merely at Separation and Union Seventh Stage, his combat power was stronger than many at True Essence Realm.

Yang Kai had effortlessly killed two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts and four Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts in a flash before her and Chen Xueshu, taking only a few breaths of time.

Though there were various reasons that allowed him to achieve such a feat, his own strength was undoubtedly formidable.

No one knew better than Shu Xiaoyu and Chen Xueshu just how powerful Yang Kai was. Having such a master join them was a blessing for this group! It was ridiculous that they were unaware and even dared to mock Yang Kai.

Shu Xiaoyu felt anger rising in her heart but said nothing more. She was not a foolish girl; how could she expose Yang Kai's true capabilities?

“Given that you are only at Separation and Union Seventh Stage, how have you survived for so long?” Ye Qingsi asked, her face filled with confusion and shock.

“I accidentally fell into a valley and spent over half a year finding my way back up…” Yang Kai shrugged.

Upon hearing this, the laughter around them grew louder, and Shu Xiaoyu's chest heaved with indignation. Yet, she felt powerless to refute.

Wu Chengyi's expression was cold, and he spoke bluntly, “Your strength is too low to be of much use. Since you are someone brought back by Chen, you should act together with Chen and the others. At least you can hold back one or two Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts; that’s not entirely useless!”

After saying this, Wu Chengyi turned and left in a hurry, unwilling to say more to Yang Kai.

“I won’t stay.” Yang Kai frowned. After coming out of seclusion this time, he only wanted to find someone to inquire about the current situation. He had been brought here by Chen Xueshu against his will. Now that he had understood the situation, he naturally wanted to leave.

Moving with so many people was too conspicuous. If they all came from the same sect, it would be fine; they could genuinely care for one another. But who knew if they were all of one mind? With his realm being the lowest among them, if any danger arose, he would likely be sent out as cannon fodder.

How could Yang Kai entrust his life to others?

If he acted alone, although there would still be dangers and uncertainties, Yang Kai was confident that with his current strength, as long as he was careful, he would be fine.

Even if surrounded by those from Tianlang Kingdom, he could easily escape using the Wings of Yang Flame. Why should he mix with these people?

Moreover, Yang Kai had another layer of concern.

That was the presence of Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba. If they were to discover the existence of the Shura Sword, it would certainly lead to trouble. Though the likelihood was low, it was still something to guard against.

Neither his own intentions nor the current environment allowed Yang Kai to act with this group.

“What did you say?” Wu Chengyi halted his steps and turned to look at Yang Kai, narrowing his eyes as he asked, “You want to act alone?”

“En!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Yang brother…” Chen Xueshu's expression changed, and he stepped forward to speak softly, “It’s too dangerous to be alone. You should stay with us, Senior Brothers and Sisters. It’s much safer than being on your own.”

His words were sincere, without a hint of insincerity.

Ye Qingsi also advised, “Yang brother, don’t be stubborn. You should stay. Although this is our first meeting, I genuinely feel a connection with you. Over the years, no one has ever made my Junior Brother and me feel this way. I don’t want you to encounter any misfortune. Right, Zhou Ba?”

The towering man nodded slightly, his expression stern.

“Thank you for your kindness.” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “But I’m used to being carefree. It’s a bit constraining for me to work under someone else.”

“Everyone has their own aspirations; there’s no need to force it!” Wu Chengyi turned around, hands clasped behind his back, and said, “However, before you leave, you must leave your pills behind.”

Yang Kai and Chen Xueshu's expressions turned cold.

It seemed that Yang Kai's earlier display of the Healing Pill had indeed caught others' attention.

Chen Xueshu frowned and said, “Wu brother, isn’t this inappropriate?”

Wu Chengyi replied indifferently, “What’s inappropriate about it? He’s only at Separation and Union Seventh Stage and will soon die under the attacks of those from Tianlang. At that time, the Healing Pill will only fall into the hands of the enemy. It’s better to leave it for our use!”

Shu Xiaoyu sneered, “Wu Chengyi, you’re being a bandit!”

Ye Qingsi frowned, looking displeased at Wu Chengyi along with Zhou Ba, but they said nothing further.

Wu Chengyi sneered, “Being a bandit? Just look around; how many people are injured and have no Healing Pills? Their strength will be significantly reduced. Only by healing quickly can we protect ourselves from the attacks of those from Tianlang! I’m taking his pills not for myself, but for the sake of our whole group!”

Chen Xueshu angrily retorted, “Wu Chengyi, don’t speak so righteously! If you truly want to take them by force, don’t blame my Senior Brothers and Sisters for not agreeing.”

Wu Chengyi glanced disdainfully at Chen Xueshu and arrogantly said, “What if you don’t agree? Do you want to fight me?”

The atmosphere instantly became tense, filled with the smell of gunpowder.

“I also think this is inappropriate.” Ye Qingsi smiled sweetly, her beautiful eyes fixed on Wu Chengyi, “This is already tantamount to banditry. Wu Chengyi, you are a distinguished disciple of a major sect; you shouldn’t be so overbearing.”

Wu Chengyi’s eyes narrowed slightly, seemingly wary of Ye Qingsi. After hesitating for a moment, he chuckled lightly, “In that case, let everyone decide! Let’s see whether it’s better for him to keep his pills or leave them behind!”

“It should be left behind!” someone immediately echoed, “Wu brother is right; with his low strength, he’ll likely die alone in a few days. The pills will only benefit those beasts from Tianlang if he keeps them.”

Upon hearing this, many nodded in agreement.

Another person said, “Chen brother, don’t be angry. I’ll speak fairly! This brother from Lingxiao Pavilion indeed has too low a strength. If he’s willing to stay and work together with us, it’s fine to keep the pills with him. If someone gets seriously injured later, he certainly won’t be stingy. But since he insists on acting alone, I think it’s indeed reasonable for the pills to be left behind!”

With the majority agreeing with Wu Chengyi's stance, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu’s expressions turned quite ugly.

Chen Xueshu sneered, “Do you all really think this is right? If your life-saving pills were to be taken, what would you do?”

Many couldn’t help but frown. Although they knew this approach was unethical, the Healing Pills on their bodies were indeed running low. Having an extra bottle might save a few lives at a critical moment.

“Do not impose on others what you do not desire for yourself!” a cold voice rang out.

Yang Kai looked up to see a girl from Wan Hua Palace nodding slightly at him.

Wu Chengyi snorted lightly, not expecting so many people to speak up for Yang Kai. Reluctantly, he said, “If that’s the case, I’ll give him a choice. Don’t say I’m bullying him.”

Coldly looking at Yang Kai, he said, “Stay with us, or leave your pills behind. You may choose!”

“Hehe…” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, staring at Wu Chengyi as he slowly said, “I choose the latter!”

He had no intention of acting with this group, and Wu Chengyi’s arrogance only made Yang Kai feel more disgusted. Why would he stay to be bullied?

However, with so many people watching him now, if he left without giving up the pills, those who had pressured him earlier would certainly not agree.

“This is your own choice!” Wu Chengyi boldly extended a hand toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head, sneering.

Wu Chengyi’s expression changed, “What do you mean?”

“I only said to leave the pills behind, not that I would give them to you. Don’t get ahead of yourself,” Yang Kai coldly laughed, reaching into his robe. He took out a bottle of Healing Pills and threw it to Chen Xueshu, saying without turning his gaze, “Senior Brother Chen, the pills are with you.”

Chen Xueshu caught the pills, his face filled with barely concealed anger.

Yang Kai was brought here by him, yet now he was being bullied by so many. How could he remain calm?

Taking a deep breath, Chen Xueshu said, “Brother Yang, don’t worry. I know who should take these pills!”

The implication was clear: those who had sided with Wu Chengyi earlier should not expect to lay their hands on this bottle of Healing Pills.

Yang Kai nodded and cupped his fist toward him, saying, “We shall meet again. I hope there will be a next time!”

After saying that, he activated his movement technique and swiftly left like a shooting star.

“You probably won’t see him again!” Wu Chengyi snorted coldly, retracting his stiffened hand and darkening his expression. He loudly declared, “Everyone, if you’re rested, let’s set off! Those from Tianlang will surely attack again. If we don’t leave now, it will be too late.”

More than thirty people quickly gathered, and under Wu Chengyi’s careful arrangements, they cautiously made their way through the dense forest.

No one noticed that a person at the back of the group silently concealed himself and, after the group had moved far away, he determined a direction and hurriedly pursued.

That direction was precisely where Yang Kai had departed.

Although Yang Kai had left a bottle of pills behind before leaving, how could a disciple coming for training possibly have only one bottle of Healing Pills? Moreover, Yang Kai had previously mentioned that he had accidentally fallen into a valley and spent over half a year finding his way back up. Since that was the case, he surely hadn’t encountered any battles during that time. Without battles, he wouldn’t have been injured, and thus wouldn’t need Healing Pills.

Therefore, he must still have pills on him!

This person was precisely sent by Wu Chengyi to intercept Yang Kai and seize the pills from him.

Wu Chengyi was meticulous in his actions, sending only one person, which naturally wouldn’t attract anyone’s attention.
