## Chapter 2273 — Still Good Friends

“Why waste words with him? Hurry up and take him down! I want him to taste every torture known to man. Only by tearing him to pieces will I be rid of this hatred!” Ning Yuanshu shouted fiercely, his face twisted with rage.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui heard this and immediately grew solemn, power surging within them.

“Hold on, you two elders! I’m coming over!” Yang Kai beamed with joy, waving at Gao Shan and Liu Shui as he quickly flew toward them.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui were stunned on the spot, and Ning Yuanshu was equally bewildered, not understanding what madness had seized Yang Kai.

Normally, Yang Kai should be running for his life right now, shouldn’t he? Yet he was delivering himself to them, looking as delighted as if he’d just reunited with close family in a time of crisis. It was baffling.

“Be careful, he might be up to something!” Ning Yuanshu snorted coldly, warning in a low voice.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui nodded, “Rest assured, Young Palace Master. This brat isn’t as strong as Luo Yuan. He won’t be able to stir up any trouble in our hands.”

“That’s best!”

Moments later, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and he appeared before the three, grinning at them.

Ning Yuanshu, seemingly still frightened from being beaten by Yang Kai earlier, shrank his pupils and instinctively retreated a few steps, widening the distance between them.

“This junior greets the two elders.” Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists to Gao Shan and Liu Shui, then looked at Ning Yuanshu and said, “Young Palace Master, we had a little misunderstanding earlier. Why don’t we let bygones be bygones over a drink and laugh off our grudges? We’ll still be good friends in the future!”

“Good friends?” Ning Yuanshu glared at Yang Kai, his cheeks swelling with anger. As he spoke, he leaned his face closer to Yang Kai, “Look at me—do you think I can still be good friends with you?”

Yang Kai leaned back, turning his face away in disgust, “If you have something to say, say it. Why bring your face so close… I’m timid, don’t scare me!”

Ning Yuanshu was completely enraged and roared, “Isn’t this all your doing?!”

“Alright, alright.” Yang Kai waved his hand to cut off his shouting, smiling at Gao Shan and Liu Shui, “Elders, I suppose I’m surrendering now, right?”

“Hmm…” Gao Shan pondered for a moment, then nodded, “At least you know what’s good for you.”

Liu Shui added, “A wise man submits to circumstances. You have a bright future ahead!”

“Heh heh heh…” Yang Kai grinned, “Then you two elders must protect me now. I’m your captive, after all.”

“Protect you?” Gao Shan frowned.

“What do you mean?” Liu Shui was also confused.

But soon, the two understood.

In the void, a figure flashed by—the Artifact Spirit chased after them, stopping a dozen zhang away, holding the Demonic Warhammer and staring at Yang Kai with a sinister gaze.

“Hiss… That aura!” Gao Shan was startled, his eyes grave as he looked at the Artifact Spirit.

Liu Shui’s expression also turned serious, and he shouted, “Demonic Qi!”

Yang Kai nodded, “You two really have sharp eyes. That's right—this fellow's aura is Demonic Qi, the purest, ancient Demonic Qi!”

“How is that possible?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s eyes widened, staring at Yang Kai as if he were joking.

Yang Kai said seriously, “I’m not in the mood to joke with you two.”

Gao Shan said, “No wonder it feels different from ordinary Demonic Qi… But why is there ancient Demonic Qi here?”

Liu Shui was also puzzled.

Yang Kai said, “Can’t you tell he’s not a living being, but an Artifact Spirit in human form? Look at the hammer in his hand—that’s an ancient Imperial Treasure!”

“What?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui trembled all over, their eyes filled with shock as they stared at the Demonic Warhammer. Gradually, their faces showed feverish greed.

Yang Kai pressed on, “You two are highly skilled, but you’ve been stuck at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm for countless years. It’s a tragedy—if you could obtain this Imperial Treasure and comprehend its mysteries, you might break through to the Emperor Realm and become renowned across the world, even a ruler someday!”

Gao Shan shot Yang Kai a cold glance and said, “No matter how glib your tongue is, boy, or how flowery your words are, I still can’t help but be tempted!”

Yang Kai laughed, “Treasure belongs to those with fate. The rabble below can’t handle this Artifact Spirit; only you two have the strength to subdue him! If you can erase his consciousness, the Imperial Treasure will be yours. Good luck—I’m rooting for you!”

After speaking, he leapt back dozens of zhang, pumping his fists to cheer Gao Shan and Liu Shui on.

“Gulp…” Gao Shan and Liu Shui both swallowed hard. They knew the Artifact Spirit was no pushover, but with such a treasure before them, how could they not be tempted?

They exchanged a glance and shouted in unison, “Attack!”

As soon as the words fell, light flashed in Gao Shan’s hand and a Secret Treasure zither appeared. He sat cross-legged in midair, placing the zither on his knees and plucking the strings, producing a sudden, clear sound.

Liu Shui also took out his long flute, placed it vertically to his lips, and began to play.

Two completely different melodies instantly resounded through the world, containing the Dao and perfectly harmonizing, forming a visible shockwave that swept toward the Artifact Spirit.

Yang Kai, not far away, wasn’t targeted, but upon hearing the music, his Divine Sense grew hazy. The sound seemed alive, drilling into his ears and transforming into a strange power that affected his mind.

He steeled himself and circulated his cultivation to resist the sonic attack.

Meanwhile, the Artifact Spirit was caught between the two elders’ sonic assault, bearing the brunt of it. Though he had taken human form, he had little intelligence. The elders’ sonic attack was essentially a soul attack, perfectly countering the Artifact Spirit.

As the music swelled, the red light in the Artifact Spirit’s eyes flickered, and the Demonic Qi around him churned violently. The warhammer he held aloft remained suspended, unable to fall.

Seeing this, Gao Shan and Liu Shui were delighted and pushed their powers even harder, determined to capture the Artifact Spirit in one go.

Ning Yuanshu watched intently, secretly excited, praying for Gao Shan and Liu Shui to succeed soon.

If the elders succeeded, the warhammer would surely be brought back to Fei Sheng Palace. An ancient Imperial Treasure held immense secrets—if his father could comprehend and refine it, his strength would soar, and Fei Sheng Palace’s status would rise, along with his own.

How could he not be thrilled?

On the other side, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, seizing every moment to recover his strength.

Now that Gao Shan and Liu Shui were holding back the Artifact Spirit, he had to make the most of this opportunity.

The Artifact Spirit was fierce, but not impossible to restrain. Yang Kai had simply exhausted himself earlier while collecting Source Crystal ore, leaving him powerless. If given a little time to recover, he could deal with the Artifact Spirit.

On the wild plain, the sounds of zither and flute rose and fell, weaving a marvelous melody. As the music surged, energy gathered and struck the Artifact Spirit, making his light flicker wildly.

The martial artists who had escaped underground were drawn by the commotion and gradually approached, watching from afar.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui saw this and their faces darkened, fearing they would end up doing all the work for someone else—especially when they spotted Luo Yuan among the crowd…

Their anxiety grew.

Their previous fight with Luo Yuan was called a draw, but in truth, both were defeated.

After all, the elders had joined forces, while Luo Yuan fought alone. For a rising star to force two veteran experts to flee in disgrace was a clear victory.

With concerns in mind, the elders exchanged a glance and, in perfect sync, changed the music’s rhythm. It suddenly became martial and fierce, the tempo soaring. As the sound changed, the visible waves of music transformed into an army, like a nation’s troops, thundering toward the Artifact Spirit.

The sound waves raged, blotting out heaven and earth.

“Roar!” At that moment, the Artifact Spirit, who had seemed suppressed by the music, suddenly let out a furious roar. The flickering red light in his eyes stabilized, and an unimaginable violent aura surged forth.

The warhammer he had held aloft fell in an instant.

In a flash, the wind and clouds changed, demonic power surged in the sky, drawn by the warhammer into a vortex that poured down like a funnel.

Boom…

The warhammer struck the void, shattering space like a mirror. A ring of light spread outward, like a blade, slicing through the army formed by the sound waves.

The power of the sound waves vanished like paper, dissipating completely.

Gao Shan’s zither rang out with a sharp, tearing twang as one of its strings snapped, while Liu Shui’s long flute followed with a brittle cracking sound, fissures spreading across its surface.

“Not good!” The elders’ faces changed dramatically as they cried out, hastily channeling their power to resist.

But their strength, under the impact, was like a lone boat tossed in a stormy sea—instantly overturned.

Puff, puff…

Both spat out mouthfuls of blood, their auras instantly weakening.

“Elders!” Ning Yuanshu cried out in terror, his eyes trembling.

“Useless!” Yang Kai cursed, utterly furious.

He had hoped Gao Shan and Liu Shui could buy him a little time to recover, but these two old men, despite their grand display, turned out to be so feeble that they lasted less than thirty breaths before being defeated by the Artifact Spirit.

Worse still, both of their Secret Treasures were damaged. This battle had cost the elders dearly—it would take at least a dozen or even twenty years to recover.

Their actions had clearly angered the Artifact Spirit. Freed from the music’s restraints, the Artifact Spirit raised his warhammer again, runes swirling on its surface as a black light spread, forming a black hole that seemed to swallow the world.

Everyone felt an extremely ominous sensation in their hearts.
