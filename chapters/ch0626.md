## Chapter 626 — How Do You Know?

Yang Kai nodded inwardly; the Duao Alliance warriors were not weak in cultivation, nor lacking in means. They were clearly seasoned veterans of battle formations, and under Yun Xuan's command they displayed a cohesion not to be ignored. Even holding the absolute tactical advantage, a lone Sixth-Tier Gold Devouring Beast still looked insufficient when faced with eight Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

Ji Hong's two-handed axe struck the Gold Devouring Beast's back with a violent clang; sparks flew, yet the impact left only a shallow mark on the plates of its back.

"This hard?" Ji Hong was taken aback. The force that rebounded his hands left them numb; hardening his resolve, he put all his strength into repeatedly bringing down his Secret Treasure great axe.

Clang, clang, clang...

"Ji Hong, fall back!" Yun Xuan cried sharply. The bearded man's action had thoroughly enraged the Gold Devouring Beast. Its crimson eyes fixed on Ji Hong, the silver light between its twin horns flickering, and a visible surge of energy ferociously slammed toward Ji Hong.

Ji Hong's face changed; he held the great axe horizontally before him, the blade just blocking that attack.

Yun Xuan had already charged forward. The spear that Master Ma had repaired earlier was now in her hand. Her full figure looked heroic and valiant; arcs of electricity danced along the spear, and the mine cavern brightened with radiance.

A phantom of a spirit-snake suddenly coiled along the spear, which twisted as if a real serpent; a ruthless aura spread, and instantly the spear transformed into a streak of rainbow light that shot toward the Gold Devouring Beast.

The Gold Devouring Beast, ignoring Ji Hong's strikes, seemed to sense unease. It roared incessantly; its dangerous aura grew countless times more ferocious, its eyes filled with violent madness.

The light between its horns flared violently, and one attack after another surged toward Yun Xuan's spear.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Energy ran rampant, Spiritual Qi fell into chaos; the fierce collisions sent stone fragments flying throughout the cavern. A low buzzing continually echoed—there were clear signs the mine might collapse.

Yun Xuan's expression was indifferent, without a trace of fear. With a sweep of her hand, the spear met each of the Gold Devouring Beast's attacks, colliding and dissipating them in succession.

The other cultivators took the opportunity to pounce, rushing to collectively assault the Gold Devouring Beast without a word.

A strange energy spread outward from beneath the ground.

Pfft, pfft, pfft...

One by one, sharp earth spikes suddenly shot up from below. The Gold Devouring Beast's frenzied momentum deflated like a punctured balloon, and it instantly grew noticeably listless.

Blood flowed and stained the ground. The Gold Devouring Beast lunged forward several zhang, uttering a string of mournful, helpless roars before collapsing to the earth.

From the side it was clear to see several bloody holes in its soft belly—exactly where the earth spikes had pierced it.

Yun Xuan's team surged forward en masse, cutting off the twin horns on its forehead without hesitation, using binding techniques to restrain it, then taking out some healing medicines to apply to its wounds.

Everyone carried out their duties in an orderly fashion, showing not the slightest panic.

Ji Hong trotted back cheerfully, winking at Yang Kai as he teased, "Brother, enjoyed the show?"

"Not bad." Yang Kai nodded faintly.

Up to this point he still had not taken any action, remaining an observer at the side.

"This was only a small skirmish. When you truly join the Duao Alliance, brother will take you to see what a grand battle looks like."

Yun Xuan withdrew her spear and held it in one hand, casting a glance at Yang Kai as she secretly nodded.

She found this taciturn youth to be steady of temperament; even when facing the sudden incident earlier, he showed no sign of panic.

This discovery left Yun Xuan thoughtful; she wondered whether he simply never showed emotion or had truly seen the world.

Clapping her hands, Yun Xuan said, "The Beast-Binding Rings are all used up. If we encounter Gold Devouring Beasts again, everyone be careful—don't get hurt."

The others all nodded and readied themselves with even greater vigor.

"Onward!" Yun Xuan waved and led the way deeper in.

Because Gold Devouring Beasts feed on minerals, they rarely gather in packs; most are solitary, occasionally two or three together. With Yun Xuan's team's strength, they were able to capture them.

The mine went deep and deeper, with countless branching passages. Someone in the squad kept a record of directions to avoid getting lost on the return.

Yang Kai also joined in. Under Yun Xuan's guidance he helped a bit; his calm and composed style of attack caused those warriors to look at him with new respect.

Even Yun Xuan could not help but regard Yang Kai more highly.

She had expected that this youth, born in a remote corner, would be flustered in such situations. For that reason she had kept him behind and not let him act, but reality proved he had some use—at the very least, after he produced that Bone Shield he could single-handedly withstand a Gold Devouring Beast's fierce charge.

Such powerful force was enough to make even Ji Hong, the strongest and most burly in the team, take a step back, yet Yang Kai could take it.

That had a significantly beneficial effect on the others' assaults.

After watching him twice, Yun Xuan felt at ease letting Yang Kai hold the Bone Shield up front as a barrier while the others launched attacks from behind him.

Their cooperation was seamless and efficiency rose greatly; everyone smiled broadly.

Half a day later, the squad took a brief rest.

While resting, Yang Kai sought out Yun Xuan. "Miss Yun, there's something I don't quite understand."

"What is it?" Yun Xuan pursed her lips and smiled. Yang Kai's conduct had won her approval; she genuinely felt inclined to recruit him into the Duao Alliance.

Having such a barrier specialist among her team would certainly increase safety on future missions.

"The Gold Devouring Beasts feed on swallowing minerals, right?"

"Correct. Why do you ask?"

"Brother Ji said they refine what they eat inside and then excrete it, and from the intelligence we got, these Gold Devouring Beasts have been here at least two or three months. Why haven't we found any of their excreted refined minerals along our route?"

Yun Xuan was taken aback. Considering it carefully, she realized Yang Kai was indeed correct.

There had been no sign of any refined mineral along the way.

Yun Xuan was at a loss for an explanation, and a sliver of doubt crept into her heart.

The other warriors were equally perplexed. They had been absorbed in the success of capturing Gold Devouring Beasts and apparently none had noticed this detail.

"Could they be finding a private place, like how humans use a latrine?" Ji Hong blurted.

Yun Xuan's face flushed; she lightly nodded, "That's possible!"

"If we can find that place, wouldn't we harvest a large amount of refined minerals?" Ji Hong stroked his thick beard and pondered.

Yun Xuan's eyes lit up. Capturing this many Gold Devouring Beasts was already a great achievement; if they could locate the refined minerals and sell them, it would be a sizable gain.

The other warriors instantly grew excited, their eyes gleaming with greed. Their fatigue vanished and they became energetic.

"Then let's search and see if such a place exists." Yun Xuan, seeing their expressions, knew they didn't want to rest and smiled as she said so.

Everyone cheered and hastened into action.

Yang Kai frowned; although something felt off, he knew too little of the situation and it wasn't his place to say much.

He would simply follow Yun Xuan's lead.

Pressing deeper into the mine, the number of Gold Devouring Beasts seemed to decrease. While they searched for that hidden place of refined minerals, they unfortunately could not find it.

While searching, Yang Kai suddenly sensed an anomaly.

Focusing his mind and sensing, Yang Kai's face changed; he called out sharply, "Yun Xuan, something's wrong!"

The group, excitedly searching for refined minerals, all stopped and turned to him, puzzled.

Yun Xuan furrowed her brow, "What is it?"

Yang Kai's sudden shout had startled her. She opened her Divine Sense but detected nothing abnormal, and she was somewhat displeased.

On missions it is most detestable to issue baseless warnings; such behavior can cause one's own side to fall into disarray, and if genuine danger then appears, no one may be ready.

Yang Kai did not answer. Continuing his probing with Divine Sense, he perceived a peculiarly strong energy emanating from the depths of the mine.

From his assessment of the energy's intensity, he could conclude this energy came from a Transcendent Realm expert!

An enemy of Transcendent Realm hiding here without being discovered—the terror of such an enemy needs no further words.

Sun Ying had scouted this mine before and knew nothing of such an expert; this showed Sun Ying would not be a match for that enemy.

Even Yang Kai himself had not detected anything during earlier reconnaissance; he did not know what means that person had used.

"What exactly is going on?" Yun Xuan snapped, clearly angered.

"There may be danger here." Yang Kai said with a solemn face.

"Explain yourself clearly." Yun Xuan's expression likewise turned extremely ugly.

"A very powerful expert is hiding here. If you don't want to die, leave at once!"

"How do you know?" Yun Xuan narrowed her brows.

Ji Hong stepped forward, growling, "Brother, you can't be joking about this. There's no danger here."

"I'm not joking." Yang Kai shook his head seriously, scanning their faces and finding that Yun Xuan's small team all looked upon him with distrust.

Yang Kai felt a jolt in his chest and realized his words carried little persuasive power at the moment.

He was only a Seventh Stage Divine Roaming Realm; among this squad his strength was not top-tier. Yun Xuan herself was a Ninth Stage Divine Roaming Realm practitioner—she had not sensed anything, so she naturally would not believe him.

Drawing a shallow breath, Yang Kai looked at Yun Xuan and said, "I came along to repay a favor. If you trust me, take them and leave now. If you don't, there's nothing more I can do."
