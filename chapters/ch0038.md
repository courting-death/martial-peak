## Chapter 38 — Hu Mei’er

The young girl was about the same age as Su Mu and the others; even if she was older, it was only by a little. Yet, the way she walked was with a sway of her hips every three steps, embodying countless charms in one body. Her chest heaved fiercely, dazzling anyone who looked.

Though so young, she already bore the aura of a mature woman—albeit not fully formed, making it seem somewhat unnatural.

“Hu Mei’er!” Upon seeing the girl, Su Mu’s expression shifted involuntarily. His eyes couldn’t help but roam over her figure, and he swallowed hard.

If Su Mu was like this, then Li Yuntian and the others were even worse.

Their eyes clung to Hu Mei’er like leeches, lingering on her exquisite figure with no intention of leaving. Their breathing grew heavy, and their manners fell away. Though the children of the martial world were often unrestrained, women dressed like Hu Mei’er were exceedingly rare. Moreover, she was only a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, tender and supple, her body’s allure overwhelmingly potent.

Li Yuntian and his companions were in the prime of youth, their blood and qi abundant. Witnessing such a provocative scene, their feelings were easy to imagine.

The reckless gazes of the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples did not anger Hu Mei’er; on the contrary, she seemed to enjoy it. Covering her small mouth, she let out a coquettish laugh. “So Brother Su knows Sister, do you?”

Su Mu hastily cleared his throat, forcing his gaze away, his face flushed. “Of course I know her.”

Cheng Shaofeng was the leading Body Tempering Realm disciple of Fengyu Tower, while Hu Mei’er was the leading Body Tempering Realm disciple of the Blood Battle Gang. This girl’s status was extraordinary—she was the youngest daughter of Hu Man, the Blood Battle Gang’s leader.

However, her reputation was far from good. Hu Man paid her no mind, allowing her to stir up trouble outside. Though young, Hu Mei’er commanded countless followers.

What puzzled everyone was why she was entangled with Cheng Shaofeng today. Had he also become one of her favored guests?

Thinking this, Su Mu felt both envious and delighted. Envious that Cheng Shaofeng enjoyed such fortune, delighted that he had been subdued by a woman.

A strange smile crept across Su Mu’s face. When he looked at Cheng Shaofeng again, his gaze had turned disdainful.

This look made Cheng Shaofeng uncomfortable. What made it worse was that the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples’ eyes were still roaming over Hu Mei’er’s body. Cheng Shaofeng’s displeasure deepened. He stepped forward a few paces, positioning himself in front of Hu Mei’er, blocking the brazen gazes of the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.

This seemingly casual move made Hu Mei’er purse her lips in a light smile.

“Su Mu, tell your men to step aside,” Cheng Shaofeng said with a darkened face, no longer bothering with pleasantries.

Su Mu sneered coldly. “The road is wide and open, each to their own side. Are we in your way standing here?”

“Yes!” Cheng Shaofeng’s expression grew even darker.

“And what if I don’t move?” Su Mu shot back defiantly. They had a long-standing grudge and knew each other’s methods well. Su Mu was not afraid.

“Brother Cheng, Brother Su standing here is no big deal. Let’s just take another route. No one would say a word,” Hu Mei’er suddenly interjected, seemingly trying to defuse the tension but in reality fanning the flames.

Su Mu cursed the woman silently. Her intentions were truly malicious. As a member of the Blood Battle Gang, she naturally wished for a deadly conflict between Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower.

Hearing Hu Mei’er’s words, Cheng Shaofeng’s hesitation vanished, replaced by firm resolve. He sneered, “If you don’t move, you’ll regret it.”

Intent on showing off in front of Hu Mei’er, Cheng Shaofeng would not yield.

Hu Mei’er smiled faintly, watching the two with interest before subtly stepping back a few paces.

“Dare to try!” Su Mu sneered at Cheng Shaofeng. Li Yuntian and the others stepped forward in unison, standing behind him.

“You asked for this,” Cheng Shaofeng laughed suddenly, waving his hand to his men. “Attack!”

No sooner had he spoken than Cheng Shaofeng charged at Su Mu, throwing a punch aimed at Su Mu’s face. Su Mu sneered and countered with a palm strike.

Their fists and palms collided. Su Mu staggered back a dozen steps before regaining his footing. Cheng Shaofeng, however, appeared calm and unshaken.

“Have you broken through to the Open Origin Realm?” Su Mu’s face changed drastically. From the qi traces he sensed in Cheng Shaofeng’s punch, it was far stronger than the faint qi within his own ninth-stage Body Tempering Realm body. This was clearly the power of someone who had broken through to the Open Origin Realm.

Cheng Shaofeng laughed heartily as he advanced. “Su Mu, we started cultivating on the same day, but there are differences between people. From now on, you can only chase after me, never surpass me.”

Su Mu’s expression darkened, bitterness filling his heart. Being surpassed by Cheng Shaofeng stung more than any humiliation from Yang Kai. In an instant, Cheng Shaofeng was nearly upon him. Su Mu snapped back to reality and unleashed his full ninth-stage Body Tempering strength, but still could not fend off Cheng Shaofeng’s assault.

Yang Kai had not yet reached the Black Wind Forest when he heard the distant sounds of fighting, mixed with the curses and shouts of Li Yuntian and the others—voices filled with humiliation and sorrow.

Listening carefully, Yang Kai sensed something was wrong. It seemed Su Mu and his group were in trouble.

Realizing this, Yang Kai quickened his pace. When he arrived at the crossroads, he was shocked to see Su Mu lying on the ground, battered and bruised, with a young man riding on top of him, pounding him relentlessly. Li Yuntian and the others surrounded Su Mu, desperately trying to protect him, but to no avail. The enemy’s numbers were many, and their overall strength far surpassed Li Yuntian’s group. The Lingxiao Pavilion disciples were overwhelmed and unable to save Su Mu.

“Submit or not?” Cheng Shaofeng’s fist struck Su Mu’s eye socket, causing it to split.

“Submit my ass!” Su Mu spat blood onto Cheng Shaofeng’s face.

“Submit or not?” Another punch landed, swelling Su Mu’s cheek.

“I submit... I submit to your ancestors!” Su Mu panted heavily but remained defiant.

“Submit or not?”

“Submit to your grandmother’s backside!”

Cheng Shaofeng said nothing more, only punching and then asking, “Submit or not?” Su Mu’s replies were always vulgar curses, which only made Cheng Shaofeng’s blows heavier and fiercer.

Yang Kai stood quietly nearby, watching. He noticed that Su Mu truly had some backbone. Seeing Su Mu now reminded him of himself before—facing an overwhelming enemy, battered and bruised, yet refusing to yield.

This was not foolishness, but a form of perseverance.

Yang Kai had no intention of intervening. Su Mu had apparently offended someone and was now being punished. He had no ties with Su Mu and even had grudges against him; there was no need to get involved.

Yet Su Mu’s unyielding spirit earned Yang Kai’s respect.

Cheng Shaofeng was growing tired. Though Su Mu was battered, his eye socket torn, and mouth full of blood, the disdain and contempt in his eyes remained unchanged.

Hu Mei’er interjected again at just the right moment. “Brother Cheng, let him go. Brother Su has a lot of backbone. Sister likes people like that.”

At this, Su Mu turned his head and cursed, “Wretched wench!”

Cheng Shaofeng sneered coldly. “Backbone? I like that too!”

As he spoke, he casually picked up a stone from the ground and aimed it at Su Mu’s head.
