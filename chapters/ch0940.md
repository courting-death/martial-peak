## Chapter 940 — When Enemies Cross Paths

That human brat really did escape from Sand City, there’s no denying that, but he carries Demon God Golden Blood within him! Xueli hadn’t told anyone this secret.

This time, if she could capture that brat and absorb the Demon God Golden Blood within him, then once she refined it, her strength would rise to the level of Demon Lord. She would take command of the Demon Domain and become the first female Demon Lord in history.

What an honor that would be!

At the thought of such glory, Xueli’s blood began to boil.

“He’s coming this way—bold fellow.” Meng Ge sneered lightly, standing aloft with careless arrogance, showing no sign of retreat.

With two Demon Generals present, they felt invincible.

“Xueli!” Yang Kai called sharply; as they drew closer he recognized the identity of the powerful expert over there, brow knitting. “But there’s another master…this aura seems familiar—where have I seen it before?”

Both he and Meng Ge had the same sudden impression of déjà vu.

“Master, be careful yourself.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded, his mind racing. He’d detected that the powerful aura was approaching from another direction, which worried him—that’s why he had broken off from the group with Li Rong and Han Fei to investigate.

Once he confirmed the newcomer was Xueli, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

This world wasn’t small; there had to be more than one passage connecting to the Tongxuan Continent. He had come from Lingxiao Pavilion—where had Xueli come from?

Moments later, the three of them stepped into view of the two Demon Generals.

Their figures halted; they faced one another across a distance of a hundred zhang.

“Human brat, who would have thought I’d run into you again in this place? Truly, enemies are fated to meet.” Xueli’s beautiful eyes blazed with searing fury, as though she meant to burn heaven and earth itself, while a chilling sneer curled on her lips.

“Indeed, enemies are fated to meet. Last time you escaped, but this time you won’t be so lucky.” Yang Kai gave a cold snort.

“Big words!” Meng Ge laughed loudly, sizing Yang Kai up with interest, frowning. “Kid, haven’t we met somewhere before? Why do you seem familiar?”

“Who are you?” Yang Kai asked, frowning; he too found the man oddly familiar.

He was certain he’d seen him somewhere.

“I am Demon General Meng Ge, under the command of the Demon Lord!” Meng Ge replied proudly.

“Meng Ge?” Yang Kai’s expression flickered; he smiled with a strange chuckle. “No wonder you seemed familiar—so it’s you!”

Meng Ge looked at him suspiciously.

“What’s this? You don’t remember me?” Yang Kai raised his brows and said with a smile, “Do you still recall who it was that slew one of your Soul Incarnations back then?”

Meng Ge’s face changed; upon studying Yang Kai more carefully he finally remembered and barked, “So it was you! I searched high and low without success, only to find you falling right into my lap!”

Years ago, in the Cangyun Evil Land’s Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, a Soul Incarnation of Meng Ge had descended—its cultivation extraordinary—but Yang Kai had used the Locking Demon Chain to shatter it in a single strike.

That was many years past; the memory had grown faint for both Yang Kai and Meng Ge, which is why they only felt a vague familiarity when they met now.

At Yang Kai’s reminder, Meng Ge’s wrath surged like a tidal wave; he sneered, “I’ve hunted you for so long—didn’t expect you to deliver yourself today! Fine, today I’ll avenge that grievance and sate my hatred!”

As he spoke, his murderous qi condensed almost into substance and surged toward Yang Kai.

Xueli’s expression changed drastically. With a wave of her hand, a streak of blood light intercepted in midair, cutting off Meng Ge’s murderous qi. She cried out sharply, “Meng Ge, we agreed beforehand—this human is mine. If you dare kill him, I won’t let you off!”

Meng Ge didn’t care for her threat at all and only sneered, “He will surely die today; no one can stop me. If you interfere, Xueli, don’t blame me for abandoning our old ties.”

The events of that year were regarded by Meng Ge as a humiliation beyond compare, a thorn stuck in his throat that he could not rest until spitting out. Now, upon seeing Yang Kai, the true culprit, how could he possibly restrain himself? He wanted nothing more than to flay Yang Kai alive, tear out his sinews, grind his bones to dust, and scatter the ashes.

That Soul Incarnation had taken him many years to cultivate; once it was slain he still hadn’t managed to form another.

Yang Kai’s action back then had cost him dearly.

“If you want to kill him, you’ll have to go through me first!” Xueli refused to yield.

Yang Kai watched the two Demon Generals bicker with a smile, while Li Rong and Han Fei following him shook their heads.

They hadn’t even started fighting and the Demon Generals were already squabbling—what an embarrassment.

Xueli and Meng Ge stared each other down, neither giving ground; in the clash of their gazes some unspoken exchange passed and their rage inexplicably evaporated.

Meng Ge nodded. “We’ll deal with these two women first—this human can wait.”

“I agree.” Xueli nodded lightly, turning her attention to Li Rong and Han Fei.

The two leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan lifted their brows and stepped out fearlessly.

“Go—no need to hold back.” Yang Kai said coolly.

Li Rong and Han Fei both nodded.

Meng Ge laughed. “Kid, you’re full of hot air—do you not take us Demon Generals seriously? Do you think these two women can defeat us?”

“Last time it was too hasty to truly measure your skill. Let’s test properly now.” Xueli also looked chill and deadly at Li Rong and directly engaged her.

“Fine.” Li Rong nodded faintly; her form flickered into a string of afterimages and, when solid, she had already appeared beside Xueli and delivered a light palm to her chest.

Xueli’s face changed; a great bloodlight flared around her and a thick, bloody aura burst outward from her center.

Strange demonic markings crawled over Li Rong’s face; her delicate palm carried crushing force, breaching the blood aura and striking Xueli’s body.

With a startled cry, Xueli dodged a fatal strike and instantly retreated a hundred zhang away.

Li Rong didn’t pursue; she stood calmly where she was, watching her.

“Your cultivation…” Xueli’s expression shifted in disbelief.

Last time Li Rong had used Demon God Transformation at full strength to match Xueli, but this time, with only a move, Xueli felt tremendous pressure.

That pressure was like what the Demon Lord himself had given her.

It left Xueli bewildered.

She couldn’t shake the feeling that, if she fought this woman now, she would surely die.

The thought made Xueli tremble; she cried out, “You haven’t broken through to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, have you?”

Li Rong nodded. “I have.”

The blood color drained from Xueli’s face; she turned pale.

As a Demon General, she knew better than anyone the strength and strangeness of those who had served the Great Demon God; they had the Demon God Transformation passed down by the Great Demon God himself, and each could fight beyond their rank.

When Li Rong was at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm she could draw even with Xueli; now at the Third Stage, Xueli had no hope of victory.

She glanced urgently at Meng Ge and sucked in a cold breath, scarcely able to believe what she saw.

While she and Li Rong fought, the other woman had already locked Meng Ge in combat. Her bone-deep cold swept across dozens of miles, turning the area into an icebound world of frozen earth and heavy snow drifting like feathers, whitening the ground.

That cold forced even the two Demon Generals to exert their Saint Yuan to resist.

Meng Ge, who had been arrogant moments before, was now tangled by that woman’s ice-cold aura and fumbled, his murderous qi freezing and his movements restrained, his face full of frustration.

Though this woman was slightly weaker than Meng Ge, she was not far behind.

Meng Ge could neither capture her nor take her life.

Xueli’s heart trembled; she realized they had badly underestimated their opponents and lost the initiative.

Whoever dared come so recklessly clearly had some ability.

“Xueli, I think we should withdraw.” Meng Ge had realized it too; he glared at Han Fei in hatred and ground his teeth.

“Leave!” Xueli acted decisively; with a sharp cry she transformed into a bloodlight and fled.

Meng Ge also twisted his body and wrapped himself into a mass of black cloud, a wisp of ghostly qi and murderous intent clinging closely to Xueli’s heels.

The two Demon Generals had made a lot of noise but in less than ten breaths they withdrew.

“No need to pursue.” Yang Kai called out; Li Rong and Han Fei halted and dispersed their Demon God Transformation, returning to their normal appearances.

The two opponents were peak experts of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; if they truly intended to flee, Li Rong and Han Fei couldn’t stop them.

They returned to Yang Kai’s side and together watched the direction the two Demon Generals had vanished with grave expressions.

“That area seems to be a place called Dayan Kingdom.” Yang Kai frowned thoughtfully.

He was only familiar with the Great Han in this world; he had been to the nearby Tianlang Kingdom once, but he knew nothing of the Dayan Kingdom.

“Master, two Demon Generals came here—could they have come from—” Li Rong worriedly began.

“It’s not from the Lingxiao Pavilion’s side. This world must have other passages leading to the Tongxuan Continent, and this one connects straight to the Demon Domain… With the methods of the Demon Race, that place has likely already become a scene of living hell.”

“What do we do now?”

“Nothing. Their intention was probably to go to Zhongdu, but they ran into us and suffered a loss; I doubt they’ll go to Zhongdu now.” Yang Kai drew a breath. “Let’s go back. The world is vast and each has their own fate; I can only protect my own family and friends. Getting them back to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is the priority.”

“As you say, Master.” Li Rong nodded lightly in agreement.

Moments later the three rejoined the main force. Fourth Master Yang asked a few questions, which Yang Kai brushed off.

After a month of travel, the thousand-strong group finally reached Lingxiao Pavilion and reunited with people from three nearby sects.
