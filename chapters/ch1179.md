## Chapter 1179 — Alive and Kicking

The moment Xie Hongwen's words fell, the three of them suddenly heard a thunderous rumbling coming from deep within the valley.

The sound came from a great distance yet reached them clearly, and with every boom the earth itself seemed to shiver.

Xie Jun and Xie Yong exchanged a glance and both felt their faces change; though they hadn't seen what was happening, that kind of overwhelming force made it plain a titanic battle was raging deep inside the valley.

Xie Hongwen suddenly thought of something, froze for a moment, then cried out in delight, "Could that commotion have been caused by that trash?"

Xie Yong frowned and hesitated, "It should be — after all, he's the only one who took this path. By now he has probably been surrounded by Fire Spirit Beasts."

"Good, good, good, hahaha, heaven favors me!" Xie Hongwen laughed arrogantly, waving a hand. "Let's go in and see. I want to watch that bastard die without so much as a grave — otherwise I won't be able to swallow this grudge!"

“Young Master…” Xie Yong and Xie Jun’s expressions changed drastically. The former hurriedly spoke up in alarm, “This valley is definitely one of Flowing Flame Sandland’s forbidden zones — once you go in, there’s no coming out! Since that man is doomed anyway, why should we take such a risk? If something happens to the two of us, it’s fine, but you, Young Master — your life is far too precious. If any mishap were to occur…”

Xie Yong knew Xie Hongwen liked to hear flattering words; if he tried to block him outright it would only provoke him, so he circled the issue and tried to persuade him gently.

Indeed, Xie Hongwen found some of that persuasive logic plausible, but his expression still betrayed eagerness — compared with unseen danger, he was far more eager to see how Yang Kai had died.

In all his years of living, no one had ever dared to humiliate him the way Yang Kai had, let alone toy with his life as if it were nothing. Every time Xie Hongwen thought about it, he couldn’t eat or sleep, seething with rage and resentment. That old bastard Qian Tong was no better — he had clearly been bullied by an outsider, yet instead of seeking justice for him, the man had treated that bastard with courtesy.

Sooner or later Qian Tong would have to pay the price!

Xie Hongwen's mind ran crookedly; the last time Qian Tong saved him from Yang Kai he felt no gratitude, only grievance toward Qian Tong as well.

Thinking this, his fury and his desire to watch Yang Kai's miserable death could not be quelled. His features hardened as he said, "We can go in and watch from afar, that's no problem, right?"

Xie Yong was shocked and about to argue when Xie Hongwen added, "Since a predecessor of the Xie Family once walked away unscathed, why shouldn't we? Or do you two lack confidence? If that's the case, you stay behind and I'll go alone — but you won't get those three hundred thousand Saint Crystals."

That wouldn't do. Xie Yong and Xie Jun panicked; they had taken the job protecting Xie Hongwen specifically because of those three hundred thousand Saint Crystals and the gains they could earn inside the Flowing Flame Sandland. If the Saint Crystals weren't paid, their haul would be cut by more than half.

For a moment they hesitated — they knew the valley's dangers better than anyone. Before leaving Xie Li had clearly warned them this valley must not be entered. Xie Li wasn't worried for their sake so much as afraid they lacked the ability to protect Xie Hongwen.

If Xie Hongwen were to be harmed, they might as well not live.

But with Xie Hongwen so adamant, they could not refuse.

Seeing their hesitation, Xie Hongwen snorted, "If you take me in and we merely watch from afar, I'll add you some reward afterward. With your positions you probably aren't qualified to learn the Xie Family's Shura Palm, are you? As for that Martial Skill, I happen to know a thing or two."

The mention of the Shura Palm instantly shook Xie Jun and Xie Yong out of their doubt; they exchanged looks, each seeing the stir of temptation in the other's eyes.

Xie Hongwen pressed the point, "Rest assured, we only need to watch from a distance. I don't want you to go up and kill him — once he dies we'll withdraw from the valley at once."

Xie Yong sighed heavily and looked to Xie Jun, asking, "What do you think?"

Xie Jun frowned, helpless, "What else can we do?"

If they disobeyed Xie Hongwen there would be no reward; if they obeyed there was some risk but the benefits would be greater. There was no other choice unless they gave up the rewards.

With that they reached an agreement. Xie Yong became serious: "Very well, Young Master, we'll take you in, but you must promise not to act rashly. If anything goes wrong we'll rush you out — please agree to that."

"Fine, I agree. You're so nagging, hurry up — if we're late that bastard might die already," Xie Hongwen impatiently urged.

The two Xie Family warriors had no choice but to continue, one behind the other, protecting Xie Hongwen as they advanced into the valley.

As they pressed forward the quaking grew ever stronger. At first Xie Yong advanced cautiously and slowly, but he could not hold out against Xie Hongwen's constant urging; besides, the valley ahead appeared to hold no immediate danger, so he couldn't help but quicken his pace.

After more than half a day they finally caught sight, from a distance, of a mass of crimson light.

That crimson glow was not the same color as the ordinary heat of the Flowing Flame Sandland; line upon line it converged across a vast area into a sight that made the hairs stand on end.

Looking closer, it was not fire at all but a countless host of Fire Spirit Beasts gathered together, seemingly launching an assault on whoever stood in their midst.

Now and then immense phantom mountain peaks shot up from the throng of Fire Spirit Beasts and then crashed down with terrible force; every strike made the ground convulse.

Xie Yong and Xie Jun stared, dumbstruck.

Though they had, from Xie Li's intelligence, guessed that the valley held many Fire Spirit Beasts, seeing it with their own eyes revealed a truth far beyond their expectations.

No wonder, four hundred years ago, over thirty elite disciples from the great powers were wiped out here — with so many Fire Spirit Beasts, even an Origin Returning Realm who blundered in would fare poorly; moreover, only those of the Saint King Realm could even enter the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Xie Hongwen's earlier bluster evaporated. Confronted by those endless Fire Spirit Beasts he turned deathly pale and froze where he stood, unable to move.

"Hide!" Xie Yong's eyes were sharp; he grabbed Xie Hongwen and pulled them toward a nearby hill a dozen zhang high, while simultaneously producing an exquisite Secret Treasure that released an invisible dome, cloaking the three and sealing off their auras.

From atop the hill the three peered cautiously at the scene below, each of them shaken to the core.

There were so many Fire Spirit Beasts — almost numbering in the ten-thousands. Xie Yong and Xie Jun reckoned that if they were surrounded like that, they would fall within the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

And yet the man called Yang Kai stood in the center of that ring and continued to slaughter without pause.

From the moment they heard the commotion to when they arrived, more than half a day had passed. To constantly employ those mountain-phantom Secret Treasures would consume a vast amount of Saint Yuan. How could he recover? How many Fire Spirit Beasts had he already slain?

Each time one of those mountain-phantom peaks fell, swathes of Fire Spirit Beasts would scatter into nothing.

What shocked them further was that they watched from the hill for two or three hours and the slaughter continued without abating; Yang Kai, surrounded in the center, showed no sign of exhaustion, and the number of Fire Spirit Beasts he killed did not seem to dwindle, maintaining a strange equilibrium.

That obscene, relentless massacre seemed as if it could continue until the end of heaven and earth.

"Why isn't he dead yet?" Xie Hongwen muttered impatiently. From his brief glimpse he had seen that the man in the center was the very Yang Kai he hated; he had expected the fellow to die any moment, yet Yang Kai remained alive and vigorous, which baffled him.

"He's extraordinary!" Xie Yong exclaimed sincerely. Though they knew Yang Kai was an elite, his cultivation was not high, and they had assumed his combat power would be limited.

But now Xie Yong realized he had completely underestimated the man; in single combat Xie Yong could not be certain of victory.

"Xie Jun, kill him now! I can't wait!" Xie Hongwen suddenly shouted in a violent, savage tone.

Xie Yong and Xie Jun had been chosen because of particular talents: the former excelled at tracking; so long as the quarry was not of the Origin Returning Realm, given a thread of trace he could find anyone. In a place like the Flowing Flame Sandland his skill was indispensable.

Xie Jun, however, possessed a different skill — the ability to kill with a single blow.

Against an elite like Yang Kai, an ambush was the correct tactic, and that was Xie Jun's specialty, which is why he had been selected.

Hearing Xie Hongwen's command, Xie Jun shook his head and lowered his voice, "No, Young Master — distance isn't the issue, but that man is surrounded by far too many Fire Spirit Beasts, and that purple shield behind him is also a formidable defensive Secret Treasure. In this situation I cannot kill him."

Even if they struck now it would at best injure Yang Kai; without the certainty of a single fatal blow it would be better not to act and risk alerting him. Xie Jun also feared that if they disturbed the Fire Spirit Beasts the three of them would be surrounded.

He and Xie Yong did not have the resources to keep cutting through tens of thousands of Fire Spirit Beasts.

"Then what are we to do?" Xie Hongwen raged; his enemy wriggled and lived before his eyes while he had no chance for revenge. He seethed, desperate to rush forward and cleave Yang Kai to repay the old grudge.
