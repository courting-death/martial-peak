## Chapter 337 — Defensive Light Barrier

Upon hearing the old man's words, everyone from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect tightened their expressions, casting worried glances at Yang Kai.

Although Tao Yang and Shen Yi believed they had a good rapport with Yang Kai, they were still strangers at this point. If Yang Kai were to abandon them for a better chance at survival, they would hardly have the right to blame him.

Moreover, from Yang Kai's own perspective, cooperating with the old man would undeniably be more advantageous.

Thinking this way, everyone felt a bit uneasy.

Yang Kai leapt from the platform, standing mid-air and attacking the evil spirit alongside the Hu sisters, his expression calm as he said, "I appreciate the good intentions."

The old man chuckled, "Kid, one must look out for oneself in this world. If you cooperate with me, how about we split the source of the evil spirit? I won't take advantage of you."

"Not a good idea!" Yang Kai firmly rejected. The old coot didn't seem trustworthy, and even if he disregarded the Hu sisters' safety, it was unwise to team up with someone potentially deceitful. He couldn't risk getting caught up in a situation where he couldn't escape himself.

"Very well, I won’t force you," the old man replied indifferently, though a cold glint flashed in his eyes.

The audacity of that kid!

Seeing Yang Kai's righteousness, everyone from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect let out a breath of relief, their eyes showing a glimmer of gratitude. Only the Hu sisters smiled sweetly at him.

Setting aside other matters, they all hailed from Wumei Town and had known each other for long. They believed Yang Kai wouldn’t abandon them.

When they traversed that ten-thousand-zhang staircase within the Inheritance Celestial Cave, he never once gave up on his sisters.

A moment later, Yang Kai finally joined forces with the Hu sisters to defeat the evil spirit, leaving behind a ball of evil spirit essence floating before them. Yang Kai tossed out his Purifying Spirit Flask to Hu Jiao’er, saying, "Use this to collect it. Don’t consume it directly!"

"Oh." Although Hu Jiao’er had never used a Purifying Spirit Flask before, at this moment, she was entirely reliant on Yang Kai’s lead. She attempted it and swiftly absorbed the essence into the flask.

Yang Kai flew to the other side, assisting the members of Baoqi Sect and Ghost King Valley.

In a short while, all six evil spirits were slain, but strangely, after being attacked by Yang Kai, the evil spirits seemed to have an instinct to escape.

Just as everyone recovered their breath, many new evil spirits soared up from below, this time in even greater numbers than before.

Everyone was at a loss for how to respond.

In desperation, Yang Kai had to confront two evil spirits alone.

Unable to swiftly kill them, the drawbacks of his True Yang Yuan Qi immediately became apparent.

True Yang Yuan Qi was naturally a sharp weapon against evil spirits, but due to its restraining nature, the evil spirits seemed to possess an instinct that told them Yang Kai was formidable. If they weren’t killed in the short skirmish, they would evade Yang Kai and attack others instead.

Yang Kai was drenched in sweat, akin to a firefighter, darting around the platform where everyone resided, chasing after the erratic evil spirits, causing the situation to become perilous.

Fortunately, the people on the platform were not novices. Moreover, the treasures they carried were numerous, allowing them to turn crises into safety when it mattered most.

As time passed, the pressure and intensity of the battle grew. A batch of evil spirits remained unvanquished, while new ones continuously surged from below.

“Junior Sister, you and the two Junior Brothers assist Brother Yang with the Five Dragon Seal!” Tao Yang quickly shouted upon seeing Yang Kai’s predicament.

“Alright!” Zhao Rong replied, taking out a large seal-like treasure.

This treasure had five dragon-shaped engravings. Once Wei Yihong and the two Baoqi Sect disciples infused it with their True Yuan, accompanied by melodious dragon roars, the five dragon-shaped figures suddenly materialized and burst forth.

The five dragons circled around, each blasting forth a beam of light towards a constantly fluttering evil spirit.

In an instant, that evil spirit seemed to be bound, struggling and writhing in place but unable to escape, only able to howl incessantly.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's expression brightened, and he swiftly dashed forward, holding the Yang Liquid sword, cutting down the evil spirit in a mere moment.

The three from Baoqi Sect were also quick-witted; seeing Yang Kai’s efficiency, they quickly adjusted their hand techniques, directing the five dragons toward another evil spirit.

Though they had divided their efforts, the scene not only did not collapse but instead became increasingly orderly.

During the battle, everyone swiftly took out True Yuan pills to ensure they wouldn’t run out of energy when it mattered.

Yang Kai didn’t need to take any pills; the Hu sisters had consumed Wan Yao Ling Ye, naturally savouring it, hoping for Yang Kai to help them recover later and thus refrained from consuming pills.

The assistance of the Five Dragon Seal reinvigorated the group.

On the platform, both the old man and the disciples of Xiaoyao Sect were having a tough time.

Though they had a Divine Roaming Realm master, they were outnumbered compared to Yang Kai's side, and their treasures were of a lower grade than those produced by Baoqi Sect. Even though they had higher combat power, they struggled against the evil spirits.

The old man observed Yang Kai showcasing his prowess, feeling a wave of humiliation wash over him. He waved his sleeve, summoning a gust of wind that directly shoved two evil spirits toward their side.

Evil spirits would attack the flesh that approached them but wouldn’t return to seek out the old man.

With such a push, the Hu sisters fell into danger.

They were already working together against one evil spirit, and now with two suddenly appearing, they were overwhelmed.

Yang Kai noticed this in the midst of battle and grew furious, realizing the old man was indeed not trustworthy. He swiftly dealt with the present evil spirit and rushed toward the Hu sisters to provide support.

In his haste, he concentrated his mind and flicked his wrist, sending a drop of Yang Liquid flying.

Under his precise control of True Yuan, that drop of Yang Liquid transformed into a semi-circular light barrier, enveloping the Hu sisters within.

The Yuan Qi control technique passed down from Xiao Fusheng shone at this moment!

As soon as the barrier was formed, the two evil spirits surged toward them, and upon contact with the barrier, they sounded as if they had fallen into a frying pan, sizzling with a noise.

Instinctively, the two evil spirits drifted backward.

Even the one the Hu sisters were dealing with abandoned them, leading them to strike at nothing.

Yang Kai looked on in astonishment.

He never anticipated such an outcome.

"Is this even possible?" Cheng Ying from Ghost King Valley cried out incredulously.

"Be careful! They are all coming!" Leng Shan shouted, as the two evil spirits pushed by the old man, along with the one the Hu sisters were engaged with, abandoned Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er and all rushed toward the people of Ghost King Valley.

In an instant, the pressure on them surged.

"Hey, Brother Yang, this isn't right." Shen Yi sighed, noting the absurd misfortune.

Although the Hu sisters were now safe, the predicament for Ghost King Valley had intensified.

"Sorry, I didn’t expect this to happen," Yang Kai replied with a wry smile, grateful he was nearby; had he not been, it could have led to casualties.

By directly entangling two evil spirits, he managed to consider a brilliant idea!

Quickly helping Baoqi Sect’s trio to eliminate the two evil spirits, Yang Kai rushed into the air, standing above everyone.

He ignored their astonished gazes and focused his mind, forcing a drop of Yang Liquid from his Dantian to fling downward.

As before, this drop of Yang Liquid transformed mid-air into a semi-circular light barrier. However, compared to the previous one, it was thinner but encompassed the entire platform.

As the barrier fell, all evil spirits were driven back a distance, circling warily around.

Such a layer of barrier was merely deterrent; if the evil spirits truly turned aggressive, it would likely break soon.

Resolute, Yang Kai continued to force out Yang Liquid, cascading drops down in quick succession.

More layers of barriers descended, perfectly overlapped under Yang Kai’s meticulous control.

After expending twenty drops of Yang Liquid, Yang Kai at last pulled back, satisfied.

The twenty-layered light barrier composed of True Yang Yuan Qi could not be said to be impregnable, but it sufficed to easily fend off these evil spirits.

"This…" Everyone was dumbfounded.

What had been a life-or-death crisis had suddenly transformed into safety—this abrupt change stunned them all.

The surrounding evil spirits merely circled around the platform, not daring to draw closer. Occasionally, a few would attempt to attack, but as soon as they touched the barrier, they were scorched away and promptly retreated.

After a lengthy silence, people turned to look at Yang Kai, their expressions mixed with shock and admiration.

The Hu sisters gazed at him with twinkling eyes, staring intently.

"I didn't expect this idea to actually work." Yang Kai chuckled.

"I'm impressed..." Shen Yi gazed at Yang Kai with admiration.

Everyone nodded in agreement, their eyes filled with endless gratitude.

After the initial shock and gratitude, they finally remembered how much True Yuan it took to create such a solid and thick defensive shield. 

How was it that Yang Kai now appeared unperturbed, as if the effort were trivial?

"Monster! Freak!" Leng Shan pouted.

Everyone else nodded vigorously.

What they didn’t know was that each layer of the barrier was a crystallization of Yang Kai's True Yuan! Twenty layers meant Yang Kai had essentially drained his meridians twenty times! How could the overlapping barrier not be solid?

Moreover, the quality of Yang Kai’s True Yuan was incredibly high, and exceptionally pure.

Realistically, this barrier was roughly equivalent to the full support of ten Divine Roaming Realm experts working in unison! 

Such a defense was a piece of cake against the situation at hand.

"Young man, why don’t you lend this old man a hand too?" The old man felt somewhat unwell upon witnessing Yang Kai’s extraordinary ability. Though he was a Divine Roaming Realm master, he knew he couldn’t reach Yang Kai’s level.

The platform on that side was now as solid as a fortress, impenetrable, ensuring that even if the people on the platform were merely spectators, they needn’t worry about their lives. Conversely, his side was becoming increasingly difficult to manage as the number of evil spirits climbed.
