## Chapter 190 — Heaven-Devouring Insect

Yang Kai could sense that Di Mo and the Insect King were engaged in a fierce battle within the star map space on the back of his hand. Although Di Mo was initially not a match for the Insect King, after the latter had devoured so much energy, it could not resolve it, causing its figure to become bloated and its speed to decrease significantly. Surprisingly, Di Mo was now fighting evenly against it.

As time passed, the energy consumed by the Insect King increased, and Di Mo gradually turned the tide, gaining the upper hand. The Soul-Breaking Spike displayed immense power, forcing the Insect King to retreat step by step, covered in wounds.

The back of Yang Kai's hand felt scorching hot, bearing the impact of such a massive influx of energy, which also harmed him. He looked down and saw that the previously hidden star map was now radiating light, revealing the endless starry sky before his eyes. Within that starry expanse, he could see two figures, one black and one gold, intertwining with each other.

A faint burnt smell wafted through the air; he had infused too much True Yang Yuan Qi, which had already burned his hand.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai persisted, continuing to pour True Yang Yuan Qi inward. The immense primordial energy not only overwhelmed the Insect King but even affected Di Mo.

Di Mo’s spirit and the Soul-Breaking Spike were both sinister entities; True Yang Yuan Qi was their natural nemesis. If it were not for acknowledging Yang Kai as its master, Di Mo would not have been able to carry the Soul-Breaking Spike and hide within his body.

Usually, there were no issues, but now, Di Mo felt as if it might be melted away by the intensely hot and Yang energy.

Anxious emotions swirled within Di Mo, urgently conveying its thoughts to Yang Kai, yet it received no response.

It felt as if it had waited for a thousand years before it finally heard Yang Kai's call.

"Come out!"

Di Mo was nearly moved to tears. Just a moment ago, it had thought Yang Kai would heartlessly eliminate it along with the Insect King, which was why it had not responded. Now, hearing the call from its young master, it was suddenly filled with a sense of loyalty that one would die for a confidant.

Not daring to delay for even a moment, as Yang Kai opened a gap in the star map space, Di Mo instantly slipped out.

The Insect King also wanted to follow, but the gap opened and closed rapidly, giving it no opportunity.

"Star Mark!" Yang Kai shouted in a deep voice, slowly raising his right fist. The pattern of the endless starry sky swirled around him, illuminating the eerie cave with countless stars.

With a loud bang, the entire insect nest seemed to tremble, and Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood.

There were no traces of the Star Mark martial technique left around; Di Mo had seen everything that had just happened. Shocked, it could not help but exclaim, "Young Master!"

"No harm!" Yang Kai coughed up several mouthfuls of congealed blood, his complexion turning extremely pale as he gasped heavily, looking down at his right hand.

The back of his hand was a bloody mess, with veins and white bones faintly visible. After examining it carefully, Yang Kai suddenly smiled.

The Insect King was dead, and there was no longer any trace of its aura within.

First, it had been force-fed so much energy, then severely injured by Di Mo, and finally, it had taken a direct hit from the Star Mark. It was a miracle that it could still be alive.

Di Mo trembled in its heart. After holding back for a while, it sincerely spoke, "Young Master... this old servant admires you!"

It had to admire Yang Kai; that strike of the Star Mark had no target but had directly detonated on the back of his hand.

If there had been even a slight miscalculation, Yang Kai would have undoubtedly died!

Fortunately, Yang Kai had controlled it well. The vast majority of the damage from this move was inflicted on the Insect King, and he had only borne a small amount of the residual force.

To be so ruthless even to himself—this was not something an ordinary person could do. Di Mo was genuinely impressed.

"Stay alert around you; I may need a few days to recover!" Yang Kai tore his clothing and wrapped his injured right hand, hurriedly instructing before closing his eyes.

The power of the Star Mark was immense; back then, Yang Kai had been able to knock a sixth-tier demon beast to the ground with a single punch. Now, even if he had only endured some residual force, it was not something a Fifth Stage Qi Movement Realm martial artist like him could withstand.

His right hand throbbed with pain. His primordial energy was in chaos, and his internal organs felt slightly displaced.

The only comfort for Yang Kai was that although the back of his hand was a bloody mess, the star map space still existed, so he did not have to worry about being unable to use the Star Mark technique in the future.

After considerable effort, Yang Kai finally managed to restore order to his chaotic primordial energy, continuously operating the True Yang Technique to warm the injured area with True Yang Yuan Qi, clearing the congealed blood from his body.

After two full days, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and immediately asked, "Those insects didn’t get in, did they?"

This was his greatest concern. The small insects were not too worrisome; they were low in rank, albeit numerous. However, those larger insects, clearly high-tier demon beasts, were likely not much weaker than the disciples of Yunxia.

"No," Di Mo replied. "Those insects do not dare to enter here; this is the Insect King's lair."

"That's good." Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that his injuries were recovering much faster than before. He unwrapped the cloth around his right hand, and although the back was still a bloody mess, it was clearly healing rapidly, and the white bones and veins were no longer visible.

Di Mo seemed to sense Yang Kai's confusion and spoke, "Young Master, last time you refined a few drops of Congealed Blood Pearls on the right peninsula of Yunxia, your vitality surged, so your recovery is naturally faster now. More vitality means stronger life force."

"So that's how it is." Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

"Young Master, although the Insect King is dead, do you not feel that it left something behind for you?" Di Mo asked a question that puzzled Yang Kai.

"What thing?"

"This old servant does not know; I ask Young Master to investigate carefully."

Hearing the seriousness in its tone, Yang Kai furrowed his brow and immersed his mind within his body to search.

After a while, he indeed discovered something unusual within his dantian—a strand of extraordinary energy was settling there. This was not the True Yang Yuan Qi he had cultivated, nor had it been absorbed by the Indomitable Golden Body. It simply lingered in his dantian, and if it were not for Di Mo’s reminder, Yang Kai would not have noticed it.

"What is this? The residual energy of the Insect King?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Hearing this, Di Mo let out a sigh of relief. "Indeed!"

"What do you know? Speak in detail."

"Young Master, do you still remember that I mentioned before that this thing is somewhat similar to an ancient exotic insect?" 

Yang Kai nodded.

"I was only suspicious before and did not dare to be certain, as I had never seen this thing with my own eyes; I had only heard of it. After fighting it, I gained about fifty to sixty percent certainty. Now that Young Master has sensed something unusual, we can confirm that it truly is that ancient exotic insect."

"What kind of insect is it?"

"Heaven-Devouring Insect!" After Di Mo revealed the name, it hurriedly congratulated, "Congratulations, Young Master, you have obtained another extraordinary treasure. Your fortune is profound, making this old servant envious."

"Be more specific." Yang Kai adjusted his sitting posture, preparing to listen to Di Mo speak of unknown secrets.

"This ancient exotic insect consumes everything, especially fond of devouring various energies and flesh. Moreover, each Heaven-Devouring Insect contains a chance; if someone can refine it, they can gain tremendous benefits. This chance could be an unparalleled cultivation method, an extraordinary martial technique, a powerful secret treasure, or even a way to increase one’s strength without any hidden dangers! The possibilities are endless, and it all depends on one’s luck."

"How can an insect contain such things? I can understand increasing strength, but the emergence of unparalleled cultivation methods and martial techniques is too bizarre!" Yang Kai was astonished.

"Young Master may not know, but each Heaven-Devouring Insect is born in response to the heavens and is extremely rare. They contain the essence of the Heavenly Dao, and the wonders within them are beyond even this old servant's comprehension. Moreover, many unparalleled cultivation methods and martial techniques are naturally birthed by the heavens and exist in the world, waiting for the fated person to uncover their mysteries, so it is not surprising for such things to appear within an insect, especially one as famous as the Heaven-Devouring Insect!" Di Mo spoke with a tone full of envy. After finishing, it noticed Yang Kai had not responded for a long time and exclaimed, "Young Master, do you not believe it?"

"I don’t know, but since it can be refined, after refining it, I will know if it truly has such miraculous properties." Yang Kai neither confirmed nor denied his belief.

What one hears may be false; what one sees is true. Besides, everything known about the Heaven-Devouring Insect was merely hearsay from Di Mo—he didn’t truly know the facts himself.

Once again closing his eyes, Yang Kai communicated with the strange energy settling in his dantian, operating the True Yang Technique to refine it with the scorching True Yang Yuan Qi.

One cycle, two cycles... Day after day, he continuously operated the refining process, and that strand of energy slowly began to change. Initially, it was incompatible with Yang Kai, as it was something left behind after the Insect King's death, not something that belonged to him.

But as the refining continued, it gradually absorbed Yang Kai's aura. Finally, one day, it suddenly split into two, uncontrollably surging into Yang Kai's body. At the same time, Yang Kai felt a sharp pain in the area around his shoulder blades, as if branded by a hot iron.

The pain came quickly and left just as fast. Before Yang Kai could react, it had vanished without a trace.

After carefully examining his strength, he found that he was still at the Fifth Stage of the Qi Movement Realm!

That Di Mo was a big liar! Yang Kai was furious.

Although he did not fully believe Di Mo’s earlier words, he still harbored a faint hope that it would allow him to significantly increase his strength.

But after refining that thing, his strength had not increased at all, let alone any unparalleled cultivation methods or extraordinary martial techniques; he had not even seen a shadow of a secret treasure.

With a sullen face, he opened his eyes, and Di Mo eagerly asked, "Did Young Master gain anything?"

"Gain anything? That thing was refined away." Yang Kai replied irritably.

Di Mo was shocked. "Impossible! This is the heavenly energy left by the legendary Heaven-Devouring Insect!"

"Legends are just to deceive people!" Yang Kai spoke earnestly.

"No, no, no, Young Master does not know. I remember an enemy of mine who refined a Heaven-Devouring Insect and obtained an unparalleled secret method, achieving a great reputation in his lifetime. This is not a legend; it truly happened, and I would stake my life... my divine soul on it." Di Mo was practically swearing an oath.
