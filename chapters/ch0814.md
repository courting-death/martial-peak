## Chapter 814 — They've Come

After a long conversation, both sides were pleased.

The half-jar of Thousand Red Flower Wine was almost finished by the Great Yao Lord, and Yang Kai felt no sting—what mattered more was gaining the yao’s friendship. Though it came with strings, to Yang Kai those strings were insignificant.

With his guidance and repairs, the Huasheng Pool would be stable for the time being, and the spirit formations he planned to teach the Great Yao Lord were only a few sets—nothing major.

Sensing the time was right, Yang Kai excused himself.

The Great Yao Lord did not try to detain him and let him go.

Below Thundertree Palace, the white jade deer Yang Kai had saved waited—after transformation he appeared only as a bashful youth, fair-skinned like a girl, exquisitely delicate.

He thanked Yang Kai personally and seemed very content.

Yang Kai told him it was nothing and, after some pleasantries, flew back toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land the same way he had come.

From entering the Beast Sea Great Forest to reaching Thundertree Palace had taken him three days; returning would likely take the same.

He still had enough time, so he wasn’t rushed.

Two days later, while flying, Yang Kai sensed a domineering aura rapidly approaching; after checking he smiled and halted.

Soon Kuang Shi charged over from one direction, calling, “Young brother, you’re back?”

“Yeah.” Yang Kai nodded. “What a coincidence—good to see you again.”

Kuang Shi snorted, “I’ve been waiting here… Did the Great Yao Lord agree to your terms?”

“He agreed. In a few days the Great Yao Lord will bring his people to my Sacred Land.”

“Ha! He really agreed?” Kuang Shi laughed, delighted, prancing about and muttering, “Great—now I can go out and see the world instead of patrolling this forest all day. So boring.”

Yang Kai smiled at his excitement and clasped his fist in greeting. “If you come, you’re most welcome. I’ll treat you well.”

“Of course I’ll go. I’ve heard of many strange things in the human world—I want to see them.”

“There are many curiosities—but also many dangers. Be careful.”

“Danger? The more dangerous, the better,” Kuang Shi sneered. “Otherwise it’d be as boring as staying here.”

“Good attitude. It’s late; I must return. I’ll await the Great Yao Lord and others at the Sacred Land.”

“Go then—safe travels!” Kuang Shi waved. After Yang Kai left, Kuang Shi turned toward Thundertree Palace, eager to volunteer his services.

Two days later Yang Kai safely returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

He released his Divine Sense quietly and soon noticed differences from when he left.

Ten li from the Nine Peaks signs of heavy human activity appeared. The Sacred Land’s Nine Peaks’ barrier and restrictions had weakened, as if previously struck.

Yang Kai’s face cooled. Those forces had not honored the deadline and had recently launched attacks.

They were likely probing attacks, however, so the barriers remained largely intact.

Word of Yang Kai’s return spread; Xu Hui and others quickly gathered.

In the main hall the six Saint Realm elders were present along with An Ling’er, the last remaining Saintess. Everyone looked to Yang Kai expectantly.

“Things went relatively smoothly—the Great Yao Lord has agreed to help with your urgent crisis, though it will cost something.”

Xu Hui and the others were stunned; they had only agreed to Yang Kai’s plan out of deference to the new Saint Lord, not expecting results.

The one they were dealing with was the Great Yao Lord—not an easy ally.

In less than ten days Yang Kai had successfully handled the matter.

“What price does the Great Yao Lord demand?” Xu Hui asked warily.

“While you recuperate, the Sacred Land’s alchemists and artificers must remain to serve them. Also, they will mine the crystal stone vein within the Nine Peaks—all they extract is theirs.”

“Only those two conditions?”

“Only those two.”

The elders exchanged looks and relaxed.

Letting them mine the crystal vein was acceptable; if the Sacred Land evacuated temporarily, the vein would fall to enemies—better they profit than the foe.

Keeping the alchemists and artificers behind to be dispatched wasn’t ideal, but manageable if done discreetly.

These two simple terms were acceptable to everyone.

In fact, rather than pleading for aid, it was more like wielding the yao’s power to strike the invaders hard—a wolf-driven-to-devour-tiger situation.

That wolf, however, wouldn’t be easy to dislodge—if the yao settled in the Nine Peaks, driving them out would be difficult.

Xu Hui and the others didn’t want to overthink; this was the Saint Lord’s decision to follow.

When the Saint Lord grows strong, reclaiming the Nine Peaks would be trivial.

Seeing Yang Kai’s efforts on behalf of the Sacred Land, Xu Hui felt the new Saint Lord had become serious about the land’s affairs and might be willing to take up the mantle.

Hearts lightened and the current crisis seemed less dire.

“Great Elder, I saw signs the Nine Peaks’ barrier was attacked. While I was away, did they make a move?” Yang Kai looked at Xu Hui, whose mind was roaming elsewhere, and asked.

Xu Hui nodded. “A day ago they probed our defenses and retreated when they sensed the peaks’ formation active. Judging by their forces, a full assault could come within a day or two.”

“There’s time. Begin arranging disciples’ evacuation and prepare to notify me when ready.”

“Yes.” Xu Hui and the others bowed deeply.

Though indebted to the Great Yao Lord, Yang Kai felt leaving the Sacred Land’s people cohabiting with the yao was dangerous, so evacuation was necessary to avoid unforeseen troubles that might render his efforts meaningless.

Besides, the place he had chosen for them to retreat to was well suited for seclusion and cultivation.

The elder protectors busied themselves and An Ling’er stayed by Yang Kai’s side, explaining another use of the Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring.

The Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring symbolizes the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s leader; it can unlock areas ordinarily inaccessible, like storerooms and the Nine Peaks’ formation.

More than that, using the ring the Saint Lord can amplify the power of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique several times through the Nine Peaks’ formation.

Each peak holds subtle energies corresponding to the nine essences of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique; a master of sufficient realm could be nearly unbeatable within the peaks.

Yang Kai’s spirit stirred—studying the ring revealed hidden secrets.

He grew more confident for the coming battle.

He also raided the Sacred Land’s storeroom and swept its contents into the Black Book Space.

Since the people would evacuate temporarily, leaving the items risked them falling into outsiders’ hands; better he take them.

He felt no guilt about it.

With medicines, minerals, secret treasures, and crystal stones, Yang Kai’s wealth swelled beyond imagination.

Two days later at dawn, while resting in a side chamber, Yang Kai felt an energy shock from a spot in the Nine Peaks and opened his eyes toward that direction.

They’ve come!

The gathered experts could no longer contain themselves—they were preparing to strike the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Yang Kai rose and strode out; Xu Hui and the others lined up solemnly, awaiting him.

Every face showed gravity and some tension, but also unity.

Seeing Yang Kai, they bowed.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Let’s see who’s so eager to come here to die!”

A glint flashed in Xu Hui and the others’ eyes; they hurried to follow.

Since returning from the yao, Yang Kai’s manner had changed—though he hadn’t said it aloud, his actions and words carried the authority of the Sacred Land’s lord.

The gathered felt encouraged and began to hope for salvation.

Boom—

Thunderous booms rolled through the peaks; one barrier shimmered in ripples but remained as solid as ever, resisting the assault.

With the Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring on Yang Kai’s hand and the Nine Peaks’ formation linked to him, his bond to the barrier was intimate.

He felt every strike on the barrier far more acutely than Xu Hui and the others.

These attacks were from Transcendent Realm fighters; none of the Saint Realm had yet committed, Yang Kai observed keenly.

Soon a group of several stood at the Nine Peaks’ edge, hovering in the void and looking down. Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh: “Quite a number!”
