## Chapter 687 — Heavy Doubts

The violent energy within the Thunder Eye was even stronger than that of the Wind Eye; Cang Yan dared to send his Divine Sense to peer into the Wind Eye, but he would not lightly touch the Thunder Eye.

Compared to the two, the Thunder Eye was undoubtedly the more dangerous one.

“The Leiguang Patriarch is chasing us. Senior, let me enter quickly.” Yang Kai glanced back and saw Xia Chengyin rushing over in a fluster, his face full of anxiety, shouting even before he arrived.

Cang Yan showed not the slightest respect for him; hearing this he smiled, "You brat are truly strange. Fine, I'll grant your wish — just don't die on me, or I won't be able to answer to my Patriarch!"

Saying so, he tossed Yang Kai forward with a casual motion, and Yang Kai's figure rapidly fell into the Thunder Eye.

A chorus of exclamations erupted; the Leiguang disciples who had been cultivating were stunned as they watched Yang Kai vanish into the Thunder Eye, unaware of what he had done to offend Cang Yan to be thrown into such a place.

Xia Chengyin arrived moments later but could only watch helplessly.

Inside the Thunder Eye, Yang Kai felt an immense pressure as soon as he entered; this pressure was far stronger than what he had felt within the Wind Eye.

Lightning coursed through his body, making every hair stand on end; he trembled with cold and soon a smell of singed flesh wafted from his skin.

He swallowed another dose of Wan Yao Ling Milk and sat cross-legged within the Thunder Eye, ignoring his injuries as the Wind-and-Thunder Wings drew in the surrounding thunder energy.

Having experienced it once before, Yang Kai handled the situation with increasing ease and now understood what the Wind-and-Thunder Wings hungered for.

As expected, a tremendous suction formed at the right shoulder blade on his back, drawing the lightning of the surroundings into his body.

Whish...

The wings spread once more; the left half danced with wind's grace while the right flashed with electric light and wandering arcs of electricity.

Yang Kai soon slipped into a state of single-minded absorption, comprehending the mysteries of lightning.

Outside the Thunder Eye, the Leiguang disciples had been driven off; the clash between Cang Yan and Xia Chengyin had shaken heaven and earth. In the end Elder Du stepped forward and stopped their fight.

For two Transcendent Realm figures at the Third Stage, it was difficult to decide a victor, but Xia Chengyin clearly felt himself inferior to Cang Yan.

If they continued to fight like that, the one to fall would undoubtedly be himself.

Realizing this, the Leiguang Patriarch also withdrew at once, using the moment to back off.

As time passed, those remaining outside the Thunder Eye noticed the thunder energy in the heavens and earth had weakened considerably; the most direct evidence was that the lightning striking down from the Thunder Eye had become far sparser than before.

Xia Chengyin's face grew extremely grim.

Today two great elders were dead, the Wind Eye had vanished, and the power of the Thunder Eye had been diminished. Whether it might disappear like the Wind Eye was unknown.

Leiguang's losses were incalculable!

A day later, the Thunder Eye's power had fallen to less than half of its usual strength. Xia Chengyin's eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the Thunder Eye like a beast, his expression full of resentment.

Elder Du, though inwardly feeling that destroying another’s foundation was somewhat lacking in morality, recalled how Duan Hai had sought to harm the one he himself had recommended, and could not help but feel a surge of anger.

Inside the Thunder Eye, Yang Kai took a deep breath and suddenly opened his eyes; they glittered brightly.

After a day's absorption he sensed that his Wind-and-Thunder Wings had approached perfection.

From that moment the pair of wings were truly refined and became his aid.

The wings on his back were filled with Yang attribute energy; the left half possessed wind's agility, the right half the thunder's ferocity.

Wind, thunder, and yang — three attributes converged into a strange balance, undergoing subtle changes so they were no longer purely one attribute; within the wind-and-thunder force there was burning heat, as if it had evolved into Wind Flame and Thunder Flame, making the killing power far greater than wind and thunder alone.

The Wings of Yang Flame were completely replaced by the Wind-and-Thunder Wings.

Yang Kai found it difficult to define these wings; they were like a Secret Treasure and yet like his own Martial Skill.

But there was no denying Han Fei had indeed given him a great gift!

Perhaps Han Fei and Li Rong had failed to refine the Wind-and-Thunder Wings because they had never had such an opportunity.

Everything was both coincidence and inevitability.

Having taken the Wind-and-Thunder Wings, Yang Kai stepped out of the Thunder Eye whose power had greatly diminished.

Those who had been waiting long watched Yang Kai emerge and brightened at the sight; even Xia Chengyin involuntarily relaxed.

The Thunder Eye had not vanished; though its power was diminished, at least it remained.

The looks directed at Yang Kai were complex, a flicker of vexation and venomous resentment.

"You rascal, you kept us waiting!" Cang Yan laughed loudly as soon as Yang Kai reappeared. "Your aura has changed a good deal — did you gain something?"

"A little," Yang Kai nodded slightly. "My cultivation didn't increase, but I grasped a bit of the thunder's mystery. Sorry to have kept you waiting."

"Don't be so formal, young friend," Du Wan smiled and inclined his head.

"Since you are ready, then we shall leave," Cang Yan waved his hand.

Yang Kai cast a cool glance at Xia Chengyin, whose face was clouded and who said nothing, apparently not intending to stop them.

With Cang Yan present, he could not intervene; in the past two days Leiguang's losses had been severe, and if they really offended Cang Yan and started a war with Tianxiao Sect, Leiguang would not be able to withstand it.

The four great madmen of Tianxiao Sect were each formidable; if a fight broke out, Leiguang would surely be wiped out.

Xia Chengyin had no choice but to swallow his pride.

"Xia Patriarch, sorry to have troubled you," Elder Du bowed to Xia Chengyin.

"Go in peace; we won't send you off!" Xia Chengyin drew a deep breath, shut his eyes, and refused even to look.

Cang Yan snorted coldly, summoned True Yuan to wrap Yang Kai, Du Wan and Mi Na, and flew off into the sky.

After they left, Xia Chengyin's face twisted as he watched their backs; after a long while he suddenly launched his body technique and sped toward the Wind Eye.

He was still suspicious of Yang Kai's previous words; with Du Wan present earlier he couldn't press the matter, but now he wanted to investigate.

Although Xu Qi and Duan Hai had been dead a day, Xia Chengyin was still confident he could gather their dispersed souls back and peer into their memories to see the grievance between them and Yang Kai.

Arriving beside the two slain elders, Xia Chengyin silently circulated his proficiencies and sent out one mysterious energy wave after another.

Soon a thirty-li radius barrier appeared; he would seal this place to facilitate collecting Xu Qi's and Duan Hai's souls.

He believed that with their cultivation, even if their bodies were dead, their souls would not dissipate quickly.

To Xia Chengyin's annoyance and puzzlement, no matter how hard he tried he could not summon a trace of soul energy; those two elders' souls seemed utterly extinguished — a discovery that left him deeply unsettled.

………

The Leiguang Divine Cult. In midair a group of four sped rapidly.

Passing a ridge, Yang Kai happened to glance down and saw a tall, proud woman standing there.

She seemed to have noticed him too; her beautiful eyes were full of guilt and astonishment as she stared blankly.

Suddenly she leapt up and exerted herself to chase this way, her pretty face anxious.

But she could not match Cang Yan's speed; within a few breaths she was left far out of sight.

"Hey, you bastard — a young lass was chasing you back there," Mi Na suddenly poked Yang Kai and said with an ambiguous expression.

"When?" Yang Kai feigned ignorance.

"Don't lie," Mi Na sniffed. "She was calling your name. Did you do something to lead her on and then abandon her? Tsk tsk, I never expected it — you look human but are beast-hearted. I better stay away from you in future."

"Don't talk nonsense, okay? I'm very innocent; I would never do such a thing," Yang Kai replied solemnly.

Mi Na pouted, clearly not entirely convinced.

Having perhaps stayed long in the Alchemists' Association, her gossiping nature was more ardent than anyone's; she seized Yang Kai and peppered him with questions, chattering relentlessly.

Yang Kai ignored her and instead regarded Cang Yan with puzzlement.

Even now he could not understand why Cang Yan would help him for no reason, even to the point of offending the Leiguang Patriarch.

After musing for a moment, Yang Kai asked, "Senior, can you tell me why you helped me? What benefit did it bring you?"

As they flew, Cang Yan glanced back with his cold face showing a trace of a smile. "You are cautious."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded openly.

Elder Du chuckled, "Young friend, you needn't suspect Cang Yan. Although I was wrong to recommend you into Leiguang earlier, this time I can guarantee he means you no harm."

"I naturally trust what Elder Du says," Yang Kai nodded lightly. "But that doesn't clear the doubt in my heart — if you bear me no ill will, could you tell me the reason?"

"Telling you won't hurt; I'm merely carrying out my task."

"A task?" Yang Kai was surprised.

"Yes. I won't say more now; you'll understand when you come with me to a place later, since I don't completely know it either."

"Who gave you this task?"

"My Sect's Patriarch."

"The leader of Tianxiao Sect?" Yang Kai was astonished.

Cang Yan said nothing and bent his head to fly on; Yang Kai asked several times but could only give up and instead turned to Elder Du, "What kind of person is the leader of Tianxiao Sect?"

"A Saint Realm powerhouse," Du Wan replied. "Exactly how strong I don't know; you'll ask him when you meet."

Cang Yan suddenly stopped and said, "Elder Du, we'll part ways here. I must take him back to the sect as soon as possible."

"Very well." Du Wan inclined his head and looked at Yang Kai, "Young friend, I feel sorry for letting you suffer this time. The Alchemists' Association will always keep its doors open to you; when you have time, remember to return."

Elder Du's kindness warmed Yang Kai's heart and he nodded, "It was not Elder Du's fault. Don't trouble yourself. Yes, I'll return to the Alchemists' Association."

Elder Du smiled faintly and said to Cang Yan, "Give my regards to your Patriarch. I'm old and frail; I won't go see him."

"I will," Cang Yan answered in a deep voice. "Elder Du, we take our leave."

With that he carried Yang Kai in another direction and flew away.

"Yang Kai, remember to come back," Mi Na kept waving at him as they parted.
