## Chapter 688 — Fei Yu

The Tianxiao Sect is one of the four major powers centered around Giant Stone City.

They were said to be four great powers, but in truth the other three could not be placed on equal footing with the Tianxiao Sect; whether in depth of foundation or the tiers of their strong cultivators, the Tianxiao Sect was far ahead by several levels.

Ancient Moon Sanctuary, Rashomon Gate, and the Leiguang Divine Cult—none of them had a Saint Realm stronghold stationed within their ranks, yet rumor had it the Tianxiao Sect counted two or three Saint Realm strongers among its number.

Below the Saint Realm, four top experts at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm were likewise well known to all.

These four were ruthless in means; Cang Yan was one of them.

But to those ignorant of the facts, the Tianxiao Sect seemed on equal footing with the other three powers, because the sect’s number of disciples was not large—nowhere near as bloated as forces like Leiguang.

Yang Kai was escorted along by Cang Yan as they flew, and along the way Cang Yan continually queried him about the situation within the Tianxiao Sect.

Cang Yan appeared taciturn and sparing of words, but he answered Yang Kai’s questions with patience.

At the same time, he was observing Yang Kai the whole way.

Cang Yan was equally puzzled as to why the Patriarch had ordered him to fetch this youth.

Half a day later, just as they were about to approach the Tianxiao Sect, Cang Yan suddenly halted, his expression dubious as he peered ahead and gave a light exclamation, as if he had noticed something.

Soon Yang Kai also perceived a formidable aura rapidly approaching; its strength and life-sign fluctuations were not inferior to Cang Yan’s, yet unlike the oppressive force Cang Yan exuded, the newcomer’s aura was soft and gentle, flowing like a long, meandering river.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but look on curiously, but he asked no questions and waited quietly.

A moment later a blue light rushed over from the distance and stopped before Cang Yan; when the glow dissipated, a woman appeared, her dress and bearing exceptionally bold.

The woman’s skin was snow-white and her eyes moist and inviting, as if containing ten thousand charms; a small black mole the size of a grain of rice graced the corner of her mouth, adding to her allure.

A languid smile played across her face; her upper garments were revealing, exposing the rounded whiteness of half a breast and the enticing cleavage that stirred imagination. Below her waist she wore a skirt slit high, a long swan-like thigh nearly bared to the hip, and a hazy, wonderful suggestion of the space between her legs.

Yang Kai gaped, unable to help stealing a few more glances.

The woman showed no embarrassment; instead she smiled and appraised Yang Kai with interest, the beauty of her face displaying clear curiosity.

Cang Yan frowned. “Fei Yu, why are you out? Didn’t the Patriarch leave you under confinement for another half year? Don’t tell me you ran off.”

“I didn’t run off.” Fei Yu tossed her head and bared her silver teeth; she had not seemed to move but suddenly appeared before Yang Kai. She reached out a delicate jade hand and hooked his chin. “Little brother, where are you from? You look unfamiliar.”

Yang Kai suddenly felt a chill of gooseflesh all over his body.

Cang Yan hurriedly pulled Yang Kai behind him, standing between him and Fei Yu like a hen shielding her chicks, frowning as he said, “Don’t make trouble—this is the person the Patriarch asked to be fetched.”

“The person the Patriarch asked for?” Fei Yu’s eyes flashed with a strange light. “Why would the Patriarch want him?”

“I don’t know.” Cang Yan shook his head. “But he’s not your plaything.”

“Fine, fine.” Fei Yu said impatiently, pouting.

“Tell me, what’s your problem? Why didn’t you stay inside the sect obediently—what did you go out for?”

“The Patriarch ordered me out.” Fei Yu laughed coquettishly. “If it weren’t for his command, how dare I wander off?”

After a pause her eyes grew soft. “Yes, the Patriarch wants me to atone by deeds; if I can resolve this matter, my remaining half-year confinement will be lifted.”

“What does he want you to resolve?” Cang Yan asked with curiosity, then slapped his own forehead as if he should not have asked, raising a hand to retract, “Forget I asked. I’m going back to the sect first—do as you please.”

“Don’t go!” Fei Yu seized Cang Yan’s arm and cooed, “Since you asked, of course I’ll tell you.”

Saying that, and unconcerned whether Cang Yan liked it or not, she launched into an explanation.

Some hundreds of li outside the Tianxiao Sect, a disciple discovered a cave while cultivating; within were restraining formations and abundant Spiritual Qi—likely the blessed land left by some master long ago. That disciple couldn’t break the seals, so he went back to the sect and brought a group of senior and junior brothers. Ten or a dozen of them joined forces to open the place, hoping to find fortune, but they triggered a hidden trap and were slaughtered in an instant.

All who entered had been infected by an ancient parasitic creature known as the Soul-Devouring Worm. When news reached the Tianxiao Sect, the Patriarch ordered Fei Yu to handle it.

“Soul-Devouring Worm?” Cang Yan’s face changed. “Weren’t those ancient pests extinct?”

“Who knows.” Fei Yu shrugged her scented shoulders. “No idea which despicable scoundrel left this blessed land near our Tianxiao Sect. If I can find his bones, I’ll tear him apart!”

“The Patriarch ordered you—how do you intend to deal with them? Those creatures are no ordinary pests; you might end up dead yourself.”

“Exactly.” Fei Yu put on an aggrieved, pitiable look. “So, Cang Yan, you have to help me.”

“How can I help? I don’t know how to deal with those ancient parasites either.”

“You cultivate a fire-based art—burn them to death.”

“True Yuan fire? You think that can kill them? You’re dreaming.” Cang Yan snorted coldly, then glanced at Yang Kai with a thoughtful expression.

“But apart from you, no one can help me. That pair, Li Wan and Fei Jian, when they heard I took this duty, they’ve been avoiding me. They’re detestable.” Fei Yu ground her teeth and spat in contempt.

“I should be the one to avoid you.” Cang Yan’s headache intensified. If he had only kept his mouth shut he wouldn’t have asked; despite living with her for so many years, he still couldn’t help being deceived by her looks and falling into her traps.

“It’s too late now.” Fei Yu’s eyes turned cold. "You will help, whether you want to or not!"

Cang Yan sighed helplessly. “This time I really can’t. I need to hurry back to bring this kid to see the Patriarch.”

“You’ve already delayed two months anyway; what’s a little more time? Come look with me—if it’s truly impossible, I won’t force you.” Fei Yu tried to persuade him.

Cang Yan frowned as if weighing the matter. Seeing a chance, Fei Yu pressed on, urging him without pause.

After a long moment Cang Yan nodded slightly. “Fine, I’ll help you this once, but… I can’t guarantee success.”

Fei Yu rejoiced and lauded him repeatedly. “I knew you were the best—next time those two bastards Li Wan and Fei Jian can die for all I care.”

“But I have a request.”

“What request?”

Cang Yan cleared his throat. “I remember fifty years ago you brewed a batch of Thousand Red Flower Wine?”

Fei Yu’s pretty face changed; she snapped, “You remember something from fifty years ago?”

“I always covet good things.” Cang Yan inclined his head and said matter-of-factly, “If this succeeds, give me half.”

“No,” Fei Yu hissed through her teeth. “I spent my youth traveling across the land to collect a thousand kinds of spirit flowers to brew that Thousand Red Flower Wine. I’ve waited fifty years and haven’t even had a sip myself; you ask for half at once—worse than Li Wan and Fei Jian! If that’s the case, I’d rather not have your help!”

Yang Kai stared at the woman in astonishment; he had the vague impression that the Thousand Red Flower Wine was a thing she prized higher than her own life.

“You brewed twenty jars; even if you give me half, you still have ten jars.”

“At most I’ll give you one jar—more than that, don’t even think about it.”

“Eight jars!”

“One jar!”

“Five jars!”

……

After arduous haggling, Cang Yan could only pinch his nose and concede: “One jar then.”

“That depends on whether you have the ability.” Fei Yu sneered. “If you can’t help, I won’t give you a single drop.”

She shot Yang Kai a glare. “Brat, what are you laughing at? Is it that funny?”

“Not really, just interesting.” Yang Kai shrugged, watching two Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm experts bicker; the warmth of their camaraderie was oddly heartening.

Yang Kai felt he hadn’t experienced such a feeling in a long time—since coming to the Tongxuan Continent he had been utterly alone.

“Let’s go—where is that blessed land?” With terms settled, Cang Yan didn’t want to waste more time.

“Follow me.” Fei Yu said as she led the way.

As the woman moved, her round hips and willow-like waist swayed enticingly, her glossy black hair streamed in the wind, revealing a fair, graceful neck as exquisite as porcelain.

“Don’t look at her—she might gouge your eyes out.” Cang Yan whispered into Yang Kai’s ear as a warning.

“That extreme?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“Last time Rashomon Gate had an elder who glanced at her a few times too many and she…” Cang Yan mimed a downward chopping motion and brushed past Yang Kai’s crotch.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“This is why the Patriarch had her confined.” Cang Yan resumed his serious tone. “Don’t be deceived by her lascivious dress—she’s actually still a virgin….”

Before he could finish, a pink fist flew toward him, catching Cang Yan off guard and sending him tumbling and flying over a hundred zhang.

Fei Yu hovered in midair, her pretty face frosted with cold fury as she glared at the fallen Cang Yan and snapped, “Do you think I'm deaf?”

Yang Kai swallowed hard, secretly concerned for Cang Yan.

“Little brother, come, sister will take you.” Suddenly Fei Yu smiled again and waved to Yang Kai; without waiting for his response she wrapped him in her True Yuan and flew forward alongside him.

The scent of the woman’s body flooded Yang Kai’s nostrils; he felt slightly embarrassed but kept a straight face and avoided looking anywhere else.

“Don’t listen to that bastard; he only knows slander.” Fei Yu murmured, her breath like orchids, teasing, “It’s all right to look more if you want—sister won’t harm you. I can be gentle.”
