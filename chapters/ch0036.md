## Chapter 36 — Beauty Beneath the Moonlight

Although Yang Kai had not yet cultivated to the point of manifesting Divine Sense, he could still clearly feel the presence of a single drop of Yang Liquid within his dantian. When his mind focused, the Yang Liquid obeyed his command without hesitation.

Yang Liquid could be used in combat, but Yang Kai had yet to try it. How it would transform in battle was something he would have to experience firsthand. Such knowledge was not something the Wordless Black Book could impart.

Despite enduring many days of hardship, now that he had condensed a drop of Yang Liquid, Yang Kai felt a deep sense of satisfaction. With a hint of excitement, he pressed on, spending most of the night cultivating once more beside the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

When he awoke in the latter half of the night, Yang Kai ceased his efforts.

Having been so relentlessly devoted to cultivation these past days, though much stronger, his body had also borne a heavy burden. The path of cultivation required balance—tension and relaxation in harmony—lest hidden dangers be sown.

Rising and patting his backside, Yang Kai’s steps were light as he returned to his small wooden hut.

The door to the hut was ajar, which puzzled Yang Kai, for he distinctly remembered closing it before leaving.

Approaching and gently pushing the door open, Yang Kai glanced inside—and the scene that greeted him caused him to freeze in place. It was as if a painting had come to life, dreamlike and surreal, utterly unreal.

In his humble hut, on the only small bed, lay a person—a woman.

Moonlight poured through several holes in the roof, casting its glow upon the woman resting on the wooden bed. By the moon’s light, Yang Kai saw her hands folded gently over her flat abdomen. Her high, proud chest rose and fell with steady breaths. Under the moon’s illumination, the skin on her neck was as translucent and pure as ice and snow. Her jet-black hair flowed smoothly, draping over her seemingly delicate shoulders. Her exquisite earlobes exuded a subtle allure.

Because she lay down, her long, graceful legs, slender waist, and full hips were displayed in perfect form before Yang Kai’s eyes. Her face was obscured by a veil as thin as cicada wings, but on her smooth forehead rested a single pale blue gem. Though not a precious ornament, it perfectly accentuated her serene coldness and purity.

The hazy moonlight added an ethereal beauty to her presence.

She seemed like a fairy exiled from the Moon Palace, flawless and imbued with sacred nobility. She lay there quietly, as if she would never awaken. For some inexplicable reason, Yang Kai felt a pang of sorrow in his heart.

Yang Kai did not consider himself a sentimental man, yet this poetic and picturesque scene deeply moved him. Even if decades passed, he feared he would never forget this moment.

Driven by an unknown impulse, Yang Kai tiptoed forward, suppressing his breath and heartbeat, fearful of disturbing her.

Standing about three meters away from the bed, he carefully examined her and confirmed what he had suspected—this woman was the senior sister he had nearly collided with at the Contribution Hall that day. When he first saw the veil, he had a faint suspicion.

Back then, she had not possessed such an untouchable, lofty sanctity. Instead, she had been timid, shy, and pure. Glancing up at the holes in the roof, Yang Kai chuckled softly. Those unrepaired holes had done a good deed today.

His soft laugh startled the woman lying on the bed, Xia Ningshang. When Yang Kai lowered his head again, he was startled to find the senior sister staring wide-eyed at him.

Her bright eyes first showed confusion and anger, then quickly flushed with embarrassment. In the blink of an eye, her delicate earlobes turned red.

Fortunately, it was night. Though the moonlight was present, Yang Kai’s view was not so clear, sparing Xia Ningshang some of the awkwardness.

They gazed at each other—one on the bed, the other below.

Yang Kai was full of questions, while Xia Ningshang wished she could slap herself unconscious, her heart in turmoil. She never imagined she would be so careless as to fall asleep here.

“Ahem…” Yang Kai cleared his throat gently, striving to sound kind as he asked, “May I ask how senior sister is called?”

Whether from emotional fluctuation or something else, his voice sounded somewhat ethereal. In this late hour, with a lone man and woman alone in a room, it carried an awkward undertone.

It sounded more like: “May I ask, young lady, your name?”

Quite the lecherous tone.

Xia Ningshang’s face burned crimson, yet she still maintained her composure and sat up on the bed. She brushed her hair back and softly said, “My surname is Xia…”

She was too embarrassed to give her full name, feeling utterly humiliated by the day’s events.

“So it is Senior Sister Xia. Is there something you need from me?”

If not for some matter, how could such a celestial being deign to visit his shabby hut?

Hearing this, Xia Ningshang remembered her purpose. Hastily, she took out a package from beside her, calming her emotions as she spoke, “This afternoon, a hunter from beneath Black Wind Mountain came looking for you. But you hadn’t returned even by the time the lights were lit. Seeing his urgency, I inquired. The hunter expressed his gratitude for your life-saving aid and asked me to deliver this package to you, saying he would come personally to thank you when he has the chance.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai immediately knew who it was.

Hunter Zhang Shan! The last time he had ventured into Black Wind Mountain to gather herbs, Yang Kai had saved him and his son.

Yang Kai reached out to take the package and nodded, “I see.”

Xia Ningshang lifted her eyes to glance at him a few times, then said, “I was entrusted with this task, so I waited here for your return. But, unexpectedly, I ended up…”

She trailed off, embarrassed to admit she had fallen asleep on someone else’s bed. The failure to fulfill her trust weighed heavily on her.

Yang Kai now fully understood the situation and laughed heartily, “Thank you for your trouble, senior sister. I will be sure to return earlier next time.”

Whether it was his imagination or intentional, the words sounded oddly like a husband’s promise to his wife before leaving.

Biting her lip, Xia Ningshang expressed some dissatisfaction, “Whether you return early or not is none of my concern. The package has been delivered. I shall take my leave.”

With that, she twisted her waist, stomped her foot, and vanished, leaving behind a faint fragrance that lingered in the room and tickled someone’s nose.

This Senior Sister Xia was truly quite shy.

Recalling the earlier scene, Yang Kai felt a warm sensation. Regaining his composure, he opened the package left by Zhang Shan and found two sets of cyan long robes inside.

The robes were meticulously sewn stitch by stitch, the needlework dense and exquisite. Yang Kai guessed they must have been made by Zhang Shan’s wife.

Zhang Shan was thoughtful! The last time he fought the flower-backed spider beast, Yang Kai’s clothes were torn to shreds. That was why Zhang Shan had brought him two sets of clothes today.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, put the clothes away, and then lay down on the bed.

That night, Yang Kai slept soundly.
